    "abstract": "Obesity is currently the most extended metabolic disturbance worldwide favoring the development of cardiometabolic alterations such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Obesity and the metabolic syndrome (MS) are characterized by an increase in circulating leptin concentrations, in parallel to a decrease in blood levels of adiponectin. Consequently, the adiponectin/leptin ratio has been suggested as a maker of adipose tissue dysfunction. This emerging biomarker correlates with insulin resistance better than adiponectin or leptin alone, or even HOMA and is decreased with increasing number of metabolic risk factors having been proposed as a predictive marker for the MS. Moreover, the adiponectin/leptin ratio is negatively correlated with markers of low-grade chronic inflammation. In this sense, an increase in this ratio has been related with reduced atherosclerosis risk as well as with a decreased risk of some types of cancer in epidemiological studies. In this commentary we propose new cutoffs to estimate obesity- and MS-associated cardiometabolic risk according to the adiponectin/leptin ratio and discuss different therapeutic strategies to increase this promising biomarker of metabolic risk.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian adipose tissue can be divided into two major types, namely, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). According to classical view, the main function of WAT is to store excess energy in the form of triglycerides, while BAT is a thermogenic tissue that acts a pivotal part in maintaining the core body temperature. White adipocytes display high plasticity and can transdifferentiate into beige adipocytes which have many similar morphological and functional properties with brown adipocytes under the stimulations of exercise, cold exposure and other factors. This phenomenon is also known as 'browning of WAT'. In addition to transdifferentiation, beige adipocytes can also come from de novo differentiation from tissue-resident progenitors. Activating BAT and inducing browning of WAT can accelerate the intake of glycolipids and reduce the insulin secretion requirement, which may be a new strategy to improve glycolipids metabolism and insulin resistance of obese and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. This review mainly discusses the significance of brown and beige adipose tissues in the treatment of obesity and T2DM, and focuses on the effect of the browning agent on obesity and T2DM, which provides a brand-new theoretical reference for the prevention and treatment of obesity and T2DM.",

    "abstract": "In the past decades, obesity and associated metabolic complications have reached epidemic proportions. For the study of these pathologies, a number of animal models have been developed. However, a direct comparison between Wistar and Sprague-Dawley (SD) Rat as models of high-fat (HF) diet-induced obesity has not been adequately evaluated so far. Wistar and SD rats were assigned for 2 experimental groups for 17 weeks: standard (St) and high-fat (HF) diet groups. To assess some of the features of the metabolic syndrome, oral glucose tolerance tests, systolic blood pressure measurements and blood biochemical analysis were performed throughout the study. The gut microbiota composition of the animals of each group was evaluated at the end of the study by real-time PCR. HF diet increased weight gain, body fat mass, mesenteric adipocyte's size, adiponectin and leptin plasma levels and decreased oral glucose tolerance in both Wistar and SD rats. However, the majority of these effects were more pronounced or earlier detected in Wistar rats. The gut microbiota of SD rats was less abundant in Bacteroides and Prevotella but richer in Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus comparatively to the gut microbiota of Wistar rats. Nevertheless, the modulation of the gut microbiota by HF diet was similar in both strains, except for Clostridium leptum that was only reduced in Wistar rats fed with HF diet. In conclusion, both Wistar and SD Rat can be used as models of HF diet-induced obesity although the metabolic effects caused by HF diet seemed to be more pronounced in Wistar Rat. Differences in the gut microbial ecology may account for the worsened metabolic scenario observed in Wistar Rat.",

    "abstract": "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), e.g. acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid, generated through colonic fermentation of dietary fibers, have been shown to reach the systemic circulation at micromolar concentrations. Moreover, SCFAs have been conferred anti-obesity properties in both animal models and human subjects. Branched SCFAs (BSCFAs), e.g., isobutyric and isovaleric acid, are generated by fermentation of branched amino acids, generated from undigested protein reaching colon. However, BSCFAs have been sparsely investigated when referring to effects on energy metabolism. Here we primarily investigate the effects of isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid on glucose and lipid metabolism in primary rat and human adipocytes. BSCFAs inhibited both cAMP-mediated lipolysis and insulin-stimulated de novo lipogenesis at 10 mM, whereas isobutyric acid potentiated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by all concentrations (1, 3 and 10 mM) in rat adipocytes. For human adipocytes, only SCFAs inhibited lipolysis at 10 mM. In both in vitro models, BSCFAs and SCFAs reduced phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase, a rate limiting enzyme in lipolysis. In addition, BSCFAs and SCFAs, in contrast to insulin, inhibited lipolysis in the presence of wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase inhibitor and OPC3911, a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor in rat adipocytes. Furthermore, BSCFAs and SCFAs reduced insulin-mediated phosphorylation of protein kinase B. To conclude, BSCFAs have effects on adipocyte lipid and glucose metabolism that can contribute to improved insulin sensitivity in individuals with disturbed metabolism.",

While the aP2-Cre(BI) and aP2-Cre(Salk) lines have been widely used to target adipose tissue, the specificity of these lines for adipocytes has recently been questioned. Here we characterize Cre recombinase activity in multiple cell populations of the major adipose tissue depots of these and other Cre lines using the membrane-Tomato/membrane-GFP (mT/mG) dual fluorescent reporter. We find that the aP2-Cre(BI) and aP2-Cre(Salk) lines lack specificity for adipocytes within adipose tissue, and that the aP2-Cre(BI) line does not efficiently target adipocytes in white adipose depots. Alternatively, the Adiponectin-CreERT line shows high efficiency and specificity for adipocytes, while the PdgfRα-CreERUCL and PdgfRα-CreERJHU lines do not efficiently target adipocyte precursor cells in the major adipose depots. Instead, we show that the PdgfRα-Cre line is preferable for studies targeting adipocyte precursor cells in vivo.",

Oil red O staining can be used to assess the degree of differentiation. However, the validity of this method for quantitative analysis has not yet been established. Here we show that a protocol with arbitrarily chosen parameters does not measure in the linear range and is not suitable for quantitative analysis (R2 = 0.077, p = 0.382), and develop and validate an optimized protocol for quantitative oil red O staining of cultured adipocytes. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes are fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.2% oil red O solution in 40% 2-propanol for 30 minutes. Dye is eluted with 2-propanol, and absorption of the eluate is measured photometrically at 510 nm. This optimized protocol achieves excellent correlation between defined amounts of differentiated adipocytes on constant-size culture plates and photometric absorption (R2 = 0.972, p = 6.585E-14). The performance of the method is independent of the culture plates used. Thus, the optimized oil red O staining protocol can be universally employed to quantitatively assess adipocyte differentiation.",

In 2011 FNDC5 burst into prominence as the parent of irisin, a small protein containing the fibronectin type III domain. Irisin was proposed to be secreted by skeletal muscle cells in response to exercise, and to circulate to fat tissue where it induced a transition to brown fat. Since brown fat results in dissipation of energy, this pathway is of considerable interest for metabolism and obesity. Here I review the original discoveries of FNDC5 and the more recent discovery of irisin. I note in particular three problems in the characterization of irisin: the antibodies used to detect irisin in plasma lack validity; the recombinant protein used to demonstrate activity in cell culture was severely truncated; and the degree of shedding of soluble irisin from the cell surface has not been quantitated. The original discovery proposing that FNDC5 may be a transmembrane receptor may deserve a new look.",

In this review, we outline and discuss the current understanding of brite adipocyte nomenclature, developmental origin and possible mechanisms of their recruitment.

    "abstract": "Human studies of the influence of aging and other factors on intermuscular fat (INTMF) were reviewed. Intermuscular fat increased with weight loss, weight gain, or with no weight change with age in humans. An increase in INTMF represents a similar threat to type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance as does visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Studies of INTMF in animals covered topics such as quantitative deposition and genetic relationships with other fat depots. The relationship between leanness and higher proportions of INTMF fat in pigs was not observed in human studies and was not corroborated by other pig studies. In humans, changes in muscle mass, strength and quality are associated with INTMF accretion with aging. Gene expression profiling and intrinsic methylation differences in pigs demonstrated that INTMF and VAT are primarily associated with inflammatory and immune processes. It seems that in the pig and humans, INTMF and VAT share a similar pattern of distribution and a similar association of components dictating insulin sensitivity. Studies on intramuscular (IM) adipocyte development in meat animals were reviewed. Gene expression analysis and genetic analysis have identified candidate genes involved in IM adipocyte development. Intramuscular (IM) adipocyte development in human muscle is only seen during aging and some pathological circumstance. Several genetic links between human and meat animal adipogenesis have been identified. In pigs, the Lipin1 and Lipin 2 gene have strong genetic effects on IM accumulation. Lipin1 deficiency results in immature adipocyte development in human lipodystrophy. In humans, overexpression of Perilipin 2 (PLIN2) facilitates intramyocellular lipid accretion whereas in pigs PLIN2 gene expression is associated with IM deposition. Lipins and perilipins may influence intramuscular lipid regardless of species.",

However, we now know that marrow adipose tissue increases with age and in response to a variety of physiologic induction signals. Bone marrow adipocytes have recently been shown to influence other cell populations within the marrow and can affect whole body metabolism by the secretion of a defined set of adipokines. Recent research shows that marrow adipocytes are distinct from white, brown and beige adipocytes, indicating that the bone marrow is a distinct adipose depot. This review will highlight recent data regarding these areas and the interactions of marrow adipose tissue (MAT) with cells within and outside of the bone marrow.",

Obesity is characterized by an increase in adipose mass due to increased energy intake, decreased energy expenditure, or both. While white adipose tissue is specialized for energy storage, brown adipose tissue has a high concentration of mitochondria and uniquely expresses uncoupling protein 1, enabling it to be specialized for energy expenditure and thermogenesis. Although brown fat was once considered only necessary in babies, recent morphological and imaging studies have provided evidence that, contrary to prior belief, this tissue is present and active in adult humans. In recent years, the topic of brown adipose tissue has been reinvigorated with many new studies regarding brown adipose tissue differentiation, function and therapeutic promise. This review summarizes the recent advances, discusses the emerging questions and offers perspective on the potential therapeutic applications targeting this tissue.",

We hypothesized that the nature of AT expansion (hypertrophy vs. hyperplasia) contributes to obesity-related reductions in serum adiponectin and that this effect is influenced by the regional distribution of AT to subcutaneous (S) and visceral (V) depots. Thirteen obese subjects provided paired AT biopsies. Serum total and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin levels were determined by ELISA. Secretion was quantified following 24-h explant culture. FC size, number, % large, and % small FC were determined by microscopic analysis. Secretion of total adiponectin was highest by SAT (P = 0.008) and correlated more strongly with serum adiponectin (total: P = 0.015, r = 0.77; HMW: P = 0.005, r = 0.83) than did secretion by VAT (P = 0.05, r = 0.66 for both).

Cana treatment also reduces body weight. However, it remains unclear whether Cana could directly work on adipose tissue. In the present study, the pharmacological effects of Cana and the associated mechanism were investigated in adipocytes and mice. Stromal-vascular fractions (SVFs) were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue and differentiated into mature adipocytes. Our results show that Cana treatment directly increased cellular energy expenditure of adipocytes by inducing mitochondrial biogenesis independently of SGLT2 inhibition. Along with mitochondrial biogenesis, Cana also increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis. Mechanistically, Cana promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and function via an Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) – silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) – peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (Pgc-1α) signalling pathway. Consistently, in vivo study demonstrated that Cana increased AMPK phosphorylation and the expression of Sirt1 and Pgc-1α.

    "abstract": "Cytokines and other peptides are secreted from skeletal muscles in response to exercise and function as hormones either locally within the muscle or by targeting distant organs. Such proteins are recognized as myokines, with the prototype myokine being IL-6. Several studies have established a role of these muscle-derived factors as important contributors of the beneficial effects of exercise, and the myokines are central to our understanding of the cross talk during and after exercise between skeletal muscles and other organs. In a study into the mechanisms of a newly defined myokine, CXCL-1, we found that CXCL-1 overexpression increases muscular fatty acid oxidation with concomitant attenuation of diet-induced fat accumulation in the adipose tissue. Clearly this study adds to the concept of myokines playing an important role in mediating the whole-body adaptive effects of exercise through the regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism. Yet, myokines also contribute to whole-body metabolism by directly signaling to distant organs, regulating metabolic processes in liver and adipose tissue. Thus accumulating data shows that myokines play an important role in restoring a healthy cellular environment, reducing low-grade inflammation and thereby preventing metabolic related diseases like insulin resistance and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Obesity-associated low-grade inflammation underlies insulin resistance and associated metabolic comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Excessive ectopic fat deposition in obesity causes disorders of energy homeostasis and low-grade chronic inflammation in metabolic tissues. In particular, obesity-induced recruitment and activation of adipose tissue macrophages play a key role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and T2D. Therefore, treatment options for energy metabolism and macrophage polarization in obese subjects are needed. Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, thereby having subsequent anti-hyperglycemic effects and reducing body weight. We recently reported that the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin increases fat utilization and browning in white adipose tissue and attenuates obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance by activating M2 macrophages. Thus, this review focuses on the beneficial effects of empagliflozin in energy homeostasis and obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Exercise training results in adaptations to numerous organ systems and offers protection against metabolic disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes, and recent reports suggest that adipose tissue may play a role in these beneficial effects of exercise on overall health. Multiple studies have investigated the effects of exercise training on both white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), as well as the induction of beige adipocytes. Studies from both rodents and humans show that there are exercise training-induced changes in WAT including decreased cell size and lipid content, and increased mitochondrial activity. In rodents, exercise training causes an increased beiging of WAT. Whether exercise training causes a beiging of human scWAT, as well as which factors contribute to the exercise-induced beiging of WAT are areas of current investigation. Studies investigating the effects of exercise training on BAT mass and function have yielded conflicting data, and hence, is another area of intensive investigation.

Adipose tissue has become crucial due to its involvement in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced insulin resistance, and traditionally white adipose tissue has captured the most attention. However in the last decade the presence and activity of heat-generating brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans has been rediscovered. BAT decreases with age and in obese and diabetic patients. It has thus attracted strong scientific interest, and any strategy to increase its mass or activity might lead to new therapeutic approaches to obesity and associated metabolic diseases.

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue remodeling occurs in obesity, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and increased infiltration of macrophages which also shift to a proinflammatory phenotype. Factors derived from these macrophages significantly alter adipocyte function, such as repressing adipogenesis, inducing inflammatory response and desensitizing insulin action. As macrophages produce a cocktail of inflammatory signals, identifying the key factors that mediate the detrimental effects may offer effective therapeutic targets. IL-1β, a major cytokine produced largely by macrophages, is implicated in the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance. In this article, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the role of IL-1β in macrophage-adipocyte crosstalk in obesity. IL-1β impairs insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue by inhibition of insulin signal transduction. Blocking the activity of IL-1β, its receptor binding or production improves insulin signaling and action in human adipocytes. This is in parallel with a reduction in macrophage-stimulated proinflammatory profile and lipolysis. Targeting IL-1β may be beneficial for protecting against obesity-related insulin resistance at the tissue and systemic levels.",

In the present study, we therefore investigate if propionic acid and butyric acid have effects on lipolysis, de novo lipogenesis and glucose uptake in primary rat adipocytes. We show that both propionic acid and butyric acid inhibit isoproterenol- and adenosine deaminase-stimulated lipolysis as well as isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in the presence of a phosphodiesterase (PDE3) inhibitor. In addition, we show that propionic acid and butyric acid inhibit basal and insulin-stimulated de novo lipogenesis, which is associated with increased phosphorylation and thus inhibition of acetyl CoA carboxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, we show that propionic acid and butyric acid increase insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. To conclude, our study shows that SCFAs have effects on fat storage and mobilization as well as glucose uptake in rat primary adipocytes. Thus, the SCFAs might contribute to healthier adipocytes and subsequently also to improved energy metabolism with for example less circulating free fatty acids, which is beneficial in the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion and sized by microscopic measurement of cell diameter.Overall, adipocytes from subcutaneous fat were larger than those from omentum or mesentery. For the subcutaneous and omental fat depots, there was a significant increase in % small cells (14.9% vs 31.4%, p = 0 .006 and 14.0% vs 30.5%, p = 0 .015, respectively) and corresponding decrease in % large cells for nondiabetic vs diabetic patients. There was a similar trend for mesentery but it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0 .090). For omentum and mesentery, there was also a significant decrease in the diameter of the small cells. Fasting glucose was positively correlated with fraction of small cells in omentum and mesentery, and HbA1C was positively correlated with fraction of small cells in the omental fat depot. There was no correlation between large cell diameter with clinical parameters in any of the fat depots.These results indicate size distribution of adipocytes, specifically an increase in the fraction of small cells, is associated with the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has emerged as a key pathogenic mechanism for these disorders; activated RAS and angiotensin (Ang) II production results in worsening of cardiovascular diseases and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) negatively regulates RAS by metabolizing Ang II into Ang 1-7. ACE2 is expressed in the adipocytes and its expression is upregulated in response to high fat diet induced obesity in mice. Loss of ACE2 results in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction which is mediated in part by epicardial adipose tissue inflammation. Angiotensin 1-7 reduces the obesity associated cardiac dysfunction predominantly via its role in adiponectin expression and attenuation of epicardial adipose tissue inflammation. Human heart disease is also linked with inflammed epicardial adipose tissue. Here, we discuss the important interpretation of the novel of ACE2/Ang 1-7 pathway in obesity associated cardiac dysfunction.",

Hence, we further focused on the potential of adipose-derived MSC (ADSC)-EVs in NAFLD by delivering miR-223-3p. The uptake of isolated ADSC-EVs by hepatocytes was assessed, and the expression of miR-223-3p in ADSC-EVs and hepatocytes was characterized. It was established that miR-223-3p, enriched in ADSC-EVs, could be delivered by ADSC-EVs into hepatocytes. Using co-culture system and gain-of-function approach, we evaluated the effect of ADSC-EVs carrying miR-223-3p on lipid accumulation and liver fibrosis in pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA)-induced hepatocytes and a high-fat diet-induced NAFLD mouse model. Bioinformatics websites and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay were performed to determine the interactions between miR-223-3p and E2F1, which was further validated by rescue experiments. ADSC-EVs containing miR-223-3p displayed suppressive effects on lipid accumulation and liver fibrosis through E2F1 inhibition, since E2F1 was demonstrated as a target gene of miR-223-3p. The protective role of ADSC-EVs by delivering miR-223-3p was then confirmed in the mouse model. Collectively, this study elucidated that ADSC-EVs delayed the progression NAFLD through the delivery of anti-fibrotic miR-223-3p and subsequent E2F1 suppression, which may suggest miR-223-3p-loaded ADSC-EVs to be a potential therapeutic approach for NAFLD.",

Moreover, TNFα and LPS exacerbated the decrease in adiponectin secretion by hypertrophic adipocytes while promoting the secretion of leptin, MCP-1 and IL-6, which is associated with impaired activation of p38 and JNK MAPK and persistent activation of ERK and IκBα in hypertrophic adipocytes.

Recent data using the four core genotypes mouse model have revealed that sex chromosome complement-independently from gonadal sex-plays a role in adiposity, feeding behavior, fatty liver and glucose homeostasis. Potential mechanisms for the effects of sex chromosome complement include differential gene dosage from X chromosome genes that escape inactivation, and distinct genomic imprints on X chromosomes inherited from maternal or paternal parents.

These include various transporters, enzymes required for lipid and glucose metabolism, regulators of protein trafficking and signaling molecules.

Our objective was to assess whether adipogenic rates of cultured human primary preadipocytes from the visceral and subcutaneous compartments relate to visceral obesity and cardiometabolic alterations. We recruited 35 women undergoing gynecological surgery and assessed body fat distribution by CT as well as fasting plasma lipids and glycemia. Fat samples from the greater omentum and abdominal subcutaneous (SC) compartments were used to assess mature adipocyte cell size and establish primary preadipocyte cultures. Differentiation was induced using adipogenic media and adipogenic rates were assessed using Oil Red O (ORO) absorbance/DNA content ratio and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) activity/DNA of differentiated cells. We found a lower adipogenic capacity of omental (OM) preadipocytes than SC preadipocytes originating from the same women (P < 0.05). Whereas only OM cell size was different among groups of low vs high OM adipogenic rate, SC adipogenic rates were clearly related to increased OM cell size and dyslipidemia when women were separated on median value of either ORO/DNA or G3PDH activity/DNA ratios. When matched for BMI, women with low SC preadipocyte adipogenic rates had a higher visceral adipose tissue area (P < 0.01), omental adipocyte hypertrophy (P < 0.05), higher VLDL-lipid content (P < 0.01) and higher fasting glycemia (P < 0.05) than those with low SC adipogenic rates.

    "abstract": "Obesity is a low-grade sustained inflammatory state that causes oxidative stress in different metabolic tissues, which leads to insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Particularly, obesity-induced metabolic endotoxemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and inflammation. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of antioxidant signaling that serves as a primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress. Pharmacological stimulation of Nrf2 mitigates obesity and insulin resistance in mice; however, Nrf2 activators are not clinically available due to biosafety concerns. A recent study demonstrated that glucoraphanin, a precursor of the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane, ameliorates obesity by enhancing energy expenditure and browning of white adipose tissue, and attenuates obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance by polarizing M2 macrophages and reducing metabolic endotoxemia. Thus, this review focuses on the efficiency and safety of glucoraphanin in alleviating obesity, insulin resistance, and NAFLD.

    "abstract": "Fat grafting popularity continues to rise among plastic surgeons. As a soft tissue filler, adipose tissue had many desirable attributes: it is easy to obtain, autologous, and may reintegrate into recipient sites. However, fat grafting is clinically plagued by unpredictable resorption rates, thus there is much interest in optimizing the procedure of fat grafting for consistent graft volumes. Fat harvesting, a part of fat transfer surgery, involves the removal of adipose tissue from the donor site. Different harvest procedures, such as whole fat excision or liposuction cannulas, result in a range of fat particle volumes, which may play a role in the cellular stability of grafts. The ideal harvesting technique and fat particle diameter is not currently known. This study aims to review the literature on the impact of fat particle size and clinical fat grafting outcomes, to present overarching conclusions, and to provide future directions for study. Current evidence supports excisional methods and larger bore cannulas to minimize cellular damage, preserve the native architecture, and maximize the number of cells within fat particles.",

The last two decades have seen a reconsideration of the role of white adipose tissue (WAT) in whole body metabolism and insulin action. Adipose tissue-derived cytokines and hormones, or adipokines, are likely mediators of metabolic function and dysfunction. While several adipokines have been associated with obese and insulin-resistant phenotypes, a select group has been linked with insulin sensitivity, namely leptin, adiponectin, and more recently, adipolin. What is known about these insulin-sensitizing molecules and their effects in healthy and insulin resistant states is the subject of this review. There remains a significant amount of research to do to fully elucidate the mechanisms of action of these adipokines for development of therapeutics in metabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondria are distinct from their counterparts in other tissues in that ATP production is not their primary physiologic role. BAT mitochondria are equipped with a specialized protein known as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). UCP1 short-circuits the electron transport chain, allowing mitochondrial membrane potential to be transduced to heat, making BAT a tissue capable of altering energy expenditure and fuel metabolism in mammals without increasing physical activity. The recent discovery that adult humans have metabolically active BAT has rekindled an interest in this intriguing tissue, with the overarching aim of manipulating BAT function to augment energy expenditure as a countermeasure for obesity and the metabolic abnormalities it incurs. Subsequently, there has been heightened interest in quantifying BAT function and more specifically, determining UCP1-mediated thermogenesis in BAT specimens - including in those obtained from humans. In this article, BAT mitochondrial bioenergetics will be described and compared with more conventional mitochondria in other tissues. The biochemical methods typically used to quantify BAT mitochondrial function will also be discussed in terms of their specificity for assaying UCP1 mediated thermogenesis. Finally, recent data concerning BAT UCP1 function in humans will be described and discussed.",

Indeed, circulating adiponectin decreases in obesity and insulin-resistance, likely because of impaired production from white adipose tissue (WAT). Conversely, lean states such as caloric restriction (CR) are characterized by hyperadiponectinemia, even without increased adiponectin production from WAT. The reasons underlying this paradox have remained elusive, but our recent research suggests that CR-associated hyperadiponectinemia derives from an unexpected source: bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT). Herein, we elaborate on this surprising discovery, including further discussion of potential mechanisms influencing adiponectin production from MAT; additional evidence both for and against our conclusions; and observations suggesting that the relationship between MAT and adiponectin might extend beyond CR. While many questions remain, the burgeoning study of MAT promises to reveal further key insights into MAT biology, both as a source of adiponectin and beyond.",

We have recently shown that IL-6-type cytokine signaling in adipocytes is involved in the development of obesity-associated hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. In addition, we revealed that adipocyte-specific IL-6 signaling ameliorates glucose metabolism in obesity via enhancing insulin secretion. Mechanistically, IL-6 induces the release of free fatty acid (FFA) and leptin from adipocytes thereby affecting liver metabolism and pancreatic β-cell function, respectively. This commentary further discusses the role of adipocyte-specific IL-6-type cytokine signaling in the regulation of FFA and leptin release. In particular, we outline depot-specific differences in IL-6-induced basal release of the two aforementioned factors. Moreover, we provide evidence that insulin's effect on the release of FFA and leptin is adipose depot-dependent. We conclude that adipose depot-specific targeting of the IL-6 signaling pathway may be a novel approach to blunt obesity-associated metabolic complications.",

Obesity is characterized by excessive expansion of white adipose tissue resulting from increased adipocyte size, and enhanced adipocyte precursor cells proliferation and differentiation into mature adipocytes, a process well-defined as adipogenesis. Efforts to develop therapeutically potent strategies to circumvent obesity are impacted by our limited understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating adipogenesis. In this review, we discuss recently discovered molecular mechanisms restraining adipogenesis. In this perspective, the discoveries of white adipose tissue endogenous adipogenesis-regulatory cells (Aregs) that negatively regulate adipocyte differentiation, platelet-derived growth factor receptor isoform α (PDGFRα) activation and downstream signaling that hinder adipocyte precursors differentiation, and a group of obesity-associated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that regulate adipogenesis open up promising therapeutic avenues to prevent and/or treat obesity.",

In contrast, the morphology of EAT adipocytes has rarely been investigated. We aimed to determine whether obesity-driven adipocyte hypertrophy, which is characteristic of other visceral fat depots, is found within EAT adipocytes. EAT samples were collected from cardiac surgery patients (n = 49), stained with haematoxylin & eosin, and analysed for mean adipocyte size and non-adipocyte area. EAT thickness was measured using echocardiography. A significant positive relationship was found between EAT thickness and body mass index (BMI). When stratified into standardized BMI categories, EAT thickness was 58.7% greater (p = 0.003) in patients from the obese (7.3 ± 1.8 mm) compared to normal (4.6 ± 0.9 mm) category. BMI as a continuous variable significantly correlated with EAT thickness (r = 0.56, p < 0.0001). Conversely, no correlation was observed between adipocyte size and either BMI or EAT thickness. No difference in the non-adipocyte area was found between BMI groups. Our results suggest that the increased macroscopic EAT deposition associated with obesity is not caused by adipocyte hypertrophy. Rather, alternative remodelling via adipocyte proliferation might be responsible for the observed EAT expansion.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global health concern that promotes chronic low-grade inflammation, leading to insulin resistance, a key factor in many metabolic diseases. Angiotensin 1–7 (Ang 1–7), a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in obesity and related disorders, though its mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of Ang 1–7 on inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT) in dietary-induced obese mice. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) produced by white adipocytes and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) produced by macrophages are pro-inflammatory cytokines and interact to form a pathogenic loop to exacerbate obesity-induced inflammation. We found that Ang 1–7 reduced MCP-1 and TNF-α gene expressions and the number of crown-like structures, which are histological hallmarks of the pro-inflammatory process, in visceral epididymal WAT (eWAT) and reduced circulating MCP-1 and TNF-α levels, accompanied by improvement in insulin resistance, in dietary-induced obese mice. Furthermore, Ang 1–7 reduced MCP-1 and TNF-α secretions in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes and RAW 264.7 macrophages, respectively, which are in vitro experimental models mimicking obesity condition. Our results suggest that Ang 1–7 directly acts on WAT to mitigate obesity-induced inflammation. Thus, this study provides novel insights into the underlying mechanism of anti-obesity effects of Ang 1–7.",

Here, we investigate the role of SUMOylation in adipose tissue development using TAK-981, a pharmacological inhibitor of SUMOylation. Administration of TAK-981 to mice resulted in significant defect in weight gain and adipocyte atrophy in perigonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) depots. Gene expression analyses revealed a marked downregulation of adipogenic genes, including Pparg, Cebpa, and Fasn. Our data thus indicate that TAK-981 treatment impaired adipogenesis in gWAT, consistent with prior findings that SUMOylation supports transcriptional regulation of adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. We also found significant infiltration of immune cells and efferocytosis in gWAT. Our results thus indicate that SUMOylation inhibition using a small molecule phenocopies genetic hypoSUMOylation models, highlighting its critical role in maintaining adipocyte functionality and immune environment. These findings provide evidence that SUMOylation is essential for fat accumulation in vivo. Furthermore, given that TAK-981 is currently under clinical evaluation for the treatment of solid tumors, our results underscore the importance of considering the potential unintended effects of SUMOylation inhibition on adipose tissue in patients.",

Although repeated injection of an ethanol extract of Brazilian propolis (100 mg/kg, ip, twice a week for 12 weeks) did not affect body weight gain and food intake of ob/ob mice, blood glucose and plasma cholesterol levels were significantly attenuated. Moreover, the propolis extract partially restored glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, indicating anti-diabetic properties of the extract. The propolis-treated mice exhibited lower weight gain in mesenteric adipose tissue, while weight gains in inguinal and epididymal adipose tissues were not modulated. Flow cytometric and microscopic analyses suggested that the extract promoted accumulation of eosinophils into mesenteric and epididymal adipose tissues. Alternatively, the ratio of M1-like macrophages to M2-like macrophages in mesenteric adipose tissue was reduced by the propolis injection, coincident with the decrement of the number of interleukin-12A(+) cells. Levels of M1 macrophage markers, such as Itgax and Il12b transcripts, were decreased in the vascular stromal fraction of mesenteric adipose tissue, whereas those of pan-macrophage markers Emr1 and Cd68 were not influenced. Microarray and subsequent gene ontology term analyses suggested that propolis attenuated immune activation in mesenteric adipose tissues. Taken together, this indicates that Brazilian propolis improves diabetes in ob/ob mice, presumably through modification of immune cells in mesenteric adipose tissues.",

We, therefore, developed a novel automatic method to provide accurate measurements of the cross-sectional area of adipocytes in histological sections, allowing rapid high-throughput quantification of fat cell size and number. Photomicrographs of H&E-stained paraffin sections of murine gonadal adipose were transformed using standard image processing/analysis algorithms to reduce background and enhance edge-detection. This allowed the isolation of individual adipocytes from which their area could be calculated. Performance was compared with manual measurements made from the same images, in which adipocyte area was calculated from estimates of the major and minor axes of individual adipocytes. Both methods identified an increase in mean adipocyte size in a murine model of obesity, with good concordance, although the calculation used to identify cell area from manual measurements was found to consistently over-estimate cell size. Here we report an accurate method to determine adipocyte area in histological sections that provides a considerable time saving over manual methods.",

As one type of these factors, adipose tissue-derived adipokines have recently garnered attention as important regulators of systemic insulin sensitivity and metabolic homeostasis. However, the realization that skeletal muscle also secretes a variety of biologically and metabolically active polypeptide factors (collectively called myokines) has provided a new conceptual framework to understand the critical role skeletal muscle plays in coordinating whole-body energy balance. Here, we highlight recent progress made in the myokine field and discuss possible roles of myonectin, which we have recently identified as a potential postprandial signal derived from skeletal muscle to integrate metabolic processes in other tissues, such as adipose and liver; one of its roles is to promote fatty acid uptake into cells. Myonectin is also likely an important mediator in inter-tissue crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 2 decades, the incidence of childhood obesity has risen dramatically. This recent rise in childhood obesity is particularly concerning as adults who were obese during childhood develop type II diabetes that is intractable to current forms of treatment compared with individuals who develop obesity in adulthood. While the mechanisms responsible for the exacerbated diabetic phenotype associated with childhood obesity is not clear, it is well known that childhood is an important time period for the establishment of normal white adipose tissue in humans. This association suggests that exposure to obesogenic stimuli during adipose development may have detrimental effects on adipose function and metabolic homeostasis. In this study, we identify the period of development associated with puberty, postnatal days 18-34, as critical for the establishment of normal adipose mass in mice. Exposure of mice to high fat diet only during this time period results in metabolic dysfunction, increased leptin expression, and increased adipocyte size in adulthood in the absence of sustained increased fat mass or body weight. These findings indicate that exposure to obesogenic stimuli during critical developmental periods have prolonged effects on adipose tissue function that may contribute to the exacerbated metabolic dysfunctions associated with childhood obesity.",

    "abstract": "During the last years the existence of metabolically active brown adipose tissue in adult humans has been widely accepted by the research community. Its unique ability to dissipate chemical energy stored in triglycerides as heat makes it an attractive target for new drugs against obesity and its related diseases. Hence the tissue is now subject to intense research, the hypothesis being that an expansion and/or activation of the tissue is associated with a healthy metabolic phenotype. Animal studies provide evidence for the existence of at least two types of brown adipocytes. Apart from the classical brown adipocyte that is found primarily in the interscapular region where it constitutes a thermogenic organ, a second type of brown adipocyte, the so-called beige adipocyte, can appear within white adipose tissue depots. The fact that the two cell types develop from different precursors suggests that they might be recruited and stimulated by different cues and therefore represent two distinct targets for therapeutic intervention. The aim of this commentary is to discuss recent work addressing the question whether also humans possess two types of brown adipocytes and to highlight some issues when looking for molecular markers for such cells.",

Since the discovery that BAT and brite/beige cells are functional in adult humans, many studies have been focusing on the physiology and functionality of this organ. The brain is controlling the maintenance of body temperature through a complex neuronal network. One of the candidates to modulate thermogenesis at central level is glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), with GLP-1 receptors widely expressed throughout the brain. Our group has recently reported that stimulation of brain GLP-1 receptors in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus is essential for the activation not only of BAT thermogenesis, but also browning of white fat. Notably, both actions are mediated by specific inhibition of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In this commentary, we summarize the latest results on this topic, as well as the potential clinical relevance of the brain GLP-1 system to treat obesity.",

The 3T3-L1 model is one of the murine cell models used extensively for the investigation of the molecular events that govern the differentiation of adipocytes from a committed preadipocyte to a mature, lipid laden adipocyte. Most of the studies investigating the effects of BPA on preadipocyte differentiation have investigated the effects of this chemical in the presence of an optimal differentiation cocktail containing high concentrations of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, conditions that result in 90% to 100% of differentiated adipocytes. Our studies employed the 3T3-L1 cell model in the absence of exogenous glucocorticoids. We show that BPA is able to increase the differentiation of the 3T3-L1 cells under these conditions. Furthermore, the effect of BPA was observed in the absence of the synthetic glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), a hormone known to be required for the differentiation of the 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, BPA upregulated the mRNA expression and protein levels of the terminal marker of adipogenesis the fatty acid binding protein (aP2) in these cells. Interestingly, the known modulators of adipogenesis such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ or CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) α were not elevated at the mRNA or protein level in response to BPA. Furthermore, BPA upregulated the expression levels of the marker of adipogenesis aP2, through an effect on the transcriptional activity of C/EBPδ and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) at its promoter.",

However, adipose tissue is highly dynamic and upon cold exposure profound changes occur in WAT resulting in a BAT-like phenotype due to the presence of brown-in-white (BRITE) adipocytes. In our recent report, transcription profiling was used to identify the gene expression changes that underlie the browning process as well as the intrinsic differences between BAT and WAT.

We fed C57BL/6J mice high fat-high protein diets using casein, soy, cod, beef, chicken or pork as protein sources. Casein stood out as the most efficient in preventing weight gain and accretion of adipose mass. By contrast, mice fed diets based on pork or chicken, and to a lesser extent mice fed cod or beef protein, had increased adipose tissue mass gain relative to casein fed mice. Decreasing the protein:carbohydrate ratio in diets with casein or pork as protein sources led to accentuated fat mass accumulation. Pork fed mice were more obese than casein fed mice, and relative to casein, the pork-based feed induced substantial accumulation of fat in classic interscapular brown adipose tissue accompanied by decreased UCP1 expression. Furthermore, intake of a low fat diet with casein, but not pork, as a protein source reversed diet-induced obesity. Compared to pork, casein seems unique in maintaining the classical brown morphology in interscapular brown adipose tissue with high UCP1 expression. This was accompanied by increased expression of genes involved in a futile cycling of fatty acids. Our results demonstrate that intake of high protein diets based on other protein sources may not have similar effects, and hence, the obesity protective effect of high protein diets is clearly modulated by protein source.",

Whole mount staining of organoids using specific lipophilic dyes showed large multi- and unilocular fat deposits in differentiated cells indicating highly efficient differentiation of ASCs into mature adipocytes.

We have recently described a system for the inducible, permanent labeling of mature adipocytes, the \"AdipoChaser\" mouse.

We also found that cold exposure or β-3 agonist stimulation induces massive white adipogenesis in the epididymal fat depot. Developmentally, adipocytes in the gonadal fat depot are differentiated postnatally, between birth and sexual maturation, while adipocytes in the subcutaneous fat are differentiated between embryonic days 14–18.

As a first step toward understanding the roles of the obesity-driven chemokine network, we used a 3T3-L1 cell differentiation model to identify the chemokine profiles elicited during adipogenesis and how this profile is modified by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) as a growth and proinflammatory factor, respectively. The chemokine network was monitored using PCR arrays and qRT-PCR while main signaling pathways of EGF and TNF were measured using immunoblotting. The dominant chemokines in preadipocytes were CCL5, CCL8, CXCL1, and CXCL16, and in adipocytes CCL6 and CXCL13. The following chemokines were found in both preadipocytes and adipocytes: CCL2, CCL7, CCL25, CCL27, CXCL5, CXCL12, and CX3CL1. Among chemokine receptors, CXCR7 was specific for preadipocytes and CXCR2 for adipocytes. These findings indicate the development of a CXCL12-CXCR7 axis in preadipocytes and a CXCL5-CXCR2 axis in adipocytes. In addition to induction of CCL2 and CCL7 in both preadipocytes and adipocytes, EGF enhanced specifically CXCL1 and CXCL5 in adipocytes, indicating the potentiation of CXCR2-mediated pathway in adipocytes. TNF induced CCL2, CCL7, and CXCL1 in preadipocytes but had no response in adipocytes. EGFR downstream activation was dominant in adipocytes whereas NFκB activation was dominant in preadipocytes. Taken together, the adipocyte-driven chemokine network in the 3T3-L1 cell differentiation model involves CXCR2-mediated signaling which appears more potentiated to growth factors like EGF than proinflammatory factors like TNF.",

The ability to modulate gene expression in mature brown adipocytes is important to understand brown adipocyte function and delineate novel regulatory mechanisms of non-shivering thermogenesis. The aim of this study was to optimize a lipofection-based small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection protocol for efficient silencing of gene expression in mature brown adipocytes. We determined that a critical parameter was to deliver the siRNA to mature adipocytes by reverse transfection, i.e. transfection of non-adherent cells. Using this protocol, we effectively knocked down both high- and low-abundance transcripts in a model of mature brown adipocytes (WT-1) as well as in primary mature mouse brown adipocytes. A functional consequence of the knockdown was confirmed by an attenuated increase in uncoupled respiration (thermogenesis) in response to β-adrenergic stimulation of mature WT-1 brown adipocytes transfected with uncoupling protein 1 siRNA. Efficient gene silencing was also obtained in various mouse and human white adipocyte models (3T3-L1, primary mouse white adipocytes, hMADS) with the ability to undergo \"browning.\" In summary, we report an easy and versatile reverse siRNA transfection protocol to achieve specific silencing of gene expression in various models of mature brown and browning-competent white adipocytes, including primary cells.",

    "abstract": "The protective effects of lower body subcutaneous adiposity are linked to the depot functioning as a \"metabolic sink\" receiving and sequestering excess lipid. This postulate, however, is based on indirect evidence. Mechanisms that mediate this protection are unknown. Here we directly examined this with progressive subcutaneous adipose tissue removal. Ad libitum chow fed mice underwent sham surgery, unilateral or bilateral removal of inguinal adipose tissue or bilateral removal of both inguinal and dorsal adipose tissue. Subsequently mice were separated into 5 week chow or 5 or 13 week HFD groups (N = 10 per group). Primary outcome measures included adipocyte distribution, muscle and liver triglycerides, glucose tolerance, circulating adipocytokines and muscle insulin sensitivity. Subcutaneous adipose tissue removal caused lipid accumulation in femoral muscle proximal to excision, however, lipid accumulation was not proportionally inverse to adipose tissue quantity excised. Accumulative adipose removal was associated with an incremental reduction in systemic glucose tolerance in 13 week HFD mice. Although insulin-stimulated pAkt/Akt did not progressively decrease among surgery groups following 13 weeks of HFD, there was a suppressed pAkt/Akt response in the non-insulin stimulated (saline-injected) 13 week HFD mice. Hence, increases in lower body subcutaneous adipose removal resulted in incremental decreases in the effectiveness of basal insulin sensitivity of femoral muscle. The current data supports that the subcutaneous depot protects systemic glucose homeostasis while also protecting proximal muscle from metabolic dysregulation and lipid accumulation. Removal of the \"metabolic sink\" likely leads to glucose intolerance because of decreased storage space for glucose and/or lipids.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays important roles in maintaining adequate adipose tissue function and in metabolic regulation. Here we have examined the organization of a relatively unexplored adipose tissue ECM component, elastin and its response to diet induced obesity in mice. Additionally, we have explored the regulation and requirement of macrophage metalloelastase, MMP-12, in adipose tissue ECM remodeling in obesity. In visceral fat depots, elastin fibers form a mesh-like net that becomes denser with diet-induced obesity. In contrast, the elastin fibers in subcutaneous adipose depots are more linear in organization, and are tightly associated with adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). We found that Mmp12 is produced predominantly by ATMs and can be induced with both short- and long-term high fat diet challenge and rapid remodeling induced by lipolysis. This contrasts with Mmp14 and Timp1 which are further induced only after chronic obesity in non-ATM populations. We examined obese transgenic Mmp12 (-/-) mice and found an increase in gene expression of ECM genes with diet-induced obesity, but showed few significant differences in metabolic parameters, elastin matrix density, or in adipose tissue inflammation. Together, these studies reveal the architecture and diet-induced regulation of the elastin matrix and suggest that MMP-12 is not required for elastin matrix remodeling or for the metabolic dysfunction that occurs with obesity.",

While glucose has been reported as the principle fuel source for osteoblasts, recent evidence supports the tenet that osteoblasts can utilize fatty acids as well. Although the ability to accumulate lipid droplets has been demonstrated in many cell types, there has been little evidence that osteoblasts possess this characteristic. The current study provides evidence that osteoblastogenesis is associated with lipid droplet accumulation capable of supplying energy substrates (fatty acids) required for the differentiation process. Understanding the role of fatty acids in metabolic programming of the osteoblast may lead to novel approaches to increase bone formation and ultimately bone mass.",

Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) biopsies were collected for assessment of adipocyte morphology and micro-array analysis. EGCG+RES had no effects on adipocyte size and distribution compared with PLA. However, we identified pathways contributing to adipogenesis, cell cycle and apoptosis were significantly downregulated by EGCG+RES versus PLA. Furthermore, EGCG+RES significantly decreased expression of pathways related to energy metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and immune defense as compared with PLA. In conclusion, the SAT gene expression profile indicates a reduced cell turnover after 12-week EGCG+RES in overweight-obese subjects. It remains to be elucidated whether these alterations translate into long-term metabolic effects.",

The aim of this study was to measure the phosphorylation at serine residue 563 of hormone sensitive lipase with and without exposure to sodium acetate. Using the 3T3-L1 cell line, we identified that stimulating the cells with isoproterenol increased phosphorylated hormone sensitive lipase (pHSL) expression by 60% compared with the basal state. In the presence of the SCFA acetate in stimulated cells, pHSL decreased by 15% compared with stimulated cells alone. These results were mirrored by the NEFA release from stimulated cells that had significantly decreased in the presence of sodium acetate after 60 min (from 0.53 µmol mg(-1) protein to 0.41 µmol mg(-1) protein, respectively, P = 0.004); and 180 min (1.73 µmol mg(-1) protein to 1.13 µmol mg(-1) protein, P = 0.020); however, treatment had no effect on glycerol release (P = 0.109). In conclusion, exposure to 4 mM acetate reduced the level of phosphorylation of HSL(SER563) in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes and led to a significant reduction in NEFA release, although glycerol release was not affected.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is closely associated with metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes. One hallmark characteristics of obesity is chronic inflammation that is coordinately controlled by complex signaling networks in adipose tissues. Compelling evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and its related signaling pathways play crucial roles in the progression of chronic inflammation in obesity. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is an anabolic pathway that utilizes the glucoses to generate molecular building blocks and reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH. In particular, NADPH acts as one of the key modulators in the control of ROS through providing an electron for both ROS generation and scavenging. Recently, we have reported that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP, is implicated in adipose tissue inflammation and systemic insulin resistance in obesity. Mechanistically, G6PD potentiates generation of ROS that augments pro-inflammatory responses in adipose tissue macrophages, leading to systemic insulin resistance. Here, we provide an overview of cell type- specific roles of G6PD in the regulation of ROS balance as well as additional details on the significance of G6PD that contributes to pro-oxidant NADPH generation in obesity-related chronic inflammation and insulin resistance.",

Gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue in PCOS and its relation to metabolic and endocrine features of the syndrome have been fragmentarily investigated. The aim was to assess in subcutaneous adipose tissue the expression of genes potentially associated with adipose tissue dysfunction and to explore their relation to features of the syndrome. Twenty-one women with PCOS (body mass index [BMI] 18.2–33.4 kg/m2) and 21 controls (BMI 19.2–31.7 kg/m2) were matched pair-wise for age, body weight, and BMI. Tissue biopsies were obtained to measure mRNA expression of 44 genes (TaqMan Low Density Array). Differential expression levels were correlated with BMI, glucose infusion rate (GIR), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and sex steroids. In PCOS, expression of adiponectin receptor 2 (ADIPOR2), LPL, and twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1) was decreased, while expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and heme oxygenase (decycling 1) (HMOX1) was increased. TWIST1 and HMOX1, both novel adipokines, correlated with BMI and GIR. After BMI adjustment, LPL and ADIPOR2 expression correlated with plasma estradiol, and CCL2 expression correlated with GIR, in all women. We conclude that adipose tissue mRNA expression differed in PCOS women and controls and that two novel adipokines, TWIST1 and HMOX1, together with adiponectin, LPL, and CCL2, and their downstream pathways merit further investigation.",

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) after bariatric surgery were identified by analyzing two expression profiles from the GEO. Subsequently, enrichment analysis, GSEA, PPI network, and gene-microRNAs and gene-TFs networks were interrogated to identify hub genes and associated pathways. Co-expressed DEGs included one that was up-regulated and 22 that were down-regulated genes. The enrichment analyses indicated that down-regulated DEGs were significantly involved in inflammatory responses. GSEA provided comprehensive evidence that most genes enriched in pro-inflammation pathways, while gene-sets after surgery enriched in metabolism. We identified nine hub genes in the PPI network, most of which were validated as highly expressed and hypomethylated in obesity by Attie Lab Diabetes and DiseaseMeth databases, respectively. DGIdb was also applied to predict potential therapeutic agents that might reverse abnormally high hub gene expression. Bariatric surgery induces a significant shift from an obese pro-inflammatory state to an anti-inflammatory state, with improvement in adipocyte metabolic function – representing key mechanisms whereby AT function improves after bariatric surgery. Our study deepens a mechanistic understanding of the benefits of bariatric surgery and provides potential biomarkers or treatment targets for further research.",

Compared to HFD-fed mice, the swertiamarin-treated mice exhibited increased lipolysis and reduced adipocyte hypertrophy and macrophage infiltration in eWAT. Moreover, swertiamarin alleviated HFD-mediated hepatic steatosis and inflammation by suppressing activation of the p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways within the eWAT and liver of obese mice.

This worsened metabolic phenotype of HFD-fed S1PR3-/- mice was mechanistically linked with increased adipose inflammation, adipose macrophage and T-cell accumulation, hepatic inflammation and hepatic steatosis. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes S1P increased adipogenesis and S1P-S1PR3 signalling regulated the expression of PPARγ, suggesting a novel role for this signalling pathway in the adipogenic program. These results reveal an anti-diabetic role for S1P, and, that S1P-S1PR3 signalling in the adipose and liver defends against excessive inflammation and steatosis to maintain metabolic homeostasis at key regulatory pathways.",

However, mechanisms regulating adipocyte inflammation remain poorly understood. Here, we observed that TRIM8 was upregulated in adipocyte inflammation and insulin resistance while DUSP14 was downregulated. TRIM8 deficiency and DUSP14 over-expression decreased the level of inflammatory cytokines, increased glucose uptake content, and improved insulin signalling transduction compared to LPS treatment alone. Conversely, silencing DUSP14 increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines. It decreased the glucose uptake content and the phosphorylation level of proteins involved in insulin signalling, further impairing insulin signalling and aggravating insulin resistance. Furthermore, The decreased level of inflammatory cytokines, increased glucose uptake, and improved insulin signalling transduction caused by TRIM8 deficiency were reversed by down-regulated DUSP14. Collectively, our findings revealed that TRIM8 can regulate adipocyte inflammation and insulin resistance by regulating the MAPKs pathway which is dependent on DUSP14.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation accompanies obesity and its comorbidities-type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis, among others-and may contribute to their pathogenesis. Yet the cellular machinery that links nutrient sensing to inflammation remains incompletely characterized. The protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SirT1) is activated by energy depletion and plays a critical role in the mammalian response to fasting. More recently it has been implicated in the repression of inflammation. SirT1 mRNA and protein expression are suppressed in obese rodent and human white adipose tissue, while experimental reduction of SirT1 in adipocytes and macrophages causes low-grade inflammation that mimics that observed in obesity. Thus suppression of SirT1 during overnutrition may be critical to the development of obesity-associated inflammation. This effect is attributable to multiple actions of SirT1, including direct deacetylation of NFκB and chromatin remodeling at inflammatory gene promoters. In this work, we report that SirT1 is also suppressed by diet-induced obesity in macrophages, which are key contributors to the ontogeny of metabolic inflammation. Thus, SirT1 may be a common mechanism by which cells sense nutrient status and modulate inflammatory signaling networks in accordance with organismal energy availability.",

Adipocytes and adipose tissue associated macrophages (ATMs) secrete bioactive molecules, including adipokines, chemokines/cytokines and free fatty acids that modulate the development of low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance responsible for obesity-related metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Nuclear receptors, notably peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors, are sensors of dietary lipids and control transcriptional programs of key metabolic and inflammatory pathways in adipocytes and macrophages. This review focuses on mechanisms by which nuclear receptors maintain white adipose tissue homeostasis.

However, not all fat is equal, and the impact of heterogeneity on the development and expansion of different adipose depots is becoming increasingly apparent. Two mechanisms are responsible for the growth of adipose tissue: hyperplasia (increasing adipocyte number) and hypertrophy (increasing adipocyte size). The former relies on the differentiation of adipocyte stem cells, which reside within the adipose stromal vascular fraction. Many differences in gene expression, adipogenesis, and the response to obesogenic stimuli have been described when comparing adipose stem cells from different depots. Considering that there is disparity in the pathogenicity of the depots, understanding this heterogeneity has clinically relevant implications. Here we review the current knowledge surrounding such differences, in the context of development, expansion and therapeutics. Moreover, given the importance of these differences, we suggest that careful consideration for the precise methodologies used, is essential if we are to truly understand the physiologically relevant consequences of this heterogeneity.",

Statins have pleotropic actions beyond cholesterol lowering, including decreased protein prenylation, which can alter immune function. The general anti-inflammatory effect of statins may be a key pleiotropic effect that improves cardiovascular disease risk. However, a series of findings have shown that statins increase the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, via decreased protein prenylation in immune cells. IL-1β can be regulated by the NLRP3 inflammasome containing caspase-1. Statins have been associated with an increased risk of new onset diabetes. Inflammation can promote ineffective insulin action (insulin resistance), which often precedes diabetes. This review highlights the links between statins, insulin resistance and immunity via the NLRP3 inflammasome. We propose that statin-induced changes in immunity should be investigated as a mechanism underlying increased risk of diabetes. It is possible that statin-related insulin resistance occurs through a separate pathway from various mechanisms that confer cardiovascular benefits. Therefore, understanding the potential mechanisms that segregate statin-induced cardiovascular effects from those that cause dysglycemia may lead to improvements in this drugs class.",

Muscle-specific myostatin inhibition also prevented hyperphagia suggesting muscle may regulate food intake.

However, the regulation of lipid storage capacity in conditions of energy excess and scarcity is still not clear. It is not technically feasible to monitor every process affecting storage capacity such as recruitment, growth/shrinkage and death of individual adipose cells in real time for a sufficiently long period. However, recent computational approaches have allowed an examination of the detailed dynamics of adipose cells using statistical information in the form of precise measurements of adipose cell-size probability distributions. One interesting finding is that the growth/shrinkage of adipose cells (> 50 μm diameter) under positive/negative energy balance is proportional to the surface area of cells, limiting efficient lipid absorption/release from larger adipose cells. In addition to the physical characteristics of adipose cells, quantitative modeling integrates dynamics of adipose cells, providing the mechanism of cell turnover under normal and drug-treated conditions. Thus, further use of mathematical modeling applied to experimental measurements of adipose cell-size probability distributions in conjunction with physiological measurements of metabolic state may help unravel the intricate network of interactions underlying metabolic syndromes in obesity.",

Comparative analyses of gene datasets allowed us to identify 1426 genes which may represent common adipose phenotype in humans and mice. Among them we identified several adipocyte-specific genes dysregulated in obese adipose tissue, involved in either fatty acid storage (acyl CoA synthase ACSL1, hormone-sensitive lipase LIPE, aquaporin 7 AQP7, perilipin PLIN) or cell adhesion (fibronectin FN1, collagens COL1A1, COL1A3, metalloprotein MMP9, or both (scavenger receptor FAT/CD36). Using real-time analysis of cell surface occupancy on xCELLigence system we developed a new method to study lipid uptake and differentiation of mouse 3T3L1 fibroblasts and human adipose stem cells. Both processes are regulated by insulin and fatty acids such as oleic acid. We showed that fatty acid addition to culture media increased the differentiation rate and was required for full differentiation into unilocular adipocytes. Significant activation of lipogenesis, i.e. lipid accumulation, by either insulin or oleic acid was monitored in times ranging from 1 to 24 h, depending on differentiation state, whereas significant effects on adipogenesis, i.e., surperimposed lipid accumulation and gene transcriptional regulations were measured after 3 to 4 d. Combination of selected times for analysis of lipid contents, cell counts, size fractionations, and gene transcriptional regulations showed that FAT/CD36 specific inhibitor AP5258 significantly increased cell survival of oleic acid-treated mouse and human adipocytes, and partially restored the transcriptional response to oleic acid in the presence of insulin through JNK pathway. Taken together, these data open new perspectives to study the molecular mechanisms commonly dysregulated in mouse and human obesity at the level of lipogenesis linked to hypertrophy and adipogenesis linked to hyperplasia.",

But, outcomes have been contradicting, which made the information on the role of the leptin gene in regulating the mechanism of pathophysiology of obesity inexplicable. Moreover, none of the studies are known to have similar implications on the Indian population. To address such contradictions, our study aims to evaluate the association of leptin gene polymorphism with obesity and leptin levels in a South Indian Population. A total of 304 cases (BMI≥27.5) and 309 controls (BMI≤23) from local inhabitants of Mysore, Karnataka were recruited for the study. The leptin gene variants rs7799039, rs2167270 and rs4731426 independently, as well as in 4 haplotype combinations, were found to be significantly associated with the risk of obesity. An increasing trend in BMI and leptin levels was observed with every addition of A and C minor alleles of exonic variant (rs2167270) and intronic variant (rs4731426) respectively. However, only AA genotype of SNP rs7799039 was positively associated with BMI. None of the SNPs were associated with fat percentage and waist to hip ratio.

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue serves as both a storage site for excess calories and as an endocrine organ, secreting hormones such as adiponectin that promote metabolic homeostasis. In obesity, adipose tissue expands primarily by hypertrophy (enlargement of existing adipocytes) rather than hyperplasia (generation of new adipocytes via adipogenic differentiation of preadipocytes). Progressive adipocyte hypertrophy leads to inflammation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and ectopic lipid deposition, the hallmark characteristics of metabolic disease. We demonstrate that during chronic high fat feeding in mice, adipogenic differentiation is impaired due to the actions of histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9), a member of the class II family of HDACs. Mechanistically, upregulated HDAC9 expression blocks the adipogenic differentiation program during chronic high fat feeding, leading to accumulation of improperly differentiated adipocytes with diminished expression of adiponectin. These adipocytes are inefficient at storing lipid, resulting in ectopic lipid deposition in the liver. HDAC9 gene deletion prevents the detrimental effects of chronic high fat feeding on adipogenic differentiation, increases adiponectin expression, and enhances energy expenditure by promoting beige adipogenesis, thus leading to reduced body mass and improved metabolic homeostasis. HDAC9 is therefore emerging as a critical regulator of adipose tissue health and a novel therapeutic target for obesity-related disease.",

In preadipocytes, RA signals predominantly through CRABP-II and the RAR isotype RARγ to induce the expression of hallmark markers of preadipocytes Pref-1, Sox9, and KLF2. RA thus maintains the preadipocyte phenotype and inhibits adipogenesis. In mature adipocytes, RA activates both of its receptors to upregulate expression of genes that enhance lipid oxidation, energy dissipation, and insulin responses. Consequently, RA potently protects mice from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance by two distinct mechanisms: by counteracting adipogenesis, thereby moderating the formation of new fat cells, and by promoting energy expenditure, thereby preventing adipocyte hypertrophy.",

    "abstract": "Polyunsaturated Fatty acids have multiple effects in peripheral tissues and pancreatic beta cell function. The n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty acids prevent and reverse high-fat-diet induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Insulin secretion is stimulated by glucose, amino acids, and glucagon- like peptide-1 in tissue containing high levels of n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty acids than lower level of n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty acids. Also, n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty acids led to decreased production of prostaglandin, which in turn contributed to the elevation of insulin secretion. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids prevent cytokine-induced cell death in pancreatic islets. Supplementation of n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty acids for human subjects prevent beta cell destruction and insulin resistance. It also enhances insulin secretion, reduction in lipid profiles and glucose concentration particularly in type II diabetes patients. Therefore there should be a focus on the treatment mechanism of insulin related obesity and diabetes by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue autophagy (AT) is associated with human obesity and increased metabolic risk. Recent findings establish a role for autophagy in lipid metabolism. Here, we compared the expression of autophagy-related and lipolysis genes in human abdominal subcutaneous AT (SCAT) in overweight/obese subjects (n = 17) with or without impaired glucose tolerance in comparison with lean normal glucose tolerant individuals (n = 9), and investigated the association between AT autophagy and lipolysis. Human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells (hMADS) were used to investigate the effect of pharmacological HSL inhibition on changes in the autophagic flux. The expression of autophagy-related genes (ATG) 5, 7 and 12 in SCAT was significantly higher (p = 0.043, p = 0.015, p = 0.004, respectively) in overweight/obese compared to lean men, while expression of the classical lipases HSL (p = 0.092) and ATGL (p = 0.084) tended to be lower. ATG12 mRNA was positively correlated with BMI (r = 0.407, p = 0.039). ATG7 mRNA correlated positively with waist/hip ratio (WHR) (r = 0.420, p = 0.041), 2 h glucose concentration (r = 0.488, p = 0.011) and insulin (r = 0.419, p = 0.033). Multiple linear regressions revealed that ATG7 gene expression was positively related to 2 h glucose, independent of BMI, WHR and insulin. Gene expression interaction analysis showed that ATG7 mRNA negatively correlated with HSL (p<0.01) and ATGL mRNA expression (p<0.01). In line, treatment of differentiated hMADS with an HSL inhibitor increased LC3 accumulation, a marker of increased autophagic flux. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that a low expression of classical lipases in abdominal SCAT is accompanied by an increased expression of ATGs in overweight/obese subjects, which seems to be mainly related to glucose tolerance.",

TRF has a direct effect on animal adiposity, causes an alteration of adipokine signaling, and diminishes white adipose tissue inflammation. Many genes involved in lipid metabolism are normally circadian, but their expression is perturbed with DIO; TRF restores their cyclical expression. One mechanism through which TRF could affect host metabolism is by altering the gut microbiome. Changes in the gut microbiome are coupled with an altered stool bile acid profile. Hence, TRF could affect lipid metabolism by altering bile acid signaling. TRF introduces many new possibilities in treating obesity and its associated metabolic disorders. However, further studies are needed to show whether these physiological findings in mice translate to humans.",

    "abstract": "Long thought to function only as an inert energy storage depot, the role of adipose tissue in breast tumorigenesis has been largely ignored. In light of increasing rates of obesity and use of breast conserving therapy and autologous fat grafting, improved understanding of the role of adipose tissue in tumor etiology is crucial. Thus, adipose tissue adjacent to and distant from invasive breast tumors (n = 20), or adjacent to non-malignant diagnoses (n = 20) was laser microdissected from post-menopausal women. Gene expression data were generated using microarrays and data analyzed to identify significant patterns of differential expression between adipose tissue groups at the individual gene and molecular pathway level. Pathway analysis revealed significant differences in immune response between non-malignant, distant, and tumor-adjacent adipose tissue, with the highest response in tumor-adjacent and lowest in non-malignant adipose tissue. Adipose tissue from invasive breasts exhibits increased expression of anti-inflammatory genes such as MARCO and VSIG4 while genes differentially expressed between tumor-adjacent and distant adipose tissue such as SPP1, RRM2, and MMP9, are associated with increased cellular proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. These data suggest that molecular profiles of adipose tissue differ depending on presence of or proximity to tumor cells. Heightened immunotolerance in adipose tissue from invasive breasts provides a microenvironment favorable to tumorigenesis. In addition, tumor-adjacent adipose tissue demonstrates expression of genes associated with tumor growth and progression. Thus, adipose tissue is not an inert component of the breast microenvironment but plays an active role in tumorigenesis.",

A sequence variation in patatin like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), rs 738409, is strongly associated with the progression of fatty liver disease. The resulting mutant causes a substitution of isoleucine to methionine at position 148. The underlying mechanism of this disease remains unsolved although several studies have illuminated key insights into its pathogenesis.

    "abstract": "The race to manage the health concerns related to excess fat deposition has spawned a proliferation of clinical and basic research efforts to understand variables including dietary uptake, metabolism, and lipid deposition by adipocytes. A full appreciation of these variables must also include a depot-specific understanding of content and location in order to elucidate mechanisms governing cellular development and regulation of fat deposition. Because adipose tissue depots contain various cell types, differences in the cellularity among and within adipose depots are presently being documented to ascertain functional differences. This has led to the possibility of there being, within any one adipose depot, cellular distinctions that essentially result in adipose depots within depots. The papers comprising this issue will underscore numerous differences in cellularity (development, histogenesis, growth, metabolic function, regulation) of different adipose depots. Such information is useful in deciphering adipose depot involvement both in normal physiology and in pathology. Obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, carcass composition of meat animals, performance of elite athletes, physiology/pathophysiology of aging, and numerous other diseases might be altered with a greater understanding of adipose depots and the cells that comprise them-including stem cells-during initial development and subsequent periods of normal/abnormal growth into senescence. Once thought to be dormant and innocuous, the adipocyte is emerging as a dynamic and influential cell and research will continue to identify complex physiologic regulation of processes involved in adipose depot physiology.",

The nature of this relationship i.e., cause and effect or consequence has not been clearly determined. We provide evidence that elevated mitochondrial ROS generated by adipocytes from mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) represents an adaptive mechanism that precipitates fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitochondrial uncoupling in an effort to defend against weight gain. Consistent with that, mice with adipocyte-specific deletion of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) exhibit increased adipocyte superoxide generation and are protected from weight gain and insulin resistance which otherwise develops in wild-type (WT) mice that consume an obesogenic diet. The defense mechanism displayed by MnSOD-deficiency in fat cells appears to be mediated by a dual effect of ROS on inefficient substrate oxidation through uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. The aim of this commentary is to summarize and contextualize additional evidence supporting the importance of mitochondrial ROS in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and the modulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression and activation in both white and brown adipocytes.",

In this study, we showed that CD44+CD90+ MSCs express adipogenic transcription factors in the AAA wall of a hypoperfusion-induced AAA model.

Adipocyte formation was assessed by Oil Red staining. Serum triglyceride, cholesterol, and desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) were quantified by ELISA. Visceral fat was detected by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Results MGP is highly expressed in visceral fat. MGP expression is induced during preadipocyte differentiation. Knockout of MGP leads to retardation of 3T3-L1 differentiation. Intracellular triglyceride amount is impaired while glycerol release is increased in MGP-depleted cells. Serum dp-ucMGP level is significantly increased in individual with higher visceral fat index (VFI) and waist height ratio (WHtR), but not body mass index (BMI). Additionally, dp-ucMGP positively correlates to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level. Conclusions MGP is involved in fat metabolism and serum inactive MGP level is associated with visceral fat.

To investigate the effects of BAT transplantation on liver lipid metabolism in diabetic mice, we transplanted BAT from male donor mice into diabetic mice induced by streptozotocin (STZ) combined with high-fat diet (HFD). At 10 weeks after transplantation, BAT transplantation significantly decreased the blood glucose and lipid, downregulated FAS, CD36, Scd1, ACCα, NOX2, NOX4, TGF-β1, FN and COL-1, up-regulated Nrf2, reversed the pathological changes of liver and increased the circulating miR-99a in diabetic mice.

But the regulatory mechanism of MCP-1 expression in adipocytes is not well defined. Our results demonstrated that TNF-α induced abundant MCP-1 production in adipocytes, including 3T3-L1 pre- (≈ 9 to 18-fold), mature adipocytes (≈ 4 to 6-fold), and primary adipocytes(< 2-fold), among which 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes showed the best reactiveness. Thus, 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were used for the most of following experiments. At the transcriptional level, TNF-α (20 ng/mL) also promoted the mRNA expression of MCP-1. It is well recognized that the engagement of TNF-α with its receptor can trigger both NF-κB and AP-1 signalling, which was also confirmed in our study (5-fold and 2-fold). Unexpectedly and counterintuitively, multiple NF-κB inhibitors with different mechanisms failed to suppress TNF-α-induced MCP-1 production, but rather the inhibitors for any one of MAPKs (JNK, ERK and p38) could do. This study, for the first time, reveals that MAPKs/AP-1 but not NF-κB signalling is responsible for MCP-1 production in TNF-α-activated adipocytes.

    "abstract": "Obesity is a major global health issue that contributes to the occurrence of metabolic disorders. Based on this fact, understanding the underlying mechanisms and to uncover promising therapeutic approaches for obesity have attracted intense investigation. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) can help burns excess calories. Therefore, promoting White adipose tissue (WAT) browning and BAT activation is an attractive strategy for obesity treatment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs, which are involved in regulation of adipogenic processes and metabolic functions. Evidence is accumulating that miRNAs are important regulators for both brown adipocyte differentiation and white adipocyte browning. Here we report that the expression of miR-669a-5p increases during the adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 and C3H10T1/2 adipocytes. miR-669a-5p supplementation promotes adipogenic differentiation and causes browning of 3T3-L1 and C3H10T1/2 cells. Moreover, the expression of miR-669a-5p is upregulated in iWAT of mice exposed to cold. These data demonstrate that miR-669a-5p plays a role in regulating adipocyte differentiation and fat browning.Abbreviations: Acadl: long-chain acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase; Acadm: medium-chain acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase; Acadvl: very long-chain acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, very long chain; Aco2: mitochondrial aconitase 2; BAT: brown adipose tissue; Bmper: BMP-binding endothelial regulator; Cpt1-b:carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b; Cpt2: carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2; Crat: carnitine acetyltransferase; Cs: citrate synthase; C2MC: Chromosome 2 miRNA cluster; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; eWAT: epididymal white adipose tissue; ETC: electron transport chain; FAO: fatty acid oxidation; Fabp4:fatty acid binding protein 4; FBS: fetal bovine serum; Hadha: hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme complex subunit alpha; Hadhb: hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme complex subunit beta; HFD: high fat diet; Idh3a: isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 alpha; iWAT: inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue; Lpl: lipoprotein lipase; Mdh2: malate dehydrogenase 2; NBCS: NewBorn Calf Serum; mt-Nd1: mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 1; Ndufb8:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8; Nrf1: nuclear respiratory factor 1; Pgc1α: peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha; Pgc1b: peroxisome proliferative activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 beta; Pparγ: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; Prdm16: PR domain containing 16; Rgs4: regulator of G-protein signaling 4; Sdhb: succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit B; Sdhc: succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit C; Sdhd: succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit D; Sh3d21: SH3 domain containing 21; Sfmbt2: Scm-like with four mbt domains 2; TG: triglyceride; TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle; Tfam: transcription factor A, mitochondrial; TMRE: tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester; Ucp1: uncoupling protein 1; Uqcrc2: ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase core protein 2; WAT: White adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "White adipose tissue wasting plays a critical role in the development and progression of cancer cachexia. However, the mechanism behind the loss of adipose tissue remains ill-defined. In this study, we found that cancer cell-derived exosomes highly expressed miR-425-3p. Administration of cancer cell-derived exosomes significantly inhibited proliferation and differentiation of human preadipocytes-viscereal (HPA-v) cells. In mature adipocytes, cancer cell-derived exosomes activated cAMP/PKA signalling and lipophagy, leading to adipocyte lipolysis and browning of white adipocytes. These exosomes-induced alterations were almost abolished by endocytosis inhibitor cytochalasin D (CytoD) and antagomiR-425-3p, or reproduced by miR-425-3p mimics. In addition, bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-425-3p directly targeted proliferation-related genes such as GATA2, IGFBP4, MMP15, differentiation-related gene CEBPA, and phosphodiesterase 4B gene (PDE4B). Depletion of PDE4B enhanced cAMP/PKA signalling and lipophagy, but had no effects on HPA-v proliferation and differentiation. Taken together, these results suggested that cancer cell-derived exosomal miR-425-3p inhibited preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation, increased adipocyte lipolysis, and promoted browning of white adipocytes, all of which might contribute to adipocyte atrophy and ultimately the loss of adipose tissue in cancer cachexia.Abbreviations: ADPN: adiponectin; aP2: adipocyte protein 2 or fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4); BCA: bicinchoninic acid assay; BFA: bafilomycin A1; BMI: body mass index; C/EBP: CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; CEBPA: CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha; C-Exo: cancer cell-derived exosomes; CNTL: control; CREB: cAMP-response element binding protein; CytoD: cytochalasin D; ECL: chemiluminescence; GATA2: GATA Binding Protein 2; HFD: high fat diet; HSL: hormone-sensitive lipase; IGFBP4: insulin like growth factor binding protein 4; IRS-1: insulin receptor substrate-1; ISO: isoproterenol hydrochloride; KD: knockdown; KO: knock out; LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3; LMF: lipid mobilizing factor; LPL: lipoprotein lipase; MMP15: matrix metallopeptidase 15; Mir-Inh-C-Exo: cancer cell-derived exosomes with miR-425-3p inhibition; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; Mut: mutant; N-Exo: normal cell-derived exosomes; NSCLC: non-small cell lung cancer; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; PGC-1: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1; PDEs: phosphodiesterases; PKI: PKA inhibitor; PKA: cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PLIN1: Perilipin 1; PTHRP: parathyroid hormone-related protein; PVDF: polyvinylidene difluoride; shRNA: short hairpin RNA; UCP1: uncoupling protein 1; WT: wild type.",

    "abstract": "Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) is an endogenous substance in redox reactions and regulates various functions in metabolism. NAD and its precursors are known for their anti-ageing and anti-obesity properties and are mainly active in the liver and muscle. Boosting NAD+ through supplementation with the precursors, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or nicotinamide riboside (NR), enhances insulin sensitivity and circadian rhythm in the liver, and improves mitochondrial function in the muscle. Recent evidence has revealed that the adipose tissue could be another direct target of NAD supplementation by attenuating inflammation and fat accumulation. Moreover, murine studies with genetically modified models demonstrated that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), a NAD regulatory enzyme that synthesizes NMN, played a critical role in lipogenesis and lipolysis in an adipocyte-specific manner. The tissue-specific effects of NAD+ metabolic pathways indicate a potential of the NAD precursors to control metabolic stress particularly via focusing on adipose tissue. Therefore, this narrative review raises an importance of NAD metabolism in white adipose tissue (WAT) through a variety of studies using different mouse models.",

We examined gene expression profiles in 8 women with metabolic syndrome and 7 healthy, normal body weight women. A total of 143 SP-DEGs were screened, including 83 upregulated genes and 60 downregulated genes. GO analyses of these SP-DEGs included proteolysis, angiogenesis, positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, immune response, protein processing, positive regulation of neuroblast proliferation, cell adhesion and ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport. KEGG pathway analysis of the SP-DEGs were involved in the TGF-beta signalling pathway, cytokine‒cytokine receptor interactions, the hippo signalling pathway, Malaria. Two modules were identified from the PPI network, namely, Module 1 (DNMT1, KDM1A, NCoR1, and E2F1) and Module 2 (IL-7 R, IL-12A, and CSF3). The gene DNMT1 was shared between the network modules and the WGCNA brown module. According to the single-gene GSEA results, DNMT1 was significantly positively correlated with histidine metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism. This study identified 7 key SP-DEGs in adipose tissue. DNMT1 was selected as the central gene in the development of metabolic syndrome and might be a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "CXCR7, an alternative receptor for the inflammatory chemokine SDF-1, is involved in cell proliferation and migration. Recent studies have reported that CXCR7 also plays a role in adipose tissue. However, evidence regarding the role of CXCR7 and its ligands in adipocyte differentiation is limited. In this study, we aimed to elucidate changes in CXCR7 expression during adipocyte differentiation and the role of the SDF-1/CXCR7/CXCR4 axis in adipogenesis using recombinant SDF-1, the CXCR7 ligand CCX771, and small interfering RNAs. The results indicated that the levels of SDF-1 and its receptors, CXCR7 and CXCR4, decreased during the early stages of adipogenesis. Treatment with recombinant SDF-1 and CCX771 inhibited adipogenesis and lipid accumulation by inducing β-arrestin2, Wnt expression, and AKT phosphorylation and downregulating C/EBPα, PPARγ, and FABP4 expression. In contrast, knockdown of SDF-1 and CXCR7 in preadipocytes downregulated the β-arrestin2/Wnt and AKT pathway, leading to the induction of adipogenesis. Meanwhile, knockdown of CXCR4 had no significant effect. In mice, basal gene expression levels of SDF-1 and CXCR7 were higher in the stromal vascular fraction compared to mature adipocytes and were significantly upregulated by a high-fat diet. Our results provide new insights into the local role of the SDF-1-CXCR7 axis in adipocytes and offer additional benefits for the prevention of obesity-related metabolic disorders.",

A retrospective study of 151 PCa patients (October 2010-November 2022) was conducted. Radiomic features were extracted from axial T2-weighted MRI of PPAT, and normalized PPAT was calculated as the ratio of PPAT volume to prostate volume. A radiomics score (Radscore) was developed using logistic regression with 16 features selected via LASSO regression. Independent predictors identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to construct a nomogram. Predictive performance was assessed using ROC curves, and internal validation involved 1000 bootstrapped iterations. The Radscore, based on 16 features, showed significant association with BM and outperformed normalized PPAT in predictive value. Independent predictors of BM included Radscore, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and clinical N stage (cN). A nomogram integrating these factors demonstrated strong discrimination (C-index: 0.908; 95% CI: 0.851-0.966) and calibration, with consistent results in validation (C-index: 0.903; 95% CI: 0.897-0.916). Decision curve analysis confirmed its clinical utility. Radscore, cN, and ALP were identified as independent BM predictors.

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue (AT) hypoxia occurs in obese humans and mice. Acute hypoxia in adipocytes causes dysregulation of adipokine secretion with an increase in inflammatory factors and diminished adiponectin release. O2 levels in humans range between 3 and 11% revealing that conventional in vitro culturing at ambient air and acute hypoxia treatment (1% O2) are performed under non-physiological conditions. In this study, we mimicked physiological conditions by differentiating human primary adipocytes under 10% or 5% O2 in comparison to 21% O2. Induction of differentiation markers was comparable between all three conditions. Adipokine release by adipocytes differentiated at lower oxygen levels was altered, with a marked upregulation of adiponectin, IL-6 and DPP4 secretion, and reduced leptin levels compared with adipocytes differentiated at 21% O2. Isoproterenol-induced lipolysis was significantly elevated in adipocytes differentiated at 10% and 5% compared with 21% O2. This effect was accompanied by increased protein expression of β-1 and -2 adrenergic receptor, HSL and perilipin. Conditioned medium (CM) of adipocytes differentiated at the three different conditions was generated for stimulation of human skeletal muscle cells (SkMC) or smooth muscle cells (SMC). CM-induced insulin resistance in SkMC was comparable for the different CMs. However, the SMC proliferative effect of CM from adipocytes differentiated at 10% O2 was significantly reduced compared with 21% O2. This study demonstrates that oxygen levels during adipogenesis are important factors altering adipocyte functionality such as adipokine release, in particular adiponectin secretion, as well as the hormone-induced lipolytic pathway.",

We confirmed that FOSL2 is an important regulator of LEP gene expression in vitro and in vivo using cell culture models and genetic mouse models. In this commentary, we discuss the transcriptional regulation of LEP gene expression, our strategy to identify an adipocyte-specific cis-regulatory element and the transcription factor(s) responsible for LEP gene expression.

Obesity is a consequence of both adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Knowledge about preadipocyte differentiation is relatively well established, whereas the mechanism responsible for preadipocyte proliferation is incompletely understood and only in the early stage of comprehension. In this regard, we have recently identified that Delta-like 1 homolog (Dlk1) (also known as Preadipocyte factor 1 [Pref-1]) inhibits preadipocyte proliferation by regulating their entry into G1/S-phase. This novel disclosure, adding to the previous published data on Dlk1 repression of preadipocyte differentiation, has given us the chance to firmly place Dlk1 as a master regulator of preadipocyte homeostasis and adipose tissue expansion. Dlk1 manipulation may, therefore, open new perspectives in obesity treatments.",

The obesogenic effect of OX-deletion is due to brown adipose tissue (BAT) dysfunction, a defect that originates during fetal growth. Brown preadipocytes in OX-null mice display undifferentiated histological appearance and fail to support both diet- and cold-induced thermogenesis. We show that the OXR1-null mice phenocopies the differentiation defect observed in the ligand-null mice indicating that OXR1 relays OX's differentiation and thermogenic function. Consistent with this, OX fails to induce differentiation in cultured OXR1-null preadipocytes.

We also determined UCP2's association with adiponectin and insulin resistance with different parameters of the metabolic syndrome.Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and omental adipose tissues (OAT) were obtained from 69 subjects, including 23 non-obese controls, 26 obese and 20 obese T2DM patients. Metabolic syndrome and other clinical features were studied. Adiponectin and UCP2 gene expression was quantitated by Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).UCP2 gene expression was significantly reduced in obese and diabetic patients compared with controls. Interestingly, we found that UCP2 gene expression was reduced more in omental fat compared with subcutaneous fat and this effect was observed only in males but not in females. Partial correlation analysis showed significant association with the obesity parameters waist circumference, insulin and HOMA-IR, the lipid parameter triglyceride and the adipokine adiponectin.Reduced UCP2 gene expression in obese and diabetic patients and its association with obesity parameters and HOMA-IR confirms its role as a candidate gene in the study of obesity and diabetes in our population. Also, its association with triglycerides implicates its role in lipid metabolism. An association between adiponectin and UCP2 gene expression may provide us with an innovative therapeutic strategy to prevent obesity related diseases, like diabetes and CVD.",

    "abstract": "The formation of new adipocytes from precursor cells is a crucial aspect of normal adipose tissue function. During the adipogenic process, adipocytes differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells give rise to two main types of fat: white adipose tissue (WAT) characterized by the presence of adipocytes containing large unilocular lipid droplets, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) composed by multilocular brown adipocytes packed with mitochondria. WAT is not only important for energy storage but also as an endocrine organ regulating whole body homeostasis by secreting adipokines and other mediators, which directly impact metabolic functions in obesity. By contrast, BAT is specialized in dissipating energy in form of heat and has salutary effects in combating obesity and associated disorders. Unfortunately, WAT is the predominant fat type, whereas BAT is scarce and located in discrete pockets in adult humans. Luckily, another type of brown adipocytes, called beige or brite (brown-in-white) adipocytes, with similar functions to those of \"classical\" brown adipocytes has recently been identified in WAT. In this review, a close look is given into the role of bioactive lipid mediators in the regulation of adipogenesis, with a special emphasis on the role of the microsomal prostaglandin E (PGE) synthase-1, a terminal enzyme in PGE2 biosynthesis, as a key regulator of white-to-brown adipogenesis in WAT.",

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a key mediator of the insulin transduction pathway whose expression is significantly enhanced during adipocyte differentiation. In this work, we studied the effects of high glucose concentration on the regulation of Cav-1 expression and activation and its relation to the insulin signaling pathway during the adipogenic process and in long-term differentiated adipocytes. Both, long-term high glucose exposure during adipogenesis and short-term glucose incubation of mature adipocytes, promoted triglyceride accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. The short-term exposure of mature adipocytes to high glucose significantly reduced the sensitivity to insulin of Cav-1, insulin receptor (IR) and potein kinase B (AKT-2) phosphorylation, as well as insulin-induced deoxyglucose uptake. Adipocytes differentiated in the presence of high glucose lost Cav-1 and IR response to insulin-stimulated phosphorylation, but maintained the insulin sensitivity of AKT-2 phosphorylation and deoxyglucose uptake. Although long-term high glucose exposure increased DNA methylation in Cav-1 promoter, Cav-1 expression was not affected. Moreover, these cells showed an increase of Cav-1, IR and AKT-2 protein content, pointing to an adaptive response induced by the long-term high glucose exposure.",

    "abstract": "Visceral adiposity is associated with type-2-diabetes, inflammation, dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), whereas subcutaneous adiposity is not. We hypothesized that the link between visceral adiposity and liver pathophysiology involves inherent or diet-derived differences between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue to store and mobilize saturated fatty acids. The goal of the present study was to characterize the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue triglyceride and portal vein fatty acids in relation to indices of liver dysregulation. For 8 weeks rats had free access to control (CON; 12.9% corn/safflower oil; 3.6 Kcal/g), high saturated fat (SAT; 45.2% cocoa butter; 4.5 Kcal/g) or high polyunsaturated fat (PUFA; 45.2% safflower oil; 4.5 Kcal/g) diets. Outcome measures included glucose tolerance, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue triglyceride, liver phospholipids and plasma (portal and systemic) free fatty acid composition, indices of inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver and adipose tissue depots and circulating adipo/cytokines. Hepatic triglycerides were significantly increased in both high fat diet groups compared to control and were significantly higher in PUFA compared to SAT. Although glucose tolerance was not different among diet groups, SAT increased markers of inflammation and ER stress in the liver and both adipose tissue depots. Fatty acid composition did not differ among adipose depots or portal blood in any dietary group. Overall, these data suggest that diets enriched in saturated fatty acids are associated with liver inflammation, ER stress and injury, but that any link between visceral adipose tissue and these liver indices does not involve selective changes to fatty acid composition in this depot or the portal vein.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to identify genes exhibiting concomitant obesity-dependent changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in adipose tissues in the mouse using diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J and genetically obese ob/ob mice as models. Mature adipocytes were isolated from epididymal and inguinal adipose tissues of ob/ob and DIO C57BL/6J mice. DNA methylation was analyzed by MeDIP-sequencing and gene expression by microarray analysis. The majority of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were hypomethylated in obese mice. Global methylation of long interspersed elements indicated that hypomethylation did not reflect methyl donor deficiency. In both DIO and ob/ob mice, we observed more obesity-associated methylation changes in epididymal than in inguinal adipocytes. Assignment of DMRs to promoter, exon, intron and intergenic regions demonstrated that DIO-induced changes in DNA methylation in C57BL/6J mice occurred primarily in exons, whereas inguinal adipocytes of ob/ob mice exhibited a higher enrichment of DMRs in promoter regions than in other regions of the genome, suggesting an influence of leptin on DNA methylation in inguinal adipocytes. We observed altered methylation and expression of 9 genes in epididymal adipocytes, including the known obesity-associated genes, Ehd2 and Kctd15, and a novel candidate gene, Irf8, possibly involved in immune type 1/type2 balance. The use of 2 obesity models enabled us to dissociate changes associated with high fat feeding from those associated with obesity per se. This information will be of value in future studies on the mechanisms governing the development of obesity and changes in adipocyte function associated with obesity.",

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that chronic, low level treatment with this CO-RM can reverse established obesity via a mechanism independent of food intake. Dietary induced obese mice were treated with CORM-A1, the inactive compound iCORM-A1, or saline every 48 hours for 30 weeks while maintained on a high fat (60%) diet. Chronic treatment with CORM-A1 resulted in a 33% decrease from initial body weight over the 30 week treatment period while treatment with iCORM and saline were associated with 18 and 25% gain in initial body weight over the same time frame. Chronic treatment with CORM-A1 did not affect food intake or activity but resulted in a significant increase in metabolism. CORM-A1 treatment also resulted in lower fasting blood glucose, improvement in insulin sensitivity and decreased heptatic steatosis. Chronic treatment with CO releasing molecules can reverse dietary induced obesity and normalize insulin resistance independent of changes in food intake or activity. These findings are likely though a mechanism which increases metabolism.",

Methods: Abdominal adipose tissue areas and radiologic attenuation were assessed using 4 CT images in 241 women (age: 47 years, BMI: 26.5 kg/m2). Fat cell weight was measured in paired VAT and SAT samples. Fasting plasma lipids, glucose and insulin levels were measured. Results: Adipose tissue attenuation was negatively correlated with SAT (r=-0.46) and VAT (r=-0.67) fat cell weight in the corresponding depot (p<0.0001 for both). Women with visceral adipocyte hypertrophy had higher total-, VLDL-, LDL- and HDL-triglyceride and apoB levels as well as a higher cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio, fasting glucose and insulin levels compared to women with smaller visceral adipocytes. Adjustment for VAT area minimized these differences while subsequent adjustment for attenuation eliminated all differences, with the exception of fasting glycaemia. In SAT, adjustment for VAT area and attenuation eliminated all adipocyte hypertrophy-related alterations except for fasting hyperglycaemia. Conclusion: CT-derived adipose tissue attenuation and area both contribute to explain variation in the cardiometabolic risk profile associated with the same biological parameter: visceral fat cell hypertrophy.",

In addition to vascular disruption, bone loss and increased marrow adiposity have become hallmarks of the diabetic bone phenotype. Emerging evidence now implicates enhanced marrow adipogenesis and changes to cellular makeup of the marrow in a novel mechanistic link between various secondary complications of diabetes.

In this study, we identify a role for habitual physical activity in the prevention of adipose tissue inflammation induced by a model of sepsis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old) were housed with access to voluntary wheel running (VWR) or sedentary (SED) for 10 weeks. Mice were then injected with LPS (2 mg/kg) or saline (SAL), and tissues were removed 6 hours post-injection. VWR attenuated body, epididymal adipose tissue (eWAT), and subcutaneous inguinal adipose tissue (iWAT) mass gain, improved glucose tolerance, increased markers of mitochondrial biogenesis in iWAT and eWAT, and increased UCP-1 protein content in iWAT. In iWAT, VWR attenuated the LPS induced increase in mRNA expression of TNF-α, MCP-1, and follistatin, along with phosphorylation of STAT3. In addition, VWR had a main effect for reducing iWAT mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and SOCS3. In eWAT, VWR had a main effect for reducing mRNA expression of IL-1β, MCP-1, IL-6, and follistatin. Further, VWR increased SOCS3 mRNA expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 in SAL mice, thus the relative change in response to LPS for these markers was attenuated. The protective effect of prior physical activity occurred in conjunction with increases in the protein content of a component of the LPS binding complex, MyD88. Overall, the results from this study demonstrate that habitual physical activity can attenuate the LPS induced inflammatory response in adipose tissue and this occurs to a greater extent in iWAT compare with eWAT.",

Compared to other lipophilic dyes, Nile Red uptake effectively distinguished adipocyte populations. Nile Red fluorescence increased with adipocyte size and granularity and could be combined with MitoTracker® Deep Red or fluorescent antibody labeling to further dissect adipose populations. Epicardial adipocytes exhibited the least mitochondrial membrane depolarization and highest fatty-acid translocase CD36 surface expression. In contrast, brown adipocytes showed low surface CD36 expression. Pregnancy resulted in reduced mitochondrial membrane depolarisation and increased CD36 surface expression in brown and epicardial adipocyte populations respectively.

Woodbury's Chemical induction was implemented with modifications to achieve neural transdifferentiation. In Group I, ADSCs were preinduced with β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) and later, with neural induction medium (NIM). In Group II, ADSCs were directly treated with NIM. In Group III, a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5-azacytidine was applied to understand whether transdifferentiation is controlled by epigenetic marks. Irrespective of the presence of (β-ME), the differentiation protocol resulted in glial-lineage cells. Group III produced poorly -differentiated neural cells with neuron-specific enolase positivity. A neuroprogenitor stage (NPC) was identified at d 11 after induction only in Group I. In other groups, this stage was not morphologically distinct. We explored the stage-specific incidence NPC, by alternatively treating them with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and antioxidants to validate if different signalling could cause varied outcomes (Group IV). They differentiated into neurons, as defined by cell polarity and expression of specific proteins. Meanwhile, neuroprogenitors exposed to NIM (Group I) produced glial-lineage cells. Further refinement and study of the occurrence and terminal differentiation of neuroprogenitors would identify a promising source for neural tissue replacement.",

AdipoGauge includes analysing tools that are capable of cell counting and colour separation. Furthermore, it can quantify the cell data in images both with and without clear boundaries around the cells. It can also remove objects from the image that are not intended for analysis, such as blood vessels or partial cells at edges of slide sections.

We aimed to identify miRNAs which are involved in the regulation of human adipogenesis and searched for their molecular targets. Applying microarray-analysis we identified miR125b-5p as upregulated during human adipocyte differentiation, although its role during adipogenesis is unknown. We identified and characterized the matrix metalloproteinase 11 (MMP11) as a direct target of miR125b-5p by showing that miR125b-5p overexpression significantly reduces MMP11 luciferase activity and mutation of any single binding site was sufficient to abolish the miR125b-5p mediated inhibition of luciferase activity. MMP11 overexpression decreased fat accumulation, indicating that MMP11 acts as an anti-adipogenic regulator. In contrast, overexpression of miR125b-5p itself reduced adipogenesis. In summary, we identified miR125b-5p as upregulated during human adipogenesis indicating that miR125b-5p may serve as a regulator of human adipocyte differentiation. We further show that miR125b-5p downregulates the anti-adipogenic MMP11, but directly inhibits adipogenesis itself. Taken together, these data implicate that miR125b-5p can affect human adipogenesis via MMP11 and probably additional targets.",

Results revealed an obvious aggravation of the histological morphology of IVDD in the visfatin group.

Interestingly, the signature also showed good performance in diagnosing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (AUC was 0.834 and 0.800, respectively). The number of neutrophils, macrophages M2, macrophages M0 and dendritic cells activated decreased significantly. After BS, the infiltration of T cells regulatory, monocytes, mast cells resting and plasma cells in adipose tissue increased. The novel proposed IRGs signature reveals the underlying immune mechanism of BS and is a promising biomarker for distinguishing the severity of NAFLD. This will provide new insights into strategies for treating obesity and NAFLD.",

This has led to an intense interest in the development of CR-mimetics to harness the beneficial effects of CR to treat aging-related diseases. One CR-mimetic that has received a great deal of attention is resveratrol. Resveratrol extends the lifespan of obese mice and protects against obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes. The specific mechanism of resveratrol action has been difficult to elucidate because resveratrol has a promiscuous target profile. A recent finding indicates that the metabolic effects of resveratrol may result from competitive inhibition of cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which increases cAMP levels. The cAMP-dependent pathways activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is essential for the metabolic effects of resveratrol. Inhibiting PDE4 with rolipram reproduces all of the metabolic benefits of resveratrol, including protection against diet-induced obesity and an increase in mitochondrial function, physical stamina and glucose tolerance in mice. This discovery suggests that PDE inhibitors may be useful for treating metabolic diseases associated with aging.",

However, the lipolytic machinery dictating TAG hydrolysis varies greatly among different cell types. Within the adipocyte, TAG hydrolysis is dynamically regulated by hormones to ensure appropriate metabolic adaptation to nutritional and physiologic cues. In other cell types such as hepatocytes, myocytes and macrophages, mobilization of stored TAG is regulated quite differently. Within the last decade, mutations in two key genes involved in TAG hydrolysis, α-β hydrolase domain 5 (ABHD5/CGI-58) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL/PNPLA2), were found to cause two distinct neutral lipid storage diseases (NLSD) in humans. These genetic links, along with supporting evidence in mouse models, have prompted a number of studies surrounding the biochemical function(s) of these proteins. Although both CGI-58 and ATGL have been clearly implicated in TAG hydrolysis in multiple tissues and have even been shown to physically interact with each other, recent evidence suggests that they may also have distinct roles. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most recent insights into how CGI-58 and ATGL regulate lipid metabolism and signaling.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global problem and effective drug therapy treatment is still unavailable. Obesity develops due to an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure (EE). Understanding what happens to EE in obesity may be the key to developing new treatments for obesity. If EE in obesity can be elevated, it could be a potential therapeutic target. We recently discovered that in baseline conditions obese mice have increased EE, in terms of thermogenesis. However, this increase in EE is not great enough to offset the elevated calorie intake that leads to the development of obesity. In obesity, the adipose derived hormone leptin is significantly elevated. This elevated leptin concentration appears to cause an increase in thermogenesis through increased sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) to brown adipose tissue deposits. The brain region of the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) appears to be a key region that leptin activates in obesity to cause this increased thermogenesis. One unsettling finding is that the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in obesity is elevated via leptin and it seems unlikely that SNA would be selectivity increased to only brown adipose tissue. Previously, it has been observed that leptin can increase SNA to numerous organs including the kidney. Furthermore, in obesity, SNA is increased in numerous organs. This leads to the critical question: is the leptin-mediated elevation of SNA and thermogenesis also chronically activating the kidney and contributing to the development of hypertension in obesity?",

A number of cell types of the innate and adaptive immune systems have been implicated in this process. Recent studies have focused on the role of natural killer T (NKT) cells, a subset of T lymphocytes that react with lipids, in the development of obesity-associated diseases. These studies have shown that invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, a population of NKT cells expressing a semi-invariant T cell receptor, become rapidly activated in response to lipid excess, and that these cells influence the capacity of other leukocytes to produce cytokines during the progression of obesity. The role of NKT cells in obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance has been investigated using NKT cell-deficient animals, adoptive transfer of NKT cells and an iNKT cell agonist. While divergent results have been obtained, it is now clear that NKT cells can modulate the inflammatory milieu in obesity, suggesting that these cells could be targeted for therapeutic intervention in obesity-associated diseases.",

We reassessed its cellular distribution using the fat droplet marker CGI-58 in OP9 and 3T3-L1 adipocyte lines and in brown adipose tissue (BAT). As expected, we found perilipin 1 in the fat droplet-enriched floating fraction from centrifuged adipocyte or BAT homogenates. However, about half of perilipin 1 was suspended in the cytosol/infranate or pelleted with cellular membranes. In these fractionations, most of the fat droplet-associated protein CGI-58 was in the floating fraction. In BAT and OP9 adipocytes about a third of perilipin 1 pellets, compared with a much smaller fraction of CGI-58. Co-imaging perilipin 1 and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers reveals both ER and fat droplet associated perilipin 1 in OP9 adipocytes. Consistent with these observations, perilipin 1 overexpressed in COS7 cells mostly fractionates with cellular membranes and imaging shows it on the ER. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes almost half of perilipin 1 floats, half is suspended as infranate and small amounts pellet. Finally, driving rapid fat droplet synthesis in OP9 adipocytes increases the intensity of perilipin 1 on fat droplets, while decreasing non-fat droplet immunolabeling. Confirming the morphological findings, fractionation shows perilipin 1 moving from the pelleted to the floated fractions. In conclusion, this study documents an expanded intracellular distribution for perilipin 1 and its movement from ER to fat droplet during lipid synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in most of the western world. With obesity comes a variety of adverse health effects such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis. It has become clear that a state of low grade chronic inflammation, typically associated with obesity, and characterized by macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue (AT) and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, plays a crucial role in the development of insulin resistance. The pathogenic mechanisms resulting in AT macrophage recruitment are under intense investigation and remain incompletely understood. We recently demonstrated that lysosomal permeabilization, and subsequent Cathepsin B (CTSB) activation, occurs at the early stages of high fat diet induced weight gain and is preceded by macrophage infiltration into hypertrophied AT resulting in adipocyte cell death through mitochondrial dysfunction. In this report, we demonstrated that another key Cathepsin, Cathepsin D (CTSD), is also activated at the early stages of weight gain. In addition, activated CTSD induced proapoptotic protein activation. In conclusion, our data identify lysosomal CTSD as a potential key mediator of adipocyte cell death during weight gain and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue development is dependent on multiple signaling mechanisms and cell-cell interactions that regulate adipogenesis, angiogenesis and extracellular remodeling. The Notch signaling pathway is an important cell-fate determinant whose role in adipogenesis is not clearly defined. To address this issue, we examined the effect of inhibition of Notch signaling by soluble-Jagged1 in the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte line. In vitro, soluble-Jagged1 expression in 3T3-L1 cells altered cell morphology, increased the rate of cell proliferation and induced an early transcriptional response to differentiation stimuli. However, these cells did not form mature adipocytes due to their inability to exit the cell-cycle in response to serum-starvation and glucocorticoid-induced cell-cycle arrest. In contrast, subcutaneous allografts of soluble-Jagged1 cells formed larger fat pads containing lipid-filled adipocytes with improved neovascularization compared with controls. Since adipogenesis is tightly associated with angiogenesis, we evaluated the influence of soluble-Jagged1 on endothelial cells by culturing them in cell-free conditioned media from preadipocytes. Soluble Jagged1-mediated inhibition of Notch signaling increased levels of secreted cytokines, potentially contributing to the improved cell growth and proliferation observed in these cultures. Our findings demonstrate an initial requirement of Notch signaling inactivation for preadipocyte cell commitment and support the hypothesis that cell-to-cell crosstalk between the preadipocytes and endothelial cells is required for neovascularization and remodeling of the tissue to promote hyperplasia and hypertrophy of differentiating adipocytes.",

However, technical challenges have hindered detection of this adipocyte population by certain other laboratories. These disparate results highlight the need for sensitive and definitive techniques to identify bone marrow progenitor (BMP)-derived adipocytes. In these studies we exploited new models and methods to enhance detection of this adipocyte population. Here we showed that confocal microscopy with spectrum acquisition could effectively identify green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive BMP-derived adipocytes by matching their fluorescence spectrum to that of native GFP. Likewise, imaging flow cytometry made it possible to visualize intact unilocular and multilocular GFP-positive BMP-derived adipocytes and distinguished them from non-fluorescent adipocytes and cell debris in the cytometer flow stream. We also devised a strategy to detect marker genes in flow-enriched adipocytes from which stromal cells were excluded. This technique also proved to be an efficient means for detecting genetically labeled adipocytes and should be applicable to models in which marker gene expression is low or absent. Finally, in vivo imaging of mice transplanted with BM from adipocyte-targeted luciferase donors showed a time-dependent increase in luciferase activity, with the bulk of luciferase activity confined to adipocytes rather than stromal cells. These results confirmed and extended our previous reports and provided proof-of-principle for sensitive techniques and models for detection and study of these unique cells.",

CD24 is a glycophosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface receptor that has been identified as a critical cell surface marker for identifying pre-adipocytes that are able to reconstitute white adipose tissue (WAT) in vivo. Here, we examined the role and regulation of CD24 during adipogenesis in vitro. We found that CD24 mRNA and protein expression is upregulated early during adipogenesis in the 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and in murine primary pre-adipocytes isolated from subcutaneous and visceral WAT, followed by downregulation in mature adipocytes. CD24 mRNA expression was found to be dependent on increased transcription due to increased promoter activity in response to activation of a pre-existing transcriptional regulator. Furthermore, either intracellular cAMP or dexamethasone were sufficient to increase expression in pre-adipocytes, while both additively increased CD24 expression. Preventing the increase in CD24 expression, by siRNA-mediated knock-down, resulted in fewer mature lipid-laden adipocytes and decreased expression of mature adipogenic genes. Therefore, conditions experienced during adipogenesis in vitro are sufficient to increase CD24 expression, which is necessary for differentiation. Overall, we conclude that the dynamic upregulation of CD24 actively promotes adipogenesis in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies initially demonstrated that maternal undernutrition leads to low birth weight with increased risk of adult-onset obesity. Maternal obesity and diabetes associated with high birth weight, excessive nutrition in neonates, and rapid catch-up growth also predispose offspring to fat accumulation. As stated by the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease concept, nutrient supply perturbations in the fetus or neonate result in long-term programming of individual body weight set-point. Adipose tissue is a key fuel storage unit mainly involved in the maintenance of energy homeostasis. Studies in numerous animal models have demonstrated that the adipose tissue is the focus of developmental programming events in a gender- and depot-specific manner. This review summarizes the impact of maternal nutritional manipulations on cellularity (i.e., cell number, size, and type) of adipose tissue in programmed offspring. In rodents, adipose tissue development is particularly active during the perinatal period, especially during the last week of gestation and during early postnatal life. In contrast to rodents, this process essentially takes place before birth in bigger mammals. Despite these different developmental time windows, altricial and precocial species share several mechanisms of adipose tissue programming. Maternal nutritional manipulations result in increased adipogenesis and modified fat distribution and composition. Inflammation changes such as infiltration of macrophages and increased inflammatory markers are also observed. Overall, it may predispose offspring to fat accumulation and obesity. Inappropriate hormone levels, modified tissue sensitivity, and epigenetic mechanisms are key factors involved in the programming of adipose tissue's cellularity during the perinatal period.",

We have previously reported that this complex cooperates with the essential lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor TLR4/MD-2 complex and plays a crucial role in LPS responses by B cells. Recent evidences suggest that TLRs can also recognize endogenous ligands and promote non-infectious chronic inflammation. For instance, TLR4/MD-2 can be ligated by adipose tissue-derived saturated free fatty acids (FAs) and induce adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Recently, we reported that RP105 knockout (KO) or MD-1 KO mice have less high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance than wild-type (WT) or TLR4 KO mice. As RP105/MD-1 is not involved in recognition of palmitic and stearic acids, which are endogenous ligands for TLR4/MD-2, we conclude that RP105/MD-1 is itself a key regulator of diet-induced chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, obesity and insulin resistance that appears to be independent of the TLR4-dependent pathway. In this mini-review, we will highlight the significance of the RP105/MD-1 complex in adipose tissue inflammation and discuss implications for human diseases.",

We also showed that visceral WAT is lined by a mesothelium and provided evidence that this structure is the source of adipocytes. Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that there is heterogeneity in the visceral progenitors, such that there are Wt1-expressing and non-expressing subsets, the relative proportions of which vary between depots. This raises the enticing prospect that the adipocytes arising from these progenitor subsets may have different properties and our preliminary data support this notion. Finally, evidence from our study and one from Spiegelman's group(2) suggests that Wt1 is not just a marker but regulates visceral WAT identity and the progenitor population.

Glycemic Control in diabetes patients is an important issue in minimizing diabetes related complications and deaths. Institution based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April, 2017. Glycated Hemoglobin A1c and biochemical profiles were determined using Huma Meter A1c and ABX PENTRA 400 clinical chemistry analyzer. Independent t-test to compare groups, bivariate and multi variable logistic regression analysis were used. A P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significance. A total of 336 study participants were enrolled in this study. Overall, 208(61.9%) of the study participants had poor glycemic control. The poor glycemic control was significantly higher in glucometer non-users 120(71.4%) compared to glucometer users 88(52.4%) (P < 0.001). Income, the number of visits, high-triglyceride, high low-density lipoprotein and non-glucometer use were significantly associated with the poor glycemic control.",

    "abstract": "The dietary constituent inorganic nitrate, found in large concentrations in green leafy vegetables, has beneficial effects on cardiometabolic health. Contemporary studies employing nitrate have demonstrated that the anion has anti-obesity and anti-diabetic properties; however the nitrate-mediated mechanisms for improving metabolic health remain unclear. Recently, we employed a combined histological, metabolomics, and transcriptional and protein analysis approach to establish that nitrate promoted the \"browning\" of white adipose tissue via the xanthine oxidoreductase catalyzed reductive nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway. Interestingly, it was observed that nitrate-stimulated brown adipose-associated gene expression in white adipose tissue was augmented in hypoxia. These findings not only suggest that protection from metabolic disease offered by vegetable consumption may, in part, be mediated through the effects of nitrate on white adipose tissue, but also, since hypoxia is a serious co-morbidity affecting adipose tissue in obese individuals, that nitrate may be effective in promoting the browning of adipose tissue to improve metabolic fitness.",

Adipose tissue is perhaps the least studied stromal cell \"compartment\" despite the fact that some tumors, particularly breast tumors, grow in close proximity to or physically interact with adipocytes. Apart from adipocytes and numerous blood vessels, adipose tissue harbors macrophages, which increase in proportion to adipose tissue mass. While circulating or bone marrow-derived macrophages play a well-defined role in tumor growth, it is less understood how resident adipose tissue-associated macrophages contribute to tumor progression. Here, we will review the role of adipose tissue in tumor growth and angiogenesis with emphasis on the specific functions of adipose tissue macrophages in these processes.",

    "abstract": "Most tumors are typified by a chronic, unresolved inflammatory response that potentiates angiogenesis and therefore enables tumor progression. We have determined that dysfunctional tumor-associated adipocytes contribute to tumor-associated inflammation. In three tumor models, tumor-associated adipose tissue was characterized by thin and fragile adipocyte membranes, necrosis, robust expression of the pro-inflammatory factor HMGB1, and loss of the lipid storage mediator, perilipin-1. By transmission electron microscopy, macrophages in tumor-associated adipose tissue contained lipid droplets and resembled foam cells, which are commonly observed in inflamed tissues. In vitro co-culture studies showed that tumor-associated adipose tissue conditioned-medium stimulated monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, adhesion, spreading, and lipid uptake. Compared with normal adipose tissue, tumor-associated adipose tissue secreted 3-fold higher levels of IL-6 and IL-6 was sufficient to stimulate macrophage differentiation and adhesion. These results suggest that, in tumors, loss of adipocyte specification, necrosis, and scavenging of adipocyte debris directly activates macrophages and contributes to tumor-associated inflammation. Thus, adipocyte dysfunction may facilitate tumor progression, especially in tumors closely aligned with adipose tissue, in particular, breast cancer.",

White adipose tissue, traditionally seen as a passive energy-storage organ, can be induced to take on certain characteristics of brown fat in a process called browning. The \"browned\" white adipose tissue, or beige fat, is a potential anti-obesity target. Various signaling pathways can enhance browning. Wnt is a key regulator of adipocyte biology, but its role in browning has not been explored. In this study, we found that in primary mouse adipocytes derived from the inguinal depot, Wnt inhibition by both chemical and genetic methods significantly enhanced browning.

There is now strong evidence that microbes resident in the human intestine can directly contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and associated cardiometabolic disorders. In fact, gut microbes represent a filter of our greatest environmental exposure – the foods we consume. It is now clear that we each experience a given meal differently, based on our unique gut microbial communities. Biologically active gut microbe-derived metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), are now uniquely recognized as contributors to obesity and related cardiometabolic disorders. However, mechanistic insights into how microbe-derived metabolites promote obesity are largely unknown. Recent work has demonstrated that the meta-organismal production of the bacterial co-metabolite TMAO is linked to suppression of beiging of white adipose tissue in mice and humans. Furthermore, the TMAO pathway is becoming an increasingly attractive therapeutic target in obesity-associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes, kidney failure, and cardiovascular disease. In this commentary we discuss recent findings linking the TMAO pathway to obesity-associated disorders, and provide additional insights into potential mechanisms driving this microbe-host interaction.",

This mini-review summarizes the observations in rodents, highlights several mechanisms that might explain these observations and discusses the translational potential.

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that the global rise in temperature is contributing to the onset of diabetes, which could be mediated by a concomitant reduction in brown fat activity. Brown (and beige) fat are characterised as possessing a unique mitochondrial protein uncoupling protein (UCP)1 that when activated can rapidly generate large amounts of heat. Primary environmental stimuli of UCP1 include cold-exposure and diet, leading to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and large amounts of lipid and glucose being oxidised by brown fat. The exact contribution remains controversial, although recent studies indicate that the amount of brown and beige fat in adult humans has been greatly underestimated. We therefore review the potential mechanisms by which glucose could be utilised within brown and beige fat in adult humans and the extent to which these are sensitive to temperature and diet. This includes the potential contribution from the peridroplet and cytoplasmic mitochondrial sub-fractions recently identified in brown fat, and whether a proportion of glucose oxidation could be UCP1-independent. It is thus predicted that as new methods are developed to assess glucose metabolism by brown fat, a more accurate determination of the thermogenic and non-thermogenic functions could be feasible in humans.",

Although, the role of visceral adipose tissue in insulin-resistance and T2D is known, limited information is available on the role of peripheral-subcutaneous adipose tissue especially in Asian Indians. In this microarray-based study of diabetic and normal glucose tolerant Asian Indians, we generated the transcriptome of their thigh adipose tissue and analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using weighted gene co-expression network analysis; further we identified perturbed pathways implicated by these DEGs in relevant co-expression modules. We also attempted to link these pathways with known aspects of T2D pathophysiology in terms of their association with some of their intermediate traits, namely; adipocyte size, HOMA-B, HOMA-R, Hb1Ac, insulin, glucose-level, TNF-α, IL-6, VLDLs, LDLs, HDLs, and NEFAs. It was observed that several modules of co-expressed genes show an association with diabetes and some of its intermediate phenotypic traits mentioned above. Therefore, these findings suggest a role of peripheral subcutaneous adipose tissue in the pathophsiology of T2D in Asian Indians. Additionally, our study indicated that the peripheral subcutaneous adipose tissue in diabetics shows pathologic changes characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and up-regulation of inflammation-related pathways.",

The present study investigated the expression of bitter taste receptor TAS2R38 in human adipocytes, the possible link with genetic background and the role of TAS2R38 in cell delipidation and lipid accumulation rate in vitro. Subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissues were collected in 32 obese and 18 lean subjects. The TAS2R38 gene expression and protein content were examined in whole tissues, differentiated adipocytes and stroma-vascular fraction cells (SVF). The P49A SNP of TAS2R38 gene was determined in each collected sample. The effect of two bitter agonists (6-n-propylthiouracil and quinine) was tested. TAS2R38 mRNA was more expressed in SAT and VAT of obese than lean subjects and the expression/protein content was greater in mature adipocytes. The expression levels were not linked to P49A variants. In in vitro differentiated adipocytes, bitter agonists induced a significant delipidation. Incubation with 6-n-propylthiouracil induced an inhibition of lipid accumulation rate together with an increase in TAS2R38 and a decrease in genes involved in adipocyte differentiation. In conclusion, TAS2R38 is more expressed in adipocytes of obese than lean subjects and is involved in differentiation and delipidation processes.",

However, the relationship between exercise and DEL-1, and the effects of DEL-1 on insulin signalling in adipocytes have not been fully elucidated to date. Protein expression levels were determined by Western blot analysis. Cells were transfected with small interfering (si) RNA to suppress gene expression. Lipid accumulation levels were detected using Oil red-O staining. Proinflammatory cytokine secretion levels were measured using ELISA. DEL-1 expression levels were induced in the skeletal muscle of people who exercised using microarray analysis. Recombinant DEL-1 augmented AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and haem oxygenase (HO)-1 expression to alleviating inflammation and impairment of insulin signalling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with palmitate. siRNA of AMPK or HO-1 also mitigated the effects of DEL-1 on inflammation and insulin resistance. DEL-1 ameliorates inflammation and insulin resistance in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells via AMPK/HO-1 signalling, suggesting that DEL-1 may be the exercise-mediated therapeutic target for treating insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

However, whether differentiated adipocytes, like the aforementioned ASC, are pro-inflammatory in obese subject AT remained to be investigated. Herein, we isolated ASC from AT of obese donors and differentiated them into adipocytes, for either 8 or 14 d. We analyzed their capacity to activate blood MNC after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin A (PHA), or not, in co-culture assays. Our results showed that co-cultures of MNC with adipocytes, like with ASC, increased IL-17A, IL-1β, and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Moreover, like ASC, adipocytes down-regulated TNFα secretion by Th1 cells. As adipocytes differentiated from ASC of lean donors also promoted IL-17A secretion by MNC, an experimental model of high-fat versus chow diet mice was used and supported that adipocytes from obese, but not lean AT, are able to mediate IL-17A secretion by PHA-activated MNCs. In conclusion, our results suggest that, as ASC, adipocytes in obese AT might contribute to the establishment of a low-grade chronic inflammation state.",

We identify, in the gene promoters of Cebpb and Cebpd, the DNA response elements responsible for binding transcription factors that are activated by cAMP or glucocorticoids. We also show that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-interacting kinase 2 (MNK2; Mknk2), which plays a distinct role in diet-induced obesity, is induced during early adipogenesis and identify the functional DNA response elements responsible for regulating its expression. Mknk2 expression is maintained in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and is expressed at high levels across a range of mouse adipose tissue depots. Together, these new insights help to clarify the transcriptional programme of early adipogenesis and identify Mknk2 as one of potentially many genes up-regulated during adipogenesis.",

The present study establishes a dysfunctional adiposity index (DAI) as an early marker of CA based on adipocytes morpho-functional abnormalities. DAI was established in 340 subjects without cardiovascular risk factors selected from a cross-sectional study (n=1600). Then, DAI was calculated in 36 healthy subjects who underwent subcutaneous AT biopsy. The correlation of DAI with adipocyte morphology (size/number) and functionality (adiponectin/leptin ratio) was analyzed. The DAI cut-off point was identified and its independent association with CA was determined in 1418 subjects from the cross-sectional study. The constant parameters to calculate the DAI were [WC/[22.79+[2.68*BMI]]]*[triglycerides (TG, mmol/L)/1.37]*[1.19/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C, mmol/L)] for males, and [WC/[24.02+[2.37*BMI]]]*[TG(mmol/L)/1.32]*[1.43/HDL-C(mmol/L)] for females. DAI correlated with adipocytes mean area, adipocyte number and adiponectin/leptin ratio. DAI ≥1.065 was independently associated with diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, subclinical atherosclerosis, and hypertension. The present study highlights that DAI is associated with early CA independently of adiposity and other risk factors. Since DAI is obtained using accessible parameters, it can be easily incorporated into clinical practice for early identification of AT abnormalities in apparently healthy subjects.",

Mice deficient in galectin-12 exhibit enhanced adipocyte lipolysis, increased mitochondria respiration, reduced adiposity and ameliorated insulin resistance associated with weight gain. The results suggest that galectin-12 may be a useful target for treatment of obesity-related metabolic conditions, such as insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Most previously described galectins largely reside in the cytosol, although they can also be induced to become associated with membrane-containing structures. Along with an in-depth characterization of galectin-12, this mini-review comments on this first report of a galectin normally localized specifically in an organelle that performs an important intracellular function. Further studies will help shed light on how this protein regulates cellular homeostasis, especially energy homeostasis, and provide additional insight into the intracellular functions of galectins.",

    "abstract": "There is a current debate in the literature on whether human fat derived from the supraclavicular region should be classified as brown, or as the white fat-derived less potent, brite/beige. This commentary addresses whether the existing classification defined in mice is sufficient to describe the types of thermogenic adipocytes in humans. We recently published a contradictory mRNA expression signature of human supraclavicular fat defined by an upregulation of the brite marker TBX1 along with the classical brown markers ZIC1 and LHX8, as well as genes indicating brown fat activity including UCP1, PGC-1α, and PRDM16; and, finally, a downregulation of the white/brite markers HOXC8 and HOXC9. Subcutaneous fat was used as reference material. Another recent study presents a higher expression of ZIC1 and a lower expression of TBX1 in interscapular compared with supraclavicular fat. Here, however, there was no difference in UCP1, PGC-1α, PRDM16, suggesting both depots had equal brown fat potency. Taken together, supraclavicular brown fat derived from adult humans seems to represent a type of brown fat with distinct features from both subcutaneous white/brite and interscapular brown fat. Therefore, the classification of adipocyte subtypes defined in mice may need reconsideration when applying to humans.",

T-bet (Tbx21) is an immune cell transcription factor originally described as the master regulator of Th1 cell development, although is now recognized to have a role in both the adaptive and innate immune systems. T-bet also directs T-cell homing to pro-inflammatory sites by the regulation of CXCR3 expression. T-bet(-/-) mice have increased visceral adiposity but are more insulin-sensitive, exhibiting reduced immune cell content and cytokine secretion specifically in the visceral fat depot, perhaps due to altered T-cell trafficking. Studies of T-bet deficiency on Rag2-- and IFN-γ-deficient backgrounds indicate the importance of CD4(+) T cells and IFN-γ in this model. This favorable metabolic phenotype, uncoupling adiposity from insulin resistance, is present in young lean mice yet persists with age and increasing obesity. We suggest a novel role for T-bet in metabolic regulation.",

The Nrf2 signaling pathway promotes the expression of a plethora of genes that regulate processes involved in protein stability, proteosome integrity, autophagy, senescence and protection against oxidative stress and inflammation. Nrf2 is held in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex bound to Keap1, which facilitates its ubiquitination. Dissociation of Nrf2 from its repressor Keap1 occurs in response to a stressful insult. Covalent modifications involving phosphorylation or acetylation of the free Nrf2 dictates its nucleocytoplasmic localization and henceforth the transcriptional activity of this pleiotropic protein. Bitar and Al-Mulla recently reported that an enhancement in the GSK-3β-Fyn signaling mechanism in wounds or fibroblasts of type 2 diabetes contributes to the diminution in Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and the concomitant aberration in the expression of Nrf2-dependent phase 2 antioxidant enzymes. This phenomenon was associated with a significant decrease in key fibroblast functions essential for wound healing, including cell migration and contraction. Overall, the authors newly identified defects in the GSK-3β-Fyn-Nrf2 signaling pathway during diabetes that may assist in placing us on the road for an evidence-based therapy of non-healing chronic wounds.",

Adipose tissue is also the major inflammation-initiated site in obesity. Adipose-derived adipokines and cytokines are known to be involved in the modulation of a wide range of important physiological processes, particularly immune response, glucose and lipid homeostasis and insulin resistance. Adipose tissue dysfunction, characterized by an imbalanced secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines and cytokines, decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, dysregulation of lipid storage and release and mitochondrial dysfunction, has been linked to obesity and its associated metabolic disorders. Proteomic technology has been a powerful tool for identifying key components of the adipose proteome, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in the proteomic characterization of adipose tissue and discussed the identified proteins that potentially play important roles in insulin resistance and lipid homeostasis.",

Its action appears to be directly linked to perturbations of the insulin pathway, leading to the development of insulin resistance. Visfatin has been suspected to be linked to insulin sensitivity, but the mechanism involved is still partly unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of visfatin in the impairment of the insulin pathway by TNFα activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and to unveil the mechanisms involved in such impairment. We demonstrated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes that visfatin was involved in TNFα-mediated insulin resistance in adipocytes. Indeed, after TNFα treatment in 3T3-L1 cells, visfatin was downregulated, leading to decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) concentrations in cells. This decrease was followed by a decrease in Sirt1 activity, which was linked to an increase in PTP1B expression. The modulation of PTP1B by visfatin was likely responsible for the observed decreases in glucose uptake and Akt phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Here, we demonstrated a complete pathway involving visfatin, NAD(+), Sirt1, and PTP1B that led to the perturbation of insulin signaling by TNFα in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",

Obesity in pregnancy increases the risk of pregnancy complications and the majority of research uses body mass index (BMI) to assess fatness. Specific fat compartments are associated with obesity-induced health risks yet it is not known how abdominal fat mass in pregnancy is related to circulating adipokines. Plasma leptin, resistin, visfatin, and adiponectin were measured by immunoassay in healthy pregnant women of normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9; n = 17) and overweight/obese pregnant women (BMI 25.0-40, n = 21) in the third trimester. Total body and abdominal subcutaneous and visceral fat mass were measured at 1-3 weeks postpartum. Overweight/obese women had greater total body fat (t = -6.210, P < 0.001) and abdominal subcutaneous fat (t = -5.072, P < 0.001) than normal-weight women while there was no difference in abdominal visceral fat. Overweight/obese women had higher leptin (66.3 ± 34.2 vs. 35.7 ± 19.3 ng/mL, P < 0.001) compared to normal-weight women. Leptin was associated with total body fat (r = 0.782, P < 0.001) and resistin was associated with abdominal visceral fat (r = 0.452, P = 0.045). No significant correlations were observed between adiponectin or visfatin and any measure of body composition. In pregnant women, resistin has the potential to be a circulating biomarker for visceral fat, an ectopic fat compartment. These observational data may provide insight for the pathophysiological roles of adipokines and the impact of visceral fat in pregnant women.",

In general, two main strategies have been used to identify adipocyte progenitor cells: fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based prospective analysis and lineage tracing. Although FACS-isolation is highly useful in defining multipotential stem cell populations for in vitro analysis and transplantation, lineage tracing is essential to identify endogenous progenitors that do, in fact, differentiate into adipocytes in vivo. Our recent lineage tracing studies have shown that cells expressing the surface marker platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) give rise to white and brown adipocytes in adult WAT, depending on inductive cues. PDGFRα+ cells are a subpopulation of those expressing CD34 and Sca1, and have unique morphology whereby long dendritic processes contact numerous cell types in the microenvironment. The significant contribution of PDGFRα+ cells to browning and hyperplastic expansion of WAT leads us to propose that PDGFRα+ cells are remodeling stem cells in adult WAT. Application of advanced imaging technology and genetic tools to this progenitor population will allow greater understanding of cellular plasticity in adipose tissue.",

According to World Health Organization, over 500 million adults, equivalent to 10%-14% of the world population, were obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m(2) or greater in 2008.(1) This rising prevalence and earlier onset of obesity is believed to be resulted from an interplay of genetic factors, over-nutrition and physical inactivity in modern lifestyles. Obesity also increases the susceptibility to metabolic syndromes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cancer.(2-4) The global obesity epidemic has sparked substantial interests in the biology of adipose tissue (fat). In addition, the skeletal muscle and its secretive factors (myokines) have also been shown to play a critical role in controlling body energy balance, adipose homeostasis and inflammation status.(5) Interestingly, skeletal muscle cells share a common developmental origin with brown adipocytes,(6,7) which breaks down lipids to generate heat - thus reducing obesity. Here, we provide a brief overview of the basics and recent progress in muscle-fat crosstalk in the context of body energy metabolism, obesity, and diabetes. We summarize the different types of adipocytes, their developmental origins and implications in body composition. We highlight the role of several novel myokines in regulating fat mass and systemic energy balance, and evaluate the potential of skeletal muscles as a therapeutic target to treat obesity.",

In the recently published study we demonstrate proinflammatory changes in the visceral adipose tissue and pancreatic islets in galectin-3-deficient mice fed high-fat diet which also exhibited excess adiposity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and systemic inflammation compared with their diet matched wild-type controls. This was associated with the increased incidence of Type-1 T and NKT cells and pro-inflammatory CD11c(+)CD11b(+) macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue. Severe insulitis, infiltration of macrophages expressing NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β, and enhanced accumulation of AGE were present within the pancreatic islets in obese LGALS3(-/-) mice. Moreover, increased caspase-1 dependent IL-1β secretion with increased expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and phospho-NFκBp65 were observed in LGALS3(-/-) peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro by lipopolysaccharide and/or saturated fatty acid palmitate. The amplified high-fat diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia and exacerbated inflammation in adipose tissue and pancreatic islets in LGALS3(-/-) mice suggest an important role for galectin-3 in the regulation of adiposity, metaflammation and type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Dedifferentiated fat cells (DFAT cells) are derived from lipid-containing (mature) adipocytes, which possess the ability to symmetrically or asymmetrically proliferate, replicate, and redifferentiate/transdifferentiate. Robust cell isolation and downstream culture methods are needed to isolate large numbers of DFAT cells from any (one) adipose depot in order to establish population dynamics and regulation of the cells within and across laboratories. In order to establish more consistent/repeatable methodology here we report on two different methods to establish viable DFAT cell cultures: both traditional cell culture flasks and non-traditional (flat) cell culture plates were used for ceiling culture establishment. Adipocytes (maternal cells of the DFAT cells) were easier to remove from flat culture plates than flasks and the flat plates also allowed cloning rings to be utilized for cell/cell population isolation. While additional aspects of usage of flat-bottomed cell culture plates may yet need to be optimized by definition of optimum bio-coating to enhance cell attachment, utilization of flat plate approaches will allow more efficient study of the dedifferentiation process or the DFAT progeny cells. To extend our preliminary observations, dedifferentiation of Wagyu intramuscular fat (IMF)-derived mature adipocytes and redifferentiation ability of DFAT cells utilizing the aforementioned isolation protocols were examined in traditional basal media/differentiation induction media (DMI) containing adipogenic inducement reagents. In the absence of treatment approximately 10% isolated Wagyu IMF-mature adipocytes dedifferentiated spontaneously and 70% DFAT cells displayed protracted adipogenesis 12 d after confluence in vitro. Lipid-free intracellular vesicles in the cytoplasm (vesicles possessing an intact membrane but with no any observable or stainable lipid inside) were observed during redifferentiation. One to 30% DFAT cells redifferentiated into lipid-assimilating adipocytes in the DMI media, with distinct lipid-droplets in the cytoplasm and with no observable lipid-free vesicles inside. Moreover, a high confluence level promoted the redifferentiation efficiency of DFAT cells. Wagyu IMF dedifferentiated DFAT cells exhibited unique adipogenesis modes in vitro, revealing a useful cell model for studying adipogenesis and lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The adipose organ, which comprises brown, white and beige adipocytes, possesses remarkable plasticity in response to feeding and cold exposure. The development of beige adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT), a process called browning, represents a promising route to treat metabolic disorders. While surgical procedures constantly traumatize adipose tissue, its impact on adipocyte phenotype remains to be established. Herein, we studied the effect of trauma on adipocyte phenotype one day after sham, incision control, or surgical injury to the left inguinal adipose compartment. Caloric restriction was used to control for surgery-associated body temperature changes and weight loss. We characterized the trauma-induced cellular and molecular changes in subcutaneous, visceral, interscapular, and perivascular adipose tissue using histology, immunohistochemistry, gene expression, and flow cytometry analysis. After one day, surgical trauma stimulated adipose tissue browning at the site of injury and, importantly, in the contralateral inguinal depot. Browning was not present after incision only, and was largely independent of surgery-associated body temperature and weight loss. Adipose trauma rapidly recruited monocytes to the injured site and promoted alternatively activated macrophages. Conversely, PDGF receptor-positive beige progenitors were reduced. In this study, we identify adipose trauma as an unexpected driver of selected local and remote adipose tissue browning, holding important implications for the biologic response to surgical injury.",

Importantly, WAT enlargement is initiated early in life, suggesting that molecular mechanisms underlying age-dependent obesity are activated at early stages of lifetime. Our recent study found that age-dependent obesity was associated with a specific decline in mitochondrial complex IV activity, which leads to reduced fatty acid oxidation and subsequent adipocyte hypertrophy. At the molecular level, global mitochondrial complex IV inhibition was driven by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α)-mediated repression of some of its key subunits, including cytochrome c oxidase 5b (Cox5b). In this commentary, we compare age-dependent WAT responses with those observed in the high fat diet model of extreme obesity. Furthermore, we discuss the potential scenarios that could initiate age-dependent WAT expansion as well as the mechanisms by which HIF1α could be activated in WAT.",

Among adipose tissue immune cells, it has been proposed that invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells play crucial roles in anti-inflammatory responses in obesity. iNKT cells recognize 'lipid' antigens loaded on CD1d of antigen presenting cells and modulate immune responses by secreting Th1 or Th2 type cytokines depending on species of lipid antigens, antigen presenting cell types, and environmental cytokine milieu. However, the regulatory mechanisms of antigen presenting cells for adipose iNKT cell stimulation have not been clearly elucidated. Recently, we have reported that CD1d expressing adipocytes could act as an antigen presenting cell for adipose iNKT cells by characterization of adipocyte-specific CD1d knockout (CD1dADKO) mice. Upon high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, CD1dADKO mice aggravated adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance compared with CD1df/f mice. In this commentary, we provide the additional data of adipocyte CD1d-dependent regulation of adipose iNKT cell responses as well as systemic insulin sensitivity.

    "abstract": "A \"Holy Grail\" sought in medical treatment of obesity is to be able to biologically reprogram their adipose tissues to burn fat rather than store it. White adipose tissue (WAT) stores fuel and its expansion underlines insulin resistance (IR) whereas brown adipose tissue (BAT) burns fuel and stimulates insulin sensitivity. These two types of fats seesaw within our bodies via a regulatory mechanism that involves intricate communication between adipocytes and blood cells, particularly macrophages that migrate into adipose deposits. The coregulator, Receptor Interacting Protein 140 (RIP140), plays a key role in regulating this communication. In mice on a high-fat diet, the level of RIP140 in macrophages is dramatically elevated to activate their inflammatory M1 polarization and enhance their recruitment into WAT, facilitating IR. Conversely, lowering the level of RIP140 in macrophages not only reduces M1 macrophages but also expands alternatively polarized, anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, triggering white adipose tissue browning, fat burning, and restoration of insulin sensitivity. This suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for reversing IR, obesity, and atherosclerotic or even cosmetic fat deposits: therapeutic browning of white adipose deposits by diminishing RIP140 levels in macrophages.",

Mice with an adipocyte-specific deletion of the SUMO-specific protease SENP1 develop symptoms of type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Peri-pancreatic adipocytes (PATs) exert both systemic and paracrine effects on pancreases function. Our recent studies report that PATs of SENP1-deficient mice have increased proinflammatory cytokine production compared with other adipose depots. Proinflammatory cytokines produced from PATs not only have direct cytotoxic effects on pancreatic islets, but also increase CCL5 expression in adjacent pancreatic islets, which induces persistent inflammation in pancreases by acquisition of Th1 and Th17 effector T cell subsets. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) can post-translationally conjugate to cellular proteins (SUMOylation) and modulate their biological functions. Several components in SUMOylation associate with T1DM susceptibility. We find that SUMOylation of NF-κB essential molecule NEMO augments NF-κB activity, NF-κB-dependent cytokine production and pancreatic inflammation. NF-κB inhibitor should provide therapeutic approach to block PAT inflammation and ameliorate the T1DM phenotype. We further propose that adipocytes in PATs may play a primary role in establishing pancreatic immune regulation at onset of diabetes, providing new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.",

The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose contains endothelial progenitors, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages, pericytes, pre-adipocytes, and stromal/stem cells, among others. In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation of the influence of age and gender in the field of stem cell biology. Yet few studies have evaluated the influence of biological age or sex on either SVF cell heterogeneity or immunophenotype. To address this issue, the current study has compared the flow cytometric characteristics between murine SVF of inguinal (iWAT), epidydimal (eWAT), and brown (BAT) adipose tissue of male and female, as well as young (6–8 week) and middle-aged (8–12 month) male C57BL/6 mice. Murine gender comparisons revealed male iWAT expressed higher percentages of leukocyte and CD34+ ASC-like sub-populations than female iWAT. Murine age comparisons revealed younger male iWAT, eWAT, and BAT SVF all contained a significantly higher percentage of pre-adipocytes, HSC-like cells, CD25−, and FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells compared to SVF from middle-aged male mice.

However, in adipogenic differentiation protocols for human adipose-derived stem cells, the concentration of glucose and insulin varies considerably. With the intent to gain maximum tissue augmentation, we focused on the late phase of adipogenesis. In this study, we modified the differentiation protocol for adipose-derived stem cells by prolongation of the induction period and the application highly concentrated glucose and insulin. Human adipose-derived stem cells were isolated from subcutaneous depots and differentiated in a standard induction medium for the first two weeks, followed by two weeks with varying glucose and insulin concentrations. Morphological changes assessed using Oil-Red-O staining were examined for corresponding alterations in the expression of the adipogenic markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Furthermore, glucose and lactate levels in conditioned media were monitored over the period of differentiation. We found high-glucose media increasing the level of lipid accumulation and the size of single droplets whereas insulin significantly showed a dose-dependent negative effect on fat storage. However, whereas high glucose stimulated PPARγ transcription, expression levels in insulin-treated cells remained constant. Results permit assumptions that a high-glucose medium intensifies the degree of differentiation in mature adipocytes providing conditions to promote graft volume while we have identified highly concentrated insulin treatment as an inhibitor of lipid storage in the late adipogenic differentiation.",

Despite the well-established link between the molecular clock and metabolic homeostasis, an intimate interplay between the clock machinery and the metabolically active brown adipose tissue (BAT) is only emerging. Recently, we came to appreciate that the formation and metabolic functions of BAT, a key organ for body temperature maintenance, are under an orchestrated circadian clock regulation. Two complementary studies from our group uncover that the cell-intrinsic clock machinery exerts concerted control of brown adipogenesis with consequent impacts on adaptive thermogenesis, which adds a previously unappreciated temporal dimension to the regulatory mechanisms governing BAT development and function. The essential clock transcriptional activator, Bmal1, suppresses adipocyte lineage commitment and differentiation, whereas the clock repressor, Rev-erbα, promotes these processes. This newly discovered temporal mechanism in fine-tuning BAT thermogenic capacity may enable energy utilization and body temperature regulation in accordance with external timing signals during development and functional recruitment. Given the important role of BAT in whole-body metabolic homeostasis, pharmacological interventions targeting the BAT-modulatory activities of the clock circuit may offer new avenues for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders, particularly those associated with circadian dysregulation.",

Protein synthesis inhibition showed that the transient expression of Klf4, Cebpb and Klf5 during early adipogenesis seemed to require a yet unknown protein for their repression. We also found that Klf4 forced expression in 3T3-F442A cells cultured under non-adipogenic conditions did not induce adipogenesis, nor the expression of Cebpb or Klf5, a Cebpb target gene, showing that KLF4 was not sufficient for adipose differentiation to take place.

Therefore, understanding the biology of adipocyte expansion in response to overnutrition is critical to devising strategies to treat obesity, and the associated burden of morbidity and mortality. Through exploratory patch-clamp experiments in freshly isolated primary murine and human adipocytes, we recently determined that SWELL1/LRRC8a, a leucine-rich repeat containing transmembrane protein, functionally encoded an ion channel signalling complex (the volume-regulated anion channel, or VRAC) on the adipocyte plasma membrane. The SWELL1-/LRRC8 channel complex activates in response to increases in adipocyte volume and in the context of obesity. SWELL1 is also required for insulin-PI3K-AKT2 signalling to regulate adipocyte growth and systemic glycaemia.

We found that micrograph analysis identified 10-40 times fewer adipocytes than whole-slide methods, and this small sample size resulted in high variances that could lead to statistical errors. The agreement of the micrograph method to measure adipocyte area with each of the two whole-slide methods was substantially less (R2 of 0.6644 and 0.7125) than between the two whole-slide methods (R2 of 0.9402). These inconsistencies were more pronounced in samples from high-fat diet fed mice. While the use of proprietary software resulted in the highest adipocyte count, the lower cost, ease of use, and minimal variances of the open-source software provided a distinct advantage for measuring the number and size of adipocytes. In conclusion, we recommend whole-slide image analysis methods to consistently measure adipocyte area and avoid unintentional errors due to small sample sizes.",

By its important secretion function, the role of adipose tissue in this metabolic low grade inflammation is well known. Recently, it was demonstrated that the alarmin high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is involved in obesity-related pathologies by its increased serum levels in obese compared to normal weight individuals, and by its pro-inflammatory effects. However, the role of HMGB1 on adipocytes inflammation is poorly documented and we propose to investigate this point. Primary culture of human subcutaneous adipocytes were performed from human adipose tissue samples. Cells were treated with recombinant HMGB1 with/without anti-TLR4 antibody and inhibitors of NF-κB and P38 MAPK. Supernatants were collected for IL-6 and MCP-1 ELISA. HMGB1 initiates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent activation of inflammation through the downstream NF-κB and P38 MAPK signaling pathway to upregulate the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. HMGB1 has pro-inflammatory effects on adipocytes. This reinforces the role of TLR4 in adipose tissue inflammation and antagonizing the HMGB1 inflammatory pathway could bring on new therapeutic targets to counteract obesity-associated pathologies.",

In mammals, this is exemplified in Ames dwarf (Prop1df/df) mice, which have a 40%–60% increase in longevity (males and females, respectively) due to their recessive Prop1 loss-of-function mutation that results in lack of growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin. Our laboratory has previously shown that Ames dwarf mice have functionally unique white adipose tissue (WAT) that improves, rather than impairs, insulin sensitivity. Because GH and thyroid hormone are integral to adipose tissue development and function, we hypothesized that brown adipose tissue (BAT) in Ames dwarf mice may also be functionally unique and/or enhanced. Here, we elaborate on our recent findings, which demonstrate that BAT is functionally enhanced in Ames dwarf mice, and suggest that BAT removal in these mice results in utilization of WAT depots as an energy source. We also discuss how our findings compare to those in other long-lived dwarf mice with altered IIS, which unlike Ames dwarf mice, are essentially euthyroid. Lastly, we provide some insights into the implications of these findings and discuss some of the necessary future work in this area.",

    "abstract": "Obesity, a condition most commonly associated with hyper-leptinemia, is also characterized by increased expression of autophagy genes and likely autophagic activity in human adipose tissue (AT). Indeed, circulating leptin levels were previously shown to positively associate with the expression levels of autophagy genes such as Autophagy related gene-5 (ATG5). Here we hypothesized that leptin acts in an autocrine-paracrine manner to increase autophagy in two major AT cell populations, adipocytes and macrophages. We followed the dynamics of autophagosomes following acute leptin administration with or without a leptin receptor antagonist (SMLA) using high-throughput live-cell imaging in murine epididymal adipocyte and macrophage (RAW264.7) cell-lines. In macrophages leptin exerted only a mild effect on autophagy dynamics, tending to attenuate autophagosomes growth rate. In contrast, leptin-treated adipocytes exhibited a moderate, ~20% increase in the rate of autophagosome growth, an effect that was blocked by SMLA. This finding corresponded to mild increases in mRNA and protein expression of key autophagy genes. Interestingly, a long-lived proteins degradation assay uncovered a robust, >2-fold leptin-mediated stimulation of the autophagy/lysosome-related (bafilomycin-inhibited) activity, which was entirely blocked by SMLA. Collectively, leptin regulates autophagy in a cell-type specific manner. In adipocytes, autophagosome dynamics is moderately enhanced, but even more pronounced stimulation is seen in autophagy-related long-lived protein degradation. These findings suggest a causal link between obesity-associated hyperleptinemia and elevated adipocyte and AT autophagy-related processes.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of obesity has increased dramatically over the past two decades with a prevalence of approximately 40% of the adult population within the United States. The current study examines the potential for transgenerational adipocyte (fat cell) epigenetic alterations. Adipocytes were isolated from the gonadal fat pad of the great-grand offspring F3 generation 1-year old rats ancestrally exposed to DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), atrazine, or vehicle control in order to obtain adipocytes for DNA methylation analysis. Observations indicate that there were differential DNA methylated regions (DMRs) in the adipocytes with the lean or obese phenotypes compared to control normal (non-obese or lean) populations. The comparison of epigenetic alterations indicated that there were substantial overlaps between the different treatment lineage groups for both the lean and obese phenotypes. Novel correlated genes and gene pathways associated with DNA methylation were identified, and may aid in the discovery of potential therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases such as obesity. Observations indicate that ancestral exposures during critical windows of development can induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of DNA methylation changes in adipocytes that ultimately may contribute to an altered metabolic phenotype.",

This meta-analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence of this polymorphism in overweight/obesity, and test the potential association by summarizing existing evidence. Comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, and CNKI databases was performed to identify eligible data sets. Finally, 16 studies involving 5,147 overweight/obese cases and 7,350 non-obese controls were included for further synthetic analyses. Odds ratio (OR) and its corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were statistically calculated. Totally, 69.9% of the included subjects came from East Asia. In the meta-analysis for overall population, statistically significant associations with increased risk of childhood and adolescent overweight/obesity were identified in allele model (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10–1.38), heterozygote model (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.16–1.68), and dominant model (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.12–1.54). Further stratified analysis according to geographical regions revealed that the statistical significance could only be detected in the East Asia subgroup in allele model, homozygote model, heterozygote model, and dominant model. In summary, our meta-analysis indicated that the ADRB3 rs4994 polymorphism could significantly increase the risk of childhood and adolescent overweight/obesity, especially for the East Asia's population.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the effects of varying concentrations of sodium butyrate (SB) on fat accumulation and cell proliferation in chicken adipocytes. High and low serial concentrations of SB used significantly reduced adipocytic fat accumulation. However, they were observed to exhibit differences in cell morphology and distinctions in lipogenic genes expression profiles. At lower concentration (0.01 mM), fat accumulation was decreased with an associated downregulation in the expression of lipogenic genes, which was mediated by free fatty acid receptors (FFARs). Contarily, at higher concentration (1 mM), the fat droplets laden in adipocytes were enlarged, and this was accompanied with activation of lipogenic genes expression. However, the total accumulated fat was also decreased largely due to reduction in cell numbers, which was partially attributable to the reduction in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Animal experiments further indicated that dietary supplementation of lower dose coated SB (0.1% wt/wt) inhibited fat deposition in livers and abdominal fat tissues of broilers, suggesting the potential application of sodium butyrate as feed additive in the regulation of fat deposition.",

    "abstract": "Adipocyte differentiation of bovine adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) was induced by foetal bovine serum (FBS), biotin, pantothenic acid, insulin, rosiglitazone, dexamethasone and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, followed by incubation in different media to test the influence of ascorbic acid (AsA), bovine serum lipids (BSL), FBS, glucose and acetic acid on transdifferentiation into functional adipocytes. Moreover, different culture plate coatings (collagen-A, gelatin-A or poly-L-lysine) were tested. The differentiated ASC were subjected to Nile red staining, DAPI staining, immunocytochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (for NT5E, THY1, ENG, PDGFRα, FABP4, PPARγ, LPL, FAS, GLUT4). Nile red quantification showed a significant increase in the development of lipid droplets in treatments with AsA and BSL without FBS. The presence of BSL induced a prominent increase in FABP4 mRNA abundance and in FABP4 immunofluorescence signals in coincubation with AsA. The abundance of NT5E, ENG and THY1 mRNA decreased or tended to decrease in the absence of FBS, and ENG was additionally suppressed by AsA. DAPI fluorescence was higher in cells cultured in poly-L-lysine or gelatin-A coated wells. In additional experiments, the multi-lineage differentiation potential to osteoblasts was verified in medium containing ß-glycerophosphate, dexamethasone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 using alizarin red staining. In conclusion, bovine ASC are capable of multi-lineage differentiation. Poly-L-lysine or gelatin-A coating, the absence of FBS, and the presence of BSL and AsA favour optimal transdifferentiation into adipocytes. AsA supports transdifferentiation via a unique role in FABP4 induction, but this is not linearly related to the primarily BSL-driven lipid accumulation.Abbreviations: AcA: acetic acid; AsA: ascorbic acid; ASC: adipose-derived stem cells; BSL: bovine serum lipids; DAPI: 4´,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DLK: delta like non-canonical notch ligand; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DPBS: Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; ENG: endoglin; FABP: fatty acid binding protein; FAS: fatty acid synthase; GLUT4: glucose transporter type 4; IBMX: 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; LPL: lipoprotein lipase; MSC: mesenchymal stem cells; α-MEM: α minimum essential medium; NT5E: ecto-5ʹ-nucleotidase; PDGFRα: platelet derived growth factor receptor α; PPARγ: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ; RPS19: ribosomal protein S19; SEM: standard error of the mean; THY1: Thy-1 cell surface antigen; TRT: treatment; TRT-Con: treatment negative control; YWHAZ: tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta",

In this study, we have characterized a lncRNA, LIPE-AS1, that spans genes CEACAM1 to LIPE in man with conservation of genomic organization and tissue expression between mouse and man. Tissue-specific expression of isoforms of the murine lncRNA were found in liver and adipose tissue, one of which, designated mLas-V3, overlapped the Lipe gene encoding hormone-sensitive lipase in both mouse and man suggesting that it may have a functional role in adipose tissue. Knock down of expression of mLas-V3 using anti-sense oligos (ASOs) led to a significant decrease in the differentiation of the OP9 pre-adipocyte cell line through the down regulation of the major adipogenic transcription factors Pparg and Cebpa. Knock down of mLas-V3 induced apoptosis during the differentiation of OP9 cells as shown by expression of active caspase-3, a change in the localization of LIP/LAP isoforms of C/EBPβ, and expression of the cellular stress induced factors CHOP, p53, PUMA, and NOXA. We conclude that mLas-V3 may play a role in protecting against stress associated with adipogenesis, and its absence leads to apoptosis.",

Additionally, abdominal adipocytes in mice injected with PC-exos had a relatively smaller size. Mechanistically, we found that genes involved in metabolism and inflammation were up-regulated, among which increase of IL-6 was significant, and we then found IL-6 promoted lipolysis. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the lipidomics changes of adipocytes after PC-exos treatment.",

Exploration of the developmental characteristics of intramuscular adipocyte will provide targets for enhancing beef cattle marbling without increasing obesity. Few reports have compared bovine perirenal and intramuscular adipocyte transcriptomes using the combined analysis of transcriptomes and lipid metabolism to explore differences in adipogenic characteristics. We identified perirenal preadipocytes (PRA) and intramuscular preadipocytes (IMA) in Qinchuan cattle. We found that IMA were highly prolific in the early stages of adipogenesis, while PRA shows a stronger adipogenic ability in the terminal differentiation. Bovine perirenal and intramuscular adipocytes were detected through the combined analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. More triglyceride was found to be upregulated in perirenal adipocytes; however, more types and amounts of unsaturated fatty acids were detected in intramuscular adipocytes, including eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3; EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3; DHA). Furthermore, differentially expressed genes in perirenal and intramuscular adipocytes were positively correlated with the eicosanoid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), and sphingomyelin contents. Associated differential metabolic pathways included the glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolisms. Our research findings provide a basis for the screening of key metabolic pathways or genes and metabolites involved in intramuscular fat production in cattle.",

In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the association between the PPAT volume and the prognosis of PCa patients after LRP. We retrospectively analyzed data of 189 PCa patients who underwent LRP in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital from July 2010 to August 2021. Volumes of PPAT and prostate were measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and normalized PPAT volume was computed (PPAT volume divided by prostate volume). Patients were then stratified into the high-PPAT group (n = 95) and low-PPAT group (n = 94) by the median of normalized PPAT volume (73%). The high-PPAT group had significantly higher Gleason score (total score 8 or more, 39.0% vs. 4.3%, p <0.001) and pathological stage (stage T3b, 28.4% vs. 13.8%, p = 0.048). No significant correlation between normalized PPAT volume and BMI (ρ = -0.012, p = 0.872) was observed. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed the high-PPAT group had significantly shorter biochemical recurrence (BCR) interval (median progression-free survival time 15.9 months vs. 32.7 months, p = 0.001). Univiarate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed high normalized PPAT volume (>73%) (hazard ratio 1.787 [1.075–3.156], p = 0.002) were independent risk factors for BCR post-operatively. In conclusion, MRI-measured PPAT volume is of significant prognostic value for PCa patients undergoing LRP.",

Brown adipocytes and browning process are capable of thermogenesis, the uncoupling metabolism which allows them to promote balanced energy expenditure, a fundamental mechanism for improving metabolic disorders. Thermogenesis process is not only performed by the thermogenin UCPs within the mitochondria, but instead, is globally regulated within brown and browning adipose tissues, which induces signalling molecules that can be sent to nearby and distant tissues to generate systemic effects on metabolism. This review highlights thermogenesis and describes the crosstalk between different organelles within browning and brown adipocytes, as well as their interorgan axes to regulate whole body metabolism. Finally, browning and thermogenesis activation will also be discussed in terms of physiological conditions, in which, we propose that thermogenesis and functional activities of brown adipocytes should be considered individually in future clinical application.",

Adipose tissues include white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige adipose tissue (BeAT). The main function of WAT is to store energy, while the BAT and BeAT can generate heat and consume energy. Therefore, promotion of BAT activation and WAT browning contributes to body weight loss. To date, many studies have suggested that exercise exerts the potential regulatory effects on BAT activation and WAT browning. In the present review, we compile the evidence for the regulatory effects of exercise on BAT activation and WAT browning and summarize the possible mechanisms whereby exercise modulates BAT activation and WAT browning, including activating sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and promoting the secretion of exerkines, with special focus on exerkines. These data might provide reference for prevention or treatment of obesity and the related metabolic disease through exercise.",

Matched Coleman fat and ECM/SVF-gel of 28 healthy women were subjected to RNA-seq, followed by functional enrichment and cell-type-specific enrichment analyses, and deconvolution of SVF cell subsets, reconstructing SVF cell composition in the transcriptome level. ECM/SVF-gels had 9 upregulated and 73 downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Downregulated DEGs were mainly associated with inflammatory and immune responses, and enriched in fat macrophages. M2 macrophages, resting CD4+ memory T cells, M1 macrophages, resting mast cells, and M0 macrophages ranked in the top five most prevalent immune cells in the two groups. The proportions of the principal non-immune cells (e.g., adipose-derived stem cells, pericytes, preadipocytes, microvascular endothelial cells) had no statistical differences between the two groups. Our findings reveal ECM/SVF-gels share the same dominant immune cells beneficial to fat graft survival with Coleman fat, but exhibiting obvious losses of immune cells (especially macrophages), while non-immune cells necessary for adipose regeneration might have no significant loss in ECM/SVF-gels and their biological effects could be markedly enhanced by the ECM/SVF-gel's condensed nature.",

Indeed, adipose tissue has emerged as a central mediator of obesity- and diet-induced insulin resistance.

    "abstract": "The cellular nutrient sensing apparatus detects nutritional depletion and transmits this information to downstream effectors that generate energy from alternate sources. Autophagy is a crucial catabolic pathway that turns over redundant cytoplasmic components in lysosomes to provide energy to the starved cell. Recent studies have described a role for hypothalamic autophagy in the control of food intake and energy balance. Activated autophagy in hypothalamic neurons during starvation mobilized neuron-intrinsic lipids to generate free fatty acids that increased AgRP levels. AgRP neuron-specific inhibition of autophagy decreased fasting-induced increases in AgRP levels and food intake. Deletion of autophagy in AgRP neurons led to constitutive increases in levels of proopiomelanocortin and its active processed product, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone that contributed to reduced adiposity in these rodents. The current manuscript discusses these new findings and raises additional questions that may help understand how hypothalamic autophagy controls food intake and energy balance. These studies may have implications for designing new therapies against obesity and insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Analyses of mature adipocytes have shown that they possess a reprogramming ability in vitro, which is associated with dedifferentiation. The subsequent dedifferentiated fat cells (DFAT cells) are multipotent and can differentiate into adipocytes and other cell types as well. Mature adipocytes can be easily obtained by biopsy, and the cloned progeny cells are homogeneous in vitro. Therefore, DFAT cells (a new type of stem cell) may provide an excellent source of cells for tissue regeneration, engineering and disease treatment. The dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes, the multipotent capacity of DFAT cells and comparisons and contrasts with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) are discussed in this review.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the alterations in triglyceride (TG) breakdown and storage in subcutaneous inguinal (SC Ing) and epididymal (Epid) fat depots following chronic endurance training. Male Wistar rats were either kept sedentary (Sed) or subjected to endurance training (Ex) at 70-85% peak VO2 for 6 weeks. At weeks 0, 3, and 6 blood was collected at rest and immediately after a bout of submaximal exercise of similar relative intensity to assess whole-body lipolysis. At week 6, adipocytes were isolated from Epid and SC Ing fat pads for the determination of lipolysis under basal or isoproterenol- and forskolin-stimulated conditions, basal and insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation into lipids, and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Body weight, fat pad mass, and insulin were reduced by endurance training. Also, circulating non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) were 33% lower in Ex than Sed rats when exercising at the same relative intensity. This coincided with reduced isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in the Epid (27%) and SC Ing (25%) adipocytes in Ex rats. Similarly, forskolin-stimulated lipolysis was reduced in Epid (51%) and SC Ing (49%) adipocytes from Ex rats. Insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation into lipids in adipocytes from both fat depots from Ex rats was also lower (∼43%) than Sed controls. Conversely, FAO was increased in Epid (1.71-fold) and SC Ing (1.82-fold) adipocytes of Ex rats. In conclusion, chronic endurance exercise reduced lipolysis and lipogenesis while increasing FAO in Epid and SC Ing adipocytes. These are compatible with an energy-sparing adaptive response to reduced adiposity under chronic endurance training conditions.",

    "abstract": "Excessive nutrient intake in obesity triggers the accumulation of various types of immune cells in adipose tissue, particularly visceral adipose tissue (VAT). This can result in chronic inflammation which disrupts insulin effects on adipocytes and muscle cells and culminates in development of insulin resistance. The interplay between immune cells and adipose tissue is a key event for the development of insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes. CD40, a well-documented costimulatory receptor, is required for efficient systemic adaptive immune responses. However, we and other groups recently showed that CD40 unexpectedly ameliorates inflammation in VAT and accordingly attenuates obesity-induced insulin resistance. Specifically, although CD40 is typically considered to play its principal immune roles on B lymphocytes and myeloid cells, we found that CD40(+)CD8(+) T lymphocytes were major contributors to the protective effect. This unexpected inhibitory role of CD40 on CD8(+) T cell activation in VAT may reflect unique features of this microenvironment. Additional knowledge gaps include whether CD40 also plays roles in mucosal immunity that control the homeostasis of gut microbiota, and human metabolic diseases. Potential therapeutic approaches, including stimulating CD40 signaling and/or manipulating specific CD40 signaling pathways in the VAT microenvironment, may open new avenues for treatment of obesity-induced insulin resistance, and prevention of type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is highly dynamic and increases its size dependent on the status of nutrition. Generally, an increase of adipose tissue mass is attributed to two mechanisms, namely hypertrophy (increase in adipocyte size) and hyperplasia (increase in adipocyte number). Here, we analyzed the proliferation capacity of a pool of nutrition sensing preadipocytes after short-term high fat diet (HFD) feeding. We show that this process is age independent and that adipocyte hyperplasia seems not to be dependent on adipocyte hypertrophy. Further, we could show that the subsequent development into adipocytes is influenced by the duration of HFD feeding after proliferation. Our data also demonstrate that the studied pool of preadipocytes seems to be finite and cannot be reactivated by multiple bouts of HFD feeding. In conclusion, our results indicate an important link between stem cells, nutrition status and homeostasis in the epididymal adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "It has been postulated that the protective effects of lower body subcutaneous adipose tissue (LBSAT) occur via its ability to sequester surplus lipid and thus serve as a \"metabolic sink.\" However, the mechanisms that mediate this protective function are unknown thus this study addresses this postulate. Ad libitum, chow-fed mice underwent Sham-surgery or LBSAT removal (IngX, inguinal depot removal) and were subsequently provided chow (Chow; typical adipocyte expansion) or high fat diet (HFD; enhanced adipocyte expansion) for 5 weeks. Primary outcome measures included glucose tolerance and subsequent insulin response, muscle insulin sensitivity, liver and muscle triglycerides, adipose tissue gene expression, and circulating lipids and adipokines. In a follow up study the consequences of extended experiment length post-surgery (13 wks) or pre-existing glucose intolerance were examined. At 5 wks post-surgery IngX in HFD-fed mice reduced glucose tolerance and muscle insulin sensitivity and increased circulating insulin compared with HFD Sham. In Chow-fed mice, muscle insulin sensitivity was the only measurement reduced following IngX. At 13 wks circulating insulin concentration of HFD IngX mice continued to be higher than HFD Sham. Surgery did not induce changes in mice with pre-existing glucose intolerance. IngX also increased muscle, but not liver, triglyceride concentration in Chow- and HFD-fed mice 5 wks post-surgery, but chow group only at 13 wks. These data suggest that the presence of LBSAT protects against triglyceride accumulation in the muscle and HFD-induced glucose intolerance and muscle insulin resistance. These data suggest that lower body subcutaneous adipose tissue can function as a \"metabolic sink.\"",

In this commentary, we aim to provide an alternative perspective on the current trend of analyzing and manipulating thermogenesis, brought about by our recent publication, in which we investigated the unexpected hypermetabolic phenotype of an animal model with defective thyroid hormone receptor α1 signaling. These mice display elevated brown adipose tissue thermogenesis; surprisingly, however, their body temperature is lower, pointing to a defect in heat conservation. Using infrared thermography and wire myograph experiments, we revealed that the tail arteries of the mutant mice are less sensitive to contractile stimuli, which leads to insufficient peripheral vasoconstriction and heat loss over the tail surface. This heat loss in turn lowers body temperature and triggers the additional thermogenesis. Our findings add a new aspect to the role of thyroid hormone in thermoregulation, and encourage a more holistic view in future studies in the field of thermogenesis, including the often-overlooked heat dissipation and recordings of body temperature.",

    "abstract": "HIV-associated lipodystrophy is a heterogeneous, evolving condition associated with fundamental defects in adipose tissue differentiation, turnover and function. Although many antiretroviral drugs can affect adipose tissues adversely, clinical evidence suggests that factors associated with the virus per se could play a role. We have focused on the possibility that an HIV accessory protein, viral protein R (Vpr) could dysregulate metabolically critical transcription factors to cause the adipose dysfunction. In a recent study published in Science Translational Medicine, we utilized 2 animal models to show that Vpr, produced in tissues that sequester HIV after antiretroviral therapy, can act in a paracrine or endocrine fashion to disrupt adipocyte differentiation and function by inhibiting PPARγ target gene expression and activating glucocorticoid target gene expression. The phenotypic consequences included many features typical of the human syndrome, including accelerated lipolysis, increased macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue, diminished size of white adipose depots and hepatic steatosis. In this commentary, we summarize the background, results, and implications of these studies, and raise important questions for future investigation. More broadly, these studies suggest that chronic viral infections may be a causative factor in the pathogenesis of some forms of lipid metabolic disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes.",

We report the characterization of AT dysfunction through measurements of the adiponectin/leptin ratio (ALR), the adipo-insulin resistance index (Adipo-IRi), fasting/postprandial (F/P) immunometabolic phenotyping and direct F/P differential gene expression in AT biopsies obtained from symptom-free adults from the GEMM family study. AT dysfunction was evaluated through associations of the ALR with F/P insulin-glucose axis, lipid-lipoprotein metabolism, and inflammatory markers. A relevant pattern of negative associations between decreased ALR and markers of systemic low-grade metaflammation, HOMA, and postprandial cardiovascular risk hyperinsulinemic, triglyceride and GLP-1 curves was found. We also analysed their plasma non-coding microRNAs and shotgun lipidomics profiles finding trends that may reflect a pattern of adipose tissue dysfunction in the fed and fasted state. Direct gene differential expression data showed initial patterns of AT molecular signatures of key immunometabolic genes involved in AT expansion, angiogenic remodelling and immune cell migration. These data reinforce the central, early role of AT dysfunction at the molecular and systemic level in the pathogenesis of IR and immunometabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Adiposity is caused by an imbalance between energy intake and consumption. Promotion of the browning of white fat increases energy expenditure and could combat adiposity. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) has been confirmed to positively correlate with adiposity. However, the putative connection between TSH and white adipose browning has never been explored. In this study, we sought to assess the effect of TSH on white adipose tissue browning and energy metabolism. Subclinical hypothyroidism mice, thyroid-specific Tshr-knockout mice injected with TSH, adipocyte-specific and global Tshr-knockout micewere subjected to morphological, physiological, genetic or protein expression analyses and metabolic cages to determine the role of TSH on the browning of white adipose tissue and metabolism. 3T3-L1 and primary SVF cells were used to verify the effects and mechanism of TSH on the browning of white adipocytes. We show that increased circulation TSH level decreases energy expenditure, promotes adiposity, impairs glucose and lipid metabolism. Knockout of Tshr decreases adiposity, increases energy expenditureand markedly promotes the development of beige adipocytesin both epididymal and inguinal subcutaneous white fat via a mechanism that likely involves AMPK/PRDM16/PGC1α. Our results reveal an important role of TSH in regulating energy balance and adiposity by inhibiting the browning of white fat.",

In a previous study, we demonstrated that miR-29a negatively regulates the differentiation of porcine adipocytes. In this study, we investigated the roles of miR-29b/c in porcine adipocytes and the underlying mechanisms. Using EdU staining and the CCK-8 assay, we observed that transfection with the miR-29b/c agomir promoted the proliferation of porcine intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) adipocytes by altering the expression of cell-cycle-related genes. According to the results of oil red O staining and western blot analysis, transfection with the miR-29b/c agomir suppressed the differentiation of porcine SC and IM adipocytes via the AKT/PKA/MAPK signalling pathway. Furthermore, we proved that miR-29b/c regulates porcine adipocytes by directly targeting the 3ʹ-untranslated region (3ʹUTR) of CTRP6 using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Finally, co-transfection with miR-29b/c and CTRP6 partially restored the changes of phenotype and gene expression induced by miR-29b/c overexpression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Taken together, our data demonstrate that both miR-29b and miR-29 c negatively regulate porcine adipogenesis by targeting CTRP6, which furthers our understanding of the gene network that regulates fat deposition in pigs.",

Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells cultured on Matrigel® demonstrated increased levels of mRNA levels for key adipogenic transcription factors (PPARγ, C/EBPα, SREBP1), lipogenic markers (FAS, FABP4, LPL, PLIN1) and markers of adipocyte maturity (LEP), compared to cells cultured directly on a polystyrene tissue culture surface.

Furthermore, growth on Matrigel® increased lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells in the presence and absence of rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione routinely used to optimize differentiation in these cells. These changes in adipocyte gene expression and lipid accumulation patterns may be a result of the increased cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions occurring on the Matrigel®, a scenario that is more reflective of an in vivo model.

This study aimed to determine effects of porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS) on adipocytes injuries and explore associated mechanisms. Adipocytes were isolated from SD rats. pLVX-XBP1 (XBP1 over-expression) and pLVX-XBP1-RNAi (silencing XBP1) were structured and transfected into adipocytes. All adipocytes were divided into pLVX-NC, pLVX-XBP1, pLVX-NC+Pg-LPS and pLVX-XBP1+ Pg-LPS group. Oil-Red O staining was employed to identify isolated adipocytes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to examine gene transcription of IL-6, TNF-α, leptin, adiponectin. Western blotting was used to detect Bax and caspase-3 expression. Adipocytes were successfully isolated and identified with Oil-Red O staining. Both XBP1 mimic and XBP1 RNAi were effectively transfected into adipocytes with higher expressing efficacy. XBP1 over-expression significantly aggravated Pg-LPS induced inflammatory response compared to adipocytes without Pg-LPS treatment (p<0.05). Pg-LPS significantly enhanced leptin and inhibited adiponectin expression by up-regulating XBP1 expression (p<0.05). XBP1 silence significantly alleviated Pg-LPS induced inflammatory response and reduced leptin, enhanced adiponectin expression in Pg-LPS treated adipocytes compared to adipocytes without Pg-LPS treatment (p<0.05). Pg-LPS induced apoptosis of adipocytes by enhancing XBP1 expression and modulating Bcl-2/Bax pathway associated molecules. In conclusion, Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS) induces adipocytes injuries through modulating XBP1 expression and initialling mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

Cartilage stem/progenitor cells (CSPCs) seem to be a promising cell source. Hypoxic extracellular vesicles (EVs) may play a major role in cell-cell and tissue-tissue communication. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of hypoxic adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs)-derived EVs on CSPCs proliferation and differentiation. The characteristics of ADSCs-derived EVs were identified, and proliferation, migration, and cartilage-related gene expression of CSPCs were measured with or without the presence of hypoxic ADSCs-derived EVs. SEM, histological staining, biochemical and biomechanical analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of hypoxic ADSCs-derived EVs on CSPCs in alginate hydrogel culture. The results indicated that the majority of ADSC-derived EVs exhibited a round-shaped or cup-shaped morphology with a diameter of 40–1000 nm and expressed CD9, CD63, and CD81. CSPCs migration and proliferation were enhanced by hypoxic ADSCs-derived EVs, which also increased the expression of cartilage-related genes. The hypoxic ADSCs-derived EVs induce CSPCs to produce significantly more cartilage matrix and proteoglycan. In conclusion, hypoxic ADSCs-derived EVs improved the proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation of CSPCs for cartilage tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "Adipose differentiation and excessive lipid accumulation are the important characteristics of obesity. Metformin, as a classic hypoglycaemic drug, has been proved to reduce body weight in type 2 diabetes, the specific mechanism has not been completely clear. A few studies have explored its effect on adipogenesis in vitro, but the existing experimental results are ambiguous. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were used to explore the effects of metformin on the morphological and physiological changes of lipid droplets during adipogenesis. A high throughput sequencing was used to examine the effects of metformin on the transcriptome of adipogenesis. Considering the inevitable errors among independent experiments, we performed integrated bioinformatics analysis to identify important genes involved in adipogenesis and reveal potential molecular mechanisms. During the process of adipogenesis, metformin visibly relieved the morphological and functional changes. In addition, metformin reverses the expression pattern of genes related to adipogenesis at the transcriptome level. Combining with integrated bioinformatics analyses to further identify the potential targeted genes regulated by metformin during adipogenesis. The present study identified novel changes in the transcriptome of metformin in the process of adipogenesis that might shed light on the underlying mechanism by which metformin impedes the progression of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a severe disease worldwide. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) may be related to metabolic abnormalities in obese individuals, but the mechanism is still unclear. We aimed to investigate whether nuclear receptors NR1D1 and ULK1 influence obesity by affecting mitophagy. In vitro model was established by inducing 3T3-L1 cells differentiation. MTT was detected cell viability. ELISA was tested triglyceride (TG). Oil red O staining was performed to detect lipid droplets. Flow cytometry was measured mtROS. ChIP and Dual-luciferase reporter assay were verified NR1D1 bind to ULK1. LC3 level was detected by IF. After differentiation medium treatment, cell viability was decreased, TG content and lipid droplets were increased Moreover, NR1D1 expression was reduced in Model group. NR1D1 overexpression was increased cell viability, reduced TG content and lipid droplets. Subsequently, NR1D1 inhibited TOM20 and mtROS, whereas, Parkin and PINK1 were accelerated. NR1D1 overexpression facilitated LC3 expression, whereas ULK1 knockdown was reversed the effect of NR1D1 overexpression. Liensinine also reversed the effect of NR1D1 overexpression, that is, cell viability was reduced, mtROS, TG content and lipid droplets were increased. The combination of nuclear receptor NR1D1 and ULK1 promoted mitophagy in adipocytes to alleviate obesity, which provided new target and strategy for obesity treatment.Abbreviations: Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), triglyceride (TG), Uncoordinated-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 (NR1D1), American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), fetal bovine serum (FBS), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), dexamethasone (DEX), short hairpin RNA ULK1 (sh-ULK1), wild-type (WT), mutant (MUT), Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Immunofluorescence (IF), standard deviation (SD).",

Firstly, mice were fed a high-fat and high-sugar diet (HF group) to establish an IR model, and the controls (NF group) were fed with a normal diet. Next, the weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum insulin and insulin tolerance were detected. Pathological changes of liver tissues were observed by H&E staining. The expressions of INSR, IRS-1 and IRS-2 in the liver, skeletal muscle and ovary were measured by qRT-PCR and western blotting. As a result, compared with the NF group, the HF group mice had increased weight, FBG, insulin and IR index after 6-week of feeding as well as a worse performance in the insulin tolerance test and H&E staining showed fatty liver-like changes after 12-week of feeding, exhibited lower expression of INSR, IRS-1 and IRS-2 in the liver of mice at 6 and 12 weeks. The expression of INSR and IRS-1 in skeletal muscle tissues exhibited the same trend, while those in ovary organs showed the opposite trend. These results suggested that the insulin signaling alters in the liver, skeletal muscle and ovary organs with the progress of IR.",

    "abstract": "Our view of how adipose tissue metabolism is regulated recently experienced a change in focus and breadth, meaning that some of the key controlling factors were not fully in the picture. The catecholamines of the sympathetic nervous system are well-known activators of β-adrenergic receptors in adipocytes to increase lipolysis. They also drive energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue and, importantly, the \"browning\" of cells in white adipose depots. However, this is clearly not the whole story. In earlier work, we established a pathway from β-adrenergic receptors to p38 MAP kinase to drive the transcription of brown adipocyte genes and respiratory uncoupling. Now we recently discovered that cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) stimulate a similar \"browning\" of human and mouse adipocytes. NPs activate the guanylyl cyclase coupled NP receptor A and activation of protein kinase G. Importantly, this pathway also depends upon p38 MAPK. These two pathways work together, additively increasing expression of brown adipocyte marker genes, as well as reflexively controlling each other's components. We discuss these findings and how the control of body fat by these cardiac hormones, in conjunction with the sympathetic nervous system, has implications for obesity as well as cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and heart failure.",

In the past decade, many HMTs and HDMs were identified and their biological and biochemical functions have been characterized. As with other cells, several HMTs and HDMs are known to be indispensable for appropriate differentiation of adipocytes from mesenchymal stem cells. Phf2 is a recently identified dimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) demethylase that has a significant function in hepatocytes and macrophages in vitro; however, the in vivo significance of Phf2 remains unclear. To determine the physiological role of Phf2, we recently generated Phf2 knockout mice. Our analyses of these mice revealed that Phf2 has a positive role in adipogenesis by coactivating CEBPA, one of the master regulators of adipogenesis, through its demethylation activity toward H3K9me2. In this commentary, we discuss several remaining questions that underlie phenotypic abnormalities seen in our investigations of Phf2 knockout mice. These studies are related to novel functions of histone modifiers and may help identify new therapeutic targets for metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Human brown adipose tissue (BAT) has during the last 5 year been subjected to an increasing research interest, due to its putative function as a target for future obesity treatments. The most commonly used method for molecular studies of human BAT is the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). This method requires normalization to a reference gene (genes with uniform expression under different experimental conditions, e.g. similar expression levels between human BAT and WAT), but so far no evaluation of reference genes for human BAT has been performed. Two different microarray datasets with samples containing human BAT were used to search for genes with low variability in expression levels. Seven genes (FAM96B, GNB1, GNB2, HUWE1, PSMB2, RING1 and TPT1) identified by microarray analysis, and 8 commonly used reference genes (18S, B2M, GAPDH, LRP10, PPIA, RPLP0, UBC, and YWHAZ) were selected and further analyzed by quantitative PCR in both BAT containing perirenal adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Results were analyzed using 2 different algorithms (Normfinder and geNorm). Most of the commonly used reference genes displayed acceptably low variability (geNorm M-values <0.5) in the samples analyzed, but the novel reference genes identified by microarray displayed an even lower variability (M-values <0.25). Our data suggests that PSMB2, GNB2 and GNB1 are suitable novel reference genes for qPCR analysis of human BAT and we recommend that they are included in future gene expression studies of human BAT.",

    "abstract": "Brown fat has gained widespread attention as a potential therapeutic target to treat obesity and associated metabolic disorders. Indeed, the anti-obesity potential of multiple targets to stimulate both brown adipocyte differentiation and recruitment have been verified in rodent models. However, their therapeutic potential in humans is unknown due to the lack of a human primary brown adipocyte cell culture system. Likewise, the lack of a well-characterized human model has limited the discovery of novel targets for the activation of human brown fat. To address this current need, we aimed to identify and describe the first primary brown adipocyte cell culture system from human fetal interscapular brown adipose tissue. Pre-adipocytes isolated from non-viable human fetal interscapular tissue were expanded and cryopreserved. Cells were then thawed and plated alongside adult human subcutaneous and omental pre-adipocytes for subsequent differentiation and phenotypic characterization. Interscapular pre-adipocytes in cell culture differentiated into mature adipocytes that were morphologically indistinguishable from the adult white depots. Throughout differentiation, cultured human fetal interscapular adipocytes demonstrated increased expression of classical brown fat markers compared to subcutaneous and omental cells. Further, functional analysis revealed an elevation in fatty acid oxidation as well as maximal and uncoupled oxygen consumption in interscapular brown adipocytes compared to white control cells. These data collectively identify the brown phenotype of these cells. Thus, our primary cell culture system derived from non-viable human fetal interscapular brown adipose tissue provides a valuable tool for the study of human brown adipocyte biology and for the development of anti-obesity therapeutics.",

Site specific differences in adipocyte phenotype and/or gene expression may play a role in these age-related changes. In this study, we isolated and characterized human facial preadipocytes and investigated distinct metabolic properties such as a differentiation pattern in relation to abdominal preadipocytes. Subcutaneous preadipocytes were isolated from human facial and abdominal skin and cultured in the presence of differentiation factors including rosiglitazone, a known peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonist, isobutyl-methyl xanthine (IBMX) and insulin. Differentiation was characterized microscopically and by quantitative real-time PCR. Unexpected superior adipogenic capacity of facial preadipocytes was observed; more facial preadipocytes differentiated in response to rosiglitazone than abdominal preadipocytes and facial preadipocytes retained their ability to differentiate through passage 11 compared with passage 5 for abdominal preadipocytes. Experiments confirmed a reduced lipolysis response in facial versus abdominal adipocytes after exposure to isoproterenol, which was consistent with the reduced β2-adrenergic receptor expression by 60% in the facial cells. The expression of other lipid metabolic gene markers was similar in both facial and abdominal adipocytes with the exception of β3-adrenergic receptor which was only found in abdominal adipose tissue. Gene profiling, by microarray analysis, identified that several HOX genes are robustly reduced in facial adipocytes compared to abdominal adipocytes, suggesting different characteristics between the 2 fat depots. These differences may have implications for development of treatments for facial fat loss during aging.",

Medical procedures for localized fat reduction are very different from each other and it is, at least, inaccurate to refer to all of them plainly as \"fat reduction methods.\" A specific classification has become urgent and its categories should be able to imply what each method entails. For this classification proposal, \"reversibility,\" \"membrane disruption or inflammation,\" and \"action selectivity,\" have been the selected criteria.",

    "abstract": "Lysyl oxidase (LOX) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of lysine residues in collagen and elastin, key components of connective tissue. LOX is synthesized as an inactive 50 kD pre-proenzyme, and secreted to the extracellular matrix where it is cleaved into an active 32 kD LOX, and an 18kD free propeptide (LOX-PP), purportedly an inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) signaling. Given that adipocytes are distributed inside the connective tissue, it is likely that LOX-PP has an important regulatory role in adipogenesis, which has not been studied. Using NIH 3T3-L1 cells, we observed that FGF-2 inhibited adipogenesis, and LOX-PP promoted adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells in the presence of FGF-2; the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) α, two markers of adipogenesis, were enhanced in the presence of LOX-PP. We further observed that LOX-PP down-regulated AKT and ERK1/2, two proliferative signaling proteins down-stream of FGF-2 signaling. Similarly, inhibition of FGF-2 receptor signaling by canofin, a competitive inhibitor of FGF-2 receptor, promoted adipogenesis albeit less effective compared to LOX-PP. To further explore whether LOX-PP promoted adipogenesis through inhibition of FGF-2 signaling, site directed mutagenesis of LOX-PP, resulting in an Arg158 to Gln158 mutation which abolishes the inhibitory activity of LOX-PP to FGF-2 receptor, attenuated the adipogenic promoting properties of LOX-PP. In summary, for the first time, our data show that LOX-PP enhances adipogenesis at least partially through inhibition of FGF-2 receptor signaling. Our data suggest that LOX-PP may serve as a bona fide therapeutic target for regulating adipogenesis and adipose tissue development.",

This study is to verify overexpression of miR-455 could ameliorate the lipid accumulation and metabolism in the liver of db/db diabetic mice and explore the potential mechanisms. Diabetic mice (db/db) and control mice (db/m) were randomly divided into four groups. After overexpression of miR-455 in the liver of db/db mice, the triglycerides level in both serum and liver decreased, the lipid deposit in liver was improved, the expression of fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCα) was also significantly down-regulated. TargetScan indicated that suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) is predicated to target miR-455 and the protein of SOCS3 in the liver of db/db mice after intervention was significantly decreased. The dual luciferase reporter assay showed that SOCS3 was target gene of miR-455. In vitro, in Palmitate (PA)-stimulated human normal liver (LO2) cells, transfected miR-455 mimic could significantly inhibit the expression of SOCS3, while transfected miR-455 inhibitor could up-regulate the expression of SOCS3. Transfecting LO2 cells with siRNA of SOCS3 could significantly down-regulate the protein expression of SREBP-1c and ACCα.

However, it is still unclear how exactly SFRP4 regulates the secretion of adipokines in the adipose tissue in vivo, an event that is closely related to the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance. In this study, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing SFRP4 in the liver and investigated SFRP4 role in adipokine secretion in mice on a regular normal diet. In Tg mice, SFRP4 protein was overexpressed in the liver, as compared to wild-type littermates (non-Tg), and released into the blood. Moreover, the size of adipocytes was smaller in the visceral adipose tissue of Tg mice compared to controls. Additionally, SFRP4 overexpression affected the expression of genes related to adipocyte differentiation, causing the upregulation of adiponectin and glucose transporter 4, and the downregulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β, in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, there was no difference in body weight or body composition between Tg and non-Tg mice. In summary, our data showed that SFRP4 overexpression altered adipocyte size and adipokine secretion, possibly affecting adipocyte differentiation, obesity, and glucose metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Although adipose tissue metabolism in obesity has been widely studied, there is limited research on the anorexic state, where the endocrine system is disrupted by reduced adipose tissue mass and there are depot-specific changes in adipocyte type and function. Stress exposure at different stages of life can alter the balance between energy intake and expenditure and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa. This review integrates information from human clinical trials to describe endocrine, genetic and epigenetic aspects of adipose tissue physiology in the anorexic condition. Changes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid, -adrenal, and -gonadal axes and their relationships to appetite regulation and adipocyte function are discussed. Because of the role of stress in triggering or magnifying anorexia, and the dynamic but also persistent nature of environmentally-induced epigenetic modifications, epigenetics is likely the link between stress and long-term changes in the endocrine system that disrupt homoeostatic food intake and adipose tissue metabolism. Herein, we focus on the adipocyte and changes in its function, including alterations reinforced by endocrine disturbance and dysfunctional adipokine regulation. This information is critical because of the poor understanding of anorexic pathophysiology, due to the lack of suitable research models, and the complexity of genetic and environmental interactions.",

The dynamic response of adipose tissue to changes in diet is therefore a crucial aspect of metabolism, and has attracted attention in the context of the ongoing worldwide increase in overweight and obesity and resulting metabolic syndrome dysfunctions. We investigated in a mouse model if there is a specific delay between an increase in caloric intake and the recruitment of new adipocytes, and if there are other changes in adipose tissue dynamics concomitant with such a diet change. By developing a dynamic mathematical model, we found that there is a delay of 3 days between the start of a high fat diet and the recruitment of new adipocytes, and that the rate of fat mass increase modulates lipid turnover and adipose cell hypertrophy.",

Any increase in UCP1 is commonly considered as the trademark of energy expenditure.

    "abstract": "Communication between the brain and the adipose tissue has been the focus of many studies in recent years, with the \"brain-fat axis\" identified as a system that orchestrates the assimilation and usage of energy to maintain body mass and adequate fat stores. It is now well-known that appetite-regulating peptides that were studied as neurotransmitters in the central nervous system can act both on the hypothalamus to regulate feeding behavior and also on the adipose tissue to modulate the storage of energy. Energy balance is thus partly controlled by factors that can alter both energy intake and storage/expenditure. Two such factors involved in these processes are neuropeptide Y (NPY) and α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH). NPY, an orexigenic factor, is associated with promoting adipogenesis in both mammals and chickens, while α-MSH, an anorexigenic factor, stimulates lipolysis in rodents. There is also evidence of interaction between the 2 peptides. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the study of NPY and α-MSH regarding their role in adipose tissue physiology, with an emphasis on the cellular and molecular mechanisms. A greater understanding of the brain-fat axis and regulation of adiposity by bioactive peptides may provide insights on strategies to prevent or treat obesity and also enhance nutrient utilization efficiency in agriculturally-important species.",

    "abstract": "Upregulating the fatty acid oxidation capacity of white adipose tissue in mice protects against diet-induced obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance. Part of this capacity results from induction of brown-like adipocytes within classical white depots, making it difficult to determine the oxidative contribution of the more abundant white adipocytes. Avian genomes lack a gene for uncoupling protein 1 and are devoid of brown adipose cells, making them a useful model in which to study white adipocyte metabolism in vivo. We recently reported that a brief (5 hour) period of fasting significantly upregulated many genes involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation pathways in white adipose tissue of young broiler chickens. The objective of this study was to determine if the effects on gene expression manifested in increased rates of fatty acid oxidation. Abdominal adipose tissue was collected from 21 day-old broiler chicks that were fasted for 3, 5 or 7 hours or fed ad libitum (controls). Fatty acid oxidation was determined by measuring and summing 14CO2 production and 14C-labeled acid-soluble metabolites from the oxidation of [1-14C] palmitic acid. Fasting induced a progressive increase in complete fatty acid oxidation and citrate synthase activity relative to controls. These results confirm that fatty acid oxidation in white adipose tissue is dynamically controlled by nutritional status. Identifying the underlying mechanism may provide new therapeutic targets through which to increase fatty acid oxidation in situ and protect against the detrimental effects of excess free fatty acids on adipocyte insulin sensitivity.",

After extraction and identification of ASC-derived EVs (ASC-EVs), mouse cortical neuronal cells were selected to establish an in vivo cerebral ischemia/reperfusion mouse model and an in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/RP) cell model.

Neuronal cells were subjected to co-culture with ASC-EVs and biological behaviors were detected by flow cytometry, Motic Images Plus, TTC, TUNEL staining, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. ASC-EVs protected neuronal cells against neuronal damage following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, which was related to transfer of miR-26a into neuronal cells. In neuronal cells, miR-26a targeted KLF9. KLF9 could suppress the expression of TRAF2 and KLF2 to facilitate neuronal damage. In vitro and in vivo results showed that miR-26a delivered by ASC-EVs inhibited neuronal damage. In summary, ASC-EVs-derived miR-26a can arrest neuronal damage by disrupting the KLF9-meidated suppression on TRAF2/KLF2 axis.",

Decreased mitochondrial abundance and function were found in white adipose tissue (WAT) of T2DM patients.

Salvianolic acid A (SAA) has been found to exert anti-diabetic and lipid disorder-improving effects. However whether SAA benefits mitochondrial biogenesis and function in adipose tissue is unclear. Here, we evaluated SAA's effect on mitochondrial biogenesis and function in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and investigated its potential regulatory mechanism. Results showed that SAA treatment significantly promoted the transcription and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator- 1α (PGC-1α), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Meanwhile, SAA treatment significantly promoted mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) quantity, mitochondrial mass, and expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes III and complex IV. These enhancements were accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC and were suppressed by Compound C, a specific AMPK inhibitor. Furthermore, SAA treatment improved adipocytes mitochondrial respiration and stimulated ATP generation. These findings indicate that SAA exerts a potential therapeutic capacity against adipocytes mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetes by activating the AMPK-PGC-1α pathway.",

    "abstract": "Critical-size defects (CSDs) are challenging oral clinical issues that need to be solved. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) and gene therapy offer a new target to solve these issues. Consequently, ADSCs attract more and more attention because of advantages such as easy obtainability and no ethical concerns. TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is a significant binding protein both of tumour necrosis factor superfamily and of the toll/interleukin-1 receptor superfamily. Evidence is accumulating that TRAF6 inhibited osteoclast formation and promoted the proliferation of multiple myeloma cell lines and bone resorption. Here, we reported that overexpression of TRAF6 enhanced the proliferation, migration and osteogenesis of ADSCs through Raf-Erk-Merk-Hif1a pathway. Cell sheet of ADSCs combined with TRAF6 accelerated the healing of CSDs. In a word, TRAF6 enhanced osteogenesis, migration and proliferation through Raf-Erk-Merk-Hif1a pathway.",

In this study, we explore the role of CABLES1 in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in human subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). We performed gene expression analysis of SAT obtained from subjects with and without T2D, and from a second validation cohort consisting of subjects without T2D. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to perform CABLES1 loss-of-function studies in human primary preadipocytes and assessed them functionally after differentiation. CABLES1 gene expression in SAT was decreased in T2D by almost 25%, and inversely associated with insulin resistance markers and hyperglycaemia. mRNA levels were reduced with increasing BMI and negatively correlated with obesity markers. We found that adipocytes are likely the main CABLES1-expressing cell type in SAT, but CABLES1 depletion in adipocytes caused no phenotypical changes in regards to differentiation, glucose uptake, or expression of key genes of adipocyte function. These findings suggest that CABLES1 gene expression in SAT might be altered in obesity and T2D as a consequence of metabolic dysregulation rather than being a causal factor.",

Differences in BAT thermogenesis can underlie significant differences in body weight and body composition, as we demonstrate in a rat model of obesity. This mini-review focuses on our current understanding of physiological BAT regulation, with a view to how it may be exploited therapeutically. BAT activation is under central nervous system control, with the most potent activator of BAT being the sympathetic nervous system, although other humoral and hormonal factors also contribute to BAT regulation. The peptide products of the proglucagon gene are important in energy homeostasis, with well-described effects on feeding and body weight. We recently demonstrated that the peptides glucagon-like peptide 1, glucagon, and oxyntomodulin are also able to induce BAT thermogenesis by a central, sympathetic mechanism. Given the wide spread use of GLP-1 receptor based therapies for type 2 diabetes, drugs targeting this system may be useful in a wider energy balance context.",

Research design Eleven-month-old male wild-type (WT) and adiponectin knockout (ADKO) mice were placed on chow or high fat diet for 12 weeks. The changes in ER stress and inflammatory genes were determined in the epididymal adipose, as well as heart tissue of adult WT and ADKO mice. To understand the role of ER/SR stress in the regulation of adiponectin, we studied the effect of tunicamycin or palmitate on H9C2 cardiomyoblasts in culture. To demonstrate the protective role of adiponectin, we studied the effect of purified adiponectin on the regulation of ERSR stress genes and inflammation in H9C2 cardiomyoblasts. Results (1) High fat diet increased TNFα in adipose tissue of ADKO mice. (2) ERSR stress genes, HSPa5, ERN1, and GADD34, and inflammation response genes, TNFα and CD68, were increased in heart of ADKO mice. High fat diet did not further increase the effect. (3) Induction of ERSR stress by tunicamycin in H9C2 resulted in the upregulation of ERSR stress response genes along with downregulation of adiponectin, adiponectin receptors 1 and 2, and Serca2A. ER stress was accompanied by down regulation of Iкβα and an increase in HSPa5 proteins. (4) Adiponectin decreased ERSR stress and inflammation response genes and increased Serca2A in to H9C2 cardiomyoblasts. Conclusion The lack of adiponectin is associated with increased ER/SR stress and inflammation in the heart. Adiponectin provides a protective effect by lowering inflammation and ER/SR stress along with increasing Serca2A in H9C2 cells.",

    "abstract": "Early studies reported that the size of adipose cells positively correlates with insulin resistance, but recent evidence suggests that the relationship between adipose cell size and insulin resistance is more complex. We previously reported that among BMI-matched moderately obese subjects who were either insulin sensitive or resistant insulin resistance correlated with the proportion of small adipose cells, rather than the size of the large adipose cells, whereas the size of large adipose cells was found to be a predictor of insulin resistance in the first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. The relationship between adipose cellularity and insulin resistance thus appears to depend on the metabolic state of the individual. We did a longitudinal study with T2D patients treated with the insulin-sensitizer rosiglitazone to test the hypothesis that improved insulin sensitivity is associated with increased adipocyte size. Eleven T2D patients were recruited and treated with rosiglitazone for 90 days. Blood samples and needle biopsies of abdominal subcutaneous fat were taken at six time points and analyzed for cell size distributions. Rosiglitazone treatment ameliorated insulin resistance as evidenced by significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose and increased index of insulin sensitivity, QUICKI. In association with this, we found significantly increased size of the large adipose cells and, with a weaker effect, increased proportion of small adipose cells. We conclude rosiglitazone treatment both enlarges existing large adipose cells and recruits new small adipose cells in T2D patients, improving fat storage capacity in adipose tissue and thus systemic insulin sensitivity.",

In this study we identify physiological triggers of ER stress and of the UPR in adipocytes in vitro. We show that two markers of adipose tissue remodelling in obesity, glucose starvation and hypoxia, cause ER stress in 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Both conditions induced molecular markers of the IRE1α and PERK branches of the UPR, such as splicing of XBP1 mRNA and CHOP, as well as transcription of the ER stress responsive gene BiP. Hypoxia also induced an increase in phosphorylation of the PERK substrate eIF2α. By contrast, physiological triggers of ER stress in many other cell types, such as the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid, cholesterol, or several inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, do not cause ER stress in 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our data suggest that physiological changes associated with remodelling of adipose tissue in obesity, such as hypoxia and glucose starvation, are more likely physiological ER stressors of adipocytes than the lipid overload or hyperinsulinemia associated with obesity.",

In order to investigate the connections between obesity-associated oxidative stress in adipocytes and increased inflammation in adipose tissue associated with the development of insulin resistance, our laboratory recently demonstrated that adipocytes form glutathionylated products of oxidative stress including glutathionyl-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (GS-HNE) and glutathionyl-1,4-dihydroxynonene (GS-DHN). The abundance of both GS-HNE and GS-DHN were increased in the visceral adipose tissue of ob/ob mice and diet-induced obese, insulin-resistant mice. Further, these products of lipid peroxidation were shown to induce inflammatory changes in macrophages. Finally, in a mouse model, overproduction of GS-HNE was associated with increased fasting glucose levels and moderately impaired glucose tolerance. Together, these findings suggest a novel mechanism by which obesity-induced oxidative stress in adipocytes may lead to activation of tissue-resident macrophages. As adipose tissue inflammation has been shown to play an important role in the development of insulin resistance, further study of this pathway may lead to potential interventions to attenuate the metabolic consequences of obesity.",

Through these interactions, pfn integrates signaling from a diverse array of extracellular cues with actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Cumulating evidence indicates that changes in pfn levels are associated and may play a pathogenic role in such inflammatory diseases as atherosclerosis and glomerulonephritis. We recently demonstrated that high fat diet (HFD) increases pfn expression in the white adipose tissue (WAT), but not in the liver or the muscle. Pfn heterozygote mice (PfnHet) were protected against HFD-induced glucose intolerance, and WAT and systemic inflammation, when compared to pfn wild-type mice. In addition to blunted accumulation of macrophages and reduced \"pro-inflammatory\" cytokines, the WAT of PfnHet exhibited preserved frequency of regulatory T cells. These findings suggest that pfn levels in WAT-both adipocytes and hematopoietic-derived cells-can modulate immune homeostasis within the WAT and glucose tolerance systemically. Here, we review the interaction of pfn with his diverse array of binding partners and discuss mechanisms that may underlie the effects of pfn dosage on insulin sensitivity and metabolic inflammation.",

In the white adipose tissue microenvironment, macrophages/adipocytes cross-talk have been shown to influence the metabolic and inflammatory states of both cell types, and contribute to the development of systemic insulin resistance during obesity. Indeed, the existence of paracrine loops between mature adipocytes and macrophages, especially during obesity-induced stress, involving the release of, and response to, an array of cytokines and regulatory factors, have been extensively studied using several in vitro and in vivo model systems. Published evidence together with recent observations, brought to light the unexpected role of erythropoietin and its receptor in the regulation of white adipose tissue mass, energy homeostasis, and inflammation as demonstrated by erythropoietin effects on adipocyte development and metabolic profile, and macrophage infiltration, cytokine responses, and activation state during diet-induced obesity. In this commentary, we discuss the newly added elements and perspectives to our understanding of the erythropoietin/erythropoietin-receptor axis as a regulator of obesity-induced white adipose tissue inflammation, providing insight into its effects on cytokine responses of macrophages and adipocytes, and possible links to glucose metabolism and insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) supplementation therapy to adults with GH deficiency has beneficial effects on adipose tissue lipid metabolism, improving thus adipocyte functional morphology and insulin sensitivity. However, molecular nature of these effects remains unclear. We therefore tested the hypothesis that lipid-mobilizing adipokine zinc-α2-glycoprotein is causally linked to GH effects on adipose tissue lipid metabolism. Seventeen patients with severe GH deficiency examined before and after the 5-year GH replacement therapy were compared with age-, gender- and BMI-matched healthy controls. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp was used to assess whole-body and adipose tissue-specific insulin sensitivity. Glucose tolerance was determined by oGTT, visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adiposity by MRI, adipocyte size morphometrically after collagenase digestion, lipid accumulation and release was studied in differentiated human primary adipocytes in association with GH treatment and zinc-α2-glycoprotein gene silencing. Five-year GH replacement therapy improved glucose tolerance, adipose tissue insulin sensitivity and reduced adipocyte size without affecting adiposity and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Adipose tissue zinc-α2-glycoprotein expression was positively associated with whole-body and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity and negatively with adipocyte size. GH treatment to adipocytes in vitro increased zinc-α2-glycoprotein expression (>50%) and was paralleled by enhanced lipolysis and decreased triglyceride accumulation (>35%). Moreover, GH treatment improved antilipolytic action of insulin in cultured adipocytes. Most importantly, silencing zinc-α2-glycoprotein eliminated all of the GH effects on adipocyte lipid metabolism. Effects of 5-year GH supplementation therapy on adipose tissue lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity are associated with zinc-α2-glycoprotein. Presence of this adipokine is required for the GH action on adipocyte lipid metabolism in vitro.",

ALK7 and activated Smads 2, 3, and 4 inhibit the master regulators of adipogenesis, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) specifically in differentiated adipocytes, but surprisingly increase both the adipocyte size and lipid content by suppressing lipolysis. Here, we show that, although both transcription factors are suppressed by ALK7 in either the obese or lean state, PPARγ, but not C/EBPα, is further suppressed under obesity through an ALK7-independent pathway. As a result, PPARγ and adipose lipolytic activities are severely downregulated in obesity. Reactivation of PPARγ by ALK7 inactivation leads to downregulation of inflammatory adipocytokines and upregulation of adiponectin. We propose that PPARγ promotes lipid turnover and remodeling by stimulating both triglyceride synthesis and breakdown in differentiated adipocytes. Finally, we discuss the physiological and evolutionary roles of the ALK7-signaling pathway and consider it as a potential target of therapy for obesity.",

These studies further demonstrate that adipose tissue stroma contains a resident population of myeloid cells capable of adipocyte and multilineage mesenchymal differentiation. These resident myeloid cells lack hematopoietic markers and express mesenchymal and progenitor cell markers. Because bone marrow mesenchymal progenitor cells have not been shown to enter the circulation, we hypothesized that myeloid cells acquire mesenchymal differentiation capacity in adipose tissue. We fabricated a 3-dimensional fibrin matrix culture system to define the adipose differentiation potential of adipose tissue-resident myeloid subpopulations, including macrophages, granulocytes and dendritic cells. Our data show that multilineage mesenchymal potential was limited to adipose tissue macrophages, characterized by the acquisition of adipocyte, osteoblast, chondrocyte and skeletal muscle myocyte phenotypes. Fibrin hydrogel matrices stimulated macrophage loss of hematopoietic cell lineage determinants and the expression of mesenchymal and progenitor cell markers, including integrin β1. Ablation of integrin β1 in macrophages inhibited adipocyte specification. Therefore, some bona fide adipocytes are specifically derived from adipose tissue-resident macrophages via an integrin β1-dependent hematopoietic-to-mesenchymal transition, whereby they become capable of multipotent mesenchymal differentiation. The requirement for integrin β1 highlights this molecule as a potential target for controlling the production of marrow-derived adipocytes and their contribution to adipose tissue development and function.",

    "abstract": "Stromal/stem cell differentiation is controlled by a vast array of regulatory mechanisms. Included within these are methods of mRNA gene regulation that occur at the level of epigenetic, transcriptional, and/or posttranscriptional modifications. Current studies that evaluate the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA demonstrate microRNAs (miRNAs) as key mediators of stem cell differentiation through the inhibition of mRNA translation. miRNA expression is enhanced during both adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation; however, the mechanism by which miRNA expression is altered during stem cell differentiation is less understood. Here we demonstrate for the first time that adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) induced to an adipogenic or osteogenic lineage have differences in strand preference (-3p and -5p) for miRNAs originating from the same primary transcript. Furthermore, evaluation of miRNA expression in ASCs demonstrates alterations in both miRNA strand preference and 5'seed site heterogeneity. Additionally, we show that during stem cell differentiation there are alterations in expression of genes associated with the miRNA biogenesis pathway. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated changes in the Argonautes (AGO1-4), Drosha, and Dicer at intervals of ASC adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation compared to untreated ASCs. Specifically, we demonstrated altered expression of the AGOs occurring during both adipogenesis and osteogenesis, with osteogenesis increasing AGO1-4 expression and adipogenesis decreasing AGO1 gene and protein expression. These data demonstrate changes to components of the miRNA biogenesis pathway during stromal/stem cell differentiation. Identifying regulatory mechanisms for miRNA processing during ASC differentiation may lead to novel mechanisms for the manipulation of lineage differentiation of the ASC through the global regulation of miRNA as opposed to singular regulatory mechanisms.",

Food reward consists of two branches: gustatory and post-ingestive nutritive information. Drosophila lacking dSLC5A11 (sodium/glucose cotransporter 6-SGLT6) prefer L-glucose over D-glucose independently of their state of satiety. Human SGLT6 is an active transporter of myo-inositol and D-glucose. We investigated expression of SGLT6 in human tissue and found a significant expression in the small intestine and brain. The preference between a metabolizable and a non-metabolizable sugar was tested in 3 mouse models with a selective and potent SGLT6 inhibitor. No influence on sugar preference was seen with SGLT6 inhibition. These studies suggest that SGLT6 does not play a significant role in nutrient sensing in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Rho-associated kinases (ROCKs) have been reported to antagonize adipocyte differentiation, and inhibition of ROCKs by small molecules promotes adipogenesis. Surprisingly, our recent study revealed that the ROCK2-specific inhibitor KD025 (SLx-2119), suppresses differentiation at the intermediate stage in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. To address whether the anti-adipogenic activity of KD025 is a generalizable property, we examined the effect of KD025 in human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs). KD025 significantly suppressed the adipocyte differentiation of hADSCs with downregulation of the protein and mRNA expression of various adipogenic and lipogenic markers, including PPARγ, C/EBPα, SREBP-1c, Glut4 and FABP4. Notably, we observed that adipocyte differentiation is effectively suppressed by exposure to KD025 during the mid-to-late period of adipogenesis but not at the earlier stages, showing stage-specificity. Contrary to expectations, KD025 upregulated the insulin signaling, as confirmed by the increased phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK-3α/β, and the differentiation-promoting activity of insulin signaling was observed to be overwhelmed by the inhibitory activity. In addition, we observed that other ROCK inhibitors (Y-27632, fasudil, and H-1152P) did not suppress but promoted adipocyte differentiation. These results indicate that KD025 suppresses adipocyte differentiation by modulation of key factors activated at the intermediate stage of differentiation, and not by inhibition of ROCK2.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence highlights the importance of interactions between tumour cells and stromal cells for tumour initiation, progression, and metastasis. In tumours that contain adipocyte in their stroma, adipocytes contribute to modification of tumour microenvironment and affect metabolism of tumour and tumour progression by production of cytokines and adipokines from the lipids. The omentum and bone marrow (BM) are highly adipocyte-rich and are also common metastatic and primary tumour developmental sites. Omental adipocytes exhibit metabolic cross-talk, immune modulation, and angiogenesis. BM adipocytes secrete adipokines, and participate in solid tumour metastasis through regulation of the CCL2/CCR2 axis and metabolic interactions. BM adipocytes also contribute to the progression of hematopoietic neoplasms. Here, we here provide an overview of research progress on the cross-talks between omental/BM adipocytes and tumour cells, which may be pivotal modulators of tumour biology, thus highlighting novel therapeutic targets.

Fasting blood samples were collected. Body composition was measured using DXA. An individualized cooling protocol was utilized to activate BAT prior to imaging with PET/CT.Results: There was an inverse relationship between fasting serum glucose and BAT volume (r = -0.40, p = 0.048). A marginally significant inverse relationship was also noted between fasting glucose and total BAT activity (r = -0.40, p = 0.05). In addition, a positive correlation was observed between serum FGF21 and SUVmax (r = 0.51, p = 0.01). No significant correlations were noted for measures of BAT activity or volume and other indicators of adiposity or glucose metabolism.Conclusions: The presence of active BAT may be associated with lower fasting glucose in young men. BAT activity may also be correlated with levels of FGF21, suggesting that BAT may lower glucose levels via an FGF21 dependent pathway. Further studies are needed to clarify mechanisms by which BAT may impact glucose metabolism.",

Mice with an adipocyte-specific deletion of HuR (Adipo-HuR−/-) were generated by crossing HuR floxed (HuRfl/fl) mice with mice expressing adiponectin-driven cre-recombinase (Adipoq-cre). Our results show that Adipo-HuR−/- mice display a lean phenotype compared to wild-type littermate controls. HuR deletion results in a diet-independent reduction in percent body fat composition along with an increase in energy expenditure. Functionally, Adipo-HuR−/- mice show a significant impairment in acute adaptive thermogenesis (six hours at 4°C), but uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) protein expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is unchanged compared to control. Pharmacological inhibition of HuR also results in a marked decline in core body temperature following acute cold challenge independent of UCP1 protein expression. Among the 588 HuR-dependent genes in BAT identified by RNA-seq analysis, gene ontology analysis shows a significant enrichment in mediators of calcium transport and signalling, almost all of which are decreased in Adipo-HuR−/- mice compared to control. In conclusion, adipocyte expression of HuR plays a central role in metabolic homoeostasis and mediates UCP1-independent thermogenesis in BAT, potentially through post-transcriptional control of intracellular calcium transport.Abbreviations: Adipo-HuR−/-: Adipocyte-specific HuR deletion mice; BAT: Brown adipose tissue; HuR: Human antigen R; UCP1: Uncoupling protein 1",

In this context, small molecule adiponectin receptor agonists have become of great therapeutic value for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Here, we investigated the effects of the adiponectin mimetic compound ALY688 on WAT metabolism. To accomplish this, rat epididymal (Epid) and subcutaneous inguinal (Sc Ing) adipocytes were isolated and incubated with ALY688. Subsequently, several parameters of glucose and fat metabolism were assessed. ALY688 promoted AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation, enhanced glucose oxidation, and suppressed fat oxidation in adipocytes from both fat depots. ALY688 did not affect basal and insulin-stimulated rates of glucose uptake, glucose incorporation into lipids, and AKTSer473 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylations in either Epid or Sc Ing adipocytes. ALY688 did not alter basal lipolysis in Epid and Sc Ing adipocytes, but it enhanced isoproterenol-induced lipolysis in Epid adipocytes. Adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2) mRNA was the prevalent isoform expressed in all adipocytes, and Epid adipocytes displayed significantly higher AdipoR2 mRNA expression than Sc Ing adipocytes. In conclusion, ALY688 can regulate adiposity and affect glycaemic control by altering substrate portioning in the WAT in a fat depot-specific manner.",

It is suggested that imbalanced diets can cause PVAT inflammation and dysfunction as well as impaired vascular function. However, the association between diets and PVAT are not clearly understood. Here, we showed that a high-fat and a high-sucrose diet affected PVAT at different sites. A high-fat diet induced increased number of large-sized lipid droplets and increased CD (Cluster of differentiation) 68+ macrophage- and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1-positive areas in the abdominal aortic PVAT (aPVAT). In addition, a high-fat diet caused decreased collagen fibre-positive area and increased CD68+ macrophage- and MCP-1-positive areas in the abdominal aorta. In contrast, a high-sucrose diet induced increased number of large-sized lipid droplets, increased CD68+ macrophage- and MCP-1-positive areas, and decreased UCP-1 positive area in the thoracic aortic PVAT (tPVAT). A high-sucrose diet caused decreased collagen fibre-positive area and increased CD68+ macrophage- and MCP-1-positive areas in the thoracic aorta. These results could be attributed to the different adipocyte populations in the tPVAT and aPVAT.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Adipokines, expressed by adipose tissue (AT), have been associated with metabolic disturbances and coronary artery disease (CAD). The impact of exercise training on the AT in patients suffering from both diabetes and CAD is unknown. To gain knowledge on changes in ATs' inflammatory profile in such a population, we investigated the effects of long-term exercise on selected adipokines and their associations with physical performance and glucometabolic variables. Adiponectin was selected based on its anti-atherogenic and anti-diabetic properties and visfatin and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) for their association with atherosclerosis and metabolic disorders. Not many studies have focused on the effects of long-term exercise training on adipokines in patients with concomitant T2DM and CAD. Methods: Patients with type 2 diabetes and CAD (n = 137), 41–81 years, 17.2% females, were randomized in a 1:1 manner to an exercise group, who underwent 1 year of 150 min weekly combined strength and endurance exercise, or a control group. AT from the gluteal region and blood samples were obtained at baseline and after 12 months, along with a physical performance test, assessed by the VO2 peak. Circulating protein levels were measured by ELISA. RNA was extracted from AT and expression levels were relatively quantified by PCR. Results: After 1 year, no significant difference in the change in the investigated markers between the intervention group and the control group was observed. Changes in circulating adiponectin and VO2 peak correlated in the total population (r = 0.256, p = 0.008). At baseline, circulating adiponectin and TNF correlated inversely with insulin and with C-peptide and VO2peak, respectively (p < 0.001, all). Conclusion: In this population with concomitant diabetes and CAD, ATs' inflammatory profile remained unchanged apparently after 1 year of exercise intervention. Changes in the VO2peak were nevertheless, related to changes in circulating adiponectin levels. Trial registration: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01232608.",

In NAFLD, women displayed significantly more fibrosis in vWAT than men, and collagen 1α mRNA expression was significantly upregulated. The degrees of fibrosis in vWAT and liver tissue correlated significantly. The size of vWAT-resident adipocytes in NAFLD correlated negatively with the local degree of fibrosis. The extent of apoptosis, as measured by circulating M30, positively correlated with the degree of fibrosis in vWAT; necrosis-associated HMGB1 mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in vWAT and liver tissue; (iii) necroptosis-related RIPK-3 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in vWAT; and autophagy-related LC3 mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in vWAT, while upregulated in the liver. Thus, the different cell death mechanisms in the vWAT in NAFLD are regulated independently while not ruling out their interaction.

However, the major target organ of RA is unknown. We performed chronic administration of RA in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice. Further, hepatic and adipose cells were used to study the direct effect of RA on lipid metabolism. In addition, qRT-PCR was performed to examine differential gene expression in mouse adipose tissue. RA administration ameliorated NAFLD in HFD-induced obese mice and increased mouse energy expenditure. Although RA had therapeutic effects on liver histology and lipid accumulation, it did not directly affect lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells. In contrast, RA reduced the weight of several adipose tissues and improved lipid accumulation in OP9 cells. In addition, RA upregulated genes responsible for fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis in three different WATs. Our work suggests that the liver may not be the main target organ of RA during NAFLD treatment. WAT browning induced by RA may be the primary contributor towards the amelioration of NAFLD in HFD-induced obese mice.",

Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine like 1(SPARCL1) is a secreted glycoprotein with important physiological functions and is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of various cells. However, the role of the SPARCL1 gene in sheep preadipocytes and its regulatory mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we explored the effect of SPARCL1 on the proliferation and differentiation of sheep preadipocytes. The results showed that the expression level of the SPARCL1 gene is higher in fat tissue than in other tissues, and the gene was significantly increased on the 6th day of preadipocyte differentiation. In the preadipocyte proliferation stage, interference of SPARCL1 gene reduced cell viability and increased cell apoptosis. In preadipocyte differentiation stage, SPARCL1 overexpression significantly inhibited lipid droplets accumulation and triglyceride content by increasing Wnt10b, Fzd8, IL6, and β-catenin and inhibiting PPARγ, C/EBPα, LPL, and IGF1 genes expression, whereas SPARCL1 deficiency significantly promoted cell differentiation by inhibiting β-catenin and increasing GSK3β, PPARγ, C/EBPα, and LPL. The results of this study suggest that SPARCL1 plays a negative role during preadipocyte differentiation and may become a novel target for regulating preadipocyte differentiation and improving IMF.Abbreviations: IMF: Intramuscular fat SPARCL1: Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine like 1 PPARγ: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ C/EBPα: CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α LPL: Lipoprotein lipase IGF1: Insulin-like growth factor 1 Wnt10b: Wnt family member 10B Fzd8: Frizzled class receptor 8 IL6: Interleukin 6 β-catenin: Catenin beta interacting protein 1 GSK3β: Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta LRP5/6: Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6",

ADSC adipogenic differentiation is controlled by the activation of a specific transcriptional program, including epigenetic factors and key adipogenic genes. Under certain conditioned media, ADSCs can differentiate into several phenotypes. We previously demonstrated that bioactive molecules could counteract lipid accumulation and regulate adipogenesis, acting on inflammation and vitamin D metabolism. In the present paper, we aimed at evaluating the effect of metformin and vitamin D in targeting ADSC differentiation towards an intermediate phenotype, as beige adipocytes. We exposed ADSCs to different conditioned media and then we evaluated the levels of expression of main markers of adipogenesis, aP2, LPL and ACOT2. We also analysed the gene and protein expression of thermogenic UCP1 protein, and the expression of PARP1 and the beige specific marker TMEM26. Our results showed a novel effect of metformin and vitamin D not only in inhibiting adipogenesis, but also in inducing a specific 'brown-like' phenotype. These findings pave the way for their possible application in the control of de novo lipogenesis useful for the prevention of obesity and its related metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic disorders related to obesity are largely dependent on adipose tissue hypertrophy, which involves adipocyte hypertrophy and increased adipogenesis. Adiposize is regulated by lipid accumulation as a result of increased lipogenesis (mainly lipid uptake in mature adipocytes) and reduced lipolysis. Using realtime 2D cell culture analyses of lipid uptake, we show (1) that high glucose concentration (4.5 g/L) was required to accumulate oleic acid increasing lipid droplet size until unilocularization similar to mature adipocytes in few days, (2) oleic acid reduced Peroxisome-Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARG) gene transcription and (3) insulin counteracted oleic acid-induced increase of lipid droplet size. Although the lipolytic activity observed in high versus low glucose (1 g/L) conditions was not altered, insulin was found to inhibit oleic acid induced gene transcription required for lipid storage such as Cell Death Inducing DFFA Like Effectors (CIDEC) and G0S2 (G0 switch gene S2), possibly through PPARA activity. Although this signalling pathway requires more detailed investigation, the results point out the differential mechanisms involved in the pro-adipogenic effect of insulin in absence versus its protective effect on adiposity in presence of oleic acid uptake.Abbreviations: AICAR, 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-D-ribofuranoside; AMPK, AMP-Activated protein kinase, ASCs, adipose stem cell; ATGL, adipose triglyceride lipase; BSA, Bovine serum albumin; CEBPA, CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; CIDEs, Cell Death Inducing DFFA Like Effectors; dA, differentiated adipocyte; DMEM, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium; FABPs, Fatty Acid Binding Proteins; FAT/CD36, Fatty acid translocase; FCS, Foetal calf serum; FN1, fibronectin 1; FFA, free fatty acid; G0S2, G0 switch gene S2; GLUTs, Glucose transporters; GPR120, G protein-coupled receptor 120; HG, high glucose; HSL, hormone sensitive lipase; INSR, insulin receptor; LG, low glucose; OA, oleic acid; PBS, Phosphate buffer saline; PPARs, Peroxisome-Proliferator Activated Receptors; PKA, Protein kinase cyclic AMP-dependent; PKG, Protein kinase cyclic GMP dependent; PTGS2, cytochrome oxidase 2; RTCA, realtime cell analysis; TG, triglyceride.",

However, the heterogeneous ASC populations of the adipose lineage constituting adipose tissue are not precisely known. In the present study, we demonstrate that cell surface expression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4)/cluster of differentiation 26 (CD26) subdivides the DLK1-/CD34+/CD45-/CD31- ASC pool of human white adipose tissues (WATs) into two large populations. Ex vivo, DPP4+ ASCs possess higher self-renewal and proliferation capacity and lesser adipocyte differentiation potential than DDP4- ASCs. The knock-down of DPP4 in ASC leads to significantly reduced proliferation and self-renewal capacity, while adipogenic differentiation is increased. Ectopic overexpression of DPP4 strongly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, in whole mount stainings of human subcutaneous (s)WAT, we detect DPP4 in CD34+ ASC located in the vascular stroma surrounding small blood vessels and in mature adipocytes. We conclude that DPP4 is a functional marker for an abundant ASC population in human WAT with high proliferation and self-renewal potential and low adipogenic differentiation capacity.",

In previous study, miR136 was showed one of differentially expressed microRNAs between preadipocytes and mature adipocytes of Small Tail Han sheep but its role in adipogenesis is still not elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of miR136 on adipogenesis and the underlying mechanism. qPCR data showed that miR136 level increased with preadipocytes proliferation while declined with preadipocytes differentiation. Moreover, miR136 mimics blocked lipid droplet formation, reduced lipid content and triglyceride accumulation while miR136 inhibitor showed the opposite effects, revealing that miR136 promoted preadipocytes proliferation but inhibited preadipocytes differentiation. Bioinformatics and biochemical validation manifested that PPARGC1B was a target of miR136. Furthermore, miR136 mimics decreased PPARγ and C/EBPα expression accompanied by PPARGC1B expression descending. Reverse effects were observed with miR136 inhibitor. Besides, overexpression of miR136 elevated IGF1 expression. Collectively, our data first exhibited a regulatory role of miR136 in adipogenesis, which is promoting preadipocytes proliferation through elevating IGF1 expression while inhibiting preadipocytes differentiation through targeting PPARGC1B and further declined PPARγ and C/EBPα expression. The modulation of PPARGC1B by miR136 may provide a new potential target for increasing intramuscular fat.",

Obesity-related changes can affect adipose RAS, predisposing to hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and possibly severe COVID-19. We evaluated the in vitro research on human adipose RAS and identified gaps in the literature. Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Web of Science, Scopus, and 1findr were searched to identify relevant studies. Fifty primary studies met our inclusion criteria for analysis. Expression of RAS components (n = 14), role in differentiation (n = 14), association with inflammation (n = 15) or blood pressure (n = 7) were investigated. We found (1) obesity-related changes in RAS were frequently studied (30%); (2) an upswing of articles investigating adipose ACE-2 expression since the COVID-19 pandemic; (3) a paucity of papers on AT2R and Ang (1–7)/MasR which counterbalance Ang II/ART1; (4) weight loss lowered adipose ACE-2 mRNA expression; and (5) angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduced deleterious effects of angiotensin II. Overall, these studies link Ang II/ATR1 signalling to impaired adipogenesis and a pro-inflammatory dysfunctional adipose tissue, with ATR1 blockade limiting these responses. ACE-2 may mitigate Ang II effects by converting it to Ang(1–7) which binds MasR. More work is needed to understand adipose RAS in various pathologic states such as obesity and COVID-19 infection.T.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in metabolic syndrome, autoimmune diseases, and many cancers. Because of adipose's role in so many aspects of human health, there is a critical need for in vitro models that replicate adipose architecture and function. Traditional monolayer models, despite their convenience, are limited, showing heterogeneity and functional differences compared to 3D models. While monolayer cultures struggle with detachment and inefficient differentiation, healthy adipocytes in 3D culture accumulate large lipid droplets, secrete adiponectin, and produce low levels of inflammatory cytokines. The shift from monolayer models to more complex 3D models aims to better replicate the physiology of healthy adipose tissue in culture. This study introduces a simple and accessible protocol for generating adipose organoids using a scaffold-free spheroid model. The method, utilizing either 96-well spheroid plates or agarose micromolds, demonstrates increased throughput, uniformity, and ease of handling compared to previous techniques. This protocol allows for diverse applications, including drug testing, toxin screening, tissue engineering, and co-culturing. The choice between the two methods depends on the experimental goals, with the 96-well plate providing individualized control and the micromold offering scale advantages. The outlined protocol covers isolation, expansion, and characterization of stromal vascular fraction cells, followed by detailed steps for spheroid formation and optional downstream analyses.",

This study evaluated the effect of silybin, the main bioactive component of silymarin, which has anti-inflammatory properties, on TNFα levels and its impact on glucose uptake in the adipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 challenged with two different inflammatory stimuli, TNFα or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Silybin's pre-treatment effect was evaluated in adipocytes pre-incubated with silybin (30 or 80 µM) before challenging with the inflammatory stimuli (TNFα or LPS). For the post-treatment effect, the adipocytes were first challenged with the inflammatory stimuli and then post-treated with silybin. After treatments, TNFα production, glucose uptake, and GLUT4 protein expression were determined. Both inflammatory stimuli increased TNFα secretion, diminished GLUT4 expression, and significantly decreased glucose uptake. Silybin 30 µM only reduced TNFα secretion after the LPS challenge. Silybin 80 µM as post-treatment or pre-treatment decreased TNFα levels, improving glucose uptake. However, glucose uptake enhancement induced by silybin did not depend on GLUT4 protein expression. These results show that silybin importantly reduced TNFα levels and upregulates glucose uptake, independently of GLUT4 protein expression.",

However, our new study has demonstrated that CCR5, a different CC chemokine receptor, plays an important role in the ATM recruitment and activation and subsequent development of insulin resistance (see the recent article in Diabetes). Although recent human studies have shown upregulation of the expression of not only MCP-1-CCR2 but also other CC chemokines and their receptors in the visceral fat of obese individuals, it is not known if CCR5 is involved in ATM recruitment and insulin resistance. This article has shown several new important observations. First, expression of CCR5 and its ligands is significantly increased and is equal to that of CCR2 and its ligands in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese mice, particularly in the macrophage fraction. Second, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis clearly demonstrates a robust increase in accumulation of CCR5(+) ATMs in response to a high fat (HF) diet. Third, and most important, two distinct models, both Ccr5 (-/-) mice and chimeric mice lacking CCR5 only in myeloid cells, are protected from insulin resistance and diabetes through reduction in ATM accumulation. Finally, it is interesting that an alternatively activated, M2-dominant shift in ATM is induced in obese Ccr5 (-/-) mice. Taken together, these data indicate that CCR5 is a novel link between obesity, adipose tissue inflammation, and insulin resistance.",

This inverse regulation occurs mainly through complex signaling crosstalk between transcriptional factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). This commentary addresses the role of myeloid elf-1 like factor (MEF) and distal-less homeobox 5 (Dlx5) in the lineage commitment of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes and osteoblasts, respectively. MEF suppresses osteoblastogenesis by preventing Runx2 from binding to the promoters of target genes and enhancing adipogenesis via transactivation of PPARγ expression. Conversely, Dlx5 enhances osteoblastogenesis through upregulation of the expression of Runx2 and osteoblast marker genes while suppressing adipogenesis through the downregulation of PPARγ expression by sequestering the cAMP response element binding protein and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α. Studies designed to examine the effects of physiological and pathologic signals on the expression of MEF and Dlx5 will provide further insight to the function of these transcription factors in vivo.",

Whether FBPase functions only in glucose metabolism or has other metabolic roles is currently unclear. In our recently published study, we examined the importance of liver FBPase in body weight regulation by performing a series of comprehensive physiological and biochemical assessments of energy balance and specific intervention studies in our transgenic mouse line that overexpresses FBPase specifically in the liver. Compared with negative littermates, these FBPase transgenic mice weighed 10% less, had 50% less adiposity, ate 15% less food but did not have altered energy expenditure. Increased circulating leptin and cholecystokinin levels, elevated fatty acid oxidation and reduced appetite stimulating neuropeptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AGRP), underpinned this phenotype. Blocking the action of FBPase returned food intake and body weight to those of the negative littermates. Our study is the first to identify liver FBPase as a previously unknown regulator of appetite and adiposity. Importantly, this work recognizes the liver as an important organ in appetite and body weight regulation. This commentary will provide further insight and expand on this novel concept that the liver does in fact play an important role in adiposity.",

Data primarily in murine models have demonstrated that adipocytes are derived from precursors present mainly in the perivascular areas of adipose tissue but their precise origin remains unclear. Subsets of cells present in bone marrow display a multipotent differentiation capacity which has prompted the hypothesis that bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) may also contribute to the adipocyte pool present in peripheral fat depots. This notion was initially demonstrated in a murine transplantation model, however, subsequent animal studies have been conflicting resulting in a debate of whether BMDCs actually differentiate into adipocytes or just fuse with resident fat cells. This controversy was recently resolved in 2 studies of human subjects undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Using a combination of different assays these data suggest that bone marrow contributes to at least 10% of the adipocyte pool. This proportion is doubled in obesity, suggesting that BMDCs may constitute a reserve pool for adipogenesis, particularly upon weight gain. This review discusses the possible mechanisms and relevance of these findings for human pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, lead to circadian disruption. We aimed at studying the effect of low doses of palmitate on circadian metabolism and to decipher the mechanism by which fatty acids convey their effect in adipocytes. Mice were fed non-obesogenic doses of palm or olive oil and adipocytes were treated with palmitate and oleate. Cultured adipocytes treated with oleate showed increased AMPK activity and induced the expression of mitochondrial genes indicating increased fatty acid oxidation, while palmitate increased ACC activity and induced the expression of lipogenic genes, indicating increased fatty acid synthesis. Low doses of palmitate were sufficient to alter circadian rhythms, due to changes in the expression and/or activity of key metabolic proteins including GSK3β and AKT. Palmitate-induced AKT and GSK3β activation led to the phosphorylation of BMAL1 that resulted in low levels as well as high amplitude of circadian clock expression. In adipocytes, the detrimental metabolic alteration of palmitate manifests itself early on even at non-obesogenic levels. This is accompanied by modulating BMAL1 expression and phosphorylation levels, which lead to dampened clock gene expression.",

Mechanisms underlying ASC trafficking have remained obscure. We recently reported that CXCL1 expressed by cancer cells chemoattracts ASC expressing CXCR1 in obesity. As a candidate mechanism of CXCL1 activation, we identified interleukin (IL)-22, systemic circulation of which is increased in obesity. It has been reported that IL-22 signaling through IL-22R is upstream of CXCL1. Here, we provide evidence that IL-22 expression by leukocytes infiltrating WAT and IL-22R expression by tumors is obesity-dependent. We propose that obesity-associated adipocyte death and the resulting recruitment of leukocytes triggers the IL-22 signaling cascade that induces CXCL1 secretion by cancer cells responsible for ASC trafficking to tumors.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue contains various types of immunocompetent cells, and these cells of innate and adaptive immunity control adipose tissue inflammation that blunts insulin sensitivity. Recent studies have shown that adipocytes express CD1d and present lipid antigen(s) to activate natural killer T (NKT) cells. The function of adipocytes is in turn modulated by cytokines that NKT cells produce to alter the expression of anti-inflammatory adipokine(s) and the production of inflammatory and chemoattractant cytokines. These in vitro studies imply that the interaction between adipocytes and NKT cells might affect the development of not only obesity but also obesity-related diseases. To test the importance of the interaction between NKT cells and adipocytes, we examined whether an adipocyte-specific CD1d deletion affected the development of obesity, which had been demonstrated with B6.CD1d-/- (CD1d KO). We found that the interaction is indeed important to induce adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in response to lipid excess. In this commentary, the advances and controversies on NKT cells and obesity are discussed based on our recent report that NKT cells play a pivotal role in the regulation of adipose tissue by communicating with adipocytes via CD1d.",

Previous work demonstrated ovariectomized (OVX) rats bred for high aerobic fitness (HCR) are protected against weight gain and IR compared to rats bred for low aerobic fitness (LCR) yet wheel running prevents OVX-induced IR in LCR rats. The purpose of this study was to determine whether adipose tissue immunometabolic characteristics from female HCR and LCR rats differs before or after OVX, and whether wheel running mitigates OVX-induced adipose tissue immunometabolic changes in LCR rats. Female OVX HCR and LCR rats were all fed a high fat diet (HFD) (n = 7–8/group) and randomized to either a running wheel or remain sedentary for 11 weeks. Ovary-intact rats (n = 7–12/group) were fed a standard chow diet with no wheel. Ovary-intact LCR rats had a greater visceral WAT inflammatory profile compared to HCR. Following OVX, sedentary LCR rats had greater serum leptin (p<0.001) and WAT inflammation (p<0.05) than sedentary HCR. Wheel running normalized the elevated serum leptin and reduced both visceral (p<0.05) and subcutaneous (p<0.03) WAT inflammatory markers in the LCR rats. Paradoxically, wheel running increased some markers of WAT inflammation in OVX HCR rats (p<0.05), which correlated with observed weight gain. Taken together, HCR rats appear to have a healthier WAT immune and metabolic profile compared to LCR, even following OVX. Wheel running improves WAT health in previously sedentary LCR rats. On the other hand, increased WAT inflammation is associated with adiposity gain despite a high volume of wheel running in HCR rats.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has become a global health-threat for every age group. It is well known that young mice (10-12 weeks of age) fed a western-type diet (WD) become obese and develop higher cholesterol levels and liver steatosis whereas insulin sensitivity is reduced. Less is known, however, about the effect of a WD on advanced-age mice. Therefore, 10 week-old (young) and 22 month-old (advanced-age), male C57BL/6JRj mice were kept on either a WD or a control diet (SFD) for 15 weeks. In contrast to young mice, advanced-age mice on WD did not show a higher body weight or adipose tissue (AT)-masses, suggesting a protection against diet-induced obesity. Furthermore, plasma adiponectin and leptin levels were not affected upon WD-feeding. A WD, however, did induce more hepatic lipid accumulation as well as increased hepatic expression of the macrophage marker F4/80, in advanced-age mice. There were no significant differences in mRNA levels of uncoupling protein-1 or F4/80 in brown AT (BAT) or of several intestinal integrity markers in colon suggesting that the protection against obesity is not due to excessive BAT or to impaired intestinal absorption of fat. Thus, advanced-age mice, in contrast to their younger counterparts, appeared to be protected against diet-induced obesity.",

Therefore the aim of the present study was the development and validation of an in vitro multiculture model allowing to measure intestinal absorption using adipocytes as lipid sensors. We previously described (1) novel methods to study oleic acid induction of adipogenesis and lipogenesis and (2) a functional reconstituted intestinal barrier using human cell lines Caco-2/HT29-MTX (9:1). In the present study we develop a co-culture model with either adipocytes or hepatocytes as sensors for intestinal lipid absorption. This model was validated using oleic acid (OA) pre-absorbed onto the intestinal barrier. Optimized experimental conditions were obtained with partially differentiated 3T3L1-MBX adipocytes sensing up to 5 μM OA in solution or 40 μM OA pre-absorbed by Caco2/HT29-MTX intestinal barriers. Metabolism including glycemia and insulinemia greatly influenced the ability to TG accumulation in adipocytes. By comparison AML12 hepatocytes found less sensitive to OA (up to 1 μM). The present study demonstrates a much better functionality for fatty acid uptake and release in Caco2/HT29-MTX versus Caco-2 intestinal barriers. Taken together these results open new opportunities to study in vitro lipid transfer between intestinal barriers and either adipocytes or hepatocytes.Abbreviations: BSA: Bovine serum albumin; CIDEs: Cell Death Inducing DFFA Like Effectors; DMEM, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium; FABPs: Fatty Acid Binding Proteins; FAT/CD36: Fatty acid translocase; FCS: Fetal calf serum; GLP2: Glucagon-like peptide-2; NAFLD: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; OA: oleic acid; PBS: Phosphate buffer saline; PPARs: Peroxisome-Proliferator Activated Receptors; RTCA: realtime cell analysis; TG: triglyceride",

However, whether and how low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) could be used for inhibiting visceral adipocyte differentiation is not fully understood. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect and associated mechanism of LIPUS on primary visceral preadipocyte differentiation and explore its potential role for clinical visceral obesity management. The preadipocytes were daily exposed to LIPUS (0.5 MHz, 1.2 MPa) for 10 min. Adipogenic differentiation was estimated by the formation of lipid droplets and the levels of adipogenic transcriptional factors and representative markers. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) member proteins and histone acetylation-related molecules were measured by western blotting. LIPUS stimulation with an average acoustic pressure of 1.2 MPa led to a prominent inhibition of adipogenic differentiation and expression of adipogenic markers. As a mechanism, LIPUS treatment increased the nuclear levels of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and decreased the acetylation of histone 3 and histone 4. Meanwhile, the inhibition of the HDAC1 could block the inhibitory effect of LIPUS on adipogenic differentiation via increasing AcH3 and AcH4 levels. Our study may provide an ultrasound-based promising strategy for clinical visceral obesity control.",

Herein, we assessed if oestrogens, including oestrone (E1), oestradiol (E2) and oestriol (E3), are associated with A-FABP in the obesity-related BC development. We collected 249 serum samples from women with or without BC and measured serum levels of E1, E2, E3 and A-FABP. Considering all subjects, E1 and E2 but not E3 levels were significantly higher in pre- than in postmenopause individuals. E3 and E1 levels were higher in non-obese than in obese women. When samples were separated by BC status, E2 levels were significantly higher, while E1 and E3 levels were significantly lower in postmenopausal obese than non-obese women without BC. These differences based on body mass index (BMI) were not observed among women with BC. E3 levels were higher in obese women with BC than those without. A-FABP levels were significantly higher in postmenopausal obese women regardless of BC status. In addition, A-FABP was not associated with E1, E2 or E3. Altogether, our data suggest that A-FABP is independently regulated by obesity and menopausal status compared to oestrogens, thus playing a unique role in the development of BC.",

These mice are unable to synthesize cholic acid, resulting in increased synthesis of chenodeoxycholic acid and enlarged bile acid pool. Cyp8b1−/- mice were found to be protected against high-fat diet induced obesity. Bomb calorimetry measurements showed increased faecal energy output in Cyp8b1−/mice. Indirect calorimetry measurements demonstrated increased energy expenditure in Cyp8b1−/- mice. Meal tolerance tests revealed no differences in glucose disposal, but the insulin response was lower in Cyp8b1−/- mice. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests, as well as static incubations of isolated islets, showed no difference between the groups, whereas insulin tolerance tests demonstrated improved insulin sensitivity in Cyp8b1−/- mice. The genes encoding mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and type 2-iodothyronine deiodinase were upregulated in brown adipose tissue of Cyp8b1/- mice and Western blot analyses showed increased abundance of TFAM, and a trend towards increased abundance of UCP1. The upregulation of TFAM and UCP1 was accompanied by increased mitochondrial density, as shown by transmission electron microscopy. White adipocytes of Cyp8b1−/- mice exhibited increased responsiveness to both catecholamines and insulin in lipolysis experiments and increased insulin-stimulated lipogenesis. In conclusion, increased energy expenditure, mitochondrial density of brown adipocytes and faecal energy output may all contribute to the protection against diet-induced obesity of Cyp8b1−/- mice. Enhanced insulin sensitivity of Cyp8b1−/- mice is accompanied by increased hormonal responsiveness of white adipocytes.",

WAT is the main source of stored energy and releases fatty acids in times of energy demand, whereas BAT plays a role in regulating non-shivering thermogenesis and oxidizes fatty acids released from the lipid droplet. The PLIN family of proteins has recently emerged as being integral in the regulation of fatty acid storage and release in adipose tissue. Previous work has demonstrated that PLIN protein content varies among adipose tissue depots, however an examination of endurance training-induced depot specific changes in PLIN protein expression has yet to be done. Male Sprague-dawley rats (n = 10) underwent 8-weeks of progressive treadmill training (18-25 m/min for 30-60 min at 10% incline) or remained sedentary as control. Following training, under isoflurane induced anesthesia epidydmal (eWAT), inguinal subcutaneous (iWAT) and intrascapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) was excised, and plasma was collected. Endurance training resulted in an increase in BAT PLIN5 and iWAT PLIN3 content, while there was no difference in PLIN protein content in endurance trained eWAT. Interestingly, endurance training resulted in a robust increase in ATGL and CGI-58 in eWAT alone. Together these results suggest the potential of a depot specific function of PLIN3 and PLIN5 in adipose tissue in response to endurance training.",

Besides their thermogenic function, brown adipocytes are able to secrete adipokines. One of these is visfatin, a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase involved in nicotinamide dinucleotide synthesis, which is known to participate in the synthesis of insulin by pancreatic β cells. In a therapeutic context, it is of interest to establish whether a potential correlation exists between brown adipocyte activation and/or brite adipocyte recruitment, and adipokine expression. We analyzed visfatin expression, as a pre-requisite to its secretion, in rodent and human biopsies and cell models of brown/brite adipocytes. We found that visfatin was preferentially expressed in mature adipocytes and that this expression was higher in brown adipose tissue of rodents compared to other fat depots. However, using various rodent models we were unable to find any correlation between visfatin expression and brown or brite adipocyte activation or recruitment. Interestingly, the situation is different in humans where visfatin expression was found to be equivalent between white and brown or brite adipocytes in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, visfatin can be considered only as a rodent brown adipocyte biomarker, independently of tissue activation.",

A previous study identified that the expression of miR-33a is different in intramuscular fat (IMF) tissues from steers and bulls. In the present study, miR-33a was overexpressed in bovine preadipocytes, and a total of 781 differentialy expressed genes were found, including 348 upregulated and 433 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of the differentially expressed genes enriched cell division and cell cycle respectively. MiR-33a overexpression decreased the rate of preadipocyte proliferation. Synchronously, the mRNA and protein expression levels of proliferation-related marker genes, including cyclin B1 (CCNB1) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), were decreased. In contrast, inhibiting miR-33a increased the rate of preadipocyte proliferation, and expression levels of CCNB1 and PCNA. Furthermore, based on luciferase reporter assays, miR-33a targeted directly cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6)-3ʹUTR and inhibited CDK6 protein expression. Interestingly, the silencing of CDK6 inhibited bovine preadipocyte proliferation and proliferation-related genes. Therefore, miR-33a inhibits the proliferation of bovine preadipocytes. CDK6 is the target gene of miR-33a and may be involved in the effects of miR-33a on bovine preadipocyte proliferation.",

Cell functional tests showed that LF-EVs promoted the proliferation, migration, and tube structure formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. LF-EVs also promoted the adipogenic differentiation of adipose tissue-derived stem cells. The results of animal experiments showed that the average weights of fat grafts in the LF-EVs-treated group were significantly higher than those in the control group. Histologically, there was less fibrosis, fewer cysts, and increased fat tissue survival in the LF-EVs group. Further investigations of angiogenic and adipogenic factors revealed that LF-EVs also promoted angiogenesis and exerted a pro-adipogenic effect in vivo. Our findings will help to elucidate the functions of LF-EVs and provide a reference dataset for future translational studies.",

The aim of this study is to discover the adipocyte genes and pathways involved in obesity and type 2 diabetes using bioinformatics analysis.Methods The GSE27951 gene expression profile was obtained. Software and online tools (STRING, Cytoscape, BioGPS, CTD, and FunRich) were used to identify core genes.21 human subcutaneous adipose samples, with 10 from type 2 diabetic patients and 11 from normal controls, were included in these analyses.Results 184 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 42 up-regulated genes and 142 down-regulated genes were found to be enriched in metabolism, receptor activity, collagen type IV and glutamine biosynthesis I pathway by using the enrichment analysis. Seven hub genes were identified from the PPI network using various software (Cytoscape, STRING, BioGPS, and CTD). Four core genes (COL4A2, ACACB, GLUL, and CD36) were found to be highly expressed in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese patients accompanying type 2 diabetes.Conclusion COL4A2, ACACB, GLUL and CD36 might be the core molecular biomarkers of obesity in patients with or without type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Adipogenesis regulation is crucial for mature adipocyte function. In obesity, a major driver of type 2 diabetes (T2D), this process is disrupted and remains poorly characterized. Here we identified altered DNA methylation profiles in diabetic obese patients, during three adipocytes differentiation stages. We isolated mesenchymal cells from visceral adipose tissue of obese patients with and without T2D to analyse DNA methylation profiles at 0, 3, and 18 days of ex vivo differentiation and documented their impact on gene expression. Methylation and gene expression were analysed with EPIC and Clarion S arrays, respectively. Patients with T2D had epigenetic alterations in all the analysed stages, and these were mainly observed in genes important in adipogenesis, insulin resistance, cell death programming, and immune effector processes. Importantly, at 3 days, we found six-fold more methylated CpG alterations than in the other stages. This is the first study to document epigenetic markers that persist through all three adipogenesis stages and their impact on gene expression, which could be a cellular metabolic memory involved in T2D. Our data provided evidence that, throughout the adipogenesis process, alterations occur in methylation that might impact mature adipocyte function, cause tissue malfunction, and potentially, lead to the development of T2D.",

As a result, 121 common DEGs were identified and mainly enriched in cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, chemokine signaling pathway, neutrophil activation and immune responses. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that the abundance of M1 macrophages was significantly lower in adipose and liver tissue after BS (p<0.05). Ten hub genes (TYROBP, TLR8, FGR, NCF2, HCK, CCL2, LAPTM5, MNDA and S100A9) that were all downregulated after BS were also associated with immune cells.

Depending on the unique organ structures and cell types, producing organoids requires individualized design and is still challenging. Organoids of some tissues, including adipose tissue, remain to generate to be more faithful to their original organ in structure and function. We previously established a new model of the origin of adipose cells originating from non-adipose fascia tissue. Here, we investigated superficial fascia fragments in 3D hydrogel and found they were able to transform into relatively large adipocyte aggregates containing mature unilocular adipocytes, which were virtually \"fat organoids\". Such fascia-originated fat organoids had a typical structure of adipose tissues and possessed the principal function of adipose cells in the synthesis, storage, hydrolysis of triglycerides and adipokines secretion. Producing fat organoids from superficial fascia can provide a new approach for adipocyte research and strongly evidences that both adipose tissues and cells originate from fascia. Our findings give insights into metabolic regulation by the crosstalk between different organs and tissues and provide new knowledge for investigating novel treatments for obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases.Abbreviations: 3D: three dimensional; ASC: adipose-derived stromal cells; C/EBP: CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein; EdU: 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine; FABP4: fatty acid-binding protein 4; FAS: fatty acid synthase; FSCs: fascia-derived stromal cells; Plin1: perilipin-1; Plin2: perilipin-2; PPARγ: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; WAT: white adipose tissue.",

Here, we asked if serum levels of these factors are altered with overweight/obesity and if this is related to adipose tissue (AT) expression and/or increased fat mass. Furthermore, we hypothesized that expression of GHR, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 is associated with AT function. Serum GHBP levels were increased in children with overweight/obesity throughout childhood, while for IGF-1 levels and the IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio obesity-related elevations were detectable until early puberty. Circulating levels did not correlate with AT expression of these factors, which was decreased with overweight/obesity. Independent from obesity, expression of GHR, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 was related to AT dysfunction,and increased insulin levels. Serum GHBP was associated with liver fat percentage and transaminase levels. We conclude that obesity-related elevations in serum GHBP and IGF-1 are unlikely to be caused by increased AT mass and elevations in GHBP are more closely related to liver status in children. The diminished AT expression of these factors with childhood obesity may contribute to early AT dysfunction and a deterioration of the metabolic state.",

Children with PHTS often develop lipomas, for which only surgical resection is available as treatment. We investigated the effects of the selective PI3K-inhibitor alpelisib on Pten-deficient lipomas. After incubation with alpelisib or the non-selective PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, we analysed histology, gene expression, and Pi3k pathway in lipoma and control epididymal adipose tissue (epiWAT). Alpelisib increased adipocyte area in lipomas compared to epiWAT. Baseline gene expression showed higher levels of markers for proliferation (Pcna), fibrosis (Tgfb1), and adipogenesis (Pparg) in lipomas, while hormone-sensitive lipase expression was lower than in epiWAT. Following alpelisib incubation, target genes of Pi3k signalling and extracellular matrix factors were reduced. We confirmed Pi3k inhibition through detecting decreased Akt levels compared to control treatment. Human lipoma samples treated with alpelisib showed variable lipolysis responses, suggesting variability in therapeutic outcomes. We established an ex vivo model to study alpelisib effects on Pten-deficient lipomas. These results underscore the therapeutic potential of targeted PI3K inhibition in the treatment of PHTS-associated lipomas, particularly in cases that are inoperable.",

In some patients, skin contraction can lead to the formation of skin contractures that limit movement, impair function, and significantly impact well-being.

Autologous fat grafting can improve the structure and function of scarred skin; however, relatively little is known about the effect of fat on skin contraction. In this study, an in vitro tissue-engineered model of human skin was used to test the effects of adipose tissue and adipose-derived stromal cells on skin contraction. Untreated tissue-engineered skin contracted to approximately 60% of the original area over 14 days in culture. The addition of adipose tissue reduced this contraction by 50%. Adipose tissue, which was emulsified or concentrated and high doses of adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSC) were able to inhibit contraction to a similar degree; however, lower doses of ADSC did not show the same effect. In conclusion, the subcutaneous application of adipose tissue has the potential to inhibit skin contraction. This study provides in vitro evidence to support the use of autologous fat grafting to prevent skin contraction in patients most at risk.",

Transmission electron microscopy and molecular analyses were used for characterization. There was no significant difference between genotypes for WAT mass, adipocyte size or triacylglycerol (TAG) content. No signs of cell death were observed in Alb-/- adipocytes, suggesting a tolerance to the metabolic challenge. Alb-/- adipocytes exhibited a lower density of caveolae with smaller invagination depths, indicating a potential adaptation to reduce FFA transport. A significantly higher abundance of micro-lipid droplets was observed in Alb-/- mice, which may result from a rapid substrate cycle with high lipolysis and re-esterification. In support of the ultrastructural phenotype, lipidomic analysis also demonstrated a significant difference between Alb-/- and WT for TAG composition. Our results showed that when no albumin is present to facilitate FFA mobilization, WAT can chronically adapt to protect the adipocytes in both morphological and molecular manners.",

Here, we tested the combined impact of OVX with and without HSCDA ablation. We discovered that HSCDA depletion plus OVX raised circulating leptin levels more than HSCDA depletion alone. Likewise, while HSCDA depletion or OVX alone inhibited physical activity and insulin responsiveness, their combination further suppressed these endpoints. Other physiologic endpoints were regulated by OVX alone. We conclude that HSCDAs play a role inthe maintenance of a subset of metabolic endpoints related to normal adipose tissue function, and their elevated production in models of female sex hormone suppression occurs to normalize these endpoints. The results highlight the ability of HSCDAs to target physical activity and insulin responsiveness, possibly by normalizing leptin production.",

We observed upregulated CAPG expression in the epididymal adipose tissue of high-fat diet-fed mice. To investigate the impact of CAPG on adipocyte differentiation and function, we generated a Capg knockdown 3T3-L1 cell line and induced adipogenic differentiation to mature adipocytes. Adipogenesis was assessed via Oil Red O and BODIPY staining, revealing that Capg knockdown markedly suppressed adipogenesis. Western blot analysis demonstrated that CAPG depletion reduced PPARγ expression. Additionally, Western blot analysis revealed that Capg knockdown significantly enhanced lipid utilization in adipocytes. ELISA and qPCR results further demonstrated that Capg knockdown effectively attenuated inflammatory responses in adipocytes. In conclusion, CAPG promotes adipogenesis and inflammatory responses, suggesting that targeted inhibition of CAPG may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity-associated adipose tissue dysfunction.",

White adipocytes primarily serve as energy storage depots, whereas brown adipocytes are mitochondria-rich and specialized for thermogenesis. However, the lipidomic profiles of white-like (WLAs) and brown-like adipocytes (BLAs) differentiated from human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remain incompletely characterized. Human adipose-derived MSCs were differentiated into WLAs and BLAs. Lipid fractions were isolated and analysed by gas-liquid chromatography. Fatty acid composition data were used to calculate indices of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) activity, elongation, and ω6 synthesis. Compared to MSCs, BLAs showed consistently elevated oleate (≥4.2-fold) and stearate (≥2.3-fold), along with reduced palmitate (≤-20%) and linoleate (≤-28%) across phospholipid, triglyceride, and free fatty acid fractions. WLAs versus MSCs showed similar trends, with oleate increasing up to 15-fold and palmitate decreasing by 67-82% depending on the lipid class. SCD1 activity and elongation indices were elevated in WLAs (SCD1: up to 4.7-fold; elongation: up to 28-fold). The ω6 synthesis index was also increased in triglyceride and free fatty acid fractions of WLAs (≥3.3-fold), but markedly suppressed in BLAs (≤-88.7%). WLAs and BLAs differentiated from MSCs exhibit distinct lipid profiles and inferred enzymatic activity patterns, reflecting their respective capacities for lipid storage and metabolic flexibility. These findings provide a foundation for future translational research aimed at targeting adipose tissue in obesity and metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Adipocytes are abundant in the breast tissue microenvironment. In breast cancer, they can change morphologically according to their proximity to tumour cells, with the closest becoming cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs). It remains unclear whether breast cancer risk factors, including menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), and mammographic density (MD), influence CAAs morphology in breast carcinogenesis. This study aimed to quantify morphological differences in adipocytes across breast cancer pathologies and associated risk factors. Whole slide images of haematoxylin and eosin stained cancer (n = 149) and normal (n = 182) breast tissue samples were analysed. Parameters representative of adipocyte morphology: perimeter, area, concavity, and aspect ratio, were measured using ImageJ. Adipocytes were considered close (≤2 mm) or distant ( > 2 mm) to cancer cells in cancer samples or breast epithelial cells in normal samples. Close adipocytes in cancer samples were designated CAAs. CAAs decreased in size compared to distant adipocytes (p≤0.0001). A similar trend was observed between close and distant adipocytes in normal (p≤0.0001). CAAs size increased post menopause (p ≤ 0.0001). CAAs size positively correlated with BMI (p ≤ 0.0001). In cancer cases, distant adipocyte size increased and concavity decreased with increasing MD (p ≤ 0.01). Smaller CAAs were associated with poorer survival (p≤0.05). Morphological differences were identified in adipocytes dependent on location within the breast, tissue, pathology and risk factors. Understanding what drives these morphological differences could provide mechanistic insight into whether risk factor-induced alterations in adipocytes influence their role in breast carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "White adipose tissue (WAT) browning has gained increasing attention as potential strategy for obesity management. The conversion of WAT into brown adipose tissue (BAT) enhances energy expenditure and improves metabolic health. Propolis, natural resinous substance produced by honeybees, contains bioactive compounds such as caffeic acid phenethylester, chrysin and quercetin, which are thought to regulate adipogenesis and promote WAT browning. This systematic review aimed to synthesize preclinical evidence on the molecular mechanisms by which propolis and its bioactive compounds regulate adipogenesis, lipid metabolism and the browning of white adipose tissue. We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar, without time restrictions, using relevant keywords related to propolis and obesity. A total of 7 preclinical studies (animal and in vitro) met the inclusion criteria. These studies indicate that propolis and its bioactive compounds, modulate adipogenic transcription factors, reduce lipid accumulation and increase expression of browning markers in cellular and animal models. Studies in vivo demonstrate reductions in body weight, fat accumulation and adipocyte differentiation, accompanied by increased thermogenesis. Preclinical evidence suggests that propolis modulates adipogenesis, lipid metabolism and WAT browning; however, clinical trials assessing mechanistic endpoints are lacking and necessary before translational recommendations can be made.",

In general, BAT can enhance metabolism and improve overall health. Our recent work demonstrates the ability of embryonic BAT transplants to correct type 1 diabetes (T1D) without insulin, via mechanisms somewhat different from those involved in BAT-associated weight loss. BAT transplants seem to reverse T1D by decreasing inflammation and increasing functionality in the surrounding white adipose tissue (WAT), thereby enabling it to secrete hypoglycemic adipokines, which compensate for the function of insulin. Thus BAT can transform unhealthy WAT to a healthy status, sufficient to replace the function of endocrine pancreas and establish insulin-independent glycemic regulation. Several studies, including ours, demonstrate the remarkable ability of BAT to correct metabolic disorders and hint at its beneficial effects on inflammation. Hence, addition of more BAT to the body, through transplantation or stimulating regeneration, may well be the therapy of the future for the simple correction of numerous diseases.",

This system is formed by a complex machinery that controls and maintains protein function and regulates mitochondrial morphology through a coordinated system of continual fusion and fission events.

However, the physiological consequences of these deficiencies remain unknown in most cases. Here, we briefly review the role of the OPA1-OMA1 system in mitochondrial biology, and summarize our recent report on the generation and phenotypic characterization of a model deficient in OMA1, an ATP-independent mitochondrial metalloprotease that participates in mitochondrial quality control. Interestingly, Oma1-deficient mice display an obesity phenotype, characterized by hepatic steatosis, decrease in energy expenditure and defective thermogenic regulation. In addition, our study has provided in vivo evidence of OMA1 function as a mitochondrial quality control protease, inactivating OPA1 under stress conditions and inhibiting mitochondrial fusion. Further, we have demonstrated the essential role of the OMA1-OPA1 system for brown adipose function and how this system regulates metabolic homeostasis in mice.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation involving adipose tissue is regarded as one of the major molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-related insulin resistance. Recent studies have suggested a series of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) to improve insulin resistance or protect against the development of diabetes mellitus. We previously demonstrated that valsartan suppresses the inflammatory response of macrophages. Interestingly, however, this effect did not occur via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ or the AT1a receptor. This suppression appears to secondarily lead to amelioration of insulin resistance and reductions in abnormal gene expressions in adipocytes. In addition to these in vitro findings, we herein demonstrate the in vivo effects of valsartan, using mice constitutively infused with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 4 weeks. Oral administration of valsartan to LPS-infused mice normalized the increased expressions of inflammatory cytokines in adipose and liver tissues. These results raise the possibility that valsartan not only contributes to normalization of obesity-related insulin resistance, but is also beneficial for the treatment of other diseases with inflammation related to the metabolic syndrome such as atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Further study is necessary to clarify these issues.",

We have recently shown that γ-synuclein is nutritionally regulated in murine adipocytes while its loss protects mice from high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and associated metabolic complications. This protection was coupled with increased adipocyte lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and energy expenditure in HFD-fed γ-synuclein-null mutant compared with wild-type mice. Cellular studies suggest that relocalization of ATGL to the lipid droplet in γ-synuclein-deficient adipocytes may contribute to increased lipolysis in these cells. Loss of γ-synuclein in adipocytes also attenuates the assembly of SNARE complexes, an important component of lipid droplet fusion machinery, possibly due to reduced chaperoning of SNAP-23 to the assembling SNARE complex by γ-synuclein. Together our data suggests that not only is γ-synuclein a novel regulator of lipid handling in adipocytes but also that the deficiency of this protein has a significant effect on whole body energy expenditure.",

Emerging evidence from this study signposts CIA in the DBA/1 mouse as a model that is relevant to study the development and treatment of early cardiovascular pathology associated with inflammatory arthritis. Here, we show global morphological changes in adipose tissue and the thoracic aorta in animals induced with CIA compared with the non-immunized controls. In CIA, we concluded that the increased cell count in PVAT was, at least in part, caused by an ingress and/or expansion of macrophages that had a mixed phenotype.

In mature adipocytes, Lsd1 responds to different environmental stimuli to alter metabolic function and enable proper thermogenic and oxidative response. Exposure to cold leads to Lsd1 upregulation and subsequent beiging of WAT. Oppositely, Lsd1 levels decline during aging resulting in a conversion of beige into white adipocytes, associated with loss of thermogenic properties of WAT. Lsd1 maintains beige adipocytes by controlling the expression of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. In summary, our studies not only provided insights into the mechanism of age-related beige-to-white adipocyte transition, but also established Lsd1 as a sensor that enables thermogenic response in WAT.",

    "abstract": "Ghrelin has garnered interest as a gut-derived regulator of lipid metabolism, beyond its classical roles in driving appetite and growth hormone release. Ghrelin's circulating concentrations follow an ultradian rhythm, peak immediately before a meal and point towards a potential metabolic role in reducing the mobilization of fatty acid stores in preparation for the storage of ingested food. Here, we demonstrate that both acylated and unacylated ghrelin have physiological roles in attenuating lipolysis in mature subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue depots of rats. Ghrelin blunted the ß3-induction (CL 316, 243) of glycerol release (index of lipolysis) which coincided with a reduced activation of the key lipid hydrolase HSL at two of its serine residues (Ser563/660). Furthermore, ghrelin appeared to inhibit fatty acid reesterification in the presence of CL such that fatty acid concentrations in the surrounding media were maintained in spite of a reduction in lipolysis. Importantly, these aforementioned effects were not observed following ghrelin injection in vivo, as there was no attenuation of CL-induced glycerol release. This highlights the importance of exercising caution when interpreting the effects of administering ghrelin in vivo, and the necessity for uncovering the elusive mechanisms by which ghrelin regulates lipolysis and fatty acid reesterification. We conclude that both acylated and unacylated ghrelin can exert direct inhibitory effects on lipolysis and fatty acid reesterification in adipose tissue from rats. However, these effects are not observed in vivo and outline the complexity of studying ghrelin's effects on fatty acid metabolism in the living animal.",

Paired abdominal subcutaneous and omental visceral adipose tissue were collected from women with GDM (n = 20) and with normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 22) during planned caesarian section. Both groups had similar maternal age (average 32.5 years) and BMI at delivery (average 33.3 kg/m2). Adipose tissue mRNA expression analyses of insulin signalling genes: PI3KCA, PI3KR1, IRS1 and IRS2 showed significantly decreased PI3KR1 expression (-23%) in visceral fat in GDM with no association to promoter DNA methylation. Reduced visceral fat PI3KR1 expression appears to be a pathogenic factor in GDM but not through altered promoter methylation.",

    "abstract": "Elastin is a highly elastic protein present in connective tissue. As a result of protease activity, elastin hydrolysis occurs, and during this process, elastin-derived peptides (EDPs) are released. One of the constitutively repeating elastin and EDP building sequences is the hexapeptide VGVAPG. Therefore, the aim of our research was to define the effect of VGVAPG peptide on adipogenesis in a mouse 3T3-L1 cell line. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated according to a previously described protocol and exposed to increasing concentrations of VGVAPG or VVGPGA peptide. The obtained results showed that VGVAPG peptide does not stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, caspase-1 activation, and 3T3-L1 cell proliferation. In the second part of the experiments, it was proved that VGVAPG peptide decreased lipid accumulation as measured by oil red O staining, which was confirmed by the profile of increased expression markers of undifferentiated preadipocytes. In our experiments, 10 nM VGVAPG added for differentiating to adipocytes increased the expression of Pref-1, serpin E1, and adiponectin as compared to rosiglitazone (PPARγ agonist)-treated group and simultaneously decreased the expression of VEGF and resistin as compared to the rosiglitazone-treated group. The obtained results show that VGVAPG peptide sustains 3T3 cells in undifferentiated state.

Brown adipocytes have emerged as potential targets for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases. However, changes that occur in brown adipose tissue during various stages of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to determine the changes occurring in brown adipose tissue during various stages of an HFD by analyzing two microarray expression profiles. A total of 1,337 differentially expressed RNAs (DE RNAs) were identified between the HFD and ND groups, using the limma package in R. The DE RNAs included 1,249 mRNAs, 74 long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 14 pseudogenes. Functional annotation of the DE mRNAs, including GO terms and KEGG pathways were identified using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using STRING and clusters were obtained through the Molecular Complex Detection plug-in. In the present study, the lncRNA,maternally expressed gene 3 (Meg3), was identified as the DE lncRNA with a significant fold change. The network of Meg3 as a ceRNA was constructed, which demonstrated that Meg3 modulated five hub DE mRNAs via competitive binding to microRNAs.",

The field of adipose tissue biology is growing due to this association with various chronic metabolic diseases. An important process in the regulation of adipose tissue biology is adipogenesis, which is the formation of new adipocytes. Investigating adipogenesis in vitro is currently a focus for identifying factors that might be utilized in clinically. A powerful tool for such work is high-throughput sequencing which can rapidly identify changes at gene expression level. Various cell models exist for studying adipogenesis and has been used in high-throughput studies, yet little is known about transcriptome profile that underlies adipogenesis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. This study utilizes RNA-sequencing and computational analysis with DESeq2, gene ontology, protein–protein networks, and robust rank analysis to understand adipogenesis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in-depth. Our analyses confirmed the requirement of mitotic clonal expansion prior to adipogenesis in this cell model and highlight the role of Cebpa and Cebpb in regulating adipogenesis through interactions of large numbers of genes.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Adipogenesis is the differentiation process generating mature adipocytes from undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells. The differentiation can be inhibited by androgens, although knowledge about intracellular effectors of this inhibition is scarce. Recently, androgen-regulated microRNAs were detected as interesting candidates in this context. In this study, we analyse the role of miR-130a and miR-301 in the adipogenesis of human SGBS preadipocytes and whether they are prone to androgen regulation. Materials and Methods: microRNA expression during adipogenic differentiation with or without androgen stimulation was measured by qPCR. Putative target genes of miR-130a and miR-301 were identified by target database search and validated in luciferase reporter assays. Results: miR-130a and miR-301 are both significantly downregulated on day 3 and day 5 of adipogenic differentiation in comparison to day 0. Under androgen stimulation, a significant upregulation of miR-130a was detected after 7 days of adipogenesis lasting to day 14, while miR-301 did not change significantly until day 14. Luciferase reporter assays revealed the androgen receptor (AR), adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) as miR-130a target genes. Conclusions: miR-130a is an androgen-regulated microRNA that is downregulated during the early phase of adipogenesis and exerts its functions by regulating AR and ADIPOQ translation. These data may help to identify new signalling pathways associated with the androgen-mediated inhibition of adipogenesis.",

    "abstract": "A chronic low-grade inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT) is one of the hallmarks of obesity and is proposed to contribute to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Despite this, the causal mechanisms underlying WAT inflammation remain unclear. Based on metabolomic analyses of human WAT, Petrus et al. showed that the amino acid glutamine was the most markedly reduced polar metabolite in the obese state. Reduced glutamine levels in adipocytes induce an increase of Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) levels via induction of glycolysis and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathways. This promotes nuclear O-GlcNAcylation, a posttranslational modification that activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. Conversely, glutamine supplementation in vitro and in vivo, reversed these effects. Altogether, dysregulation of intracellular glutamine metabolism in WAT establishes an epigenetic link between adipocytes and inflammation. This commentary discusses these findings and their possibly therapeutic relevance in relation to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

While tumor protein D52 (TPD52) did not emerge from earlier studies as a strong candidate, exogenous expression of human TPD52 in cultured cells resulted in significantly increased numbers of lipid droplets, and oleic acid supplementation increased TPD52 detection at both lipid droplets and the Golgi apparatus. These results suggest that direct testing of proteins that are infrequently but recurrently identified in proteomic and RNAi screening studies may identify novel lipid droplet regulators.

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) has raised great research interest because of its significant potential in counteracting obesity and type II diabetes. However, the mechanisms underlying browning are still poorly understood. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are one class of nuclear receptors, which play a vital role in regulating cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose metabolism. Following our previous finding that LXRs serve as repressors of UCP1 in classic brown adipose tissue in female mice, we found that LXRs, especially LXRβ, also repress the browning process of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in male rodents fed a normal diet. Depletion of LXRs activated thyrotropin releasing hormone positive neurons in the paraventricular area of the hypothalamus, and thus stimulated secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary. Consequently production of thyroid hormones in the thyroid gland and circulating thyroid hormone level were increased. Moreover, the activity of thyroid signaling in SAT was markedly increased. One unexpected finding of our study is that LXRs are indispensable in the thyroid hormone negative feedback loop at the level of the hypothalamus. LXRs maintain expression of thyroid receptors in the brain and when they are inactivated there is no negative feedback of thyroid hormone in the hypothalamus. Together, our findings have uncovered the basis of increased energy expenditure in male LXR knock-out mice and provided support for targeting LXRs in treatment of obesity.",

Human and mouse primary subcutaneous white preadipocytes (hsASCs and WT lean and obese msASCs, respectively) were induced to transdifferentiate into beige adipocytes under conditions of intact or blocked insulin signaling, respectively. Level of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) after induction of beige adipocytes under conditions of normal insulin signaling, phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α), zinc-fifinger transcriptional factor PRD1-BF1-RIZ1 homologous domain-containing protein 16 (PRDM16), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) were significantly increased. Conversely, when insulin signaling is incompletely inhibited, the expression of the thermogenic and adipogenic factors is significantly reduced, with obvious impairment of adipogenesis. However, phosphorylation level of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and expression level of sirtuin type 1 (SIRT1) had increased. These white preadipocytes from different donors showed similar dynamic change in morphology and molecular levels during the browning. The present data indicate that insulin signaling plays a important role in regulation of browning of hsASCs and msASCs through PI3K-AKT-UCP1 signaling pathway.

However, cell ageing caused by long-term in vitro expansion and poor survival after in vivo delivery greatly limits their success in preclinical and clinical applications. Dedifferentiation represents a potential strategy for enhancing the retention and function of MSCs in hostile environments. In this study, we evaluated the cell phenotype, proliferation, and differentiation potential, as well as the anti-oxidative stress ability of human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hMSCs) manipulated with adipogenic priming and subsequent dedifferentiation. After an in vitro differentiation and dedifferentiation procedure, the resultant dedifferentiated hMSCs (De-hMSCs) displayed properties similar to their original counterparts, including immunophenotype and mesodermal potential. Upon re-induction, De-hMSCs exhibited a significantly higher adipogenic differentiation capability than unmanipulated hMSCs. Importantly, De-hMSCs showed a significantly enhanced ability to resist tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) induced apoptosis compared to undifferentiated hMSCs. Mechanisms involving bcl-2 family proteins and autophagy may contribute to the demonstrated advantages of dedifferentiation-reprogrammed hMSCs. These results indicate that adipogenic dedifferentiation promotes adipogenesis and cell persistence, as well as preserves the stemness of human umbilical cord-derived MSCs that have been committed to the adipocytic lineage. As a unique stem cell population, dedifferentiated MSCs may represent an attractive and promising candidate for MSC-based therapy.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is characterized by macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. White adipose tissue remodelling under inflammatory conditions involves both hypertrophy and adipogenesis and is regulated by transcription factors, which are influenced by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and are involved in obesity-related processes such as adipogenesis. Therefore, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs in the epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of mice fed a normal diet (ND) and those fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The expression of miR-6402 was significantly suppressed in the inflamed eWAT of HFD-fed mice than in ND-fed mice. Furthermore, Bmpr2, the receptor for BMP4, was identified as a target gene of miR-6402. Consistently, miR-6402 was downregulated in the inflamed eWAT of HFD-fed mice and in 3T3-L1 cells (preadipocytes) and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (mature adipocytes) , and BMPR2 expression in these cells was upregulated. Adipogenesis was induced in WAT by BMP4 injection (in vivo) and in 3T3-L1 cells by BMP4 stimulation (in vitro), both of which were inhibited by miR-6402 transfection. Inflamed eWAT showed higher expression of BMPR2 and the adipogenesis markers C/EBPβ and PPARγ, which was suppressed by miR-6402 transfection. Our findings suggest that miR-6402 is a novel anti-adipogenic miRNA that combats obesity by inhibiting the BMP4/BMPR2 signalling pathway and subsequently reducing adipose tissue expansion.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory changes in perivascular adipose tissue are associated with atherosclerotic lesions in the adjacent artery and can also be used as a marker in patient workup. While adipocyte size is known to be closely related to adipose tissue dysfunction and inflammation, it has not been widely studied in perivascular adipose tissue obtained from healthy human subjects without clinical atherosclerosis. In this cross-sectional study, we addressed this issue by measuring adipocyte size and defining its relationship to cardiovascular risk factors in a healthy cohort of living kidney donors. The presence of cardiovascular risk factors was established by a standardized questionnaire, clinical measurements and body composition analyses. Adipocyte size was measured in the perivascular depot. The proportions of various macrophage subtypes were determined by flow cytometry. To confirm the results, the proportion of CD68 + macrophages was additionally assessed by immunohistochemistry. A correlation and principal component analyses were performed to explore associations. Adipocyte size in perivascular adipose tissue correlated with markers of lipid metabolism, inflammation, and glucose metabolism. Further, the positive correlation with the pro-inflammatory subpopulation of macrophages suggests a strong local effect of perivascular adipose tissue. Perivascular adipocyte size was associated with cardiovascular risk factors and markers of inflammation in a healthy cohort of living kidney donors. This further supports the local role of adipose tissue dysfunction and inflammation in early atherosclerosis development and detection.",

    "abstract": "We discovered two adult sisters in Colombia, lineally consanguineous, with severe obesity and undetectable serum leptin levels despite markedly elevated body fat. Their clinical profile included childhood-onset extreme weight gain, intense hunger, hyperphagia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and family history of obesity. Direct sequencing of the LEP gene revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation in exon 3 (c.350G>T [p.C117F]). The presence of this mutation, undetectable leptin, and severe obesity confirmed a diagnosis of monogenic leptin deficiency. Here we describe the clinical outcomes of a 12-month treatment with recombinant human leptin (metreleptin). Metabolic and endocrine assessments were conducted before and after therapy. Metreleptin therapy significantly reduced BMI: from 59 to 38 kg/m2 (OBX1, age 27) and 60 to 48 kg/m2 (OBX2, age 24). Total body fat mass decreased, serum lipids normalized, and insulin sensitivity improved. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism reversed, and menstruation resumed. Thus, metreleptin reversed the major metabolic and endocrine abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency in these sisters. Limitations include the small sample size, absence of a control group, and lack of anti-metreleptin antibody measurements. Nevertheless, our findings support that leptin replacement with metreleptin is currently the only effective hormonal treatment for this monogenic form of human obesity.",

    "abstract": "Cachexia is a complex syndrome that is often associated with cancer. Chemotherapy, one of the main cancer treatments, worsens weight loss in cancer-induced cachexia. In this context, it is thought that fat loss precedes muscle loss, and that alterations in adipose tissue are associated with tumours. However, the effect of cancer treatment on adipose tissue is not well understood. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy alone on mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes to identify the mechanisms contributing to adipose tissue alteration. The murine cell line 3T3-L1, a model of mature adipocytes, was used in this study. After differentiation, cells were treated for 48 h with a chemotherapy cocktail called FLOT composed of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and docetaxel at two concentrations (FLOT 1X and 0.1X). The control group was treated with the vehicle of the chemotherapy cocktail. Viability, mitochondrial function and dynamics, lipid metabolism, and cellular stress were also evaluated. FLOT 1X chemotherapy significantly reduced viability of mature 3T3-L1 cells and inhibited lipid accumulation. Interestingly, while FLOT 1X treatment downregulated lipogenesis markers, FLOT 0.1X treatment upregulated some of them. Although, the treatment showed no effect on mitochondrial respiration or density, it significantly increased expression of oxidative stress and inflammation markers in adipocytes.This in vitro study provides the first evidence of FLOT chemotherapy's direct effects on healthy mature adipocytes. The results demonstrate significant treatment-induced reductions in cell viability along with dysregulation of both lipogenic and lipolytic pathways. These findings elucidate previously unrecognized mechanisms underlying adipose tissue dysfunction in cancer cachexia.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are global public health challenges. Activating thermogenic adipose tissues, such as brown adipose tissue and beige adipose tissue, could be a promising strategy to combat obesity and consequently obesity-related diabetes. Both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and retinoid X receptor γ (RXRγ) play significant roles in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation. However, the underlying mechanisms and interactions between these receptors during adipogenic differentiation remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of a transcriptome sequencing dataset sourced from the GEO database, encompassing samples of white and brown adipose tissues from 15 healthy individuals. Our findings reveal that RXRγ expression is significantly elevated in brown adipose tissue relative to white adipose tissue (p = 0.041). Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assays validated that RXRγ can be co-precipitated with PPARγ. Subsequent luciferase assays demonstrated that the interaction between RXRγ and PPARγ significantly enhances the transcriptional activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) compared to the overexpression of PPARγ alone (3.4-fold vs. 1.5-fold, p < 0.001). Notably, in human preadipocytes, the co-overexpression of RXRγ with PPARγ resulted in a significant increase in UCP1 transcriptional activity compared to the overexpression of PPARγ alone (3.4-fold vs. 2.0-fold, p < 0.05). In summary, our findings suggest that RXRγ serves as a novel cofactor for PPARγ, promoting the browning of adipose tissue through the upregulation of UCP1 transcription.",

Here, we developed vascularized adipose organoids (VAOs) from peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells (PBMSCs) using a standardized three-dimensional dynamic culture system that sequentially induces angiogenesis and adipogenesis. These VAOs mimic native adipose tissue with coexisting adipocytes and endothelial cells. Transcriptomic analysis shows that vascularization alters genes linked to inflammation and redox homoeostasis, yielding distinct metabolic and inflammatory profiles in VAOs versus non-vascularized controls. Notably, upon TNF-α stimulation, VAOs exhibit markedly reduced IL-6 secretion relative to non-vascularized adipose organoids (NVAOs). Importantly, Celastrol simultaneously inhibits angiogenesis and adipogenesis in VAOs and broadly modulates the expression of genes associated with mitochondrial metabolic processes. This study establishes PBMSC-derived VAOs as a scalable, patient-accessible model for investigating adipose development, metabolism, and inflammation. The system also provides a platform for mechanistic research and high-throughput drug screening in obesity and related metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Different adipose tissues (AT) have been described, including subcutaneous and visceral tissues (SCAT and VAT). They display different morphological structures, physiological and metabolic functions. Imaging adipocytes in the whole AT was not feasible because of the large adipocyte sizes and the lipid-full content of the droplets that increased the refractive index. Tissue clearing is then required mainly through a delipidation step, which induces also a tissue shrinkage. Our aim was to image in 3D freshly extracted adipocytes and compare them to those within their tissues. Trout ATs were stained with 5DTAF (extracellular matrix) and Nile Red (lipids). After clearing with Histodenz, 3D images were obtained using a confocal microscope, and adipocytes were segmented and measured. In situ, major differences in adipocyte size and shape were observed between the VAT and SCAT. Ex situ, only the size mattered because all cells were round outside their tissues. This method can be applied to other species, such as mice. In situ, adipocyte sphericity was even higher in the SCAT from a Swiss and a C57Bl6. This approach demonstrates that 3D adipocyte imaging with lipid labeling enables accurate morphological characterization, provides insights into depot-specific structural features, and supports optimization of cell isolation protocols.",

We sought to measure basal and β3-stimulated indices of lipoysis (FFAs, glycerol) in vivo in E2 deficient or supplemented rats, and ex vivo with direct acute E2 exposure. For 2 weeks, ovariectomized (OVX) and OVX rats treated with a daily oral dose of E2 (OVX E2) were pairfed to SHAM controls (n = 12 per group). Adipocyte size was modestly (∼40%) increased in OVX rats, but did not reach significance (p = 0.2). After 2 weeks, half of the animals in each group received an in vivo injection of saline or 1 mg/kg of the β3 agonist CL 316, 243. Serum FFA concentrations, but not glycerol, were lower in OVX and OVX E2 rats compared with SHAM controls (p = 0.02). A significant CL response was present in all groups (p<0.001) and HSL activation was unaffected by OVX or OVX E2 in retroperitoneal (r.p.) or inguinal (iWAT) adipose depots in vivo. Ex vivo, CL increased FFA and glycerol accumulation in the media as well as HSL phosphorylation by several fold in r.p. and iWAT explants, but responses from OVX and OVX E2 rats were comparable to SHAMs. To assess whether E2 can directly affect lipolysis, r.p. and iWAT tissue was treated with E2, CL or E2 + CL for 2, 4 or 8 hours using adipose tissue organ culture. CL stimulated FFA release (p<0.001), but was unaffected by E2. Overall, our results indicate that E2 does not directly regulate adipose tissue lipolysis.",

To perform its thermogenic function, its level of mitochondria increases dramatically. If the stimuli are removed the mitochondrial levels return to base line. Following the withdrawal of external stimuli, beige adipocytes directly acquire a white fat-like phenotype through mitophagy-mediated mitochondrial degradation. The beige cell is therefore a dynamic model for studying the mechanism of mitochondrial biogenesis and degradation.",

However, current cell culture models routinely grow ASCs on plastic surfaces largely missing niche parameters. In the present communication, we employed human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) monolayers as feeder cells for ASCs, which were isolated from human subcutaneous white adipose tissue and amplified in vitro. We found that PPARγ2 and several adipocyte markers were significantly higher expressed in differentiated ASCs growing on feeder layers relative to plastic dishes. Moreover, a significant higher number of adipocytes was generated from ASCs cultured on feeder layer and these adipocytes contained larger fat droplets. Insulin strongly stimulated glucose uptake into adipocytes produced on feeder layer suggesting that these cells show characteristic metabolic features of fat cells. Finally, we show that the HFF feeder layer allows adipogenic differentiation of low-density-seeded ASCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the HFF feeder layer increases adipocyte differentiation of ASCs and allows differentiation of low density seeded progenitor cells into functional adipocytes.",

We found remarkable changes in adipocyte metabolism that occur prior to infiltration of macrophages in expanding adipose tissue. Results of metabolomic analyses, adipose tissue respirometry, electron microscopy, and expression analyses of key genes and proteins revealed dysregulation of several metabolic pathways, loss of mitochondrial biogenetic capacity, and apparent activation of mitochondrial autophagy which were followed in time by downregulation of numerous mitochondrial proteins important for maintaining oxidative capacity.

    "abstract": "Haptoglobin (Hp) is an inflammatory and adiposity marker, its expression during obesity being specifically induced in the white adipose tissue (WAT). We previously reported that when challenged with a high fat diet (HFD) Hp-/- mice are partially protected from the onset of insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis. The aim of the present study was to get further insights into Hp function in WAT. To this end, we performed histological and gene expression analysis of the Hp-/- WAT, both in standard and obesity conditions, and investigated how Hp deficiency impacts adipogenesis and WAT development. The average size and percentage of very large adipocytes were respectively smaller and reduced in HFD Hp-/- mice as compared with HFD WT. The expression of perilipin, HSL and angiogenesis related markers were increased in HFD Hp-/- mice. Lean adult Hp-/- showed significantly larger adipocytes and lower subcutaneous WAT expression of aP2 and LPL with respect to WT. Hp-/- young mice (P30) were characterized by larger adipocyte size and lower expression of adipocyte and adipogenesis markers. Comparison of adipocyte size distribution between young and adult mice revealed attenuated changes in Hp-/- mice compared with WT. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Hp-/- mice were less capable of accumulating triglycerides and exhibited lower expression of PPARγ, aP2, FAS, LPL and Leptin. In conclusion, Hp deficiency tends to blunt the effect of age and diet on the size of adipocytes, which show less susceptibility to develop hypertrophy during obesity and a reduced adipogenic/hyperplastic potential during youth. In addition, Hp deficiency impacts negatively on adipogenesis.",

Here, we generated mice with KO of PKC-λ in adipocytes, i.e., AλKO mice. In isolated adipocytes of AλKO mice, insulin-stimulated aPKC activity and glucose transport were diminished, as were ERK levels and activity. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport and insulin activation of ERK in adipocytes of wild-type mice were similarly inhibited by acute inhibition of PKC-λ with a highly-specific chemical inhibitor. With impairments in glucose transport and ERK activation, AλKO mice had diminished adiposity and serum leptin levels. In addition, AλKO mice had normal glucose tolerance and insulin hypersensitivity owing to enhanced suppression of hepatic glucose output, which apparently reflected increases in Akt activity and FoxO1 phosphorylation, and subsequent decreases in expression of gluconeogenic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. We conclude that: PKC-λ is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport and ERK signaling in mouse adipocytes; and diminution of these processes is attended by leanness and therefore hypoleptinemia. How these and perhaps other PKC-λ-dependent processes communicate to liver and improve insulin suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis remains unclear.",

In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that these effects of butein may occur via reduction of ADAMTS5 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with ThromboSpondin motifs 5) expression. Murine 3T3-L1 or 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were differentiated into mature adipocytes in the presence of butein or vehicle. At regular time intervals RNA was collected for gene expression studies. Male hemizygous mice for Tg(Ucp1-luc2,-tdTomato)1Kajim (ThermoMouse) were exposed to butein or vehicle, after which ATs were analyzed for Adamts5 and uncoupling protein-1 (Ucp-1) mRNA level changes. During preadipocyte differentiation, butein (25 – 50 mM) did not affect Adamts5 or Ucp-1 expression. Oil Red O analysis and monitoring of differentiation markers failed to demonstrate effects of butein on the differentiation extent. Furthermore, butein administration to the ThermoMouse (10 or 20 mg/kg, 4 days) or to the C57BL6/Rj mice (20 mg/kg, 4 weeks) did not enhance Adamts5 or Ucp-1 expression. Thus, we could not demonstrate marked effects of butein on the preadipocyte differentiation extent or AT development and browning, nor on Adamts5 or Ucp-1 gene expression during these processes.",

Results: lifestyle intervention resulted in opposite direction changes in fat tissue and blood for CAV1 expression and DNA methylation and these changes were correlated between tissues, while no significative differences were found in CAV1 expression after bariatric surgery. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a role for CAV1 in modulating adipocyte function as a consequence of lifestyle changes, as exercises and diet.

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is an important metabolic organ, and transplantation of white adipose tissue plays crucial roles in glucose homoeostasis and energy metabolism. However, how adipose tissue affects glucose utilization is poorly understood. PAI-1-knockout (PAI-1KO) mice were previously shown to be resistant to a high-fat diet and obesity. We used microPET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography), gene microarray, and biochemical assays to measure changes in systemic and myocardial glucose metabolism in mice subjected to transplantation of adipose tissue from PAI-1KO and wild-type mice. Here, we show that transplanting subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) from PAI-1KO mice into high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice reduced levels of serum total cholesterol and triglycerides, and improved glucose tolerance in the HFD-fed mice. microPET/CT imaging revealed that cardiac glucose uptake was increased in the heart but not in the liver, hindlimb muscles, or abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue in HFD-fed mice transplanted with PAI-1KO scWAT, suggesting that the transplanted PAI-1KO scWAT exerted endocrine effects in the heart. In addition, transplantation of scWAT from PAI-1KO mice upregulated mitochondrial gene expression in cardiac muscle, increased the expression of glucose transporters 1 and 4 in cardiac tissues and was associated with an increased NAD+/NADH ratio. Together, these findings suggest that modulating PAI-1 in scWAT may provide a promising approach for intervening in glucose metabolism.",

It has been demonstrated that extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates cell proliferation and differentiation by interacting with ERK1/2 signalling pathway. In this study, we prepared autologous decellularized extracellular matrix (d-ECM) and explored its effect on the proliferation and adipogenic ability of ADSCs in low serum culture. We found that 2% foetal bovine serum (FBS) in growth medium inhibited cell viability and DNA replication, and decreased mRNA and protein levels of PPARγ and C/EPBα compared with 10% FBS. Correspondingly, after 14-days adipogenic induction, cells cultured in 2% FBS possessed lower efficiency of adipogenesis and expressed less adipocyte differentiation markers ADIPOQ and aP2. On the contrary, the d-ECM-coated substrate continuously promoted the expression of PPARγ, and regulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in different manners during differentiation. Pretreatment with ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 neutralized the effects of d-ECM, which suggested d-ECM might regulate the adipogenesis of ADSCs through ERK1/2-PPARγ pathway. In addition, d-ECM was revealed to regulate the transcription and expression of stemness-associated genes, such as OCT4, NANOG and SOX2, in the undifferentiated ADSCs, which might be related to the initiation of differentiation.",

Previous research has shown that both acylated (AG) and unacylated (UnAG) ghrelin blunt adrenoreceptor-stimulated lipolysis in rat white adipose tissue (WAT) ex vivo. We investigated whether acute or chronic consumption of a high fat diet (HFD) impaired the ability of ghrelin to regulate adipose tissue lipolysis, and if this impairment could be restored with exercise. After 5 days (5d) of a HFD, or 6 weeks (6 w) of a HFD (60% kcal from fat) with or without exercise training, inguinal and retroperitoneal WAT was collected from anesthetized rats for adipose tissue organ culture. Samples were treated with 1 μM CL 316,243 (CL; lipolytic control), 1 μM CL+150 ng/ml AG or 1 μM CL+150 ng/ml UnAG. Incubation media and tissue were collected after 2 hours. Colorometric assays were used to determine glycerol and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations in media. Western blots were used to quantify the protein content of lipolytic enzymes and ghrelin receptors in both depots. CL stimulated lipolysis was evidenced by increases in glycerol (p < 0.0001) and FFA (p < 0.0001) concentrations in media compared to control. AG decreased CL-stimulated glycerol release in inguinal WAT from 5d LFD rats (p = 0.0097). Neither AG nor UnAG blunted lipolysis in adipose tissue from 5d or 6 w HFD-fed rats, and exercise did not restore ghrelin's anti-lipolytic ability in 6 w HFD-fed rats. Overall, this study demonstrates that HFD consumption impairs ghrelin's ability to regulate adipose tissue lipolysis.",

Cell-viability assays, and Western blots were performed to determine alterations in apoptotic, proliferation and lipid metabolism protein markers. Free fatty acids (FFA) and inflammatory markers in the collected treatment-conditioned media were also quantified. Adipocyte secretory factors increased the cell-viability of doxorubicin-treated cells (p < 0.0001), which did not correspond to apoptosis or proliferation pathways. Adipocyte secretory factors increased the protein expression of hormone-sensitive lipase (p < 0.05) in doxorubicin-treated cells. Adipocyte secretory factors increased the utilization of leptin (p < 0.05) and MCP-1 (p < 0.01) proteins and possibly inhibited release of linoleic acid by doxorubicin-treated cells (treatment-conditioned media FFA profiles). Adipocyte secretory factors induced doxorubicin treatment resistance, by increasing the utilization of inflammatory mediators and inhibiting the release of FFA by doxorubicin-treated cells. This further promotes inflammation and lipid metabolic reprogramming (lipid storage) in the tumour microenvironment, which breast cancer cells use to evade the toxic effects induced by doxorubicin and confers to acquired treatment resistance.",

Better understanding molecular mechanisms governing porcine adipocyte hyperplasia may provide insight into the regulation of adipose tissue development that is useful both when considering the pig as a commodity and when extrapolating porcine data to human disease. Primary cultures of pig stromal-vascular cells have served as a useful tool for investigating factors that regulate preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation. However, such cultures have generally been maintained at 37°C in vitro despite euthermia being 39°C in pigs. To address potential concerns about the physiological relevance of culturing primary pig preadipocytes under what would be hypothermic conditions in vivo, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of culture temperature on the proliferation and differentiation of pig preadipocytes in primary culture. Culturing primary preadipocytes at 37 rather than 39°C decreases their proliferation rates based upon cleavage of the tetrazolium salt, MTT (P < 0.001), reduction of resazurin (P < 0.001), and daily cell counts (P < 0.001). Likewise, culturing primary porcine preadipocytes at 37°C suppressed their adipogenic potential based upon monitoring adipogenesis morphologically, biochemically, and via the expression of mRNA encoding adipogenic marker genes. Collectively, these data indicate the proliferation and differentiation of primary pig preadipocytes is suppressed when cultures are incubated at 37°C compared to normal body temperature of pigs. This may confound investigation of factors that impact adipocyte hyperplasia in the pig.",

We speculated that ADAM10 plays a modulatory role in adipose tissue inflammation and metabolism. To this end, we studied adipose tissue-specific ADAM10 knock-out mice (aKO). While young, regular chow diet-fed aKO mice showed increased insulin sensitivity, following prolonged (33 weeks) high-fat diet (HFD) exposure, aKO mice developed obesity and insulin resistance. Compared to controls, aKO mice showed less inflammatory adipokine profile despite the significant increase in adiposity. In brown adipose tissue, aKO mice on HFD had changes in CD8+ T cell populations indicating a lesser inflammatory pattern. Following HFD, both aKO and control littermates demonstrated decreased adipose tissue pro-inflammatory macrophages, and increased anti-inflammatory accumulation, without differences between the genotypes. Collectively, our observations indicate that selective deletion of ADAM10 in adipocytes results in a mitigated inflammatory response, leading to increased insulin sensitivity in young mice fed with regular diet. This state of insulin sensitivity, following prolonged HFD, facilitates energy storage resulting in increased fat accumulation which ultimately leads to the development of a phenotype of obesity and insulin resistance. In conclusion, the data indicate that ADAM10 has a modulatory effect of inflammation and whole-body energy metabolism.",

In the present study, we conducted a metabolic characterization of P2RX5 knockout male mice; next, we characterized this purinergic pathway in a cell-autonomous context in brown adipocytes. We then tested the role of the P2RX5 receptor agonism in metabolic responses in vivo in conditions of minimal adaptive thermogenesis requirements. Our data show that loss of P2RX5 causes reduced brown adipocyte differentiation in vitro, and browning in vivo. Lastly, we unravel a previously unappreciated role for P2RX5 agonism to exert an anti-obesity effect in the presence of enhanced brown adipose tissue recruitment in male mice housed at thermoneutrality. Altogether, our data support a role for P2RX5 in mediating brown adipocyte differentiation and function that could be further targeted for benefits in the context of adipose tissue pathology and metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "White adipose tissue can metabolize large amounts of glucose to glycerol and lactate. We quantitatively traced glucose label to lactate, glycerol and fats in primary cultures of mature rat epididymal adipocytes. Cells were incubated with 7/14 mM 14C-glucose for 24/48 h. Medium metabolites and the label in them and in cells' components were measured. Gene expression analysis was done using parallel incubations. Glucose concentration did not affect lactate efflux and most parameters. Glycerol efflux increased after 24 h, coinciding with arrested lipogenesis. Steady production of lactate was maintained in parallel to glycerogenesis. Changes in adipocyte metabolism were paralleled by gene expression. Glucose use for lipogenesis was minimal, and stopped (24 h-onwards) when glycerol efflux increased because of triacylglycerol turnover. Lactate steady efflux showed that anaerobic glycolysis was the main adipocyte source of energy. We can assume that adipose tissue may play a quantitatively significant effect on glycaemia, returning 3C fragments thus minimizing lipogenesis.",

Apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE) and C57Bl/6J (control) mice were fed a high fat western diet up to 30 weeks. 3D microCT reconstructions were used to quantify: 1) vascular wall volume, a surrogate measure of remodeling, was greater in ApoE, 2) aorta PVAT volume was reduced in ApoE, 3) plaque volumes increased over time in ApoE, 4) plaque development co-localized with luminal ostia, origins of branching arteries, which traveled through areas of greatest PVAT volume, 5) qualitatively, the same arteries showed evidence of increased tortuosity in ApoE.

We obtained subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) before and 3 h after oral glucose (OGTT) in carriers and non-carriers of the Ala allele (12 Pro/Pro, 15 Pro/Ala, and 13 Ala/Ala). Adipogenesis, adipocyte glucose uptake and lipolysis as well as PPARγ target gene expression were investigated and compared between the genotype groups. During fasting and post-OGTT, neither basal nor insulin-stimulated adipocyte glucose uptake differed between genotypes. Compared to fasting, a decreased hormone-sensitive lipase gene expression in Pro/Pro (p < 0.05) was accompanied with a higher antilipolytic effect of insulin post-OGTT (p < 0.01). The adipocyte size was similar across groups. Preadipocyte differentiation rates between Pro/Pro and Ala/Ala were unchanged. In conclusion, no major differences in AT differentiation, glucose uptake, lipolysis or expression of PPARγ target genes were observed between different PPARγ Pro12Ala genotypes. Albeit small, our study may suggest that other pathways in AT or effects exerted in other tissues might contribute to the Pro12Ala-mediated protection against T2D.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissues often exhibit subtle, quantitative differences between individuals, leading to a graded series of adiposity phenotypes at the population level. Robust, quantitative analyses are vital for studying these differences. In this Commentary we highlight two articles from our lab that employ sensitive new methods in zebrafish capable of delineating complex and quantitative adiposity phenotypes. In the first article, we utilized in vivo imaging to systematically quantify zebrafish adipose tissues. We identified 34 regionally distinct zebrafish adipose tissues and developed statistical models to predict the size and variance of each adipose tissue over the course of zebrafish growth. We then employed these models to identify effects of strain and diet on adipose tissue growth. In the second article, we employed deep phenotyping to study complex disease-related adiposity traits. Using this methodology, we identified that adipose tissues have unique capacities to re-deposit lipid following food restriction and re-feeding. These distinct re-deposition potentials led to widespread fat distribution changes following re-feeding. We discuss how these novel findings may provide relevance to health conditions such as anorexia nervosa. Together, the strategies described in these two articles can be used as unbiased and quantitative methods to uncover new relationships between genotype, diet and adiposity.",

Twenty-one FAs were detected and the total saturated FA percentage of experimental groups was similar. While the total monounsaturated FA (MUFA) (p < 0.0004) and desaturase index (18:1 cis-9/18:0; p < 0.03) were higher in PCOS women than non-PCOS women, total polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) was lower in PCOS than non-PCOS women (p < 0.004).

We aimed to investigate the effect of HuR on the expression of VEGF and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured with ADSCs-derived exosomes. The HuR-overexpressed HUVECs (HuR-HUVECs) were cocultured with ADSCs-derived exosomes. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to examine the stability and expression of VEGF-A mRNA and protein. The proliferation, migration, and proangiogenic capacity of HuR-HUVECs were evaluated using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), scratch wound healing, and Matrigel tube formation assay. qRT-PCR showed that HuR-HUVECs had higher expression and slower attenuation of VEGF-A mRNA. Western blotting confirmed higher expression of VEGF-A in HuR-HUVECs. CCK-8, scratch wound healing, and Matrigel tube formation assay demonstrated an increased proangiogenic effect in HuR-HUVECs. HuR promotes angiogenesis of HUVECs cocultured with ADSCs-derived exosomes via stabilization and overexpression of VEGF in vitro.

The research of adipogenesis mechanism would provide new insight into intramuscular fatty deposition. Here, the role of microRNA-378 was investigated during bovine adipogenic differentiation. It was revealed that miR-378 expression exists variably in bovine major tissue and organs by RT-qPCR. It was predicted that miR-378 targets CaMKK2, as an AMPKα kinase, by DIANA Tools. For better research, primary preadipocytes with stable transfection for up-/down-regulated expression of miR-378 were constructed by lentiviral vectors with GFP gene. The analyses of qPCR showed that PPARγ and adiponectin mRNA levels increased, but C/EBPβ, pref-1 and CaMKK2 mRNA levels decreased during adipogenic differentiation. When miR-378 was overexpressed, preadipocytes proliferation became slower, there are more cellular lipid droplets, and PPARγ and C/EBPβ mRNA levels were higher, but pref-1, adiponectin and CaMKK2 were lower than control groups. Luciferase assay and western blot analysis validated that miR-378 binds the nucleotide sites of the 3′- untranslated region of CaMKK2, which inhibits the mRNA and protein expression of CaMKK2. These findings suggest that miR-378 promotes adipogenic differentiation in bovine intramuscular preadipocytes by targeting CaMKK2 via AMPK signalling pathway.",

The focus of this research was to use bioinformatics to discover possible treatment targets for obesity. To begin, the GSE133099 database was used to identify 364 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then, DEGs were subjected to tissue-specific analyses and enrichment analyses, followed by the creation of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and generation of a drug-gene interaction database to screen key genes and potential future drugs targeting obesity. Findings have illustrated that the tissue-specific expression of neurologic markers varied significantly (34.7%, 52/150). Among these genes, Lep, ApoE, Fyn, and FN1 were the key genes observed in the adipocyte samples from obese patients relative to the controls. Furthermore, nine potential therapeutic drugs (dasatinib, ocriplasmin, risperidone, gemfibrozil, ritonavir, fluvastatin, pravastatin, warfarin, atorvastatin) that target the key genes were also screened and selected. To conclude the key genes discovered (Lep, ApoE, Fyn, and FN1), as well as 9 candidate drugs, could be used as therapeutic targets in treating obesity.",

Several studies have implicated the transcriptional cofactor and acetyltransferase Tip60 in PPARγ signaling and adipocyte differentiation. Since Tip60 protein levels, but not mRNA levels, are upregulated during adipogenesis, and since Tip60 can be degraded by the proteasome, we hypothesized that Tip60 protein may be stabilized through deubiquitination during adipogenesis. Indeed, Tip60 is protected from proteasomal degeradation by the deubiquitinase USP7, which is particularly important for mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), an early step in adipogenesis. Besides this novel role in early differentiation, earlier studies indicated that Tip60 is also important during the later stages of differentiation, indicating a dual role for this protein in adipogenesis. Our recent study sheds new light on the role of Tip60 in cellular differentiation and provide new insights into the importance of a regulatory process that has not been studied intensively in adipogenesis: protein (de)ubiquitination.",

APs were maintained by continuous culture and induced to undergo adipogenic differentiation. Adipogenesis, determined by Oil Red O staining, was assessed with each passage and compared to wildtype controls. Adipogenic capability was rapidly lost with increased passage number in committed APs with concurrent reduction in cell proliferation and expression of essential late adipogenic genes, including Pparγ and C/ebpα.

We recently identified adipose tissue inflammation and resulting dysfunctional adipose tissue-liver cross-talk as an early event in the development of HFD-induced hepatic insulin resistance. In particular, reducing white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation by adipocyte-specific depletion of Fas/CD95 protected mice from developing hepatic insulin resistance but not hepatic steatosis. Herein, we expanded our previous work and determined the impact of four days of HFD on lipolytic activity of isolated adipocytes. Compared with chow-fed mice, the degree of basal and isoproterenol-stimulated free fatty acid (FFA) and glycerol release was similar in HFD-fed animals. Moreover, insulin's ability to suppress lipolysis remained intact, suggesting retained insulin sensitivity. Despite unaltered lipolysis, circulating FFA concentrations were greatly increased in non-fasted HFD-fed mice. In conclusion, a short-term HFD challenge does not affect lipolytic function of adipocytes. The observed increase of circulating FFA levels in randomly fed animals may rather be the result of increased dietary fat supply.",

Depletion of the 14-3-3ζ isoform affected parallel pathways that drive adipocyte development, including pathways controlling the stability of key adipogenic transcription factors and cell cycle progression. Going beyond adipocyte differentiation, this study opens new avenues of research in the context of metabolism, as 14-3-3ζ binds to a variety of well-established metabolic proteins that harbor its canonical phosphorylation binding motifs. This suggests that 14-3-3ζ may contribute to key metabolic signaling pathways, such as those that facilitate glucose uptake and fatty acid metabolism.

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue fatty acid storage varies according to sex, adipose tissue depot and degree of fat gain. However, the mechanism(s) for these variations is not completely understood. We recently published findings based on the glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) enzyme activity assay we optimized for use with human adipose tissue. These findings include a decrease in total GPAT and GPAT1 as a function of adipocyte size in both omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue and a strong, positive correlations between ACS, GPAT, and DGAT activities for both sexes and depots and between these storage factors and palmitate storage rates into TAG. The aim of this commentary is to expand upon the data from our recent publication. We describe here additional details on the optimization of the GPAT enzyme activity assay, a correlation between DGAT and percentage palmitate in the diacylglycerol fraction, and sex differences in fatty acid storage factors and storage rates into TAG at high palmitate concentrations.",

    "abstract": "The field of immunometabolism is burgeoning, with hundreds of papers published on the topic each year. Our understanding of the contribution of immune cells to metabolic regulation has expanded from a simple idea of innate immune cells, such as macrophages, altering adipose tissue function in obesity, to an awareness of the complex role of adaptive immunity in many different organ systems. Recent findings have clearly demonstrated the presence of adaptive lymphocytes, such as T and B cells, in adipose tissue. Furthermore, these data demonstrated T-cell accumulation and limited T-cell receptor repertoire diversity in obese adipose tissue, indicating that an antigen-specific immune response may occur within this tissue. In a recently published paper, we reported that a mouse model of weight cycling resulted in increased T-cell accumulation in adipose tissue. In the current commentary, we discuss the possibility that this increase in adipose tissue T-cell number could represent a local secondary immune response to self-antigens exposed in adipose tissue during obesity. If further experimentation indicates that this hypothesis is true, these data will fortify the concept that obesity is a complex immune-mediated disease and would emphasize the importance of designing therapies to maintain weight loss.",

    "abstract": "The role of the angiotensin type-2 receptor in adipose physiology remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate whether genetic angiotensin type-2 receptor-deficiency prevents or worsens metabolic and adipose tissue morphometric changes observed following a 6-week high-fat/high-fructose diet with injection of a small dose of streptozotocin. We compared tissue uptake of nonesterified fatty acid and dietary fatty acid in wild-type and angiotensin type-2 receptor-deficient mice by using the radiotracer 14(R,S)-[(1) (8)F]-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid in mice fed a standard or high-fat diet. Postprandial fatty acid uptake in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney and adipose tissue was increased in wild-type mice after a high-fat diet and in angiotensin type-2 receptor-deficient mice on both standard and high-fat diets. Compared to the wild-type mice, angiotensin type-2 receptor-deficient mice had a lower body weight, an increase in fasting blood glucose and a decrease in plasma insulin and leptin levels. Mice fed a high-fat diet exhibited increased adipocyte size that was prevented by angiotensin type-2 receptor-deficiency. Angiotensin type-2 receptor-deficiency abolished the early hypertrophic adipocyte remodeling induced by a high-fat diet. The small size of adipocytes in the angiotensin type-2 receptor-deficient mice reflects their inability to store lipids and explains the increase in fatty acid uptake in non-adipose tissues. In conclusion, a genetic deletion of the angiotensin type-2 receptor is associated with metabolic dysfunction of white adipose depots, and indicates that adipocyte remodeling occurs before the onset of insulin resistance in the high-fat fed mouse model.",

Our study aimed to demonstrate the mechanism underlying the olanzapine-induced insulin resistance and find appropriate drug interventions. In this study, firstly, we constructed rat insulin resistance model using a two-month gavage of olanzapine and used the main active ingredient mixture of Gegen Qinlian Decoction for the treatment. The activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was measured using the PET/CT scan, whereas Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR were used to detect the expression of GLUT4 and UCP1. The results showed that the long-term administration of olanzapine impaired glucose tolerance and produced insulin resistance in rats, while Gegen Qinlian Decoction could improve this side effect. The results of the PET/CT scan showed that the BAT activity in the insulin-resistant rats was significantly lower than that of the Gegen Qinlian Decoction treated rats. Also, the expression of GLUT4 and UCP1 in the insulin resistance group showed a significant decrease, which could be up-regulated by Gegen Qinliane Decoction treatment. The results of both in vivo and in vitro experiments were consistent. we demonstrated that the olanzapine could induce IR in vitro and in vivo by decreasing the expression of UCP1; thus, suppressing the thermogenesis of BAT and impairing glucose uptake. More importantly, we demonstrated a possible novel strategy to improve the olanzapine-induced IR by Gegen Qinlian Decoction.",

We also highlight the importance of AdECs to maintain adipocytes metabolic homoeostasis by regulating insulin sensitivity, lipid turnover and plasticity. The differential regulation of AdECs in adipose plasticity often depends on vascular density and metabolic states. Although choosing pro-angiogenic or anti-angiogenic therapies for obesity is still a matter of debate in clinical settings, the growing numbers of drugs have been confirmed to play an anti-obesity effect by affecting vascularization. Pharmacologic angiogenesis intervention has great potential as therapeutic strategies for obesity.",

However, the interaction between brown adipose tissues and NB remains unclear. The study aimed to investigate the effect of brown adipocytes in the co-culture system on the proliferation and migration of NB cells. Brown adipocytes promoted the proliferation and migration of Neuro-2a, BE(2)-M17, and SH-SY5Y cells under the co-culture system, with an increase of the mRNA and protein levels of UCP2 and PPAR-γ in NB cells. The UCP2 inhibitor genipin or PPAR-γ inhibitor T0090709 inhibited the migration of NB cells induced by brown adipocytes. Genipin or siUCP2 upregulated the expression of E-cadherin, and downregulated the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin in NB cells. We suggest that under co-cultivation conditions, NB cells can activate brown adipocytes, which triggers changes in various genes and promotes the proliferation and migration of NB cells. The PPAR-γ/UCP2 pathway is involved in the migration of NB cells caused by brown adipocytes.",

Fat cell sizes were measured from epicardial, paracardial, and appendix adipose tissues of post-mortem cases (N= 118 total, 37 females). Epicardial, extra-pericardial, and visceral fat volumes were measured by computed tomography from a subset of cases (N= 70, 22 females). Correlation analyses and stepwise linear regression were performed to identify predictors of fat cell size in males and females. Median fat cell sizes in all depots did not differ between males and females. Body mass index (BMI) and age were independently predictive of epicardial, paracardial, and appendix fat cell sizes in males, but not in females. Epicardial and appendix fat cell sizes were associated with epicardial and visceral fat volumes, respectively, in males only. In females, paracardial fat cell size was associated with extra-pericardial fat volume, while appendix fat cell size was associated with BMI only. No predictors were associated with epicardial fat cell size in females at the univariable or multivariable levels. To conclude, no clinical measurements were useful surrogates of epicardial fat cell size in females, while BMI, age, and epicardial fat volume were independent, albeit weak, predictors in males only.",

The role of insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the systemic and organ-specific responses to HFD is unclear. Using cixutumumab, a monoclonal antibody that internalizes and degrades cell surface IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1 R), leaving insulin receptor expression unchanged we aimed to establish the role of IGF-1 R in the response to a HFD. Mice treated with cixutumumab fed standard chow developed mild hyperinsulinemia with no change in WAT. When challenged by HFD mice treated with cixutumumab had reduced weight gain, reduced WAT expansion, and reduced hepatic lipid vacuole formation. In HFD-fed mice, cixutumumab led to reduced levels of genes encoding proteins important in fatty acid metabolism in WAT and liver. Cixutumumab protected against blunting of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in liver of HFD fed mice. These data reveal an important role for IGF-1 R in the WAT and hepatic response to short-term nutrient excess. IGF-1 R inhibition during HFD leads to a lipodystrophic phenotype with a failure of WAT lipid storage and protection from HFD-induced hepatic insulin resistance.",

SAT biopsies were obtained from 44 female subjects with or without T2D. Gene expression of ESR2 and markers of adipose function and metabolism was assessed. ESR2 knockdown was performed using CRISPR/Cas9 in preadipocytes isolated from SAT of females, and differentiation rate, lipid storage, and glucose uptake were measured.ESR2 expression was inversely correlated with measures of central obesity and expression of some fatty acid oxidation markers, and positively correlated with lipid storage and glucose transport markers. Differentiation was reduced in ESR2 knockdown preadipocytes. This corresponded to reduced expression of markers of differentiation and lipogenesis. Glucose uptake was reduced in knockdown adipocytes.Our results indicate that ESR2 deficiency in women is associated with visceral adiposity and impaired subcutaneous adipocyte differentiation as well as glucose and lipid utilization. High ESR2 expression, as seen after menopause, could be a contributing factor to SAT expansion. This may support a possible target to promote a healthy obesity phenotype.",

In this study, we employed an integrative analysis that combined Mendelian randomization (MR) and bioinformatics analyses to comprehensively explore the association between DR and adiponectin, aiming to provide a unified answer of their relationship. Using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, the odd ratio (OR) of developing DR per 1 mg/dL increment in genetically predicted log-transformed adiponectin concentration was estimated to be 0.949 (P = 0.557). Other robust MR methods produced consistent results, confirming the absence of a causal effect of adiponectin on DR. Additionally, the expression levels of the six adiponectin-related genes showed no significant differences among normal controls, individuals with diabetes but without DR, and those with DR Furthermore, the biological pathways enriched by these genes were not strongly relevant to DR. At both the individual gene and pathway levels, there were no overlaps between the adiponectin-related genes and the differentially expressed genes, indicating a lack of association between adiponectin and DR based on gene expression profiles. In summary, the integrative analysis, which combined MR and bioinformatics data mining, yielded compelling evidence supporting the notion that adiponectin is not a risk factor for DR.",

To test site variability, and whether the adipocyte extensive anaerobic metabolism of glucose was found in NSC, we analyzed, in parallel, subcutaneous, mesenteric and epididymal WAT of male adult Wistar rats. Adipocytes and NSC fractions, were isolated, counted and incubated (as well as red blood cells: RBC) with glucose, and their ability to use glucose and produce lactate, glycerol, and free fatty acids was measured. Results were computed taking into account the number of cells present in WAT samples. Cell numbers were found in proportions close to 1:13:100 (respectively, for adipocytes, NSC and RBC) but their volumes followed a reversed pattern: 7,500:10:1. When counting only non-fat cell volumes, the ratios changed dramatically to 100:10:1. RBC contribution to lactate production was practically insignificant. In most samples, NSC produced more lactate than adipocytes did, but only adipocytes secreted glycerol (and fatty acids in smaller amounts). Glucose consumption was also highest in NSC, especially in mesenteric WAT. The heterogeneous NSC showed a practically anaerobic metabolism (like that already observed in adipocytes). Thus, NSC quantitative production of lactate markedly contributed (i.e. more than adipocytes) to WAT global use (wasting) of glucose. We also confirmed that glucose-derived glycerol is exclusively produced by adipocytes.",

However, its role and mechanism in dedifferentiation of adipocyte remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of insulin on dedifferentiation of mice adipocytes, and the potential mechanisms. The preadipocytes were isolated from the subcutaneous white adipose tissue of wild type (WT), TNFα gene mutant (TNFα-/-), leptin gene spontaneous point mutant (db/db) and TNFα-/-/db/db mice and were then induced for differentiation. Interestingly, dedifferentiation of these adipocytes occurred once removing exogenous insulin from the adipogenic medium. As characteristics of dedifferentiation of the adipocytes, downregulation of adipogenic markers, upregulation of stemness markers and loss of intracellular lipids were observed from the four genotypes. Notably, dedifferentiation was occurring earlier if the insulin signal was blocked. These dedifferentiated cells regained the potentials of the stem cell-like characteristics. There is no significant difference in the characteristics of the dedifferentiation between the adipocytes. Overall, the study provided evidence that insulin plays a negative regulatory role in the dedifferentiation of adipocytes. We also confirmed that both dedifferentiation of mouse adipocytes, and effect of the insulin on this process were independent of the cell genotypes, while it is a widespread phenomenon in the adipocytes.",

    "abstract": "Insulin action initiates a series of phosphorylation events regulating cellular differentiation, growth and metabolism. We have previously discovered, in a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic study, that insulin/IGF-1 signalling induces phosphorylation of retinoid x receptor alpha (RXRα) at S22 in mouse brown pre-adipocytes. Here, we show that insulin induces the phosphorylation of RXRα at S22 in both brown precursor and mature adipocytes through a pathway involving ERK, downstream of IRS-1 and −2. We also found that RXRα S22 phosphorylation is promoted by insulin and upon re-feeding in brown adipose tissue in vivo, and that insulin-stimulated S22 phosphorylation of RXRα is dampened by diet-induced obesity. We used Rxra knockout cells re-expressing wild type (WT) or S22A non-phosphorylatable forms of RXRα to further characterize the role of S22 in brown adipocytes. Knockout of Rxra in brown pre-adipocytes resulted in decreased lipid accumulation and adipogenic gene expression during differentiation, and re-expression of RxraWT alleviated these effects. However, we observed no significant difference in cells re-expressing the RxraS22A mutant as compared with the cells re-expressing RxraWT. Furthermore, comparison of gene expression during adipogenesis in the WT and S22A re-expressing cells by RNA sequencing revealed similar transcriptomic profiles. Thus, our data propose a dispensable role for RXRα S22 phosphorylation in adipogenesis and transcription in differentiating brown pre-adipocytes.",

Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a critical transporter, is expressed in the outer membrane of mitochondria. We speculated that [18F]DPA714, a specific TSPO tracer, may monitor BAT activity in tumor-bearing mice in vivo. We first analyzed the radioactive uptake of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers in BAT of CT26 xenograft mice with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) and [18F]DPA714. We also studied the BAT uptake of [18F]DPA714 in CT26, A549 and LLC tumor models. The dynamic distribution of [18F]FDG is quite variable among animals, even in mice of the same tumor model (%ID/g-mean: mean ± SDM, 8.61 ± 8.90, n = 16). Contrarily, [18F]DPA714 produced high-quality and stable BAT imaging in different tumor models and different animals of the same model. Interestingly, %ID/g-mean of [18F]DPA714 in BAT was significantly higher on day 26 than that on day 7 in CT26 xenograft model. Taken together, these results strongly indicate the potential feasibility of [18F]DPA714 PET imaging in investigating BAT and energy metabolism during tumor progression in preclinical and clinical study.",

SUMO/sentrin specific protease 1 (SENP1) is a critical protease that is required during the process of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation, which are dynamic mechanisms that influence cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and apoptotic status. However, the contribution of SENP1 to these important cellular processes in hADSCs is largely uncharacterized and further studies in this area are required. Here, we show for the first time that after knock out SENP1 in hADSCs, their capacity to migrate and proliferate were inhibited, while apoptosis was enhanced. However, SENP1 did not significantly influence the morphology and MSC-related phenotypes of the hADSCs. These results highlight a role for SENP1 during hADSC growth, and its potential as a therapeutic target to improve the efficacy and safety of hADSCs in the clinic.",

Hypoperfusion in the vascular walls due to stenosis of the vasa vasorum is reportedly a cause of AAA onset and involves the induction of adventitial ectopic adipocytes. Recent studies have reported that ectopic adipocytes are associated with AAA rupture in both human and hypoperfusion-induced animal models, highlighting the pathological importance of hypoperfusion and adipocytes in AAA. However, the relationship between hypoperfusion and AAA remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the changes in inflammation-related factors in adipocytes at low glucose and serum levels. Low glucose and serum levels enhanced the production of AAA-related factors in 3T3-L1 cells. Low glucose and serum levels increased the activation of protein kinase B (also known as Akt), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and nuclear factor (NF) кB at the protein level. The inflammatory factors and related signalling pathways were markedly decreased following the return of the cells to normal culture conditions. These data suggest that low glucose and serum levels increase the levels of inflammatory factors through the activation of Akt, mitogen activated protein kinase, and NF-κB signalling pathways.",

For the purposes of this study, we collected blood samples before and after the treatment with HDSC from 60 GO patients and 34 control subjects and measured serum levels of adiponectin, AIF-1, A-FABP and FGF-21. Levels of adiponectin significantly differed among the three study groups (ANOVA p = 0.03). AIF-1 levels were also significantly different among the study groups (ANOVA p < 0.0001). AIF-1 was significantly associated with the presence of GO after adjusting for clinical factors (age, sex, smoking and BMI) and level of TSH (odds ratio 1.003, p < 0.01).

SPRY1, a feedback inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, is expressed in PDGFRa+ adipocyte progenitor cells (APC) in vivo. Global deficiency of Spry1 in mice results in disproportionate postnatal growth of gonadal WAT (gWAT), while iWAT and BAT were similar in size between Spry1KO and WT mice. Spry1 deficiency increased the number of PDGFRa+ stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells in gWAT and showed increased proliferation and fibrosis. Spry1KO gWAT had increased collagen deposition and elevated expression of markers of inflammation. In vitro, SPRY1 was transiently down regulated during early adipocyte differentiation of SVF cells, with levels increasing at later stages of differentiation. SPRY1 deficiency enhances PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB induced proliferation of SVF cells. Increased proliferation of SVF from Spry1KO gWAT accompanies an increase in AKT activation. PDGF-AA stimulated a transient down regulation of SPRY1 in wild type SVF, whereas PDGF-BB stimulated a sustained down regulation of SPRY1 in wild type SVF. Collectively, our data suggest that SPRY1 is critical for regulating postnatal growth of gWAT by restraining APC proliferation and differentiation in part by regulation of PDGFRa/b-AKT signaling.",

Here, we applied the ATAC-seq method to depict a high-quality genome‐wide time-resolved accessible chromatin atlas during adipogenesis of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). Our data indicated that the chromatin accessibility drastic dynamically reformed during the adipogenesis of hASCs and 8 h may be the critical transition node of adipogenesis chromatin states from commitment phase to determination phase. Moreover, upon adipogenesis, we also found that the chromatin accessibility of regions related to anti-apoptotic, angiogenic and immunoregulatory gradually increased, which is beneficial to maintaining the health of adipose tissue (AT). Finally, the chromatin accessibility changed significantly in intronic regions of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ during adipogenesis, and these regions were rich in transcription factors binding motifs that were exposed for further regulation. Overall, we systematically analysed the complex change of chromatin accessibility occurring in the early stage of adipogenesis and deepened our understanding of human adipogenesis. Furthermore, we also provided a good reference data resource of genome‐wide chromatin accessibility for future studies on human adipogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is emerging as an epidemiological issue, being associated with the onset and progress of various metabolism-related disorders. Obesity is characterized by the white adipose expansion, which encounters white adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia. White adipocyte hyperplasia is defined as adipogenesis with the increase in the number of the white adipocytes from the preadipocytes. Adipogenesis contributes to distributing excess triglycerides among the smaller newly formed adipocytes, reducing the number of hypertrophic adipocytes and secreting anti-inflammatory factor. Therefore, adipogenesis is emerging as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity. In the present study, for a better understanding of the contribution of the alteration of the omental differentiated white adipocytes to the systemic metabolic disorders, we downloaded the mRNA expression profiles from GEO database GSE1657, 328 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened between the undifferentiated preadipocytes (UNDIF) and omental differentiated white adipocytes (DIF). The contributions of the upregulated and downregulated DEGs to the system were performed via the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network, respectively. The potential contribution of the whole altered genes in the differentiated white adipocytes was explored with the performance of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), especially on the GO analysis, KEGG analysis, hallmark analysis, oncogenic analysis and related miRNA analysis. The output of the current study will shed light on the new targets for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related disorders.",

However, the effects of TMAO on vWAT in hypertension remained incompletely explored. The impact of a chronic 22-week-long treatment with 1 g/L TMAO on vWAT, and its transcriptional and metabolic changes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were evaluated by serum cytokine measurements, histological analysis, fatty acid determinations, and co-expression network analyses. TMAO increased the serum interleukin-6 levels and insulin secretion in SHRs. The adipocyte size was diminished in the SHR 1 g/L TMAO group. In addition, one kind of monounsaturated fatty acids (cis-15-tetracosenoate) and four kinds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (cis-11,14,17-eicosatrienoic acid, docosatetraenoate, docosapentaenoate n-3, and docosapentaenoate n-6) were elevated by TMAO treatment. Three co-expression modules significantly related to TMAO treatment were identified and pathway enrichment analyses indicated that phagosome, lysosome, fatty acid metabolism, valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation and metabolic pathways were the most significantly altered biological pathways. This study shed new light on the metabolic roles of TMAO on the vWAT of SHRs. TMAO regulated the metabolic status of vWAT, including reduced lipogenesis and an improved specific fatty acid composition. The mechanisms underlying these effects likely involve phagosome and lysosome pathways.",

Here, we found that SPRY4 positively correlates with the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived MSCs (hAMSCs).

Immunohistochemical, western blot and PCR analyses revealed that these tissues expressed BAT markers such as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and CIDEA, but not white adipose markers, and β3-adrenergic stimulation increased UCP1 amounts, a classic characteristic of BAT tissue. The newly identified BAT stores contained extensive sympathetic innervation with high mitochondrial density and multilocular lipid droplets similar to interscapular BAT. BAT repositories were present and functional neonatally, and showed developmental changes between the neonatal and adult periods. In summary, several new depots showing classical BAT characteristics are reported and characterized in the lower abdominal/pelvic region of mice. These BAT stores are likely significant metabolic regulators in the mouse and some data suggests that similar BAT depots may also exist in humans.",

    "abstract": "The posttranslational modification (PTM) in protein occurs in a regiospecific manner. In addition, the most commonly occurring PTMs involve similar residues in proteins such as acetylation, ubiquitylation, methylation and sumoylation at the lysine residue and phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc modification at serine/threonine residues. Thus, the possibility of modification sites where two such PTMs may occur in a mutually exclusive manner (ME-PTM) is much higher than known. A recent surge in the identification and the mapping of the commonly occurring PTMs in proteins has revealed that this is indeed the case. However, in what way such ME-PTM sites are regulated and what could be their relevance in the coordinated network of protein function remains to be known. To gain such potential insights in a biological context, we analyzed two most prevalent PTMs on the lysine residue by acetylation and ubiquitylation along with the most abundant PTM in proteins by phosphorylation among enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, a fundamental process in biology. The analysis of the PTM data sets has revealed two important clues that may be intrinsically associated with their regulation and function. First, the most commonly occurring PTMs by phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitylation are widespread and clustered in most of the enzymes involved in glucose metabolism; and the prevalence of phosphorylation sites correlates with the number of acetylation and ubiquitylation sites including the ME-modification sites. Second, the prevalence of ME-acetylation/ubiquitylation sites is exceptionally high among enzymes involved in glucose metabolism and have distinct pattern among the subset of enzymes of glucose metabolism such as glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycogen synthesis, and the irreversible steps of gluconeogenesis. We hypothesize that phosphorylation including tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of ME-acetylation/ubiquitylation sites and their similar pattern among the subset of functionally related proteins allows their coordinated regulation in the normal physiology. Similarly their coordinated dysregulation may underlie the disease processes such as reprogrammed metabolism in cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Our hypothesis provides an opportunity to understand the regulation of ME-PTMs in proteins and their relevance at the network level and is open for experimental validation.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal adipokine production, along with defective uptake and metabolism of glucose within adipocytes, contributes to insulin resistance and altered glucose homeostasis. Recent research has highlighted one of the mechanisms that accounts for impaired production of adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and adipocyte glucose uptake in obesity. In adipocytes of human obese subjects and mice fed with a high fat diet, the level of the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) is diminished. Reduction of ICER elevates the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) activity, which in turn increases the repressor activating transcription factor 3. In fine, the cascade triggers reduction in the ADIPOQ and GLUT4 levels, which ultimately hampers insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) interacting-protein 1, also called islet brain 1 (IB1), is a target of CREB/ICER that promotes JNK-mediated insulin resistance in adipocytes. A rise in IB1 and c-Jun levels accompanies the drop of ICER in white adipose tissues of obese mice when compared with mice fed with a chow diet. Other than the expression of ADIPOQ and glucose transport, decline in ICER expression might impact insulin signaling. Impairment of ICER is a critical issue that will need major consideration in future therapeutic purposes.",

The regional distribution of lipid deposited within adipose tissue (AT) - so called body fat distribution (BFD) - is a strong risk factor for NCDs. BFD is highly heritable; however, the genetic basis of BFD is almost entirely unknown. Genome-wide association studies have identified several loci associated with BFD, including at Plexin D1 (PLXND1) - a gene known to modulate angiogenesis. We recently demonstrated that zebrafish homozygous for a null mutation in plxnd1 had a reduced capacity to store lipid in visceral AT (VAT) leading to altered BFD. Moreover, we found that type V collagens were upregulated in plxnd1 mutants, and mediated the inhibitory effect of Plxnd1 on VAT growth. These results strengthen evidence that Plxnd1 influences BFD in human populations, and validate zebrafish as a model to study BFD. However, many pertinent questions remain unanswered. Here we outline potential Plxnd1 mechanisms of action in AT, and describe the genetic architecture at human PLXND1 that is associated with BFD and NCD susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of adipose tissue metabolism is associated with multiple metabolic disorders. One such disease, known as Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD2) is characterized by defective fat metabolism and storage. FPLD2 is caused by a specific subset of mutations in the LMNA gene. The mechanisms by which LMNA mutations lead to the adipose specific FPLD2 phenotype have yet to be determined in detail. We used RNA-Seq analysis to assess the effects of wild-type (WT) and mutant (R482W) lamin A on the expression profile of differentiating 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes and identified Itm2a as a gene that was upregulated at 36 h post differentiation induction in these cells. In this study we identify Itm2a as a novel modulator of adipogenesis and show that endogenous Itm2a expression is transiently downregulated during induction of 3T3-L1 differentiation. Itm2a overexpression was seen to moderately inhibit differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes while shRNA mediated knockdown of Itm2a significantly enhanced 3T3-L1 differentiation. Investigation of PPARγ levels indicate that this enhanced adipogenesis is mediated through the stabilization of the PPARγ protein at specific time points during differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate that Itm2a knockdown is sufficient to rescue the inhibitory effects of lamin A WT and R482W mutant overexpression on 3T3-L1 differentiation. This suggests that targeting of Itm2a or its related pathways, including autophagy, may have potential as a therapy for FPLD2.",

Normal glucose tolerance (NGT) was identified in 31 women and impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) in 8. Women with IGM had higher BMI/fat mass, and related expected adipose tissue features, than women with NGT. Ethnicity was similar in the groups, but numerically there was a higher proportion of European women in the NGT group and a higher proportion of non-European women in the IGM group. BMI was the best discriminator of NGT versus IGM (multivariable logistic regression: OR = 1.34, P < 0.01). Waist-to-height ratio and adipocyte volume were most strongly associated with HOMA-IR (multivariable linear regression: R2 = 0.656, P < 0.001). After adjustment for BMI/ethnicity, women with IGM had increased serum adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, weight gain after index pregnancy, and a lower proportion of fat-free mass. These factors, together with high BMI, abdominal fat distribution, and enlarged adipocytes, may increase the risk of progression to T2DM after GDM.",

    "abstract": "Mast cell lipid bodies are key to initiation, maintenance and resolution of inflammatory responses in tissue. Mast cell lines, primary bone marrow-derived mast cells and peripheral blood basophils present a 'steatotic' phenotype in response to chronic insulin exposure, where cells become loaded with lipid bodies. Here we show this state is associated with reduced histamine release, but increased capacity to release bioactive lipids. We describe the overall lipid phenotype of mast cells in this insulin-induced steatotic state and the consequences for critical cellular lipid classes involved in stages of inflammation. We show significant insulin-induced shifts in specific lipid classes, especially arachidonic acid derivatives, MUFA and PUFA, the EPA/DHA ratio, and in cardiolipins, especially those conjugated to certain DHA and EPAs. Functionally, insulin exposure markedly alters the FcεRI-induced release of Series 4 leukotriene LTC4, Series 2 prostaglandin PGD2, Resolvin-D1, Resolvin-D2 and Resolvin-1, reflecting the expanded precursor pools and impact on both the pro-inflammation and pro-resolution bioactive lipids that are released during mast cell activation. Chronic hyperinsulinemia is a feature of obesity and progression to Type 2 Diabetes, these data suggest that mast cell release of key lipid mediators is altered in patients with metabolic syndrome.",

However, assessing UCP1 protein levels in beige adipocytes is challenging because of the high level of lipid contaminants in WAT. This study showed that an acetone precipitation method had advantages over conventional methods for eliminating lipid contaminants, achieving clear Western blot bands for WAT proteins, especially UCP1.

The differentiation of preadipocytes and the deposition of lipid droplets in the adipocytes are the key to regulate the IMF content. The differentiation of adipocytes is regulated by a series of transcription factors and genes. Acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 (Acot2) hydrolyzes the acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) into free fatty acids and CoA and has the potential to maintain the free fatty acids and acyl CoA at the cellular level. In this work, we detected the expression of the Acot2 gene during the adipocyte differentiation in Chinese Red Steppe cattle, and then interfered and overexpressed the Acot2 gene in the preadipocytes to explore its regulatory role in the adipocyte differentiation. The results showed that the expression and regulation of Acot2 mainly occurred at the later stage of the adipocyte differentiation. The interference with the Acot2 gene significantly inhibited the lipid droplets accumulation and triglyceride content, while its overexpression significantly promoted both of them. The results of this study show that the Acot2 gene is a positive regulator of the adipocyte differentiation and may become a new target to improve the beef quality.",

    "abstract": "We discovered a unique expression pattern of two histone methyltransferases Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, both of which preferentially catalyse the formation of H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and further H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), a transcriptional repressive mark. The expression of Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 displayed a sharp increase at the early stage of 3T3-L1 differentiation, which peaked after differentiation induction, and then declined towards later stage of differentiation, suggesting a key role for these two histone methyltransferases in adipogenesis. Indeed, inactivating Suv39h1 or Suv39h2 via lentiviral shRNA knockdown inhibited adipogenesis, while overexpressing Suv39h1 promoted adipogenesis. Notably, overexpressing or knocking down Suv39h1 in 3T3-L1 cells was associated with reciprocal changes in the expression of Wnt10a, an anti-adipogenic regulator. Further, Wnt10a knockdown largely prevented the inhibitory effect of Suv39h1 on adipogenesis, indicating Wnt10a as a downstream target mediating Suv39h1's action in adipogenesis. Mechanistically, our comprehensive approaches involving ChIP, co-immunoprecipitation and pyrosequencing analysis demonstrated that Suv39h1 may regulate Wnt10a expression via H3K9 methylation and interaction with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) at the Wnt10a promoter, resulting in altered DNA methylation at the promoter. We conclude that Suv39h promotes adipogenesis by epigenetically down-regulating Wnt10a expression via H3K9me3 and DNA methylation at the Wnt10a promoter.Abbreviated title: Suv39h and 3T3-L1 Adipogenesis",

The results showed that even minor differences in the function of proteins regulating exocytosis are sufficient to provoke metabolic disease, including hyperglycaemia, liver steatosis, adipocyte hypertrophy and obesity. Thus, an imbalance in the dynamics of hormonal and/or neurotransmitter release can cause obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Modified responses and the metabolism of hormones have been observed in visceral adiposity during obesity, specifically as related with cortisone. The objective of this study was to assess, in the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line, the short-term effect of cortisone on the expression of 11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (Hsd1), which is responsible for activation of cortisone into cortisol, and for Aquaporin 7 (Aqp7), involved in glycerol transport through the cell membrane. Total RNA (tRNA) and complementary DNA (cDNA) were obtained from cell samples treated with cortisone (0.1, 1, and 10 μM) during different times (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min, and 48 h) to quantify the expression of the aforementioned genes by real time PCR employing MnSOD and Ppia as housekeeping genes. There was a time-dependent response of Aqp7, a dose-dependent response of Hsd1, and an increase observed in the expression of both genes during min 1 of treatment (5- and 6-fold, respectively), followed by a decrease during the following 5-10 min (P < 0.05). With the 1-μM cortisone treatment, both genes showed cubic tendencies in their expression; the Hsd1 tendency is described by the equation y = 0.18×(3)-1.65×(2)+3.59x+1.31, while the Aqp7 tendency is described by y = 0.33×(3)-2.67×(2)+4.93x+1.84.

We illuminated POU class 2 homeobox associating factor 1 (POU2AF1) may promote MSCs adipogenesis by histone deacetylases 1 (HDAC1) signalling. Human retroperitoneal adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from overweight and control groups of patients. IncRNA microarray was used to identified gene expression levels. Adenovirus transduction and cellular small-interfering RNA transfection were used to achieve overexpression and interference of POU2AF1 or HDAC1. Adipogenesis was identified by Oil-red O staining, triglycende, cholesterol assay, real-time PCR and Western Blot. POU2AF1 expression was upregulated in retroperitoneal adipose tissue of overweight patients, and increased during adipogenesis. Overexpression of POU2AF1 promoted spontaneous adipogenesis without adipogenic treatment. Silencing of endogenous POU2AF1 in MSCs inhibited adipogenesis. Overexpression of POU2AF1 alleviated the translocation of HDAC1 to the nucleus. The mRNA level of HDAC1 was also reduced. Co-transfection of Ad-POU2AF1 and Ad-HDAC1 partially reversed the promotion effect of POU2AF1 overexpression in MSCs spontaneous adipogenic differentiation.

We conducted CT-based sex-specific abdominal fat measurements in ccRCC patients to assess whether VFA distribution could predict the ccRCC T stage. In total, 253 patients (182 males and 71 females) from our hospital with pathologically confirmed ccRCC (178 low T-stage and 75 high T-stage) were retrospectively reviewed for the present study. Computed tomography (CT) scans were assessed using ImageJ to differentiate between the visceral and subcutaneous fat areas (VFA and SFA), after which the relative VFA (rVFA) and total fat area (TFA) were computed. The relationships between these fat area-related variables, patient age, sex, and BMI, and ccRCC T stage were then evaluated through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to clarify the association between general or sex-specific abdominal visceral fat and T stage. Following adjustment for age, males with high T stage ccRCC exhibited an increased rVFA as compared to males with low T stage ccRCC, with the same relationship being observed among females. This association between rVFA and high T stage was confirmed through both univariate and multivariate models. As thus, sex-specific visceral fat composition is a reliable independent predictor that can identify both male and female patients with high T stage ccRCC.",

However, this report is unlike any published for all other breeds of cattle we have worked with or that we have seen in published reports, in which mature adipocytes retain and distribute lipids into daughter cells symmetrically or asymmetrically. In the present work, we noted that Angus-derived mature adipocytes extruded a majority of their cellular lipid droplets prior to cell division. In this manner, these cells are processing lipid in a manner observed in mature adipocytes isolated from swine tissue. These results suggest that regulation of the mechanism(s) underlying lipid processing might be different between and within animal breeds.

    "abstract": "While body weight is essentially determined by the balance of energy intake and energy consumption, it is not necessarily the case that changes in daily food intakes and exercise directly reflect changes in body weight. In recent years, it has been revealed that numerous metabolic interactions between organs, which are organized by the brain, function as a feedback mechanism, and are involved in maintaining body weight homeostasis against excess energy intake. On the other hand, since obesity has seen an explosive increase in this age of plenty, there must be other interactions between organs working as feedforward mechanisms favoring weight gain. However, no such interaction has yet been demonstrated. Recently, we discovered a new interorgan neural network, from the liver, which may represent the feedforward mechanism.(1) Under conditions of excessive energy intake, changes in glucose metabolism occur in the liver with increased expression of hepatic glucokinase (GK) and the induction of neuronal signal transmission via the afferent vagus nerve. These signals are received by the medulla and result in inactivation of sympathetic nerve to brown adipose tissue (BAT), thereby suppressing thermogenesis in BAT and promoting adiposity. Furthermore, the efficacy of the liver-to-BAT interaction differs among mouse strains and these differences may contribute to determining the obesity predispositions of various strains. In conclusion, this novel interorgan neuronal relay system functions to suppress energy expenditure when energy intake is increased, and thus, is considered to be a thrifty mechanism operating on the whole body level. During periods when sufficient food was not always available, this system worked in favor of survival. However, in the current age of plenty, it is assumed to work as a mechanism flipping a metabolic switch toward obesity.",

    "abstract": "PKCλ, an atypical member of the multifunctional protein kinase C family, has been implicated in the regulation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport and of the intracellular immune response. To further elucidate the role of this cellular regulator in diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, we generated both liver (PKC-Alb) and adipose tissue (PKC-Ap2) specific knockout mice. Body weight, fat mass, food intake, glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure were evaluated in mice maintained on either chow or high fat diet (HFD). Ablation of PKCλ from the adipose tissue resulted in mice that were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates. However, PKC-Alb mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity (DIO). Surprisingly this DIO resistance was not associated with either a reduction in caloric intake or an increase in energy expenditure as compared with their wild-type littermates. Furthermore, these mice displayed an improvement in glucose tolerance. When maintained on chow diet, these mice were similar to wild types in respect to body weight and fat mass, yet insulin sensitivity was impaired compared with wt littermates. Taken together these data suggest that hepatic PKCλ is modulating insulin-mediated glucose turnover and response to high fat diet feeding, thus offering a deeper understanding of an important target for anti-obesity therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and diabetes are major health concerns worldwide. Western diets, often calorically rich, paired with sedentary habits are driving the current worldwide epidemic of pediatric and adult obesity. In addition, age related energy imbalances lead to increased adiposity and metabolic disorders later in life, making the middle aged population particularly susceptible. Here we discuss how Forkhead box A3 (Foxa3), a family member of the forkhead box binding proteins, can potentially contribute to pathology by playing a double role in metabolism. Recent data revealed that Foxa3 favors the selective expansion of visceral depots under high caloric conditions (e.g., high fat diet) and suppresses subcutaneous fat tissue energy expenditure during aging. This evidence suggests that Foxa3 acts to both preserve and conserve calories, by accumulating fat and by reducing metabolic burn. In other words, Foxa3 appears to function to enable energy \"hoarding,\" which may be critical for survival of organisms with intermittent exposure to external caloric sources, but pathologic in circumstances where calories are abundant. Understanding how this \"calorie hoarder gene\" functions may suggest approaches to combat obesity and associated metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "There are many unanswered questions related to the heterogeneity of adipose tissue depots and the paucity of their function, development, and organization at the cellular level. Much effort has been directed at studying white adipose tissue (WAT), the driver of obesity and the associated metabolic disease. In recent years, the importance of brown adipose tissue (BAT) has also been appreciated. While BAT depots are prominent in many small mammal species, their detection in adult humans has been technically challenging and the identity of brown human adipocytes found within depots of WAT has remained controversial. We recently reported a peptide probe that binds to BAT vasculature and, when coupled with a near-infrared fluorophore, can be used to detect BAT in whole body imaging. This probe reliably discriminates between endothelium associated with brown or brown-like (beige/brite) adipocytes and endothelium of visceral WAT. Improved probes based on this approach could aid in assessing human adipose tissue body distribution and remodeling, which is a process underlying various pathologies. This commentary aims at discussing open questions that need to be addressed before full clinical advantage can be taken from adipose tissue imaging, as well as its metabolic activation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is often associated with systemic insulin resistance, and the decline of insulin sensitivity marks the progression of obesity into a disease state. We recently generated a mouse with adipose-specific ablation of the p110α phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit to model insulin resistance in this organ. The phenotypes of this animal revealed novel roles of adipose PI3K signaling in regulating body weight and systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis. Loss of p110α in the brown adipose tissue resulted in reduced expression of mitochondrial-associated genes and decreased respiration in brown adipocytes. Reduced activity of the brown adipose tissue in p110α-null mice lowered their energy expenditure, which promoted obesity and systemic metabolic dysfunction with increased lipid deposition in the liver. Loss of PI3K activity did not affect adiposity until sexual maturation, suggesting that the effect of adipose PI3K on obesity might be linked to the development of puberty. Elevated leptin in the p110α knockout mice might interfere with the reproductive axis to delay pubertal development. The increase in adiposity induced by adipose-specific loss of p110α provides a link between insulin resistance and obesity onset and may also provide deeper insight into changes in prepubescent insulin sensitivity that can affect metabolism later in life.",

OSM was shown to inhibit adipogenesis, suppress browning, and contribute to insulin resistance in cultured white adipocytes. In contrast, OSM may have a metabolically favourable role on adipocytes in mouse models of obesity and insulin resistance. However, a putative role of OSM in modulating lipolysis has not been investigated in detail to date. To address this, cultured white adipocytes of mouse or human origin were exposed to 10 or 100 ng/ml of OSM for various time periods. In murine 3T3-L1 cells, OSM stimulation directly activated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and other players of the lipolytic machinery, and dose-dependently increased free fatty acid and glycerol release. In parallel, OSM attenuated insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis and induced phosphorylation of serine-residues on the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) protein. Key experiments were verified in a second murine and a human adipocyte cell line. Inhibiton of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 activation, abolished OSM-mediated HSL phosphorylation and lipolysis. In conclusion, OSM signalling directly promotes lipolysis in white adipocytes in an ERK1/2-dependent manner.",

Patients with PCa had higher PPAT thickness (4.64 [3.65-5.86] vs. 3.54 [2.49-4.51] mm, p < 0.001) and subcutaneous fat thickness (29.19 [23.05-35.95] vs. 27.90 [21.43-33.93] mm, p = 0.013) than those without PCa.

By reducing the length of exposure to adipogenic hormones, in combination with a physiological glucose concentration (5 mM), and the provision of exogenous fatty acids (reflecting typical dietary fatty acids), we were able to restore early insulin signalling events and glucose uptake, which were impaired by extended use of hormones and a high glucose concentration, respectively. Furthermore, the addition of exogenous fatty acids greatly increased the storage of triglycerides and removed the artificial demand to synthesize all fatty acids by de novo lipogenesis. Thus, modifying the adipogenic cocktail can enhance functional aspects of human adipocytes in vitro and is an important variable to consider prior to in vitro investigations into adipocyte biology.",

    "abstract": "Mature adipocytes are notoriously difficult to study ex vivo and alternative cell culture systems have therefore been developed. One of the most common models are human adipose progenitor cells (hAPCs). Unfortunately, these display replicative senescence after prolonged culture conditions, which limits their use in mechanistic studies.Herein, we knocked in human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) into the AAVS1 locus of CD55+ hAPCs derived from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue and characterized the cells before and after differentiation into adipocytes.Immortalized TERT-hAPCs retained proliferative and adipogenic capacities comparable to those of early-passage wild type hAPCs for > 80 passages. In line with this, our integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that TERT-hAPCs displayed robust adipocyte expression profiles in comparison to wild type hAPCs. This was confirmed by functional analyses of lipid turnover where TERT-hAPCs exhibited pronounced responses to insulin and pro-lipolytic stimuli such as isoprenaline, dibutyrul cAMP and tumour necrosis factor alpha. In addition, TERT-hAPCs could be readily cultured in both standard 2D and 3D-cultures and proteomic analyses revealed that the spheroid culture conditions improved adipogenesis.Through descriptive and functional studies, we demonstrate that immortalization of human CD55+ hAPCs is feasible and results in cells with stable proliferative and adipogenic capacities over multiple passages. As these cells are cryopreservable, they provide the additional advantage over primary cells of allowing repeated studies in both 2D and 3D model systems with the same genetic background.

Group A: Standard TEC model was constructed; Group B: the epigastric vessel bundles were dissected from the fat flap and ligated, fat flap was cut into granules and planted into the chamber; Group C: Free fat was planted in the chamber. At week 6, samples in the chamber were harvested.Results: Significant volume increase was observed in group A and B, while the volume decreased in group C (P<0.05). Regeneration morphology could be found according to the histological observation in A and B. Micro CT results showed the ligated vessels into grafted fat sprouting robustly, coordinated with volume changes.Conclusion: Fat grafts in TEC model could not only survive but also regenerate. The combination of fat graft and TEC could fabricate a vascularized fat flap, which was a promising method in breast reconstruction.Abbreviations: VOI: Volumes of Interest; TEC: Tissue Engineering Chamber; CAL: Cell Assisted Lipotransfer.",

Conventional cell staining methods are used to determine the formation of adipose areas during adipogenesis as a qualitative representation of adipogenic potency. Staining methods such as oil-red-O are quantifiable using absorbance measurements, but these assays are time and material consuming. Detection methods for cell characteristics using advanced image analysis by machine learning are emerging. Here, live-cell imaging was combined with a deep learning-based detection tool to quantify the presence of adipose areas and lipid droplet formation during adipogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stem/stromal cells. Different detection masks quantified adipose area and lipid droplet formation at different time points indicating kinetics of adipogenesis and showed differences between individual donors. Whereas CEBPA and PPARG expression seems to precede the increase in adipose area and lipid droplets, it might be able to predict expression of ADIPOQ. The applied method is a proof of concept, demonstrating that deep learning methods can be used to investigate adipogenic differentiation and kinetics in vitro using specific detection masks based on algorithm produced from annotation of image data.",

To study the stimulatory capacity of ASC on endothelial progenitor cells we used a commercially available co-culture system (V2a - assay). ASC, isolated from lipoaspirates of 18 healthy patients, were co-cultured for 13 d on endothelial progenitor cells. Using anti CD31 immunostaining, cells that had undergone endothelial differentiation were quantified after the defined co-cultivation period. Endothelial cell differentiation was observed and demonstrated by an increase in area covered by CD31+ cells compared with less to no endothelial cell differentiation in negative and media-only controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in supernatant medium collected during the co-cultivation period revealed elevated VEGF levels in the co-culture samples as compared with ASC cultures alone, whereas no increase in adiponectin was detected by ELISA. These findings help to provide further insights in the complex interplay of adipose derived cells and endothelial cells and to better understand the diversity of ASCs in respect of their stimulatory capacity to promote angiogenesis in vitro.",

We recently discovered that the loss-of-function of the Src homology domain-containing protein Nck2 in mice promotes adiposity accompanied with adipocyte hypertrophy and impaired function, and enhanced adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Moreover, in severely-obese human's adipose tissue, we found that Nck2 expression is markedly downregulated. In this commentary, our goal is to expand upon additional findings providing further evidence for a unique Nck2-dependent mechanism regulating adipogenesis. We propose that Nck2 should be further investigated as a regulator of the reliance of white adipose tissue on hyperplasia versus hypertrophy during adipose tissue expansion, and hence, as a potential novel molecular target in obesity.",

Ninety-three percent of adipose samples measured were bimodal (P < 0.0001); therefore, we describe and propose a method of testing hyperplasia or lipid filling of previously divided fibroblastic cells based upon the probability of an adipocyte falling into 2 chosen competing \"bins\" as adiposity increases. We also conclude that increased adiposity is correlated positively with an adipocyte being found in the minor mode (r = 0.46) and correlated negatively with an adipocyte being found in the major mode (r = −0.22), providing evidence of either hyperplasia or lipid filling of previously divided fibroblastic cells. We additionally conclude that as adiposity increases, the mode of the major distribution of cells occurs at a larger diameter of adipocyte, indicating hypertrophy.",

Ex vivo studies of this process elucidated an elegant network of mostly transcription factors that drive APCs through the differentiation (adipogenesis) process. Here we discuss our study that identified an Adamts1 signal as a glucocorticoid and diet responsive regulator of an extracellular relay system that modulates the initiation of this intracellular adipogenesis program in APCs.

    "abstract": "In the last decade, results in both animal models and humans have demonstrated that white adipocytes are generated over the entire life-span. This adds to the plasticity of adipose tissue and alterations in adipocyte turnover are linked to metabolic dysfunction. Adipocytes are derived from precursors present primarily in the perivascular areas of adipose tissue but their precise origin remains unclear. The multipotent differentiation capacity of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC) has prompted the suggestion that BMDC may contribute to different cell tissue pools, including adipocytes. However, data in murine transplantation models have been conflicting and it has been a matter of debate whether BMDC actually differentiate into adipocytes or just fuse with resident fat cells. To resolve this controversy in humans, we recently performed a study in 65 subjects that had undergone bone marrow transplantation. Using a set of newly developed assays including single cell genome-wide analyses of mature adipocytes, we demonstrated that bone marrow contributes with approximately 10 % to the adipocyte pool. This proportion was more than doubled in obesity, suggesting that BMDC may constitute a reserve pool for adipogenesis, particularly upon weight gain. This commentary discusses the possible relevance of these and other recent findings for human pathophysiology.",

Gene expression of inflammatory factors, chemokines and immune markers in adipocytes and adipose tissue, cytokines in cell culture medium and serum, and inflammation regulatory pathways in adipocytes were detected. Results showed that UA increased the expression of interleukins and chemokines, but not TNFα, in both adipocytes and adipose tissue.

Cd14 expression level and number of CD14+ monocytes were higher in UA treated adipose tissue than those in the control group. Glucose tolerance test was impaired by UA treatment in DIO mice. Mechanistically, UA induced the expression of Tlr4 and the phosphorylation levels of ERK and NFκB in adipocytes.

Previous studies examining global Adam17 knockdown models and ADAM17 inhibition using overexpression of endogenous ADAM17 inhibitors have shown improved metabolic health and decreased metabolic inflammation. However, there have been no studies examining the role of adipocyte ADAM17 using in vivo models. In this study, we developed an adipocyte-specific Adam17 knockout model using Adipoq-Cre-expressing mice crossed with Adam17-floxed mice. Using this model, we show that loss of adipocyte ADAM17 plays no evident role in baseline metabolic responses. Surprisingly, in a state of metabolic stress using high-fat diet (HFD), we observed that adipocyte ADAM17 had little effect overall on the metabolic phenotype as well as inflammatory cell populations. Using whole-body metabolic phenotyping, we show that loss of ADAM17 has no effect on energy utilization both at a baseline state as well as following HFD. However, lastly, using high-parameter flow cytometry, we show that loss of adipocyte ADAM17 alters macrophage and eosinophil populations following HFD. Overall, the studies presented here give more insight into the role of ADAM17 in metabolic responses and metabolic inflammation, specifically in adipocytes.",

In this technical report, we present a reliable protocol to achieve a functional KO in the genome of human adipose stem/progenitor cells (ASCs). Using Sprouty1 (SPRY1) as a model target gene for a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated KO, we particularize the procedure including the selection of the CRISPR/Cas9 target sequences and the employment of appropriate lentiviral vectors to obtain a functional gene KO. The efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate the SPRY1 gene is determined by a PCR-based mutation detection assay and sequence analysis. Effects on mRNA and protein levels are studied by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. In addition, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 mediated SPRY1 KO and gene silencing by shRNA are similarly effective to deplete the Sprouty1 protein and to inhibit adipogenic differentiation. In summary, we show a reliable approach to achieve a gene KO in human ASCs, which could also apply to other primary cell types.

Some clues from a model of prenatal maternal 70% food-restricted diet throughout gestation in pregnant female rats (FR30) suggest that the white adipose tissue (WAT) is a key target of MU fetal programming. Under standard diet, although showing a lean phenotype, adult FR30 male rats were predisposed to adiposity exhibiting higher serum leptin and corticosterone concentration, two hormones actively involved in WAT regulation. Although FR30 procedure does not worsen the metabolic syndrome features induced by HF diet, FR30HF rats gained more weight and showed hyperleptinemia suggesting increased adiposity. WAT FR30 adult rats revealed marked changes in transcript levels of several genes. In particular, leptin and Ob-Rb, many peptide precursors and receptors, factors involved in lipogenesis and glucocorticoid sensitivity mRNA expression levels as well as mechanisms involved in leptin sensitivity, were modified in FR30 offspring in depot-specific and diet-specific manners. These modifications might predispose for altered fat accumulation in adult male rat offspring.",

Several studies have been conducted on the relationship between adipose tissue and ccRCC prognosis, however, the results have been inconsistent to date. The current study aimed at establishing a link between abdominal fat composition and short-term prognosis in patients with ccRCC after T-stage stratification. We retrospectively analysed 250 patients with pathologically confirmed ccRCC (173 low T-stage and 77 high T-stage) in our hospital. The computed tomography (CT) images were evaluated using ImageJ. Then, subcutaneous and visceral fat areas (SFA and VFA), total fat areas (TFA) and the relative VFA (rVFA) were measured and computed. Meanwhile, biochemical indices of blood serum were analysed. The results showed that rVFA in low T-stage cohort who had a history of short-term postoperative complications were significantly lower than those who did not. No such association was observed in the high T-stage cohort. Further investigation revealed that the correlations between biochemical indexes and fat area-related variables varied across T-stage groups. As a result, rVFA is a reliable independent predictor of short-term prognosis in patients with low T-stage ccRCC but not in patients with high T-stage ccRCC.",

    "abstract": "Interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) of both rabbits and humans exhibits a similar whitening phenomenon under physiological conditions. However, a detailed characterization of iBAT whitening in them is still lacking. Here, we chose rabbits as a model to gain a better understanding of the molecular signature changes during the whitening process of iBAT by transcriptomic analysis of rabbit iBAT at day 1, day 14, 1 month and 4 months after birth. We applied non-invasive MRI imaging to monitor the whitening process and correlated these changes with analysis of morphological, histological and molecular features. Principal component analysis (PCA) of differentially expressed genes delineated three major phases for the whitening process as Brown, Transition and Whitened BAT phases. RNA-sequencing data revealed that whitening of iBAT was an orchestrated process where multiple types of cells and tissues participated in a variety of physiological processes including neovascularization, formation of new nervous networks and immune regulation. Several key metabolic and signalling pathways contributed to whitening of iBAT, and immune cells and immune regulation appeared to play an overarching role.",

Proper reference genes in gene expression analysis are crucial to mitigate experimental variances and ensure PCR efficacy. Unreliable reference genes can lead to erroneous gene expression quantification, resulting in data misinterpretation. This study focused on identifying suitable reference genes for mouse brown adipocyte research, utilizing brown adipocytes from the Ucp1-luciferase ThermoMouse model. Comparative analysis of gene expression data under adipogenesis and thermogenesis conditions was conducted, validating 13 housekeeping genes through various algorithms, including DeltaCq, BestKeeper, geNorm, Normfinder, and RefFinder. Tbp and Rer1 emerged as optimal references for Ucp1 and Pparg expression in brown adipogenesis, while Tbp and Ubc were ideal for the expression analysis of these target genes in thermogenesis. Conversely, certain conventional references, including Actb, Tubb5, and Gapdh, proved unstable as reference genes under both conditions. These findings stress the critical consideration of reference gene selection in gene expression analysis within specific biological systems to ensure accurate conclusions.",

The inflammatory pathway involves multiple targets such as nuclear factor kappa B, inhibitor of nuclear factor κ-B kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Vitamins are micronutrients with anti-inflammatory activities that have unclear mechanisms. The present study aimed to describe the putative mechanisms of vitamins involved in the inflammatory pathway of insulin resistance. The strategy to achieve this goal was to integrate data mining and analysis, target prediction, and molecular docking simulation calculations to support our hypotheses. Our results suggest that the multitarget activity of vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B12, C, D3, and E inhibits nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase, in addition to vitamins A and B12 against inhibitor of nuclear factor κ-B kinase. The findings of this study highlight the pharmacological potential of using an anti-inflammatory and multitarget treatment based on vitamins and open new perspectives to evaluate the inhibitory activity of vitamins against nuclear factor kappa B, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and inhibitor of nuclear factor κ-B kinase in an insulin-resistant context.",

Herbal medicines, such as ginger, have shown potential in treating obesity by inhibiting adipogenesis and reducing adipocyte hypertrophy. Ginger contains bioactive compounds, particularly gingerols, which have demonstrated anti-adipogenic and/or lipolytic effects. However, research on the effects of 10-gingerol on adipose tissue remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 10-gingerol on lipid content, lipolysis markers, and the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Three groups were analyzed: a negative control (preadipocytes), a positive control (mature adipocytes), and a group treated with 10-gingerol (10-G). Results showed that 10-G reduced lipid accumulation by 42.16% in mature adipocytes compared to the control, without affecting cell viability. Additionally, 10-G increased glycerol release and downregulated lipogenic genes such as Pparγ, Acaca, Fabp4, and Mtor, while upregulating genes related to fatty acid oxidation, including Cebpα, Cpt1a, Lipe, and Prkaa1. In conclusion, 10-gingerol reduces lipid content in mature adipocytes by downregulating lipogenesis, increasing lipolysis, and enhancing fatty acid oxidation.",

A lipid-rich microenvironment, as observed in obesity, skews this adipocyte-driven cytokine output towards a more inflammatory output. Whether a lipid-rich microenvironment also affects iNKT cells directly, however, is unknown. Here, we show that primary mouse iNKT cells isolated from AT can accumulate lipids in lipid droplets (LDs), more so than liver- and spleen-resident iNKT cells. Furthermore, a lipid-rich microenvironment increased the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IFNγ. Next, to an indirect, adipocyte-mediated cue, iNKT cells can directly respond to environmental lipid changes, supporting a potential role as nutrient sensors.",

Therefore, studying its associated cellular and molecular pathways may be aided by analysing genetic tractable diseases. In this context, the study of ciliopathies such as Bardet–Biedl syndrome has highlighted the relevance of primary cilia in obesity, both in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Based on our previous in vitro results supporting the role of a novel Bbs4-cilia-Fstl1 axis in adipocyte differentiation, we evaluated the in vivo relevance of the zebrafish orthologous genes fstl1a and fstl1b in primary cilia and adipose tissue development. Using a combination of knockdowns and a new fstl1a mutant line, we show that fstl1a promotes primary cilia formation in early embryos and participates in adipose tissue formation in larvae. We also show that fstl1b partially compensates for the loss of fstl1a. Moreover, in high fat diet, fstl1a depletion affects the expression of differentiation and mature adipocyte markers. These results agree with our previous in vitro data and provide further support for the role of FSTL1 as a regulator of adipose tissue formation. Dissecting the exact biological role of proteins such as FSTL1 will likely contribute to understand obesity onset and presentation.",

The mechanisms underlying these differences are not fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate molecular differences in VAT and SAT of male Wistar rats fed a cafeteria diet (CD) or a standard rodent diet (STD) for three months. The expression of fatty acid metabolism genes was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR. Global and gene-specific DNA methylation was quantified using the Imprint® Methylated DNA Quantification Kit and pyrosequencing, respectively. Bodyweight, retroperitoneal fat mass, insulin resistance, leptin and triglyceride concentrations and adipocyte hypertrophy were higher in CD- compared to STD-fed rats. The expression of solute carrier family 27 member 3 (Slc27a3), a fatty acid transporter, was 9.6-fold higher in VAT and 6.3-fold lower in SAT of CD- versus STD-fed rats. Taqman probes confirmed increased Slc27a3 expression, while pyrosequencing showed Slc27a3 hypomethylation in VAT of CD- compared to STD-fed rats. The CD decreased global methylation in both VAT and SAT, although no depot differences were observed. Dysregulated fatty acid influx in VAT, in response to a CD, provides insight into the mechanisms underlying depot-differences in adipose tissue expansion during obesity and metabolic disease.Abbreviations: CD: cafeteria diet; E2F1: E2F Transcription Factor 1; EMSA: electrophoretic mobility shift assay; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; GCF: GC-Rich Sequence DNA-Binding Factor; HOMA-IR: Homeostasis model for insulin resistance; NKX2-1: NK2 homeobox 1; PCR: Polymerase chain reaction; qRT-PCR: quantitative real-time PCR; RF: retroperitoneal fat; SAT: subcutaneous adipose tissue; Slc27a3: solute carrier family 27 member 3; STD: standard diet; TNFα: tumour necrosis factor alpha; TTS: transcriptional start site; T2D: Type 2 Diabetes; VAT: visceral adipose tissue; WT1 I: Wilms' tumour protein 1",

In various cellular and animal models of obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis vaspin has shown beneficial, protective and/or compensatory action. While testing proteases for inhibition by vaspin, we noticed specific cleavage within the vaspin N-terminus and sequence analysis predicted cell-penetrating activity for the released peptides. These findings raised the question whether these proteolytic peptides exhibit biological activity.We synthesized various N-terminal vaspin peptides to investigate cell-penetrating activity and analyse uptake mechanisms. Focusing on adipocytes, we performed microarray analysis and functional assays to elucidate biological activities of the vaspin-derived peptide, which is released by KLK7 cleavage (vaspin residues 21-30; VaspinN). Our study provides first evidence that proteolytic processing of the vaspin N-terminus releases cell-penetrating and bioactive peptides with effects on adipocyte biology. The VaspinN peptide increased preadipocyte proliferation, interfered with clonal expansion during the early stage of adipogenesis and blunted adrenergic cAMP-signalling, downstream lipolysis as well as insulin signalling in mature adipocytes.Protease-mediated release of functional N-terminal peptides presents an additional facet of vaspin action. Future studies will address the mechanisms underlying the biological activities and clarify, if vaspin-derived peptides may have potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of metabolic diseases.",

In vitro studies previously indicated that these bone marrow-derived adipocytes (BMDAs) were generated from adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) that lose their hematopoietic markers and acquire mesenchymal markers prior to terminal adipogenic differentiation. Here we interrogated whether this hematopoietic-to-mesenchymal transition drives BMDA production In vitro. We generated transgenic mice in which the lysozyme gene promoter (LysM) indelibly labeled ATM with green fluorescent protein (GFP). We discovered that adipose stroma contained a population of LysM-positive myeloid cells that simultaneously expressed hematopoietic/myeloid markers (CD45 and CD11b), and mesenchymal markers (CD29, PDGFRa and Sca-1) typically found on conventional adipocyte progenitors. These cells were capable of adipogenic differentiation In vitro and In vitro, while other stromal populations deficient in PDGFRa and Sca-1 were non-adipogenic. BMDAs and conventional adipocytes expressed common fat cell markers but exhibited little or no expression of hematopoietic and mesenchymal progenitor cell markers. The data indicate that BMDAs are produced from ATM simultaneously expressing hematopoietic and mesenchymal markers rather than via a stepwise hematopoietic-to-mesenchymal transition. Because BMDA production is stimulated by high fat feeding, their production from hematopoietic progenitors may maintain adipocyte production when conventional adipocyte precursors are diminished.",

However, whether this occurs in a translationally-relevant large animal model remains unknown. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that ovariectomy would promote visceral and perivascular AT (PVAT) inflammation, as well as subsequent insulin resistance and peripheral vascular dysfunction in female swine. At sexual maturity (7 months of age), female Yucatan mini-swine either remained intact (control, n = 9) or were ovariectomized (OVX, n = 7). All pigs were fed standard chow (15–20 g/kg), and were euthanized 6 months post-surgery. Uterine mass and plasma estradiol levels were decreased by ∼10-fold and 2-fold, respectively, in OVX compared to control pigs. Body mass, glucose homeostasis, and markers of insulin resistance were not different between control and OVX pigs; however, OVX animals exhibited greater plasma triglycerides and triglyceride:HDL ratio. Ovariectomy enhanced visceral adipocyte expansion, although this was not accompanied by brachial artery PVAT adipocyte expansion, AT inflammation in either depot, or increased systemic inflammation assessed by plasma C-reactive protein concentrations. Despite the lack of AT inflammation and insulin resistance, OVX pigs exhibited depressed brachial artery endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation, which was rescued with blockade of endothelin receptor A. Together, these findings indicate that in female Yucatan mini-swine, increased AT inflammation and insulin resistance are not required for loss of ovarian hormones to induce endothelial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The objective was to determine the effect of nutritional milieu of isolated stromal vascular (SV) cells on proliferative capacity of preadipocytes, and adipogenic and lipogenic capacity in adipocytes in vitro. Proliferation of the preadipocytes increased over time with 48 and 72 h being greater than 24 h; however, preadipocytes from steers supplemented with corn (LC) had lower proliferation rates compared with those without corn grain supplementation (L) at 72 h. Adipocyte cultures isolated from LC group had higher mean diameter on d 4 and 6, and higher mean volume on d 0, 4, 6, and 12 of culture. Adipocytes from steers supplemented with corn grain (LC) had lower expression of key adipogenic genes during extended days in culture. The results show that prior nutritional treatment of the donor animal used to isolate SV cultures alters their proliferative, adipogenic, and lipogenic capacity in culture. These differences may be related to lower induction/expression of AP2 gene in the adipose cultures from corn supplemented group. Corn grain supplementation to steers grazing legumes could have stimulated more active adipogenic progenitor cells to differentiate, which would leave fewer behind in the SV pool for subsequent isolation.",

This was accomplished by searching clinical MeSH categories in MEDLINE with full texts, EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Academic Search Complete, ICTRP and ClinicalTrial.gov. Reviewers examined all the findings and selected the studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. The Downs and Black Checklist was used to assess for bias, followed by a Review Manager v5. A Forrest plot was used for the meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis. The protocol for this review was registered with PROSPERO CRD42022320252. The clinical studies (n = 2) comprised 1065 patients with prediabetes and 1103 normal controls. The RAAS measurements were completed in the adipose tissue. The RAAS components, renin and aldosterone were higher in the prediabetic (PD) compared to the control [mean difference (MD) = 0.16, 95% CI 0.16 (-0.13, 0.45), p = 0.25]. Furthermore, the PD group demonstrated higher triglycerides mean difference [MD = 7.84, 95% CI 7.84 (-9.84, 25.51), p = 0.38] and increased BMI [MD = 0.13, 95% CI 0.13 (-0.74, 0.99), p = 0.77] compared to the control. The overall quality of the studies was fair with a median score and range of 17 (16-18). The current study highlights the relationship between increased BMI, RAAS and insulin resistance which is a predictor of prediabetes. The renin is slightly higher in the prediabetes group without any statistical significance, aldosterone is rather negatively associated with prediabetes which may be attributed to the use of anti-hypertensive treatment.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is closely associated with the development of disease in the body. However, there are few studies on ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in obesity. Therefore, key genes and signalling pathways related to ferroptosis in obesity were screened. Briefly, the RNA sequencing data of obesity and the non-obesity human samples and 259 FRGs were downloaded from GEO database and FerrDb database, respectively. The obesity-related module genes were firstly screened by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and crossed with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of obesity/normal samples and FRGs to obtain obesity-ferroptosis related (OFR) DEGs. Then, key genes were screened by PPI network. Next, the correlation of key genes and differential immune cells between obesity and normal samples were further explored by immune infiltration analysis. Finally, microRNA (miRNA)-messenger RNA (mRNA), transcription factor (TF)-mRNA networks and drug-gene interaction networks were constructed. As a result, 17 OFR DEGs were obtained, which mainly participated in processes such as lipid metabolism or adipocyte differentiation. The 4 key genes, STAT3, IL-6, PTGS2, and VEGFA, constituted the network. M2 macrophages, T cells CD8, mast cells activated, and T cells CD4 memory resting had significant differences between obesity and normal samples. Moreover, 51 miRNAs and 164 drugs were predicted for 4 key genes. All in all, this study has screened 4 FRGs, including IL-6, VEGFA, STAT3, and PTGS2, in obesity patients.",

We analysed the nuclear morphology and laminar distribution in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes overexpressing human wild-type lamin A/C (LMNA WT) or lamin A/C with the R133L mutation (LMNA R133L). We found the nuclear size was varied, nuclear membrane invagination or blebbing, and an irregular A-type lamin meshwork in cells overexpressing LMNA R133L.3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation into adipocytes was impaired in cells expressing LMNA R133L; contemporaneously, the expression levels of genes associated with adipose tissue self-renewal, including adipogenesis, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix maintenance, were downregulated. Furthermore, the insulin-signalling pathway was inhibited in LMNA R133L adipocytes. Microarray gene expression profiling showed that the most prominent differences between 3T3-L1 cells expressing wild-type LMNA and LMNA R133L were in genes implicated in metabolic pathways, the cellular response to DNA damage and repair. We thus expand the clinical spectrum of laminopathy and conclude that the LMNA R133L mutation associated with lipodystrophic features and multisystem disorders likely impairs adipocyte renewal and disrupts the expression of genes implicated in the induction and repair of DNA damage.",

Following delivery, lambs remained at sea level (LTH-SL). Perirenal adipose tissue was collected at ~day 14, and qRT-PCR was used to quantify mRNA. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), PPAR gamma coactivator 1 (PGC1α), and deiodinase-2 (DIO2) mRNA levels were significantly lower in both LTH groups while PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) levels did not differ. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) was maintained in the LTH-HA group and significantly increased in the LTH-SL group, compared to control. Unlike our previous LTH foetal studies, the brown/beige fat phenotype was rapidly lost by day 14 postpartum compared to control, while PPARγ was maintained. This loss of the brown fat phenotype may promote obesity due to decreased energy expenditure, favouring fat deposition.",

Aurora-A was highly expressed in the pancreas of the diabetic mice as confirmed by western blot. Inhibition of Aurora-A did not affect fasting blood glucose and body weight, but did improve insulin resistance, as indicated by improved oral glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, and the Homoeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance index. Blockade of Aurora-A dramatically decreased the number of infiltrating macrophages in the pancreas in parallel with decreases in the levels of serum insulin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA. The levels of phosphorylated forms of protein kinase B, which are the key mediators of in insulin resistance, were not induced in liver, adipocyte tissues, and skeletal muscle by alisertib treatment.

While the biochemical processes regulating storage and release of excess energy are well known, the temporal organization of these events is much less defined. In this study, we have characterized the presence of small surface-associated lipid droplets, distinct from the central droplet, in primary human adipocytes. Based on microscopy analyses, we illustrate the distribution of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes in the vicinity of these specialized lipid droplets. Ultrastructure analysis confirmed the presence of small droplets in intact adipose tissue. Further, CIDEC, known to bind and regulate lipid droplet expansion, clearly localized at these lipid droplets. Neither acute or prolonged stimulation with insulin or isoprenaline, or pharmacologic intervention to suppress lipid flux, affected the presence of these lipid droplets. Still, phosphorylated perilipin and hormone-sensitive lipase accumulated at these droplets following adrenergic stimuli, which supports metabolic activity at these locations. Altogether, we propose these lipid droplet clusters represent an intermediate site involved in lipid transport in primary adipocytes.",

Our genome-wide exon array analysis in white adipose tissue (WAT) from wild-type and Sam68−/− mice revealed that Sam68 deficiency leads to an abnormal splicing of the mTOR gene. This has been shown to reduce the overall mTOR protein content and activity during in vitro adipose differentiation.

The exponential growth related to adipose tissue research over the past decade will only continue to increase; adipose tissue and adipocytes will continue to be a central focus to warrant a dedicated platform of scientific exchange for those studying the biology of adipose tissue, function and disease.

Importantly, in ruminant's metabolism the aforementioned NADPH provided, is utilized for de novo fatty acid synthesis. Previous work of cloning the ovine (Ovis aries) og6pdh gene has revealed the presence of two cDNA transcripts (og6pda and og6pdb), og6pdb being a product of alternative splicing not similar to any other previously reported.(1) In the current study the effect of energy balance in the ovine G6PDH protein expression was investigated, shedding light on the biochemical features and potential physiological role of the oG6PDB isoform. Changes in energy balance leads to protein expression changes in both transcripts, to the opposite direction and not in a proportional way. Negative energy balance was not in favor of the presence of any particular isoform, while both protein expression levels were not significantly different (P > 0.05). In contrast, at the transition point from negative to positive and on the positive energy balance, there is a significant increase of oG6PDA compared with oG6PDB protein expression (P &lt; 0.001). Both oG6PDH protein isoforms changed significantly toward the positive energy balance. oG6PDA is escalating, while oG6PDB is falling, under the same stimulus (positive energy balance alteration). This change is also positively associated with increasing levels in enzyme activity, 4 weeks post-weaning in ewes' adipose tissue. Furthermore, regression analysis clearly demonstrated the linear correlation of both proteins in response to the WPW, while energy balance, enzyme activity, and oG6PDA relative protein expression follow the same escalating trend; in contrast, oG6PDB relative protein expression falls in time, similar to both transcripts accumulation pattern, as reported previously.(2.)",

Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to adipocyte turnover is thus important. We have recently refined and published an existing method to assess in vivo adipogenesis using incorporation of the stable isotope deuterium into the DNA of isolated adipocytes and adipocyte progenitors from adipose tissue.

Adipose tissue expansion occurs through two processes: (i) hypertrophy, and (ii) hyperplasia, the formation of new adipocytes, also termed adipogenesis. Recently, serum amyloid A3 (Saa3) has been implicated in adipogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Saa3 on adipogenesis using both an in vitro and in vivo murine model. Saa3 gene silenced pre-adipocytes ha a lower expression of pro-adipogenic markers and less lipid accumulation, indicating impaired adipogenesis. Furthermore, male NUDE mice, injected with Saa3 gene silenced pre-adipocytes developed smaller fat pads with smaller adipocytes and lower expression of pro-adipogenic markers than their control counterparts. This confirms that Saa3 gene silencing indeed impairs adipogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate a clear role for Saa3 in adipogenesis and open new perspectives in the battle against obesity.",

Then, the hierarchical clustering of differential metabolites was conducted and the KEGG database was used for metabolic pathway analysis. A total of 50 (in positive ion mode) and 68 (in negative ion mode) metabolites were identified as differential metabolites in WAT of diabetic GK rats between IT group and Sham-IT group, respectively. These differential metabolites were well clustered, which in descending order of the number of involved differential metabolites is ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis, AMPK signalling pathway, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, ferroptosis, vitamin digestion and absorption, glycerophospholipid metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism and bile secretion, and correlated with the parameters of body weight, food intake, WAT mass and glucose metabolism, which were significantly improved after IT surgery. The differential metabolites in WAT of diabetic GK rats were mainly related to the pathway of energy metabolism, and correlated with the improved phenotypes of diabetic GK rats after IT surgery.",

    "abstract": "Cell lines recapitulating physiological processes can represent alternatives to animal or human studies. The 3T3-L1 cell line is used to mimic adipocyte function and differentiation. Since transfection of 3T3-L1 cells is difficult, we used a modified 3T3-L1 cell line overexpressing Cas9 for a straightforward generation of gene knock-outs. As an example, we intended to generate 3T3-L1 cell lines deficient for adhesion G protein-coupled receptors Gpr64/Adgr2 and Gpr126/Adgr6 using the CRISPR/Cas approach. Surprisingly, all the generated knock-out as well as scramble control cell lines were unresponsive to isoprenaline in respect to adiponectin secretion and lipolysis in contrast to the wild type 3T3-L1 cells. We, therefore, analysed the properties of these stable Cas9-overexpressing 3T3-L1 cells. We demonstrate that this commercially available cell line exhibits dysfunction in cAMP signalling pathways as well as reduced insulin sensitivity independent of gRNA transfection. We tried transient transfection of plasmids harbouring Cas9 as well as direct introduction of the Cas9 protein as alternate approaches to the stable expression of this enzyme. We find that transfection of the Cas9 protein is not only feasible but also does not impair adipogenesis and, therefore, represents a preferable alternative to achieve genetic knock-out.",

AT explants from subjects with T2D and without diabetes (non-diabetic, ND) were treated with rIL8, rGROα and rIL15 in concentrations equal to those in conditioned media (CM) from T2D and ND myotubes, and sprout formation evaluated. Endothelial cells (EC) were isolated from T2D and ND-AT, treated with rGROα and tube formation evaluated. Finally, we investigated the involvement of MMP-2 and -9 in vascularization. ND and T2D concentrations of IL8 or IL15 caused similar stimulation of sprout formation in ND- and T2D-AT. GROα exerted a similar effect in ND-AT. When T2D-AT explants were exposed to GROα, sprout formation in response to T2D concentrations was reduced compared to ND. Exposure of EC from T2D-AT to GROα at T2D concentrations resulted in reduced tube formation. Reduced responses to GROα in T2D-AT and EC were also seen for secretion of MMP-2 and -9. The data indicate that skeletal muscle can potentially regulate AT vascularization, with T2D-AT having impairments in sensitivity to GROα, while responding normally to IL8 and IL15.",

Twenty-one patients with newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism from Graves’ disease were recruited. A titration dosing regimen of thionamide anti-thyroid drug (ATD) was used to establish euthyroidism over 12–24 weeks. Anthropometric, biochemical and adipocytokine parameters were measured before and after control of hyperthyroidism.

Plasma adiponectin level was significantly increased following correction of hyperthyroidism in the overall sample. Free thyroxine (FT4) was also identified as a predictor of adiponectin level in thyroid dysfunction. However, significant changes in adiponectin level and correlations involving adiponectin were absent in BAT-positive patients but maintained in BAT-negative patients. BAT activity diminishes the correlative relationship with body composition and abolishes TH and adiponectin relationships when transitioning from a hyperthyroid to euthyroid state.",

Here, we investigate effects of serum type (\"fetal bovine\" versus \"newborn calf\") on responses to differentiation inducers (the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone or the neurotransmitter norepinephrine) in cultured primary brown adipocytes. Lipid storage was enhanced by fetal versus newborn serum. However, molecular adipose conversion (Pparg2 and Fabp4 expression) was not affected by serum type. Rosiglitazone-induced (7-days) expression of thermogenic genes (i.e. Ucp1, Pgc1a, Dio2 and Elovl3) was not systematically affected by serum type. However, importantly, acute (2 h) norepinephrine-induced thermogenic gene expression was overall markedly higher (and adipose genes somewhat lower) in cells cultured in newborn serum. Thus, newborn serum promotes thermogenic competence, and the use of fetal serum in brown adipocyte cultures (as is often routine) counteracts adequate differentiation. Agents that counteract this inhibition may therefore confoundingly be ascribed genuine thermogenic competence-inducing properties.",

We have previously found that the cell surface receptor CD24 regulates adipogenesis as measured by lipid accumulation and gene expression in mature adipocytes. How CD24 regulates these processes remains unknown. To begin answering this question, we first determined that CD24 does not affect glucose uptake in differentiating adipocytes in vitro. We then examined changes in global gene expression via DNA microarray in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with siRNA-mediated knock-down of CD24 expression. We found that CD24 expression is necessary for upregulation of up to 134 genes. We validated the CD24-mediated regulation of 4 of these genes during in vitro adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 and primary cells isolated from the inguinal white adipose tissue depots of CD24 knockout mice. Surprisingly, we found that only 1 of these genes was also regulated by CD24 in cells from the epididymal depot. Overall, these data suggest that CD24 is necessary for select gene expression in a depot-specific manner during adipogenesis in vitro. These findings could help elucidate the mechanisms regulating lipid accumulation in adipocytes thereby aiding in the development of novel treatment strategies for obesity and lipodystophy.",

Moreover, expression of senescence markers was reduced in HFD-fed adipocyte-specific ASK1 knockout mice.

An increase in ROS is known to decrease vascular function, increase inflammatory cytokines, and promote adipocyte hypertrophy. A known regulator of the oxidative stress response is the heat shock protein, heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1), which is induced by cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP). Menin was recently found to promote the sustained expression of heat shock proteins and is implicated in the regulation of oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated how changes in menin expression affected adipogenesis via the interaction between endothelial cells and adipocytes in response to CoPP treatment during oxidative stress. Using angiotensin II (Ang II) to induce oxidative stress in endothelial cells and adipocytes, we observed the induction of various cytokines including EGF, VEGF, angiogenin, IL-6, and MCP-1. Preadipocytes cultured in endothelial cell conditioned media treated with Ang II showed no changes in differentiation markers. Preadipocytes treated with the endothelial cell-conditioned media pretreated with CoPP resulted in an increase in the number of adipocytes, which expressed higher levels of adipocyte differentiation markers in direct correlation with the complete downregulation of the stress response regulator, menin. This change was not detected in adipocytes directly treated with CoPP alone. Therefore, we concluded that loss of menin is associated with the maturation of adipocytes induced by conditioned media from endothelial cells treated with CoPP.",

Suppression of wBAT in 21-day-old mice showed no significant effect on diet-induced obesity or cold tolerance in adult mice. Analysis of gene expression indicated that capacity to induce the brown fat phenotype was normal.

    "abstract": "Oxidative tissues such as brown adipose tissue and muscle internalize large amounts of circulating lipids and glucose as energy source. Endothelial cells (ECs) provide a platform for regulated transport and processing of blood-borne nutrients. Next to this role, it has become recognized that intercellular crosstalk between ECs and underlying parenchymal cells is indispensable for maintenance of tissue homoeostasis. Here, we comment on our recent observation that capillary ECs in thermogenic adipose tissues take up and metabolize entire triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) particles in response to cold exposure. This process is dependent on CD36, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). Remarkably, loss of LAL specifically in endothelial cells results in impaired endothelial proliferation and diminished thermogenic adaptation. Mechanistically, cell culture experiments indicate that LAL-mediated TRL processing leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species, which in turn activate hypoxia-induced factor (HIF)-mediated proliferative responses. In the current manuscript, we provide in vivo evidence that LAL-deficiency impairs proliferation of endothelial cells in thermogenic adipose tissue. In addition, we show uptake of nanoparticle-labelled TRL and LAL expression in cardiac endothelial cells, suggesting a physiological function of endothelial lipoprotein processing not only in thermogenic adipose tissue but also in cardiac muscle.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock is an intricate molecular network that paces a variety of physiological process to ~ 24 hour day/night cycles. Whereas the central circadian clock in the brain is primarily entrained by light signals, peripheral circadian clocks, which are in most cells in the body, receive cues not only from the central pacemaker but also endocrine and other systemic and tissue-specific signals. Prior studies have connected peripheral circadian clocks to metabolism, primarily with studies focused on the robust clock in the liver that responds to feeding/fasting cycles. Adipose tissue is also critical for metabolism and adipocytes have circadian clocks. Yet, the role of the circadian clock in adipocytes is poorly understood. Here we describe our studies that revealed components of the circadian clock in primary adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) in mice. We made the surprising discovery of a particularly prominent role for the circadian gene Period 3 (Per3) in the APC clock. Furthermore, we elucidated that Per3 directly regulates an output pathway of the APC clock to modulate the expression of the Kruppel-like factor 15 (Klf15) gene. Finally, we discovered that this clock-Klf15 pathway regulates adipogenesis in APCs. These finding have important implications for our understanding of adipose tissue biology and metabolism and, we speculate, will generate opportunities to develop novel therapeutic strategies based on the context-specific features of the circadian clock in APCs.",

We found that genetic blockade of γ-secretase in adipocytes leads to a decrease in EMR1 (F4/80) expression, as a marker of macrophage presence, in adipose tissue without changes in expression of markers of other inflammatory cell types. To explore the mechanism by which adipocytes can alter macrophage function in vitro, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with a γ-secretase inhibitor in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and transcription of IL6 and ccl2 (MCP1) were quantified. IL-6 expression and secretion were significantly inhibited by γ-secretase blockade, with little effect on MCP1. Preconditioned media from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with a γ-secretase inhibitor also alters macrophage activation but did not affect macrophage translocation in vitro. Therefore, γ-secretase inhibition in fully differentiated adipocytes can alter IL-6 signalling to macrophages, consistent with our hypothesis that that γ-secretase is involved in adipocyte-initiated inflammatory signalling cascades.",

Histological measurements of biopsied adipose tissue can reveal cardiovascular and/or cancer risks, to complement typical prognosis parameters such as body mass index, hypertension or diabetes. Yet, current methods for adipocyte quantification are problematic and insufficient. Methods such as hand-tracing are tedious and time-consuming, ellipse approximation lacks precision, and fully automated methods have not proven reliable. A semi-automated method fills the gap in goal-directed computational algorithms, specifically for high-throughput adipocyte quantification. Here, we design and develop a tool, AdipoCyze, which incorporates a novel semi-automated tracing algorithm, along with benchmark methods, and use breast histological images from the Komen for the Cure Foundation to assess utility. Speed and precision of the new approach are superior to conventional methods and accuracy is comparable, suggesting a viable option to quantify adipocytes, while increasing user flexibility. This platform is the first to provide multiple methods of quantification in a single tool. Widespread laboratory and clinical use of this program may enhance productivity and performance, and yield insight into patient metabolism, which may help evaluate risks for breast cancer progression in patients with comorbidities of obesity.

At a population level, the adipose cell-size distribution is insulin-sensitivity dependent, and the observed correlation between obesity and insulin resistance is believed to play a key role in the metabolic syndrome. Changes in fat mass can be induced by altered energy intake or even diet composition. These macroscopic changes must manifest themselves as dynamic adipose cell-size distribution alterations at the microscopic level. The dynamic relationship between these 2 independent measurements of body fat is unknown. In this study, we investigate adipose tissue dynamics in response to various isocaloric diet compositions, comparing gender- and insulin sensitivity-dependent differences. A body composition model is used to predict fat mass changes in response to changes in diet composition for 28 individuals, separated into 4 subgroups according to gender and insulin sensitivity/resistance. Adipose cell-size distribution changes in each individual are simulated with a dynamic model and parameters corresponding to lipid turnover and cell growth rates are determined for each subgroup to match the relative change of fat mass for each diet composition, respectively. We find that adipose cell-size dynamics are associated with different modulations dependent on gender and insulin resistance. Larger turnover and growth/shrinkage rates in insulin resistant individuals suggest they may be more sensitive to changes in energy intake and diet composition than insulin sensitive subjects. The different cell-size distribution changes of adipose cells of various sizes in different subject groups further suggest distinct modulations of adipose cell dynamics.",

However, it remains unknown whether IL-27-mediated adipocyte energy dissipation is paralleled by an elevated energy supply from lipids and/or carbohydrates. We hypothesized that IL-27 increases lipolysis and glucose uptake in white adipocytes, thereby providing substrates for thermogenesis. Unexpectedly, we found that treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with IL-27 reduced intra- and extracellular free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations and that phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was not affected by IL-27. These results were confirmed in subcutaneous white adipocytes. Further, application of IL-27 to 3T3-L1 adipocytes increased intracellular triglyceride (TG) content but not mitochondrial ATP production nor expression of enzymes involved in beta-oxidation indicating that elevated esterification rather than oxidation causes FFA disappearance. In addition, IL-27 significantly increased GLUT1 protein levels, basal glucose uptake as well as glycolytic ATP production, suggesting that increased glycolytic flux due to IL-27 provides the glycerol backbone for TG synthesis. In conclusion, our findings suggest IL-27 increases glucose uptake and TG deposition in white adipocytes.",

AHCY has been reported to influence proliferation and differentiation processes in different cell types, e.g. in cancer cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. In the development of adipose tissue, both the proliferation and differentiation of adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) are important processes, which in the context of obesity are often dysregulated. To assess whether AHCY might also be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation of APCs, we investigated the effect of reduced AHCY activity on human and mouse APCs in vitro. We show that the inhibition of AHCY using adenosine dialdehyde (AdOx) and the knockdown of AHCY using gene-specific siRNAs reduced APC proliferation and number. Inhibition of AHCY further reduced APC differentiation into mature adipocytes and the expression of adipogenic differentiation markers. Global DNA methylation profiling in human APCs revealed that inhibition of AHCY is associated with alterations in CpG methylation levels of genes involved in fat cell differentiation and pathways related to cellular growth. Our findings suggest that AHCY is necessary for the maintenance of APC proliferation and differentiation and inhibition of AHCY alters DNA methylation processes leading to a dysregulation of the expression of genes involved in the regulation of these processes.",

Staufen double-stranded RNA binding protein 1 (Staufen1 or STAU1) plays diverse roles in RNA processing and adipogenesis. Previously, we found that the downregulation of STAU1 affects the expression of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) at the protein level but not at the mRNA level. This study aimed to determine the mechanism underlying the regulation of FABP4 expression by STAU1, explaining the inconsistency between FABP4 mRNA and protein levels. We used RNA interference, photoactivatable ribonucleoside enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation, and an adeno-associated virus to examine the functions of STAU1 in adipogenesis. Our results indicate that STAU1 binds to the coding sequences of FABP4, thereby regulating the translation of FABP4 mRNA by unwinding the double-stranded structure. Furthermore, STAU1 mediates adipogenesis by regulating the secretion of free fatty acids. However, STAU1 knockdown decreases the fat weight/body weight ratio but does not affect the plasma triglyceride levels. These findings describe the mechanisms involved in STAU1-mediated regulation of FABP4 expression at the translational level during adipogenesis.",

This study employed a case-control study design. Twenty-three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 13 genes in the selected ADIPO signalling pathway were genotyped by SNPscanTM kit. All statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 25.0, PLINK 1.07, R 2.14.2, Haploview 4.2, SNPstats, and other statistical software packages. In the association analysis based on a single SNPs, rs1044471 had statistical significance in the overdominant model without adjusting covariates. Rs1042531 had statistical significance in the overdominant model. Rs12718444 had statistical significance in the recessive model. There was a linkage disequilibrium between the loci within 9 genes, and the two loci in RXRA gene did not form blocks. Four kernel functions were used for SNPs set analysis based on ADIPO signalling pathway showed that there was no statistical significance whether covariates were added or not, P>0.05.According to our research results, it is found that some single nucleotide polymorphisms (ADIPOR2 rs1044471, PCK1 rs1042531, GLUT1 rs12718444) in the adiponectin signalling pathway may be associated with T2DM.",

Protein pulldown studies confirmed this protein–protein interaction in transfected cells, and reporter assays demonstrated that STK38 enhanced PPARγ's transactivating activities without requiring STK38's kinase activity. In cell-based assays, STK38 increased PPARγ protein stability, extending PPARγ's half-life from ~1.08 to 1.95 h. Notably, in human preadipocytes, the overexpression of STK38 enhanced adipogenesis, whereas knockdown impaired the process in a PPARγ-dependent manner.

    "abstract": "Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are characterized by their low immunogenicity and unique immunosuppressive properties, providing many opportunities for autologous transplantation in regenerative medicine and plastic surgery. These methods are characterized by low rejection rates and intense stimulation of tissue regeneration. However, procedures during which fat tissue is harvested occur under local anaesthesia. To better understand the effects and mechanisms of anaesthetic compounds in cosmetic and therapeutic procedures, the present study used a mixture of these compounds (0.1% epinephrine, 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, and 4% articaine) and examined their impact on a human adipose-derived stem cell line. The results showed anesthetics' negative, dose-dependent effect on cell viability and proliferation, especially during the first 24 h of incubation. After extending the exposure to 48 and 72 h of incubation, cells adapted to new culture conditions. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in immunophenotype, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. The results obtained from this study provide information on the effect of the selected mixture of anaesthetics on the characteristics and function of ASC52telo cells. The undesirable changes in the metabolic activity of cells suggest the need to search for new drugs to harvest cells with unaltered properties and higher efficacy in aesthetic medicine treatments.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities has sparked a worldwide concern to address rates of adipose tissue accrual. Recent studies have demonstrated a novel role of Zyflamend, a blend of natural herbal extracts, in regulating lipid metabolism in several cancer cell lines through the activation of the AMPK signalling pathway. Yet, the role of Zyflamend in adipogenic differentiation and lipid metabolism remains largely unexplored. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of Zyflamend on white 3T3-MBX pre-adipocyte differentiation and elucidate the molecular mechanisms. We demonstrate that Zyflamend treatment altered cell cycle progression, attenuated proliferation, and increased cell death of 3T3-MBX pre-adipocytes. In addition, treatment with Zyflamend inhibited lipid accumulation during the differentiation of 3T3-MBX cells, consistent with decreased expression of lipogenic genes and increased lipolysis. Mechanistically, Zyflamend-induced alterations in adipogenesis were mediated, at least in part, through the activation of AMPK, PKA, and JNK. Inhibition of AMPK partially reversed Zyflamend-induced inhibition of differentiation, whereas the inhibition of either JNK or PKA fully restored adipocyte differentiation and decreased lipolysis. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that Zyflamend, as a novel anti-adipogenic bioactive mix, inhibits adipocyte differentiation through the activation of the PKA and JNK pathways.Abbreviation: 7-AAD: 7-amino-actinomycin D; ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AKT: protein kinase B; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATGL: adipose triglyceride lipase; C/EBPα: CCAAT-enhancer binding protein alpha; DMEM: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium; DMSO: dimethyl sulphoxide; DTT: dithiothreitol; EGTA: ethylene glycol-bis-(2-aminoethyl)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid; ERK: extracellular signal–regulated kinases; FASN: fatty acid synthase; FBS: foetal bovine serum; GLUT: glucose transporter; HSL: hormone-sensitive lipase; IR: insulin receptor; IRS: insulin receptor substrate; JNK: c-JUN N-terminal kinase; MGL: monoacylglycerol lipase; NaF: sodium fluoride; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; PBS: phosphate buffered- saline; PCB: pyruvate carboxylase; PDE: phosphodiesterase; PKA: protein kinase cAMP-dependent; PMSF: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PPARγ: perilipin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; PREF-1: pre-adipocyte factor 1; PVDF: polyvinylidene fluoride; RIPA: radio-immunoprecipitation assay; SDS-PAGE: sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SEM: standard error of the mean; SOX9: suppressor of cytokine signalling 9; TGs: triacylglycerols.",

We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in breast tissues before and after IER by analyzing the expression profile from GEO. Then, enrichment analysis was used to identify important pathways of DEGs and hub genes were selected from PPI network. After that, GEPIA, ROC, and KM plotter were used to explore the preventive and prognostic value of hub genes. It was found that FOXM1 and CXCR4 were highly expressed in BC tissues and associated with the worse prognosis. FOXM1 and CXCR4 were down-regulated after IER , which meant that FOXM1 and CXCR4 might be the most important key genes for reducing the risk and improving prognosis of BC after IER . ROC curve indicated that FOXM1 and CXCR4 also had the predictive value for BC. Our study contributed to a better understanding of the specific mechanisms in protective effects of IER on BC and provided a new approach to improve the prognosis of BC, which might provide partial guidance for the subsequent development of more effective treatments and prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "A large number of studies in recent years have aimed to devise novel therapeutic strategies to increase adipose tissue metabolic activity and fight the global obesity epidemics. Growing evidence suggests that cells are able to accept isolated mitochondria by a simple coincubation in a process known as mitochondrial transformation. Therefore, we aimed to test whether mitochondrial transformation occurs in mature adipocytes, and whether this phenomenon could be utilized as a therapeutic approach to increase adipose tissue mitochondrial content and improve metabolic control. We provide evidence that both brown and white adipocytes are able to rapidly accept a large amount of brown adipocyte-derived mitochondria, which remain functional for several days and significantly contribute to cellular respiration in vitro. However, we did not find any evidence that internalization of exogenous mitochondria would trigger transcriptional changes in the recipient cells. Moreover, injection of a large amount of brown adipocyte-derived mitochondria into the inguinal fat of C57BL/6 mice failed to increase whole-body energy expenditure, and reduce body weight gain under obesogenic conditions. This might be due to activation of immune response and rapid removal of administered mitochondria. Altogether, our study adds information on the usability of mitochondrial transformation in the treatment of metabolic disease.",

During induced dedifferentiation, adipocytes exhibit profound gene expression and cell morphology changes. However, dedifferentiation of post-mitotic cells is expected to enable proliferation, which is critical if enough MPPs are to be obtained. Here, lineage tracing was employed to quantify cell proliferation in mouse adipocytes subjected to a dedifferentiation-inducing protocol commonly used to obtain DFAT cells. No evidence of cell proliferation in adipocyte-derived cells was observed, in contrast to the robust proliferation of non-adipocyte cells present in adipose tissue. We conclude that proliferative MPPs derived using the ceiling culture method most likely arise from non-adipocyte cells in adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT) play pivotal roles in maintaining body temperature and energy metabolism. In mice, BAT quickly stimulates thermogenesis by activating brown adipocytes upon cold exposure. In the presence of chronic cold stimuli, beige adipocytes are recruited in inguinal WAT to support heat generation. Accumulated evidence has shown that thermogenic execution of brown and beige adipocytes is regulated in a fat depot-specific manner. Recently, we have demonstrated that ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 20 (RNF20) regulates brown and beige adipocyte thermogenesis through fat-depot-specific modulation. In BAT, RNF20 regulates transcription factor GA-binding protein alpha (GABPα), whereas in inguinal WAT, RNF20 potentiates transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) through the degradation of nuclear corepressor 1 (NCoR1). This study proposes the molecular mechanisms by which co-regulator(s) selectively and temporally control transcription factors to coordinate adipose thermogenesis in a fat-depot-specific manner. In this Commentary, we provide molecular features of brown and beige adipocyte thermogenesis and discuss the underlying mechanisms of distinct thermogenic processes in two fat depots.",

    "abstract": "White adipose tissue (WAT) is a dynamic organ capable of remodelling in response to metabolic state. For example, in response to stimuli such as cold exposure, WAT can develop inducible brown adipocytes ('browning') capable of non-shivering thermogenesis, through concurrent changes to mitochondrial content and function. This is aided by increased neurite outgrowth and angiogenesis across the tissue, providing the needed neurovascular supply for uncoupling protein 1 activation. While several RNA-sequencing studies have been performed in WAT, including newer single cell and single nuclei studies, little work has been done to investigate changes to the adipose proteome, particularly during dynamic periods of tissue remodelling such as cold stimulation. Here, we conducted a comprehensive proteomic analysis of inguinal subcutaneous (sc) WAT during the initial 'browning' period of 24 or 72hrs of cold exposure in mice. We identified four significant pathways impacted by cold stimulation that are involved in tissue remodelling, which included mitochondrial function and metabolism, cytoskeletal remodelling, the immune response, and the nervous system. Taken together, we found that early changes in the proteome of WAT with cold stimulation predicted later structural and functional changes in the tissue that are important for tissue and whole-body remodelling to meet energetic and metabolic needs.",

These 3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate in vitro using methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin conditions, then exposed to either 1% DMSO as a control group or varying concentrations of BDE-47 (2.5 μM, 7.5 μM, 12.5 μM, 18.75 μM, and 25 μM). Oil red O staining showed that the absorbance value of the BDE-47 exposure groups was higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05). This study identified 722 common genes between the differentially expressed genes of each exposure group. Using Cytoscape 10 hub genes were identified as Actb, Cdk1, Myc, Ccnb1, Aurkb, Plk1, Aurka, Pparg, Kif11, and Casp3. Enrichment analysis data revealed that the effects of BDE-47 on 3T3-L1 cell differentiation were associated with the cell cycle, p53 signalling, and PPARγ pathways. The transcription factor genes, KAT2A, MAX, SIN3A, TBP, and EP300, were shown to be associated with the PPARγ pathway. The mRNA expression of PPARγ in each exposure group was higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05), and a bimodal distribution between PPARγ mRNA expression and BDE-47 dose was observed. These findings indicate that BDE-47 May activate the PPARγ pathway and mitotic pathway to regulate the cell cycle and induce adipocyte differentiation.",

DEGs with the same biological function in two types of ATs often exhibited different expression trends. SharedVAT-specific and SAT-specific hub genes were mainly associated with transcription factors, monocyte-macrophage markers, and chemokines, respectively. Immune cells affected by both AT types included monocytes, granulocytes, T and B lymphocytes, and NK cells. VAT affected more immune cells, mainly myeloid cells. Shared hub genes in VAT correlated positively with M1 macrophages, suggesting pro-inflammatory effects, while those in SAT correlated negatively with M1 macrophages and lymphocytes, suggesting anti-inflammatory effects.

    "abstract": "Weight change is often seen in people with diabetes. We investigated the effects of genes associated with weight change/glucose handling/insulin-signalling.DNA from diabetes individuals and non-diabetes individuals, plus clinical data, were available from the DARE study (n = 379 individuals: T1D n = 111; T2D n = 222; controls n = 46). Weight gain was assessed by temporal change of Body Mass Index (BMI). Genotyping was performed for CAV1rs926198, LEPRrs1137101, BDNFrs6265 and FTOrs9939609.No differences in genotype distributions were observed for the four SNPs in all groups un-stratified by weight gain. Following stratification differences in genotype distribution were observed. For those BMI relatively stable; controls showed a difference in genotype distributions versus T1D (CAV1rs926198, LEPRrs1137101). In T2D vs controls, significant differences were observed in genotype distribution for all four genes. For BMI increase, the only difference by category was LEPRrs1137101 (bothT1D/T2D vs controls). In BMI-stable groups, CAV1rs926198, T1D individuals showed lower T allele frequency (p=0.004) vs non-diabetes and for LEPRrs1137101 a higher G allele frequency versus controls (p=0.002). For T2D, CAV1rs926198, T allele frequency was lower in T2D than controls (p=0.005). For LEPR rs1137101, the G allele frequency was higher than in controls (p=0.004). In those with BMI increase, LEPRrs1137101 T1D individuals had higher G allele frequency versus controls (p=0.002) as did T2D vs controls (p=0.03).Differences in allele frequency were seen between diabetes individuals and non-diabetes diagnosed at baseline in relation to the likelihood of BMI increase of >10%. It is established that the G allele of LEPRrs1137101 is associated with weight gain/obesity. However, this is the first report of CAV1rs926198 polymorphism being associated with weight stability/gain in diabetes.",

    "abstract": "The plasminogen receptor, Plg-RKT, is a unique cell surface receptor that is broadly expressed in cells and tissues throughout the body. Plg-RKT localizes plasminogen on cell surfaces and promotes its activation to the broad-spectrum serine protease, plasmin. In this study, we show that overexpression of Plg-RKT protects mice from high fat diet (HFD)-induced adipose and metabolic dysfunction. During the first 10 weeks on the HFD, the body weights of mice that overexpressed Plg-RKT (Plg-RKT-OEX) were lower than those of control mice (CagRosaPlgRKT). After 10 weeks on the HFD, CagRosaPlgRKT and Plg-RKT-OEX mice had similar body weights. However, Plg-RKT-OEX mice showed a more metabolically favourable body composition phenotype. Plg-RKT-OEX mice also showed improved glucose tolerance and increased insulin sensitivity. We found that the improved metabolic functions of Plg-RKT-OEX mice were mechanistically associated with increased energy expenditure and activity, decreased proinflammatory adipose macrophages and decreased inflammation, elevated brown fat thermogenesis, and higher expression of adipose PPARγ and adiponectin. These findings suggest that Plg-RKT signalling promotes healthy adipose function via multiple mechanisms to defend against obesity-associated adverse metabolic phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Mitochondria are essential for generating cellular energy and are significant in the pathogenesis of obesity. Peptide PDBSN has been demonstrated to inhibit the adipogenic differentiation of adipocytes in vitro and improves metabolic homoeostasis in vivo. Therefore, in this study, we further investigated the effects of PDBSN on the morphology, synthesis, and function of adipocyte mitochondria. Methods: Human visceral and subcutaneous primary preadipocytes (HPA-v and HPA-s) were cultured into mature adipocytes. Intracellular triglyceride content was assessed using oil-red O staining and tissue triglyceride determination. Gene and protein levels associated with mitochondrial synthesis were detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Mitochondrial membrane potentials and ROS were detected using fluorescent indicators. Morphological changes were observed by electron microscopy. Results: PDBSN significantly increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), while decreasing intracellular triglyceride (TG) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. On the other hand, the transcription and protein levels of genetic marker genes PGC1-α and MTFA were significantly up-regulated after PDBSN administration. Further studies showed that transcriptional and protein levels of mitochondrial fusion and fission genetic markers MFN1, MFN2, NRF1, and DRP1 increased. Conclusion: PDBSN significantly reduces intracellular TG and ROS levels and increases MMP. The maximum respiratory capacity in adults significantly increases after PDBSN administration, and ROS levels are significantly reduced. This suggests that PDBSN improves mitochondrial function to some extent, which not only provides an essential basis for the pathophysiology of obesity but also provides insights for the development of new drugs to treat obesity and metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal microbiota may contribute to the development of obesity by affecting host lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. To investigate the effects of microbiota manipulation on ex vivo basal and β-adrenergically-stimulated lipolysis in human adipocytes, 36 obese men were randomized to amoxicillin (broad-spectrum antibiotic), vancomycin (narrow-spectrum antibiotic) or placebo treatment (7 d, 1500 mg/d). Before and after treatment, ex vivo adipose tissue lipolysis was assessed under basal conditions and during stimulation with the non-selective β-agonist isoprenaline using freshly isolated mature adipocytes. Gene (targeted microarray) and protein expression were analyzed to investigate underlying pathways. Antibiotics treatment did not significantly affect basal and maximal isoprenaline-mediated glycerol release from adipocytes. Adipose tissue β-adrenoceptor expression or post-receptor signalling was also not different between groups. In conclusion, 7 d oral antibiotics treatment has no effect on ex vivo lipolysis in mature adipocytes derived from adipose tissue of obese insulin resistant men.",

    "abstract": "Soft tissue defects caused by adipose tissue loss can result in various conditions such as lipodystrophy in congenital diseases, trauma secondary to ageing, and mastectomy in breast cancer; fat grafting is commonly performed to restore these defects. Although various enrichment strategies have been studied, novel therapeutics that are cost-effective, safe, technologically easy to manufacture, and minimally invasive are required. In this study, we identified a novel peptide derived from plasminogen, named plasminogen-derived peptide-1 (PLP-1), which showed adipogenic differentiation potential and led to an increase in the expression levels of adiponectin, C1Q and collagen domain containing protein, fatty acid-binding protein 4, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha. In vivo experiments confirmed an increase in the rate of adipocyte differentiation and the expression levels of CD31 in the PLP-1-treated mice groups. These results suggested that PLP-1 plays an important role in promoting the differentiation of preadipocytes and may be useful for developing therapeutic approaches to treat adipose tissue defects.",

Little is known about changes in expression levels of TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 genes in mammals, including humans. Number of factors were studied, but data remain controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of selected cytokines, adipokines and myokines with known or putative insulin sensitivity regulation activity (adiponectin, irisin, omentin, interleukin 6, leptin, resistin, and tumour necrosis factor) on TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 expression levels in cultured differentiated human adipocytes. No significant differences were found between the adipocytes treated with different stimuli and this effect was determined not dose dependent. It is reasonable to conclude that relative shortage of data showing no change in TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 from literature results from publication bias; therefore, our finding provides additional insight into the role of both genes.",
