    "abstract": "Abstract Poor households access their food from the market, subsistence production and transfers from public programmes or other households. In the past rural households produced most of their own food, but recent studies have shown an increase in dependence on market purchases by both urban and rural households, in some cases reaching 90% of the food supplies. Food expenditures can account for as much as 60–80% of total household income for low-income households in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Subsistence/smallholder agriculture can play an important role in reducing the vulnerability of rural and urban food-insecure households, improving livelihoods, and helping to mitigate high food price inflation. There is a need to significantly increase the productivity of subsistence/smallholder agriculture and ensure long-term food security. This can be achieved by encouraging farmers to pursue sustainable intensification of production through the use of improved inputs. This will require a dramatic increase in the use of fertiliser, organic inputs and conservation investments, combined with the development of well-functioning input and output markets to help farmers acquire and use improved inputs, market their (surplus) output and reduce transaction costs and risks. Increased productivity will reduce pressure on marginal lands, as the intensification of cultivated land will reduce pressure to crop fragile marginal lands. There is a need to determine methods of identifying cost-effective ways to improve access to inputs by, among other things, improving delivery, and assisting farmers to earn cash to purchase inputs and invest in infrastructure, thereby improving food security.",

A new Cooperatives Act, based on international principles of cooperation, was promulgated in South Africa in August 2005. The theory of cooperatives, and new institutional economics theory (NIE) (including transaction cost economics, agency theory and property rights theory) and its applicability to the cooperative organizational form, are also presented, as are the inherent problems of conventional cooperatives, namely free-rider, horizon, portfolio, control and influence cost problems caused by vaguely defined property rights. An analysis of the future of cooperatives in general, based on a NIE approach, suggests a life cycle for cooperatives (formation, growth, reorganization or exit) as they adapt to a changing economic environment characterized by technological change, industrialization of agriculture and growing individualism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract At first glance South Africa's black farming sector appears to contribute rather minimally to overall agricultural output in South Africa. However, despite the complexity involved in this sector and the often marginal conditions in which agriculture is practised it appears to be important to a large number of black households. Furthermore, the significance they attach to subsistence agriculture as means of supplementing household food supplies seems to heavily outweigh other reasons for engaging in agriculture. Some South African researchers have indicated the contribution subsistence production makes to household food security, despite the prevalent complexities and the low input nature of this production. Statistics South Africa's Labour Force Survey data from 2001 to 2007 and a case study of subsistence farming in Limpopo Province are used to support the argument that, despite the complexity of this sector, the more than 4 million subsistence farmers, need and merit greater support. Such support should be based on the local context, build on and, where appropriate, improve existing local practices, while addressing various existing threats to this type of production. Recommendations are made as to what policy makers need to consider when considering how best to support subsistence production.",

Farmers in two case study communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal face high transaction costs as reflected primarily in their low levels of education and literacy, lack of market information, insecure property rights, poor road and communication infrastructure, and long distances to markets. Analysis of the reasons why cooperatives were originally established in various parts of the world suggests that most of the causes (such as poverty, market failure and high transaction costs) also apply to the study farmers, as do the seven international principles of cooperation. Smallholder farmers in both case study regions have the potential to grow high-value crops such as vegetables, fruit and cut flowers. In the supply chain from farm to market, the optimum boundary for each organization involved in the chain (e.g. cooperative and investor-oriented firm) depends on the minimum operational and transaction costs for each business.

The following variables were statistically significant: age, ability to speak/understand English, region, ownership of transport, access to market information, distance to market, dependency ratio, trust, land size and ownership of livestock. Increases in the latter four have negative effects on commercialisation. The negative relationship between land size and commercialisation probably indicates that increased market participation is also afunction of input (land) productivity.

A bivariate probit model is applied to account for the simultaneity of participation decisions of both male and female members of farm households. The results of the analysis show that human capital variables such as health and training on non-farm activities have a positive effect on the off-farm participation decisions of male members of farm households. The education status of the head has no significant impact on the participation decisions of the members of the family as most of the off-farm activities do not require formal education. The availability of credit and transfer income is the other factors that have a positive impact on the decisions of male members to participate in off-farm activities. The effects of family and farm characteristics are also analysed. Finally, policies that aim to increase the off-farm work participation decisions of family members should take into consideration the difference in responses to the various factors that affect the off-farm work decisions of male and female members of farm households.

Results showed that climate change has significant nonlinear impacts on net revenue per hectare of sugarcane in South Africa with higher sensitivity to future increases in temperature than precipitation.

The study suggests that adaptation strategies should focus special attention on technologies and management regimes that will enhance sugarcane tolerance to warmer temperatures during winter and especially the harvesting phases.",

Survey results show that while many farmers noticed long-term changes in temperature and precipitation, most could not take remedial action. Lack of access to credit and water were cited as the main factors inhibiting adaptation. Common adaptation responses reported included diversifying crops, changing varieties and planting dates, using irrigation, and supplementing livestock feed. A multinomial logit analysis of climate adaptation responses suggests that access to water, credit, extension services and off-farm income and employment opportunities, tenure security, farmers' asset base and farming experience are key to enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity. This implies that appropriate government interventions to improve farmers' access to and the status of these factors are needed for reducing vulnerability of farmers to climate adversities in such arid areas.",

We estimate a multinomial endogenous switching regression model of farm household's choice of combinations of CF practices and their impacts on crop net revenue. Four primary results are found. First, several factors affect adoption of CF practices depending on the combinations in which they are adopted. Second, all CF practices significantly increase crop net revenue per hectare when practised either singly or jointly. Third, a joint adoption of crop residue retention and minimum soil disturbance yields the highest crop net revenue per hectare among all the possible combinations of CF practices. Thus a more comprehensive approach that focuses on joint adoption of all CF practices is not the best income yielding portfolio. Fourth, adoption of CF practices in combination generally results in more crop net revenue per hectare than adopting them in isolation. Therefore, results point towards the need for promotion of adoption of CF practices in combination while considering the influence from household, seed, plot level, agro-ecological, and miscellaneous factors to enable farmers in Zambia to realise most payoffs.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTABSTRACTAlthough the term itself was only developed in the 1970s, food security has played a central role in policies that have shaped the history of South Africa from the 17th century. As with the changing international interpretation of food security over the past four decades, South African food security determinants have been interpreted differently by different ruling authorities and governments over three centuries. The Natives Land Act of 1913 played a significant role in determining the food security context of the country in terms of the character, composition and contribution of the agricultural sector, shaped consumption patterns and determined rural livelihoods. While food security is expressed as a national objective in a plethora of strategies and programmes, no formal evaluation has been carried out of the food security impact of these programmes, and there is a dire lack of coordination and no enforceable policy to ensure food security. Any national food security policy will need a framework of enforceable legislative measures and statutory coordination and reporting. This article explores the current national and household food security and nutrition situation in South Africa, and it offers recommendations for a comprehensive food security policy.Keywords: food securityfood security policyagriculture policyJEL classification: I38",

We then developed a two-by-two matrix of contract types based on the interaction of transaction attributes. The results show that four contract types can be distinguished: total, group, lean and market contracts. Furthermore, CFAs that are misaligned with transaction attributes have problems of side-selling and inefficiency. Our new empirically based categorisation can help managers and policymakers to design CFAs that match with underlying transaction attributes, thus enhancing the stability and efficiency of CFAs.",

    "abstract": "South African agriculture is comprised of mainly two categories of farmers—the subsistence farmers in the former homeland areas and the large-scale commercial (mainly white) farmers. This is in contrast with the situation in many other countries in the world where one would find a whole range of farm sizes, ranging from the very small or subsistence farmer to the very large farmer/agribusiness. The paper highlights the situation of small-scale farmers in an international context and compares it with the South African situation that is totally different. Within this context, this paper has as basic premise that in South Africa the concept of \"small-scale farmer\" is usually value-laden, creates wrong impressions and is often viewed in a negative light. \"Small-scale\" is often equated with a backward, nonproductive, non-commercial, subsistence agriculture that we find in parts of the former homeland areas. This paper endeavours to correct the negative perceptions towards small-scale farms by redefining the small-scale farmer and laying to rest the fallacy that small relates to land size only.",

These include farmland size, ox ownership, fertilizer application, education level of household heads, household size, and per capita production. The result was analyzed further to compute partial effects and to conduct simulation studies on significant determinant factors. Analysis of partial effects revealed that an introduction to fertilizer use and an improvement in the educational levels of household heads lead to relatively greater probability of food security. On the other hand, simulations were conducted on the basis of the base category of farmers, representing food secure households, revealed that both educational levels of household heads and fertilizer application by farmers have relatively high potential to more than double the number of food secure households in the study area following improvements in these factors.",

This article addresses whether there is a case for similar protection in South Africa. The article explores the economic rationale for implementing a system of Geographical Indications by addressing issues such as information asymmetry and the role of reputation; formation of niche markets; monopoly formation, value added and rural development. The economic rationale for protecting Geographical Indications derives mainly from the fact that place of origin may be used as a quality signal, or alternatively, that the resources of the region may be captured as quality attributes. In the first instance the meaning of the geographical name is emphasized in order to reduce information asymmetries. Where place of origin is used as an attribute, resources of the region are used to increase the value of the product. This includes specific resources such as production techniques, varieties and species, but also resources that are general to the region such as landscape, environment and culture. Economic arguments present a strong justification for the introduction of geographical indications in South Africa. At the same time it will afford greater protection to indigenous resources and geographical names which could, through the collective and inclusive nature of the system, directly contribute to rural development.",

Recent focus on food security due to rising food prices at a national and global level has placed the food security agenda back in the spotlight. In this paper it is argued that there is a disjuncture between the institutional response mechanism defined in South Africa's strategy and the complexity of food insecurity nationally. It outlines why, as a response seated uncomfortably under the leadership of the National Department of Agriculture, the IFSS remains frustrated by a range of structural and organisational challenges. The IFSS provides a useful case study to demonstrate the importance of institutional arrangements to achieve food security that by its nature, requires integrated responses from diverse stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With South Africa's urban population approaching 60%, supermarkets and fast food chains have become important players in the South African food system. These large players in the food sector have systematically modified their procurement practices especially with regard to fresh fruit and vegetables and are now circumventing spot markets in favour of sourcing via in-house sourcing companies who mainly procure from preferred supplier producers. This paper draws extensively from a global research programme which seeks to highlight the market changes that potentially contribute to continued exclusion of the small producers from mass consumer markets. This paper illustrates, through a series of case studies, how integration of small-scale farmers into the urban retail market can be facilitated and how the challenges posed by the changing food system could possibly be overcome. The case studies illustrate various initiatives through which small-scale farmers and agribusinesses can be integrated into mainstream agri-food systems and may be used as models for an innovative approach to include small-scale farmers while still maintaining profitable business operations. They highlight the need for a multi actor approach for the successful participation of smallholder farmers in order to allow them to join the supply chain at any point within the channel.",

Because these surveys are not designed for the analysis of household-level food security, it is not possible to do the kind of detailed analysis made possible by purpose-designed surveys. However these datasets have some value in respect of understanding food security, namely: large sample sizes; the depth of complementary types of information that assist in contextualising the experience of food insecurity and, in the case of the General Household Survey, regularity. Among the findings are a decline in the experience of hunger during the period 2002–2007, and significantly lower food expenditure per capita in rural areas, suggesting a greater extent of 'self-provisioning' than is commonly assumed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent high food prices and changes in the world food situation are exacerbating the conditions of households that are vulnerable to food insecurity, especially those with weak livelihood strategies. To address the impact of these and other stressors it is necessary to develop a deeper understanding of concepts such as 'vulnerability' and 'food insecurity'. This is challenging as both concepts are used rather loosely in the food security despite both having at least two dimensions. Vulnerability has an external and internal dimension, and food insecurity has a temporal and intensity dimension. However, assessments are often only concerned with one dimension at a time. An exploration of the two concepts suggests that in both cases the dimensions need to be combined in order to understand the different interactions and the interconnections between different dimensions and the multiple levels of the systems in which they are embedded. This combination of dimensions is important for understanding the significant role that livelihoods play in the accumulation of assets and for accessing food. It makes the understanding of the multiple causes and consequences of vulnerability and food insecurity for different households clearer. Those households and individuals considered chronically poor or food-insecure are likely to experience severe food insecurity in the long-term, as a result of their weak livelihoods and minimal assets. Consequently, future studies on vulnerability to food insecurity should focus on these chronically food insecure households in order to determine the multidimensional nature of the stressors they experience and their ability to cope and adapt to these stressors. This would contribute to our understanding of the contexts in which the data from larger quantitative studies are embedded.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Several agro-ecological practices have been developed to increase the range of soil fertility management options available to farmers, but little information is available on their labour input requirement and profitability relative to conventional practices. This study used a multiple visit cost-route method to estimate labour inputs and financial profitability of agroforestry-based and conventional (with and without fertiliser) soil fertility management practices in eastern Zambia. Results show that aggregated over a five-year cycle, labour inputs used under agroforestry practices were lower than fertilised maize fields but higher than non-fertilised continuous cropped maize. Agroforestry practices were more profitable (NPV ranging between $233 and $327 ha-1) than unfertilised maize fields (NPV of $130 ha-1) but less profitable than fertilised maize fields. The NPV for the latter is $499 ha-1 under a 50% government subsidy on fertiliser but, it fell to $349 ha-1 when the subsidy effect is removed. In terms of return per unit investment cost, agroforestry practices performed better with a benefit to cost ratio ranging between 2.77 to 3.13 in contrast to 2.65 (subsidised fertiliser) and 1.77 (non-subsidised fertiliser). The returns to labour per person day was $2.56 in (non-subsidised) fertilised maize field, $3.16 in subsidised fertiliser field, $2.63 in Gliricidia fields, $2.41 in Sesbania fields, $1.90 in Tephrosia fields, and $1.10 in non-fertilised maize fields. The results do not support the popular notion that agroforestry practices are more labour intensive. It suggests that in addition to total labour use requirements, the temporal distribution of labour use during the farming season is important. It is concluded that agroforestry practices are profitable, and could contribute to food security.

Limited by inadequate resources and expertise, among other things, these countries also have poor participation rate in discussions related to SPS that impedes the representation of their interests and concerns in setting international standards for agricultural products. Using a gravity model, this paper estimates the trade effect of total aflatoxin level set by five OECD countries (Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany and USA), on South African food exports. The findings support the hypotheses that stringent SPS standards are limiting trade markedly. The trade elasticity of aflatoxin standard is 0.41 and statistically significant. Moreover, the simulation result based on the assumption that these five OECD countries adopt the total aflatoxin level recommended by CODEX, shows that South Africa would have gained an estimated additional amount of US$ 69 million per year from food exports to these countries from 1995 to 1999.",

A food security target is a well-defined and measurable goal to reduce the numbers of people who lack enough food of the right quality to live healthy lives. To derive baseline indicators for household food security, the following question is asked: what is the average cost of a nutritionally adequate food basket per person? The cost of recommended nutrient intake is based on estimates of dietary energy costs. Reported food expenditure for each household based on 2005/2006 Income and Expenditure Survey data gets compared to two dietary energy cost baskets. The food expenditure shares of the poorest households vary between 38% and 71% according to different surveys. At food expenditure levels reported in the IES, one in five households meet their average dietary energy cost. Deep levels of food insecurity exist in rural areas with 85% of rural households unable to afford even the 'below average dietary energy costs'. Food security policy based on refined baseline indicators can better target food insecure households. Another policy benefit is that robust indicators help to develop effective monitoring capabilities.",

To assess the impact of supermarket chains on various participants in the supply chain, a survey was carried out in Botswana, Namibia and Zambia in 2004, 2005 and 2007. To determine the factors that influence the choice between the supermarket or traditional market channel and the impact of participation in the supermarket supply chain, a two-step treatment model was used. The results showed that over 80% of all processed food products in Botswana, Namibia and Zambia were imported from South Africa, and that supermarkets used a mixture of procurement systems for fresh fruit and vegetables and processed food products. Participation in the supermarkets channel had a positive impact on small-scale farmers' incomes. Farmers who supplied fresh fruit and vegetables to supermarkets had a significantly higher income than those who supplied to traditional markets in Zambia. The expansion of South African supermarkets into the SADC countries may be beneficial to small-scale farmers and therefore efforts should be made to incorporate them into the supermarkets' fresh fruit and vegetable supply chain.

Five of the cooperatives grow and market vegetables, three produce and market poultry, one is a beef production cooperative and another operates a bakery. The results of a cluster analysis suggest that the performance of the selected smallholder cooperatives is influenced by institutional and governance problems. Institutional problems give rise to low levels of equity and debt capital, reliance on government funding, low levels of investment, and subsequent loss of members. Governance problems are strongly linked to the absence of secret ballot, low levels of education, lack of production and management skills training, weak marketing arrangements and consequent low returns to members as patrons or investors. The conclusion is that appropriate institutional arrangements and good governance are important to the performance of enterprises initiated by groups of smallholders. South Africa's new Cooperatives Act prevents smallholder cooperatives from adopting good institutional arrangements. Alternative ownership structures such as close corporations and private companies offer better institutional arrangements and opportunities for equity-sharing partnerships.

The ability to diversify livelihoods depends on asset portfolios and the economic shocks that rural households face. The main objective of this paper is to improve understanding of rural livelihood challenges in south-east Zimbabwe and how households in this area diversify livelihoods to cope with these challenges. A cluster analysis of 200 households surveyed in 2008 in the Chiredzi district identified five distinct livelihood strategies: (1) subsistence smallholders/ unskilled workers; (2) subsistence smallholders/nontimber forestry products (NTFPs) harvesters; (3) crop production and NTFPs extraction integrators; (4) commercial smallholders with regular off-farm employment; and (5) specialised commercial livestock producers. Multinomial logit model results showed that the level of education of the household head, value of physical assets, cattle numbers and income, remittances, NTFP income and economic shocks were the main determinants of these livelihood choices. There is also some evidence that those households that were statistically significantly affected by HIV/AIDS shock practised distresspush diversification by harvesting NTFPs. These results suggest that policymakers need to advise rural households on how to improve their risk management capacities, and move from geographically untargeted investments in livelihood assets to a more integrated approach adapted to the asset bases of individual households.",

The findings show a positive effect of commercialisation on improved seed varieties use and food crop yields, even after controlling for an endogeneity problem. There is no strong evidence of commercialisation effect on fertilizer use among the sampled farm households. Apart from commercialisation, better education, larger farm sizes, access to markets and credit facilities, good roads and extension contacts are necessary for farmers to increase input use and crop yields. Overall, these findings suggest that programmes targeting to increase smallholder farm productivity through commercialisation will only work if they consider production and marketing conditions surrounding the target households.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Small-scale agriculture is one of the few tools available to support improved rural livelihoods on a significant scale in South Africa. Access to output markets is a key factor in generating higher incomes. The rise of modern markets (supermarkets in particular) is generally viewed as positive for the rural poor, although most commentators accede that there are challenges to be overcome in obtaining access to such markets. These challenges are generally perceived as supply-side issues: That is, the \"fault\" for market exclusion lies largely with small producers – their production methods, their business organisation and their location – rather than with these markets themselves. This study asserts that much of the research that has been undertaken in this area is in fact incomplete, because it has excluded two key issues: The likely impact of the dominant supermarket business model on small farmers; and the actual position of small farmers in those countries with high levels of supermarket concentration. A closer examination of the supermarket model suggests it is inherently hostile towards smaller producers. The South African food retail market structure resembles that of industrialised countries rather than developing countries. Therefore, we should expect that the position of South African small farmers vis-à-vis supermarkets is similar to that of small farmers in industrialised countries, who are increasingly excluded from these value chains.",

We estimate the stochastic meta-frontier and region-specific stochastic frontiers based on the ‘true random effects’ framework. Our results show variations in efficiency measures and that smallholder maize production is characterised by increasing returns to scale across all regions, which clearly suggest maize farmers to reduce their average long-term costs by increasing their production scale. We find that some regions are on average more technically efficient than others while those with TE values exceeding 90 per cent operate further below their potential output than those with moderate TE values. Similarly, farm households from regions whose mean TE values are about 90 per cent employ inferior farming techniques to those employed by farmers from regions whose mean TE values are lower. This is in part due to industry-wide specific environmental factors. Most importantly, we find no region to have maize farmers that adopt the most advanced techniques. Results further indicate that all provinces have had either lower or higher TEs, TGRs and MTEs in one period than in another. Generally, our results point to the need to promote superior techniques that would withstand industry-wide specific environmental factors. While it is not possible to find the many reasons for wide variations in TEs, TGRs, and MTEs across regions and time, our results make novel contributions to literature.",

The results showed that fixed transaction costs associated with market information and household characteristics such as gender and education level of the household head had a statistically significant influence on market participation. Proportional transaction costs (distance to market) and variables such as output prices, farm size, labour force, membership of farmer associations and geographical location of households influenced both market participation and intensity of participation.

The research brings to light new evidence of youth perspectives on contemporary attitudes, experiences and expectations of work in the agricultural sector in South Africa.The research took a narrative-based approach using SenseMaker as a tool for blended qualitative and quantitative data collection. A sample of 573 youth narratives was drawn from across three sites in the KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Western Cape provinces of South Africa.Findings show that attitudes towards careers in agriculture vary greatly. While a set of negative perceptions emerged from the narratives as anticipated, approximately one third of the respondents expressed a clear interest in and passion for agriculture. This interest persisted in spite of a range of pervasive social norms and stigmas. However, these positive aspirations tended to be at odds with the kinds of jobs created by an increasingly corporatised food regime.The research addresses two key policy documents: The National Development Plan and the National Youth Policy, contributing toward the growing body of literature seeking to understand how agricultural policy based on principles of \"accumulation from below\" may be formulated. It also provides an empirical evidence base for activists, educators and policy-makers interested in the role of the agricultural sector in addressing youth unemployment in South Africa and elsewhere in Africa.",

    "abstract": "Abstract South Africa is one of few developing countries, and the only one in Africa that has adopted genetically modified crops for commercial production. The very impressive adoption rate of insect-resistant cotton in South Africa can be attributed to different benefits enjoyed by adopters. This article focuses on the reasons and effects of Bt cotton adoption by large-scale and small-scale cotton farmers in South Africa and considers the impact of the adoption on yields, cost and profit. In addition the paper also analyses the production efficiency of adopters and non-adopters. Both large-scale and small-scale farmers enjoy financial benefits due to higher yields and despite higher seed costs. In addition, those who adopted the technology appear to be more technically efficient than those who do not adopt—indicating that it is perhaps the better farmers who spot the potential benefits of the Bt cotton seed. Further diverse analysis of the results from the various surveys are underway and promises to deliver interesting results on the various impacts Bt cotton is having on the South African cotton industry.",

As a direct result of population growth, most peasants have small fields and land fragmentation is common. The purpose of this article is to examine the effect of land fragmentation on economic efficiency. Regression analysis shows that area operated is primarily determined by the population-land ratio, non-agricultural employment opportunities, ownership certainty and adequate information through agricultural training. Results from a block-recursive regression analysis indicate that the level of net farm income per hectare, which indirectly reflects greater economic efficiency, is determined by the area operated, use of farm information, field extension staff visits, formal education of a farm operator, and the fragmentation of land holdings. Economies of size are evident in the data. The results obtained using ridge regression support the findings of two-stage least squares. Policies should be implemented to improve the functioning of land rental markets in order to reduce land fragmentation, improve rural education and access to relevant information; and strengthen extension facilities to individual farmers.",

The study showed that the levels of technical efficiency ranged from 29.4% to 98.2% with a mean of 86.6%, which suggests that average rice output falls 13.4% short of the maximum possible level. Therefore in the short run there is scope to increase technical efficiencies on rice farms in the study area.

The volatility in the prices of white maize, yellow maize and sunflower seed have been found to vary over time, suggesting the use of the GARCH approach in these cases. Using the GARCH approach, the conditional standard deviation is the measure of volatility, and distinguishes between the predictable and unpredictable elements in the price process. This leaves only the stochastic component and is hence a more accurate measure of the actual risk associated with the price of the crop. The volatility in the prices of wheat and soybeans was found to be constant over time; hence the standard error of the ARIMA process was used as the measure of volatility in the prices of these two crops. When comparing the medians of the conditional standard deviations in the prices of white maize, yellow maize and sunflower seed to the constant volatilities of wheat and soybeans, the price of white maize was found to be the most volatile, followed by yellow maize, sunflower seed, soybeans, and wheat respectively. These results suggest that the more risk-averse farmers will more likely produce wheat, sunflower seed and to a lesser extent soybeans, while maize producers are expected to utilise forward pricing methods, especially put options, at a high level to manage the higher volatility.",

Using a logit modelling approach, it also identified the drivers of adoption of the technology by analysing the influence of household characteristics and ecological factors on farmers' decision to adopt the technology. The model correctly predicted 75% of observed adoption and non-adoption by farmers. Results reveal that dairy herd size, land holding size, membership of dairy association and agro-ecological potential are the key factors influencing farmers' adoption of fodder bank. Age, sex, household size and educational level of farmers play lesser role. Male and female farmers were equally likely to take up and practice fodder bank if they are given equal access to information and incentives. The study recommends farmer-led extension approaches where farmers who possess certain key characteristics should constitute the initial group for disseminating information regarding the technology in rural communities. The results highlight the importance of access to dairy product markets as a driver for the adoption of fodder banks. It is recommended that forging a strategic partnership with the Dairy Development Programme (DDP) will offer high potential for enhancing the scaling up of the adoption and impact of fodder bank technology in the country.",

Noting that many of the world's hungry are smallholder farmers, it is clear that food insecurity is closely linked to the livelihood strategies of these farm households. As previous studies have shown, food insecurity is linked to livelihood assets, strong institutional support and a favourable external environment. In particular, the paper finds that food security depends on cereal output, budgetary support to agriculture, agricultural value added and poverty—all variables strongly linked to the sustainable livelihoods framework. Since most poor rural households rely on agricultural production for a significant share of their households income, increasing agricultural productivity is critical to increase food security and reduce rural poverty.",

It analyses contract farming from the small-scale farmer perspective to better understand the implications for small-scale farmers of contractual arrangements with processing and/or marketing firms. The paper, based on empirical research conducted in the Limpopo Province of South Africa using a combination of qualitative and econometric analyses, argues that contract farming is not a panacea for small-scale farmers. On the one hand, contract farming improves agricultural production for contract farmers who benefit from increased incomes, enables better access to services and resources, and creates new opportunities to participate in markets. However, on the other hand, the results show that contract farming remains limited and mostly involves the already better-off, who have benefitted from specific development paths and public support. This case study shows that contract farming in itself does not appear to provide an efficient means of reducing poverty, nor does it provide an institutional tool through which to improve rural livelihoods. It does, therefore, not represent a tool appropriate for the majority of small farmers or for redressing the historical imbalances in the South African agricultural sector.",

The ways farmers articulate these priorities afford us a perspective on urban agricultural development in Johannesburg that is crucial for the implementation of policy. The article discusses these themes in the context of the newly formulated policy and explains their significance vis-à-vis the broader assessment of urban agriculture and smallholder agriculture in the literature.

It seeks to understand the drivers of CA adoption intensity in terms of the number of practices implemented using count data analysis. On average, the farmers in our sample adopt five out of eight possible CA practices while only 7.4% use all eight practices in any one year. Practices such as digging planting basins (81.9%), applying manure (73.2%) and timely post-planting weeding (70.1%) are relatively popular, while adoption of crop rotation (22.8%) is comparatively rare. Productivity is positively correlated to the number of techniques used. Farmers adopting all the CA practices are the most productive, with an estimated maize yield of 2.50 tons/ha, compared with a yield of less than 1 tons/ha for those using three techniques or fewer. Results from a Poisson regression indicate that education, agro-ecology, non-governmental input support and extension support have a significant impact on adoption intensity. Subsidised inputs increase the number of components used, although access to those inputs was uneven across regions of Zimbabwe. Further, the number of CA components used in the previous season positively impacts current season adoption intensity, implying that promotions of CA technologies do have a persistent effect, even after those promotions end.",

The past decade saw little change in the general behaviour of smallholder farmers, and the stumbling blocks faced by smallholder farmers who want to participate in commercial agri-food chains. A possible reason may be that researchers tend to focus on the current behaviour and performance of the farmers while neglecting the influence of the incentive structure on their behaviour. The aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework that allows for a more holistic analysis of farmers and their value chains to better understand the reasons underlying current behaviour, and to identify potential solutions to change the behaviour of the farmers and relevant role-players to better match the requirements for successfully participating in competitive agri-food chains. The integrated value chain, New Institutional Economics – Structure-Conduct-Performance framework, does allow for a comprehensive analysis of the incentive structure embedded in the social, physical and institutional environment within which the farmers operate. Special attention is also awarded to the relationship between the farmers and their buyers to identify the appropriate coordination strategy that will minimise transaction costs.",

    "abstract": "Increased frequency of droughts (especially mid-season dry spells), higher than normal temperatures and altered patterns of precipitation and intensity are some of the extreme weather events evident in southern Africa. These extreme weather events present a threat to livelihoods and sustainability of agricultural production in the region. However, several climate-smart agricultural technologies (including drought-tolerant maize) believed to offer adaptation to climate variability in maize-based farming systems have been widely adopted. Moreover, empirical work on these technologies is limited. This paper demonstrates how by adopting drought-tolerant maize, a climate-smart agricultural technology impacts on the quantities of maize produced, sold and consumed in Zimbabwe. Using primary data on smallholder farmers collected in 2011 in Zimbabwe's four districts, we employed propensity score matching techniques to construct a suitable comparison group and calculate the average treatment effect on the treated sample. We find that, the adoption of drought-tolerant maize (DTM) in rural Zimbabwe significantly enhances overall maize productivity and consequently the quantities set aside for sale and personal household consumption. Our study therefore suggests that, systematic expansion of climate-smart agricultural technologies such as adoption of drought-tolerant maize can significantly improve maize yields, sales and consumption in rural Zimbabwe. Our empirical results, robust to sensitivity checks, strongly point to the overall importance of DTM adoption in Zimbabwe. The findings from this paper also have very important implications for overall efforts on the promotion of climate-smart agriculture technologies in Africa and other developing countries.",

Debates on what kind of food system we need to respond to this crisis remain unresolved and lacking in a good understanding of the impacts of Covid-19 on farmers who are key actors in food systems. This article contributes to these debates by revealing the experiences of black fresh produce farmers in South Africa since Covid-19 arrived in the country and the government responded with a range of emergency regulations. This is based on in-depth research with 40 market-orientated black small- and medium-scale farmers. Giving particular attention to black farmers is essential in South Africa given the high levels of continued wealth and racial inequalities. The study has found that, despite overall growth in the agricultural sector, these farmers are facing many challenges and receive inadequate support. The outcomes of Covid-19 related impacts include reductions in production and incomes as well as job losses. If not addressed there could be long-term negative consequences that undermine the food system and reinforce existing inequalities. A holistic food system approach, better informed by an understanding of black farmers and the networks they are part of, will be valuable to finding solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract South Africa's agricultural policy has had food self-sufficiency as a major objective until recently. This is still the case for a number of the homelands. South Africa has to a large extent achieved this goal by producing a surplus in most of the agricultural commodities. Despite this efficiency, large inequities, inefficient food distribution networks and high levels of malnutrition are experienced. South Africa is therefore characterised by surpluses and exports amidst food shortages—a situation of “hunger and malnutrition next to the granary” is therefore typical. These conditions necessitate a review of the current agricultural policy goals. This paper strongly argues in favour of a policy of food security aimed at both national and household level. The paper initially reviews the issues and terminology of food security as a matter of clarification. The dimensions of the food security problem in South Africa at national and household level are subsequently quantified showing that 21% of the urban population and 63% of the rural population in South Africa live below the minimum subsistence level. The evidence necessitates an evaluation of policies and programmes to address food security in South Africa. The paper looks at a range of policy alternatives and concludes that, on the one hand, production orientated policies implying technological change and commercialization of production by rural households will provide a long term impact in terms of all the food security risks. Given South Africa's inequitable distribution of infrastructure, this will have to be accompanied by infrastructural development and an improved food distribution network. On the other hand, the increasing number of urban households necessitates a reconsideration of pricing and distributional issues. Specific issues which will have to be addressed are controlled marketing, marketing margins and the influence of concentration in the food processing sectors on the price and affordability of basic foodstuffs. Attention should also be paid to the “food price dilemma” which should be taken into consideration in agricultural price policy. Finally it is important to note that food security requires economic development and large scale public commitment which is not achievable with a few cheap short term interventions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Coffee producers in Ethiopia have historically received a very small share of the export price of green coffee. Reasons that are often mentioned are heavy government intervention and high marketing and processing costs. Prior to 1992, government regulation of the domestic coffee market in the form of fixed producer prices and the monopoly power of the Ethiopian Coffee Marketing Corporation put a substantial wedge between the producer price and the world price of coffee by imposing an implicit tax on producers. The domestic coffee marketing system in Ethiopia was liberalised after 1992, which was envisaged to have a positive effect on producer prices and price transmission signals from world markets to producers. This paper, with the help of Cointegration and Error-Correction Model (ECM), attempts to analyse its impact. As findings indicate, the reforms induced stronger long-run relationships among grower, wholesaler and exporter prices. The estimation of the ECM shows that the short-run transmission of price signals from world to domestic markets has improved, but has remained weak in both auction-to-world and producer-to-auction markets. This might be explained by the weak institutional arrangement coordinating the domestic coffee system and contract enforcement. In general, the domestic price adjusts more rapidly to world price changes today than it did prior to the reforms.

Using historical maize and cotton yield data from nine districts in Zimbabwe, we find that catastrophic drought insurance contracts based on the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be constructed whose indemnities exhibit higher correlations with yield losses than the conventional rainfall index. In addition the NDVI contracts can be offered within the 5 to 10 per cent premium range considered reasonably affordable to many poor smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Abstract About 70 per cent of the Namibian population depends on agricultural activities for their livelihood. Moreover, agriculture remains an important sector in Namibia owing to the fact that its national economy is widely dependent on agricultural production. Cattle producers in the Northern Communal Areas (NCAs) have an option to market their cattle via the formal or informal market. Efforts have been made to encourage producers to market their cattle through the formal market; however, these proved to be futile as the strategy yielded limited improvements. In this study, a number of variables have been analysed to determine factors that influence cattle marketing decisions. Factors influencing the marketing decision on whether to sell or not sell through the formal market have been analyzed using the Probit model. Factors influencing the amount of cattle sold through the formal market, assuming that a producer uses the formal market to sell cattle, were analysed using the Truncated model. Testing the Tobit model against the alternative of a two-part model was done using Cragg's model. Results from empirical research suggest that problems with transportation to MeatCo, marketing experience and the age of cattle producers are some of the factors that significantly influence the decision whether or not sell through the formal market. The accessibility of marketingrelated information, accessibility of new information technology, the age of respondents and a lack of improved productivity are some of the factors that influence the proportional number of cattle sold through the formal market. The results suggest that substantially more information is obtained by modelling cattle marketing behaviour as a dual decision-making framework instead of a single decision-making framework.

The intensity of uptake was measured using an index that accounted for the number of CA components used, their relative importance, and the rate and extent of their application. Previous studies ignore some or all of these important aspects of uptake. The determinants of use and intensity were identified using a double hurdle model. Although most smallholders applied the reduced tillage or crop rotation components of CA, few combined these practices with mulching. Farm size and experience with CA technology impacted positively on the current use of CA, while distance from town (market) and ownership of an ox-drawn plough reduced the intensity of its uptake. Sensitivity analysis showed that these results change when partial measures of CA uptake are used, emphasising the importance of establishing a comprehensive measure of intensity. Policy implications include a need for institutional change to improve smallholder access to cropland, more participatory approaches to agricultural extension, and more convenient access to farm inputs.",

An understanding of factors that influence livelihood strategies adopted across rural households can further improve policy-making.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means cluster analysis were used to analyse the outcomes. The application of PCA on dummy variables depicting participation in livelihood activities reduced the number of dimensions. Next, PCA factor loadings served as input into K-means cluster analysis; K-means clusters represented household livelihood strategies. Multinomial logistic regression applied to the K-means clusters determined factors influencing the choice of livelihood strategies at the household level. The results indicate that years of formal education, household size, dependency ratio, arable dryland area accessed by the household, and savings of household heads, the location of the household and source of agricultural information were the main determinants of livelihood choice. These findings suggest that policymakers should design policies that are sensitive to household-level characteristics in promoting livelihood strategies.",

    "abstract": "In this era of rapidly increasing food demand, a sustainable food supply is required to meet such demand. This suggests that capital investment through adequate access to credit is needed to develop the agricultural sector in developing countries including Lesotho. Therefore, this paper examined farmers' access to credit and its impact on farm income using a three-stage model, namely: Probit, Tobit, and propensity score matching. The study was conducted in Lesotho with a sample size of 100 farmers. The empirical results reveal that access to credit increases net farm revenues by US$116.608 to US$136.894. Furthermore, savings, scale of production, membership of farmer associations and financial record keeping exert significant positive effects on access to credit, while higher interest rates reduce farmers' likelihood of securing credit from a financial institution. We conclude that adequate access to credit is necessary to promote a sustainable agricultural development and the livelihoods of rural farmers in Africa.",

    "abstract": "While contract farming and interlocked contractual arrangements (ICAs) are generally perceived to resolve persistent market failures and improve smallholder farmers' welfare in developing countries, uncertainties remain as to whether these arrangements enhance welfare because of farmers' low marketed volumes and margins. To account for potential selection bias, non-Gaussian and missing data problems, a robust two-stage Bayesian instrumental variable approach is used to determine the impact of dairy farmers' participation in ICAs on household income and milk revenue. Data are from smallholder dairy farmers in Zambia. We find that male household heads, wealth, experience selling to milk collection centres (MCCs), livestock holding, milking parlour ownership, landholding, and access to marketing information positively affect farmers' probability to participate in ICAs. However, increased off-farm income and distance to MCCs limit their participation. While some socioeconomic variables have significant positive effects of affecting ICA participation on household welfare, we find no sufficient evidence of causal effects of ICAs on household incomes and milk revenue among dairy farmers. Thus, while ICAs enhance smallholder farmers' access to markets, they may not address high rural poverty rates in developing countries. We provide some insights by which performance of ICAs in the dairy sector may be improved.",

Farming styles refer to specific farming strategies, which are conscious responses of farmers to the prevailing ecological and socio-economic conditions. The specific objectives of the study were to identify and characterize styles of farming in the Dzindi community of smallholders, to provide an understanding of the different styles from a smallholder perspective, and to interpret the meaning of the findings for smallholder development policy. Data collection involved both quantitative and qualitative methods. Three main farming styles were identified, and in each of these farmers employed particular strategies, which were congruent with their farming objectives, and which represented different degrees of exposure to risk evidenced by the crop selection, the amount of land they planted, the service providers they used with specific reference to land preparation, the social networks they maintained, especially with regard to marketing produce, the labour they hired and the farming requisites they purchased and utilised. The findings suggest that the response by farmers in the different styles to contemporary agricultural and related policy aimed at their empowerment and commercialisation is unlikely to be uniform, and this is expected to dilute the impact of policy measures in support of specific development trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is now widely appreciated internationally that rural communities make extensive use of wild resources, and that this use has significant direct use value. The number of case studies in South Africa that have valued the use of such resources are small, albeit growing. Yet none of them have been from coastal sites, which would include use of marine resources, nor have previous studies included the non-biological resources of sand and clay for building purposes. This paper addresses this gap, through examination of the role and value of wild resources in rural livelihoods of households in the Ntubeni and Cwebe areas of the Transkei Wild Coast in the Eastern Cape. Households used a wide range of resources collected from the surrounding communal lands and the Dwesa Cwebe Nature Reserve. Major differences between the sites were the widespread use of bushmeat, shellfish and building sand at Ntubeni compared with relatively small use of these three resources at Cwebe. These differences resulted in a markedly higher, gross, annual, direct-use value at Ntubeni than at Cwebe. The gross, annual, direct-use value averaged across all resources (excluding medicinal plants) and all households (user and non-users) was over R12 000 at Ntubeni, compared to R4 858 at Cwebe. At Ntubeni over half of the total annual direct-use value was contributed by fish and shellfish, indicating the need for more studies in coastal areas. A similar pattern was not evident at Cwebe, because residents did not have access to a rocky shoreline outside of the marine reserve. Local trade was highly variable, both between resources and between households. Averaging the value of trade across all households (i.e. traders and non-traders), gave a total gross, annual value of R1 660 and R600 at Ntubeni and Cwebe, respectively.",

Three output and 10 input types were used to calculate the efficiency score for each farm. A two-stage analysis was conducted to measure and explain the efficiency scores. Firstly, the efficiency scores were measured by a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach, which was implemented using a linear programming (LP) method. About 18 per cent of the farms were fully productive, each with an efficiency score of unity, which means this group is currently operating on the production possibility frontier. About 32 per cent of the farms had efficiency scores below 0.25, which means that about a third of the dairy farms would need to expand their dairy production by at least 75 per cent from the current level without any increase in the level of inputs. Secondly, a fractional regression method was used to explain the efficiency scores by relating them to a range of explanatory variables. The findings indicate that technology adoption factors, such as the existence of improved breeds, and feed and fodder innovations (e.g., growing legumes), have positive and statistically significant effects on the level of efficiency. Similarly, zero-grazing seems to have positive and highly significant effects. As far as marketing variables are concerned, selling milk to individual consumers or organisations seems to contribute positively and more significantly to dairy efficiency than other marketing outlets such as traders or chilling plants. Membership of a dairy cooperative has a positive effect but is not statistically significant.

General-to-specific methodology of time series econometrics was utilised to arrive at the preferred error correction model that was used to determine the impact of government spending on agriculture and on economic growth. In consonance with economic theory, the results showed that the total expenditure on agriculture had a positive significant effect on Nigeria's economic growth in the long run with elasticity of 0.32 during the period under review. The results also showed that economic growth was independent of recurrent expenditure, but dependent (positively) on capital expenditure in the long run with elasticity of 0.36.

As the most widely consumed animal protein, a special focus is placed on poultry, which is disaggregated into two separate product groups, namely IQF portions and other poultry products, providing an improved understanding of demand preferences among different poultry cuts. In light of the changes that have occurred in both global agricultural markets and the South African consumer environment over the past decade, the model is estimated based on monthly data from January 2008 to September 2014, yielding short run elasticities. Expenditure elasticity estimates for IQF portions, other poultry products, pork, mutton and beef were 1.17, 1.24, 0.44, 1.07 and 0.8 respectively and the compensated own-price elasticities were estimated as −0.61, −0.43, −0.72, −0.96 and −0.11 for IQF portions, other poultry products, pork, mutton and beef, respectively. Most of the estimated elasticities conformed to a priori expectations, with the exception of poultry expenditure elasticities, which were higher than expected and in line with luxury goods, rather than normal goods, as the most affordable source of protein. Within the lower income consumer groups, where poultry dominates meat consumption, it was argued that meat in itself is a luxury good, reflected in the elasticities of poultry as the most affordable entry point into the meat market.",

This 6.1-fold increase in overall maize production since 1935 occurred against a 35.7 per cent reduction in the area planted, made possible by an 8.6-fold increase in average maize yields. While commercial farmers now produce 94.6 per cent of the country's maize crop (on 87.5 per cent of the maize area), that was not always the case. In 1942 smallholder farmers—operating within the former homeland areas and outside those areas—accounted for 20.6 per cent of production and 40.6 per cent of the planted area. The location of production also changed. While the Free State remains the dominant producer with 38.8 per cent of output and 42.7 per cent of planted area in 2015, other regions have gained considerable ground (e.g., Mpumalanga, which now accounts for 23.5 per cent of production, and the Northern Cape, 6.4 per cent). Other provinces have ceded ground (e.g., the North West accounted for 28.5 per cent of production in 1994, down to 17.3 per cent in 2015). We also quantify the shifting shares of white versus yellow maize. Although white maize is still a significant share of overall production (49.6 per cent in 2015), yellow maize is growing at a faster pace as both the area planted to yellow maize and the yield growth thereof has outpaced that of white maize.",

However, its influence on performance in developing and emerging (D&E) economies, particularly under a cooperative's context, has been under-researched. This paper examines the impact of market orientation components on the performance of seed producer cooperatives (SPCs) in Ethiopia. Results show that customer orientation, interfunctional coordination, and supplier orientation, but not competitor orientation, contribute to higher business performance. Our findings confirm that customer orientation is the key factor for superior business performance in D&E economies. Business performance has a mediating effect between market orientation components and livelihood performance. Interfunctional coordination and supplier orientation influence the livelihood of member farmers both directly and indirectly via business performance. The study concludes that market orientation of SPCs is very important for business performance and provides a strong basis for the livelihood of seed producer families. SPCs can improve their performance and the livelihood of member-farmer families by implementing market oriented strategies, emphasising the key components of market orientation.",

This study investigates whether collective action through farmer groups has improved incomes among rural farming households in South Africa. The propensity score matching (PSM) method and the treatment effect approach were used to analyse a sample of 984 rural households from four districts in KwaZulu-Natal. The PSM results indicated that participation in farmer groups significantly and positively influenced household incomes. Group membership increased the average household incomes per adult equivalent by about R3000. However, the Rosenbaum bounds tests indicated that the impact estimates obtained using the PSM approach were not robust to hidden bias. The treatment effect regression model, which controls for hidden bias, was estimated, and the results supported those of PSM. The results also indicated that groups benefit more those who are educated and are males, suggesting a bias against the females and those less educated. The results suggest that organising smallholder farmers into groups can play a positive role in rural poverty reduction. For greater impact, policy makers should promote group formation and participation among smallholder farmers as well as introduce adult literacy classes to improve education levels.",

This paper examines the determinants of market participation and marketing channel choice decisions by small scale sorghum farmers using a case comprising 380 households from five Wards in the mid Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe. Mixed data collection approaches including a questionnaire, observations and focus group discussions were used. Secondary data triangulated and validated farmers' responses. A double hurdle based on probit and multinomial logit regression models was applied to the two decision making stages. Ninety six percent of the sampled farmers participated in some market as influenced by payment time, number of buyers in the market, age of principal decision maker and distance to market. Three marketing channels were isolated as local, traders and a combination. The local marketing channel dominates due to its convenience and relatively lower transaction costs. Using the local market option as the referent category, weighted average market price of sorghum, number of buyers in the market, distance to the market, dependency ratio and household income are the most robust determinants of marketing channel selection. Sorghum marketing channel options are limited for small scale farmers in Zimbabwe. Strengthening cooperative based and extension anchored marketing can reduce the risks associated with relating to external traders who usually exploit farmers for price, payment time and quality requirements. Decentralisation of the sorghum markets and promotion of value addition activities in the sorghum value chain is likely to reduce transaction costs and increase the market size.",

This was partly attributed to the importance crop diversification and markets for accessing other nutrient-dense food and the status quo of purchasing food versus own food production. It was concluded that pursuing crop diversification and women market-oriented empowerment by improving farmers skills in agriculture would likely improve food and nutrition security. It was recommended that a more transformative and empowering system that allows farmers to diversify crop production and access more markets be sought.

Data were collected from 900 farm households in Northern Ghana. Our results indicate that the adoption of combinations of agricultural technologies is affected by various socio-economic attributes, resource constraints, institutional factors, and production shocks. We find that adopting multiple technologies improves rice yields, gross rice income, and per capita consumption expenditure. The results point out the crucial synergistic effects of the adoption of agricultural technologies on household welfare. We suggest that policies aimed at strengthening farm household welfare should encourage adopting multiple agricultural technologies in rice-producing farm households to realise the most welfare.",

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity to fast-track the deployment of contact-free digital solutions along the agri-food value chains. Despite the numerous opportunities presented by the digital agricultural revolution, its potential to transform agri-food systems in Africa remains uncertain.

Using cross-sectional data collected from 408 households in three districts of East Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia, this study combined two food security indicators namely calorie intake and Food Consumption Score (FCS) so as to gain more insights on the multidimensional nature of food security and to categorise households into different food insecurity groups. The study further sought to identify factors influencing the households' food insecurity status. The research findings based respectively on the per capita calorie intake and the FCS indicate that 36.03 and 49.02 percent of the sampled households were food insecure. However, the findings reveal that when the two indicators were combined, 22.06 and 40.93 percent of the households were completely food insecure and transitory food insecure respectively. These findings also suggest that the 40.93 percent (26.96 and 13.97 percent) of households categorised as food secure based on single indicators (i.e., per capita calorie intake and FCS respectively) was unrealistic. Furthermore, findings from the bivariate probit model indicate that food insecurity incidences decreased with the adoption of soil and water conservation, access to irrigation, livestock, access to fertilisers, and household income. It increased with the age of the household head, the household size, and the coping strategy index. Therefore, policies and strategies combating food insecurity should consider a combination of food security indicators.",

This research is reviewed. Water values were found to differ significantly between sectors, between geographic areas and within geographic areas. As agriculture is a large consumer of water several studies along different rivers were undertaken, including studies on water quality. Average ratios indicate that agriculture is an inefficient user of water in terms of gross income generated per unit of water and also in terms of jobs created per unit of water. Irrigation farming is, however, an important employer of labour while it contributes 30% to the value of farm output. A marginal approach and water demand elasticities also indicate that non-agriculture generally places a high value on water assurance but little value on more than what it already uses. This may indicate that although water is expected to transfer out of agriculture in the longer run, in the short run agriculture may be its best use. Water efficiency could be significantly enhanced if transfers within and between river reaches are promoted, as water shadow prices differ. Inputs from the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) are important in water allocation due to socio-economic and environmental externalities of water allocation.",

Recent studies have shown that improvement in market access increases agricultural productivity, firstly by facilitating specialisation and exchange transactions in rural areas, and secondly through intensification of input use. The extent to which specialisation and intensification contribute to agricultural productivity, and how this increase is distributed across farmers of different farm sizes and resources, will be presented in this paper. The output generated from a variance analysis is used to develop and estimate a three stage least square regression model. The model is used to assess the effects of market access on agricultural productivity, and the distribution of market-generated benefits among small and large farmers. Data collected from 100 farmers in Machakos District are used for the analysis. The results indicate that aggregate physical productivity increases with improvement in market access, but that there is a disparity in the distribution of market-generated efficiency gains between small and large farmers (large farmers benefit more than small farmers), and between farmers with different access options to markets—easy access farmers benefit more than farmers with difficult access.",

A measurement of the competitive performance of the South African wine industry—the WINE COMPETITIVENESS INDEX (WCI)—indicates that South Africa's wines are internationally highly competitive with a sustainable and increasing positive trend over recent years. The wine industry in South Africa also shows positive trends in competitiveness in the long run and it should not lose its competitiveness status in the near future if its dynamic ability to continue to trade is sustained. An analyse of the key success factors that established competitive advantage and constraints that impacted negatively on competitiveness of the wine industry through the—WINE EXECUTIVE SURVEY (WES)—indicates that for the present intense competition in the market, the production of affordable high quality products, stringent regulatory standards in the industry, efficient supporting industries, and the availability of internationally competitive local suppliers of primary inputs are the major success factors to the competitiveness of this industry. The major factors that impact negatively on the competitive success of this industry are the strong Rand, fluctuations in the exchange rate, trust in the political support system, competence of personnel in the public sector, crime, South Africa's labour policy and the growth and size of the local market. These factors should be crafted into a Strategic Plan for the industry.",

However, profitability and sustainability in the sector are constrained by low returns to investment due to a number of factors. The study investigates the factors influencing mainstream market participation among small-scale farmers in the five districts of the province. The main aim is to calculate the probability of small-scale farmers selling their livestock to more profitable mainstream markets, for example auction pens, against the odds of selling to informal speculators. A binary logistic regression model is applied to primary data collected from 60 sampled households in the districts of Kgalagadi, Pixley ka Seme, Frances Baard, Siyanda and Namakua. The partial effects of the conditional probability of selling livestock to mainstream markets and the impact of changes to the variables on the probability of selling to formal markets are estimated. The results show that farming experience, extension visits and infrastructure have a profoundly positive effect on the probability of small-scale farmers marketing their animals to the mainstream markets. On the other hand, household size, distance to the nearest market, and whether or not farmers have outstanding debts have a negative impact on the probability of them selling their animals to the formal markets. A unit increase in the farmer's debts, household size and distance to nearest market decreases the probability of profitable operation by 69.84%, 9.04% and 2.79% respectively. This result implies that an intervention policy is needed to alleviate these constraints that are impeding participation in the mainstream markets.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT ABSTRACT This paper analyses the effect of farmer characteristics, variety attributes and agro-ecological conditions on farmers' banana variety choice decisions in Uganda. A Multinomial Logit (MNL) model was used to estimate the determinants of variety choice. The results show that M9 was the most preferred hybrid variety, followed by M2 and M14. However, many of the respondents (39.4%) chose Mbwazirume, a local variety, as their most preferred variety. Good taste, large bunch size, soft food and good flavour were the most desirable attributes, while longer maturity period was a notable undesirable attribute. Results from the MNL analysis suggest that small land size, taste and regional location were negatively associated with variety choice, while perceptions that hybrid bananas could reduce food insecurity and tolerance to pests and diseases were positively associated with probabilities of variety choice. Probabilities of choosing hybrids for food security increase in favour of M2 (by 6.13%) and M9 (27.60%), and decrease by 23.05% for M2, 6.89% for M14 and 9.36% for M9 due to taste relative to Mbwazirume. Farmers' involvement in varietal improvement and development programmes is vital for meeting their preferences. Future breeding efforts should consider attributes such as bunch size, good taste, soft food and agronomic characteristics. Farmers with large land sizes should be targeted for on-farm promotional activities to increase the potential adoption and impact of the hybrids. After the hybrids are popularized and used by farmers, there will be a need for an impact study to evaluate their acceptability in terms of household food security and income.

    "abstract": "Food security is recognised as a multifaceted condition of complex causality, and given its broad definition, it is no surprise that food security eludes precise measurement. This study considers there to be three components of household food security (quantity, quality and stability), and attempts to address the \"concept-to-measurement\" gap in food security by building an index that spans these three dimensions. A panel data set from rural Zambia is used for descriptive analysis of food security indicators in 2001, 2004 and 2008. A multidimensional index of food security for rural Zambia is then developed using principal component analysis. We use this index to explore the spatial patterns of food security over time and to assess correlates of food security and impacts of climate shocks. Results indicate that both rainfall and temperature have a significant impact on a household's food security score, though not for each individual component of the index. The paper concludes with a discussion of the merits and shortcomings of developing a composite food security index.",

The reason for the focus on maize and pigeonpea is because these products are key crops that contribute to household production, consumption and cash income in the study zones. A Multinomial Logit Analysis of a multistage sample of 562 smallholder farmers, who market maize and pigeonpea, showed that transaction costs, household wealth, access to credit and extension services, and social capital affect their choice of marketing channel. This outcome suggests that policies aimed at reducing transaction costs, improving access to productive assets, prudent use of credit, and promoting the use of well-organised farmer groups to access appropriate technology and information could enhance market access and better integrate smallholder farmers into markets in the study areas.",

    "abstract": "In the literature, there are limited studies on how socio-psychological factors affect farmers' attitudes towards risks. Therefore, this paper looks into this issue in Ethiopia for better understanding of how socio-psychological issues influence farmers' risk attitudes. The study uses data from a cross-sectional survey and a generalised ordered logistic regression is used to analyse the data. The findings show that farmers perceive natural hazards, input and output price volatility, technological risks, financial shocks and human security as the main sources of risks for agricultural production and livelihoods. Farmers' risk attitudes were assessed dividing them into three categories from more to less risk averse. Education, relational capital, attitudes, group membership, technical training and household sise were found to be the factors influencing farmers' risk attitudes. Farmers who can read and write, who have strong social capital and who have received training are less risk averse. Finally, this study confirms the importance of positive attitudes, strong social capital (group membership and relational capital) and satisfactory competence to motivate farmers to take risks related to technological innovations and others in the agricultural production. Therefore, attention should be given to specific initiatives to enhance their awareness, build their adaptive capacity to shocks and hazards, provide timely and up-to-date information, and improve their skills and knowledge. These issues would help to avert the risk aversion of smallholder farmers, who are usually thought to be risk-averse in low-income economies and to stimulate them to adopt sustainable agriculture and technological innovations, which are expected to improve agricultural production and enhance the tolerance of local systems for risks and shocks.",

Understanding the drivers of these contrasting effects, and the prevailing one, would allow one to draw important conclusions.We review, through a meta-analytical approach, a set of empirical studies that quantify the effects of NTMs on African agri-food trade. We find a prevalence of the trade-impeding effects. Our results also help explaining differences in NTMs' effects due to methodological and structural heterogeneity. Moreover, the effects of NTMs vary across the types of NTMs and analysed commodities.We conclude by comparing our findings with existing literature and emphasise which research areas deserve further investigation, such as intra-Africa trade or trade effects of technical NTMs.",

Data on household socio-demographic characteristics; knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and practices on OFSP production and nutrition were fitted to a Heckman bivariate probit model with sample selection to empirically assess the determinants of sequential adoption and dis-adoption decisions. The results showed that adoption and dis-adoption of OFSP is significantly influenced by a combination of farmers' socio-economic characteristics (age, gender, nutrition knowledge, education, access to planting material), consumption (taste, dry matter content) and agronomic (yield, early maturity, drought tolerance) traits. However, the agronomic traits and access to planting material are particularly key for the retention of OFSP varieties. These results suggest the need for breeding efforts to improve the agronomic traits of biofortified OFSP to match or better local non-biofortified varieties and establish seed delivery systems for sustainable adoption of biofortified OFSP.",

The study employs an endogenous switching regression (ESR) model that accounts for observed and unobserved factors to estimate the impact of CF. Further, the propensity score matching (PSM) model is used to check the robustness of ESR results. The results indicate that 162 farmers had contracts and French bean yields and incomes significantly increased with CF. Specifically, the empirical results reveal that CF leads to a gain of 17%, 34% and 37.5% in the yield, crop income and household income.

    "abstract": "Climate change poses a significant threat to the sustainability of agricultural production among smallholder farm households in Ethiopia. To reduce the adverse effects of climate risks, farm households have sought to adopt different adaptation strategies. This study investigates factors influencing farm households' choice of climate adaptation strategies and associated effects on their food security in Ethiopia using data collected from 516 farm households from three regions. A multivariate probit and propensity score matching models were used to analyze data. Major adaptation strategies adopted by the farm households in the study area are planting drought-tolerant crop varieties (60%), changing the planting dates (53%), growing diversified crops (49%), and diversifying the sources of household income (45%). Results suggest that older farm household heads are more likely to use drought-tolerant crop varieties to reduce climate risks. Farm households with larger farmland size and those with more years of experience in farming are more likely to use drought-tolerant crop varieties and crop diversification strategies. Farm households with larger family size are more likely to use crop and income diversification strategies and change the planting dates against the backdrop of a high risk of climatic shocks. Membership in input supply cooperatives, frequency of contact with extension agents, and access to information on expected rainfall and temperature are positively associated with different adaptation practices adopted by farm households. Farm households who have adopted climate adaptation strategies have higher food security status (by 2.3-2.8%) compared to those who have not. Thus, the farm households' climate adaptation practices have positive food security effects in Ethiopia.",

Utilising three-wave comprehensive panel data from rural Ethiopia, this paper offers valuable insights into the effect of maize productivity on rural household welfare. We use both fixed-effects and correlated random-effects IV estimators to account for unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity. Our findings reveal that increased maize productivity leads to higher household income, enhanced maize consumption, and greater asset ownership, ultimately reducing rural poverty. Notably, the welfare gains from maize productivity vary among farm households, with the most substantial effects observed among advantaged households, particularly those headed by male farmers and those with a more favourable economic standing in terms of poverty status. These results not only hold promise for poverty reduction through intensified agricultural practices in rural Ethiopia but also emphasise the necessity for targeted interventions to ensure equitable distribution of welfare benefits.",

The main factors that will help promote the competitiveness of SA farmers, and the agricultural sector in general, include good governance at all levels of government and industry, institutional innovations for commercial and small-scale farmers, improving the quality of (school) education (particularly in mathematics and science) and skills training, promoting research in agriculture, and farmers adopting new technologies. Government should focus its relatively scarce resources on providing physical infrastructure (especially improved transport and communication infrastructure) and legal infrastructure (secure property rights and contract enforcement) to reduce transaction costs, including risk, so that markets for products and resources work more efficiently; relax restrictive labour laws; reduce uncertainty regarding land claims, AgriBEE and the rural land tax; improve efficiency in disbursing LRAD grants to approved projects; reduce crime rates; and promote education, agricultural R&D and skills training.",

First, problems of private choice are contrasted with those encountered in collective choice. Second, the “market failure” rationale for government redistribution programs in agriculture is contrasted with “rent seeking”. Third, implications of information and incentive problems inherent in collective choice are explored. The subjective nature of cost is shown to be important in economic regulation, including cost of production as a basis for agricultural price supports. Finally, the results of the analysis are related to the work agenda of agricultural economists. The Robbinsian maximization approach is contrasted with radical subjectivism. If information about means and ends is assumed given, the economic problem becomes computational. The challenge is to develop economic analyses that provide more satisfactory explanations of human behavior in a world of uncertainty, where outcomes of plans differ from predictions. Economic efficiency studies traditionally have focused on outcomes of the market process. However, since costs and benefits are subjective, it is argued that efficiency is more appropriately judged by the process through which transactions are carried out than by the results. Insights from public choice theory and neo-Austrian economics are held to be important in improving the institutional framework in public policy analysis.",

Commercial land expropriated should be resettled on a private individual tenure basis by small scale farmers and not on a communal basis. Under a communal system the return (rent) on grazing land is zero while the return on arable land is low due to lack in permanent tenure. This explains idle arable land in KwaZulu in spite of population pressure. The rental value is the cost to the farmer for non usage of land if it can make a positive contribution. The market mechanism penalizes the commercial farmer for the non usage of commercial land. A land tax does not increase this cost and will thus not bring unproductive land into production. (The supply of land is not perfectly inelastic due to improvements). Taxes on agricultural land have certain advantages such as (a) avoidance less possible than income taxes(b) a wealth tax and (c) may better target to wealthy landowners who with the assistance of tax experts arc better able to avoid taxes. Disadvantages of land taxes are that administration cost may be high and the tax is the same in good and bad years.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wide, weather-induced fluctuations in maize production lead to recurrent food shortages in Zambia's maize consuming regions, while the cassava-growing regions of the north enjoy stable food production, even in drought years. Noting this striking correlation between drought vulnerability and the prevalence of maize as a staple food, a growing array of agencies in Zambia has begun introducing highly productive new cassava varieties, developed in the north, to more central and southerly regions in an effort to provide low-cost food security during drought years. Yet agro ecological conditions in these drought-prone regions differ significantly from the northern research stations where Zambian scientists developed the new cassava varieties. So it is not clear that the varieties or management practices that work well in the north will prove optimal in other regions. In order to assist farmers and agencies interested in expanding cassava as a food security crop in central Zambia, we have conducted cassava trials in central Zambia over the past three years. Concurrently, we have engaged in regular on-farm discussions with early adopting farmers. Results from these investigations suggest that, with some modification of management practices recommended in the north, many of the new cassava clones offer a feasible means of mitigating lean season hunger and providing low-cost, in-kind drought insurance for rural households in central Zambia.",

The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the structures and issues of raw commodity procurement in South African agribusiness supply chains. The results suggest that a wide range of institutions are employed to procure raw commodities for the South African agro-processing sector and that companies are increasingly moving away from the open market as a source of supply for raw commodities, and are utilising contractual arrangements instead. According to the main findings, 78.5% of the total volume of fruit and vegetables procured by agribusiness companies for processing is based on some form of contracting arrangement. The balance is procured through a combination of the open market, own estates, agents and imports. It is only in the case of potatoes, onions, beans and peanuts that a stronger reliance on the spot market is evident. South African retailers source 70% to 100% of their fresh produce directly from farmers (usually through growing programmes). The procurement of meat, poultry and eggs appears to favour vertical integration (and in some cases own production), medium- to long-term contracts and long-term informal supply arrangements with selected groups of farmers.

In South Africa, renewed interest in development-oriented cooperatives saw the introduction of a new Cooperatives Act in 2005, along with support measures dedicated to ‘emerging’ cooperatives. This paper contends that the architects of the new Act discounted important trends in international legislation that would have made development-oriented cooperatives more versatile and given their members better access to capital and expertise through equity partnerships with private agribusiness firms. It is concluded that the new Act should be amended to admit non-patron investors as members, and to allow for non-redeemable and hence appreciable and tradable shares. Such innovations are emerging internationally, usually with a cap on non-patron voting power.",

This paper uses the new institutional economics (NIE) to highlight problems created by the Act. Case studies were done of three producer groups in KwaZulu-Natal that formally registered as cooperatives after August 2005. It is clear that the cooperative model was adopted because it was seen as a precondition for government support. All of these cooperatives displayed symptoms of institutional problems and two of them had mitigated these problems by shedding their poorest members and creating their own rules to reward investors with capital gains. The first of these 'solutions' is not consistent with the objective of pro-poor economic development; the second is at odds with the new Act. It is recommended that the new Act should be amended so that cooperatives can at least issue tradable equity shares that offer benefits proportional to shareholding. In addition, it is recommended that the same level of start-up support should be made available to all producer groups that formally register their business, regardless of the business model chosen, and that member empowerment should be an essential requirement for registration and public funding.

Primary data were collected using a structured questionnaire from a representative sample of 300 rural households in Msinga, KwaZulu-Natal. The study used a logistic regression model to examine the effect of social capital on household poverty, testing the hypothesis that the possession of social capital reduces household poverty. The result of the logistic regression model indicated that, in addition to the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of some households, social capital endowments have a statistically significant negative effect on the probability of a household being poor. The study concluded that, among other factors, social capital is very important to reduce household poverty. Policy implications were discussed.",

Additional instruments, alongside CF, are implemented to overcome the challenges of CF and to adapt to the policy environment in which the different stakeholders operate. This paper develops a theoretical framework that gives insight into how these complex entities are structured and operate in a developing country context. This theoretical analysis takes a holistic approach by adopting elements of existing theories to form a new critical research paradigm: (i) Resource Dependence Theory to incorporate the wider operating environment in which the two cases operate, (ii) Transaction Cost Economics to explain the internal efficiency of the different models, and (iii) Agency Theory to account for the safeguard mechanisms. This new framework is then tested on two complex IBs that aim to integrate smallholder farmers into the commercial value chain, but which have each implemented a different institutional set-up developed around CF arrangements. It finds that a high dependence by the offtaker in the first case study stimulates a higher level of commitment and investment by this stakeholder in the contract arrangement. In turn, this increases the asset specificity aspect, which then requires safeguards to ensure the smallholders adhere to the contractual agreement. A higher dependency in this particular study also resulted in a higher number of smallholders being engaged in the contract, requiring mechanisms to efficiently monitor and coordinate them.",

However, the production and marketing challenges they faced inhibits the farmers from benefiting fully, which calls for relational transactions to enhance exchange efficiency. Therefore, this study aims to determine the nature of relationship constructs between vegetable farmers selling to formal and informal channels. Data elicited from 170 farmers were analysed using factor analysis, multiple regression analysis and discriminant analysis. Results revealed that farmers derived satisfaction from the price offered and communication, while trust was derived from satisfaction, communication and duration of the relationship, and commitment was derived from trust in both channels. The discriminant analysis results revealed that there is statistical significant difference between the channels. Farmers supplying formal markets perceived levels of satisfaction, trust, and commitment better than those supplying informal markets. The results also indicated that satisfaction and trust were the best predictors of the nature of the relationships. The lack of written contracts and low produce quantity purchased by the formal markets contributes to the low-level establishment of the farmer-buyer relationships. Therefore, coordinated supply chains and supplier-development approaches are necessary to complement the logistical requirements associated with fresh produce and to create mutual benefits.",

    "abstract": "Just more than one hundred years after the implementation of the 1913 Land Act, the subject of land reform and rural development are still at the forefront of public discourse within South Africa. Much of the literature suggests that post-apartheid interventions have not been successful at improving small-scale agriculture, which is seen as an important vehicle for improving rural food security. Nevertheless, data from the General Household Survey (GHS) indicate that household hunger levels have declined substantially in the post-2000 decade across the entire nation (as other estimates of household poverty have also indicated). In particular, this paper demonstrates that this trend has been more pronounced in the former homeland regions, eliminating the previously higher incidence of hunger there. Using linear probability models, this paper seeks to isolate which factors have led to the convergence of the homeland regions' household hunger levels and those of households residing in non-homeland parts of the country. The historical context that is sketched here highlights the severe challenges faced by farmers in former homeland areas; this raises the question how convergence in food security occurred, given that many agricultural interventions in rural areas (also in homelands) have not attained the success that was hoped for. In particular, the proportionately larger reliance on social grants in homelands regions accounts for a part of the faster reduction in hunger levels there. Communal gardens and connections to the agricultural market have also reduced hunger within former homelands regions. The long-term sustainability of grants in bolstering food security is of concern, highlighting the need for greater market integration of small-scale farmers in homeland regions.",

For different African agri-food exporters, the compliance with NTMs has varied impacts. For relatively comprehensive exporters, NTMs are helpful in upgrading their food production, increasing agricultural input and promoting sustainable development. For countries with relatively less diversified crops, however, such compliance has huge negative effects such as rise in trading costs and reduction in exporting profits. In an attempt to address the above-mentioned issue using the VARMA(X) model and intervention analysis, this paper first examines agri-food trade records between African countries and analyses NTMs, which reveals the mechanisms of NTMs. Second, defining impacts of NTMs as the difference between the estimated agri-food trades' volumes between African countries from 1996 to 2013 without NTMs and the actual volumes, the paper shows that NTMs have in fact led to a significant reduction in agri-food trade volume in Africa. Finally, based on these empirical econometrical results, the authors suggest possible solutions, including strengthening external assistance, improving trade liberalisation and accelerating economic integration.",

    "abstract": "The prices of agricultural grain commodities are known to be volatile due to several factors that influence these prices. Moreover, different combinations of these factors, such as demand, supply and macroeconomic indicators are responsible for the price volatility at different times. Big Data presents opportunities to collect and integrate datasets from several sources for the purpose of discovering useful patterns and extracting actionable insights that can be used to gain competitive advantage or improve decision making. Neural Networks presents research opportunities for training computer algorithms to model linear and non-linear patterns that might exist in datasets for the purpose of extracting actionable insights such as making predictions. This article proposes a Big Data and Neural Networks approach for predicting prices of grain commodities in South Africa. It was identified that disparate data that influence the grain commodities market can be acquired, integrated and analysed in real-time to predict future prices of grain commodities. By utilising SAP HANA as the enabling Big Data technology, data acquired from several sources was used to create an integrated dataset, and a predictive model was developed using Backpropagation Neural Network algorithms. This model was used to predict the daily spot prices of white maize on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) at the end of each trading day. The initial results indicate that the approach can be scientifically used to predict future prices of grain commodities in a real-time environment.",

We measured COVID-19 effect using a news-based sentiment index. A robust nonparametric Granger causality-in-quantiles test is used to test the effect of the COVID-19 sentiment on agricultural commodity prices and price volatility. We find significant Granger causality from the news-based COVID-19 sentiment to mean of the agricultural commodity prices in the lower and upper ranges of the quantiles. Moreover, findings show that the COVID-19 sentiment is also causal for variance of agricultural commodity prices, but only above the quantile ranges above the first quarter. Thus, COVID-19 is causal for large volatility changes in agricultural commodity prices. Accordingly, the extremely negative sentiment associated with COVID-19 has not only caused a price crash in agricultural markets, but also significantly increased market risk. Policymakers should be wary of the risks and vulnerabilities of agricultural commodities to extreme events, as well as the ramifications for producers and consumers throughout the economy.",

However, the gain from agriculture disproportionately trickles down to the poor which can be partly reduced by addressing gender differences in production. Historically, the validity of gender statistics has been questioned as the way researchers and policymakers describe gender differences also affects how they perceive and address them. Amid these antecedents, we apply a meta-stochastic frontier to pooled cross-sectional population-based surveys that represent three decades (1987–2017) of the production history for twelve crops in Ghana to assess the dynamics of gender gaps in technology gaps and technical efficiency (TE). Results indicate that female farmers exhibit technology gap and TE scores of 25 and 76% while their male counterparts exhibit scores of 20 and 73%. The TE gap of 4% against male farmers has remained relatively steady over the three decades while the technology adoption gap against females has reduced from 18% in 1997/98 to 3% in 2016/17. All farmers operate at 60% of the potential possible given the overall crop production technology in Ghana. Over the three decades, the estimated crop production gap of 5.94% against females shifted to a gap estimated at 9.24% against males.",

The youth are increasingly disinterested in agriculture and often view it as a last resort in the absence of alternative employment opportunities. This paper explores strategies to change these negative perceptions and attract young people to agriculture. Drawing on twenty-two studies conducted over the past decade, national grade 12 statistics, University enrolments, yearbook reviews, and twenty job advertisements, I identify five key areas for intervention. First, the youth interested in agripreneurship need support to access financial and physical resources. They also need training offered jointly by tertiary institutions and the government. Second, agricultural education in primary and secondary schools will likely attract and retain youths to agriculture. Third, we need to reform the education system at all levels to ensure holistic student development opportunities, including the technical and soft skills required by agricultural sector employers. Fourth, our marketing strategies need reform; collaboration with the media is necessary to increase awareness and change youths' perceptions about agriculture and agricultural careers. Five, we need to strengthen the role of agricultural associations to bridge the gap between the agricultural sector and secondary and tertiary education institutions.",

Despite this, there is evidence of a lack of technical and managerial knowledge among emerging sugarcane farmers who are beneficiaries of South Africa's land reform programme, thus, limiting their full potential in terms of innovation and productivity which is detrimental to their competitiveness. This paper employs the Crépon, Duguet, and Mairesse (CDM) approach, correcting for endogeneity problems, to estimate the causal impact of on-the-job training expenditure, used as a proxy for human capital development, on innovation, and innovation on farm productivity. It is based on a case study of 35 emerging sugarcane farmers in the KwaZulu-Natal north coast, South Africa. The results from the CDM model confirm the causal relationships between human capital (on-the-job training) and the innovation behaviour of the farmers, which positively impact the farm's productivity. This result underscores the relevance of human capital development in boosting innovation and productivity in the agricultural sector.",

The primary objective of the study was to the determine whether South Africa, with 75% of its exports destined for Europe, will be negatively affected by changes in Peru and Chile's export orientation. This question is addressed by breaking it down into four key factors. The first is the role of policy by applying Anderson et al.'s (2006) empirical framework of nominal rate of assistance (NRA) followed by measures of competitiveness, namely relative trade advantage (RTA), normalised revealed comparative advantage (NRCA) and the logarithmic relative export advantage (InRXA). The last two measures – indirect freight cost and trade barriers - zoom in on trade from one country to a specific destination. The results and discussion highlight that Peru, operating in close to a zero-distorted environment, has the potential to increase its competitiveness in the global table grape market. Whilst South Africa's table grape exporters also have this potential, given the advantages of a depreciating rand, broader and more favourable market access outside the EU and UK is paramount.",

Two-thirds of the participants bought cooked pork from the informal street markets because of affordability (36%), convenience (34%), and price (41%). Most consumers preferred grilled (87%), well done (68%) and bone-in (57%) meat of moderate lean thickness (48%). Cut type (33% of consumers) and taste (52%) were the most important pork quality indicators. Prior to purchasing pork, 70% of consumers performed a safety assessment, mostly based on pork appearance (40%). Two-thirds of consumers indicated their willingness to pay more for safe pork. Marginal effects from logistic regression showed that the likelihood of consumers to assess pork safety was positively influenced (P ≤ 0.05) by gender and education level, while the source of income, income class, and education level positively influenced (P ≤ 0.05) consumers' willingness to pay more for safe pork. Findings suggest that policy and development interventions by the government and municipalities to match quality attributes of pork to the preferences of consumers in the informal urban street markets should target specific sub-groups of the population, particularly females, low-income earners and the less educated.",

In this framework, the ability of an economy to supply an adequate supply of food to a growing population can be related to the existence of a steady state. This property is used to define a simple analytical criterion upon which to assess the long-term food situation of a closed economy. This sustainability condition relates all the dynamic parameters of the economy: rates of technological change in the two sectors, rate of population growth and rate of land degradation. The condition is used to highlight the technological characteristics in agriculture conducive to sustainability and to assess empirically the food situation of a number of countries. Although no global food crisis appears to be looming ahead, the data suggest that sub-Saharan Africa is likely to increase its food dependence in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper quantifies the responsiveness of producers of teff, wheat, maize and sorghum to incentives using an error-correction model (ECM). It is found that planned supply of these crops is positively affected by own price, negatively by prices of substitute crops and variously by structural breaks related to policy changes and the occurrence of natural calamities. It has found significant long-run price elasticities for all crop types and insignificant short-run price elasticities for all crops but maize. Higher and significant long-run price elasticities as compared to lower and insignificant short-run price elasticities are attributable to various factors, namely structural constraints, the theory of supply and the conviction that farmers respond when they are certain that price changes are permanent. The paper concludes that farmers do respond to incentive changes. Thus attempts, which directly or indirectly tax agriculture with the belief that the sector is non-responsive to incentives, harm its growth and its contribution to growth in other sectors of the economy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Farmworker equity-share schemes were initiated in the Western Cape region of South Africa in the early 1990's as a method of redistributing farm assets to land reform beneficiaries while maintaining the viability of commercial farming operations. This study set out to identify the institutional characteristics of successful farmworker equity-share schemes in South Africa and to discern a set of best institutional practices that will likely promote the success of future equity-share schemes. A detailed study of nine land reform projects intended to empower previously disadvantaged farmworkers was undertaken in the Western Cape during November 2001 to explore relationships between their institutional arrangements, worker empowerment, management quality and performance. Cluster analysis of variables measuring these four constructs revealed positive relationships between sound institutional arrangements, competent management, effective worker empowerment and good performance. Best institutional practices identified by the analysis suggest that farmworker equity-share schemes should be operated as (or like) a company with voting and benefit rights proportional to individual shareholdings, but with restrictions on certain share transactions to prevent free-riding by non-workers and the loss of creditworthiness through sudden outflows of equity and managerial expertise. However, this positive relationship between best institutional practices and enterprise performance is dependent on effective worker empowerment (e.g. skills transfer and gender representation), good governance (e.g. external auditing) and competent management (e.g. schemes to reward worker performance and to resolve disputes).",

Most vegetables are cultivated in mixed-cropping types of farming systems. The technical efficiency of vegetable based cropping systems was estimated in order to identify the potential increase in production without incurring additional costs. The factors affecting technical efficiency and constraints and potential of the cropping system were also investigated. A field survey was conducted covering 120 vegetable farmers in the irrigated Tugela Ferry scheme and dryland farming sector in Msinga district during October to December 2003. According to a stochastic frontier production function using a Cobb-Douglas model, hired labour, organic fertilizer, inorganic fertilizer, area harvested and soil fertility maintenance cost showed significant positive effects on vegetable production. The mean technical efficiency of the vegetable based cropping systems was 84.32%. According to the inefficiency model the efficiency increased significantly as a result of farm visits by extension officers, participation in farmer training, less sloping lands, more experience, and higher diversity of the vegetable system. Technical efficiency decreased, however, with higher education level of the farmer and with higher off-farm income. Farm income is low due to low productivity, market constraints, lack of technology, and institutionally related constraints. Environmental conditions in the Msinga district are such that a high value crops can be grown with an adequate supply of irrigation water. There is a good possibility for stepping up production of these crops in marginal lands through appropriate crop diversification.",

A sample of 374 households was surveyed and a Tobit model was applied to explain household preferences for quality and quantity of domestic water supply and derive estimates of WTP for such a service. The results confirm that household income had a positive and statistically significant impact on WTP for both quality and quantity. Distance to the water source is positively associated with WTP regardless of the location (rural or urban) and of the household head's age, education, and gender. Current water consumption was also statistically significant for WTP for improved quantity, but with a negative sign, implying that the more a household consumes water, the less that household is WTP to have improved water quantity. Conversely, the same household would be WTP for improved water quality. Rural households showed a much higher WTP for improved water provision services than urban households. There is therefore scope to improve water service levels in Swaziland even at a higher water price. More precisely, the estimates of WTP obtained in this study indicate the possibility of introducing a demand-driven program to expand the coverage of rural tap water schemes.",

The results revealed that the more stringent Prochloraz MRLs indeed have an impact on avocado exports to the EU. The simulation results show that the revenue foregone due to the more stringent Prochloraz MRLs is US$15.27 million. In relative terms this is significant, and should the Prochloraz MRLs be relaxed to the CODEX levels the contribution of the avocado industry to the gross domestic value of agricultural products would increase significantly. Furthermore, several studies have revealed the potentially negative impacts of abnormal levels of Prochloraz. The question arises why there are anomalies in the application of Prochloraz MRLs between countries and whether the CODEX MRL already account for these negative impacts. In depth analysis should be done with respect to the anomalies prevailing for Prochloraz MRLs to provide a proper scientific basis for applying them. Other recommendations are that much more attention should be given to the development of the national market for avocados and that other markets than the EU market should be explored for exports.",

The sample was separated into a high wage paying North Coast and lower wage paying South Coast. Typically farmers were unable to distinguish between the impact of the Sectoral Determination and other labour laws. Results indicate that the impact of the legislation is similar in each region. No respondents reported mass retrenchment, but job shedding is disguised by not replacing workers (especially unskilled workers) that leave the farm. A sizeable number of growers (17 per cent on the South Coast and 44 per cent on the North Coast) have reduced the working week to 27 hours (or 36 hours in the Felixton Mill Group Area) enabling them to pay wages on an hourly, rather than a weekly basis. This strategy reduces the effective wage. About 40 per cent of growers have reduced the in-kind benefits to their workers. About half of respondents indicated that they are likely to increase their use of seasonal and contract labour in future. Although a majority of respondents indicated that they considered mechanisation of the harvesting process, cost and topographical factors currently does not make this a serious alternative to manual harvesting. However, because of increased wage costs and the relatively strong currency in recent years, chemical weed control has become an attractive alternative to manual weed control.",

Based on the results, the use of forward pricing is associated with lower levels of risk aversion and higher levels of human capital. Factor analysis is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the personal reasons which help to interpret the underlying, common factor of the personal reasons why farmers are reluctant to use forward pricing methods. Three factors were extracted and were labelled \"Lack of capacity\", \"Distrust of the market\", and \"Bad experiences\". The results from the factor analysis confirm the finding that farmers need higher levels of human capital to use forward pricing methods and that farmers do not believe that the forward pricing market is effective. Education should furthermore, focus more on the practical application of alternative forward pricing methods and not purely on the benefits of the use of forward pricing methods.",

While most retailers' food quality positioning is in line with consumer trends, based on conventional price-orientated strategies, the retail sector has been entering and driving quality related niche markets and is even proactively re-establishing the demand for products, such as in the case of Karoo lamb. As illustrated by the organic case, alternative quality trends provide an opportunity for value addition that could potentially lead to considerable price premiums and growth. This potential has, however, been left largely untapped by local suppliers. The article shows that the main vehicle for the institutionalisation of quality in South Africa has been the establishment of new certification schemes which are largely driven by the dominant retail sector. This sector captures most of the consumer purchasing power and sets the rules governing the system. Based on this analysis, the article then explores the implications of new food quality trends and the dominant role of the retail sector in small-scale farmers' market access.",

Variables capturing transaction costs are used in the analysis and these relate to searching for a trading partner, gathering information about the transaction, contracting, negotiating, monitoring and enforcing of contracts. The findings reveal that collective action, gender of household head, degree of dependence on the crop, geographical location and access to price information significantly affect the choice of selling point.

Based on food security needs and the central role of agriculture, Africa may stand to benefit from green biotechnology given the low agricultural productivity and the looming food crises in most urban areas. However, the adoption of GM crops in Africa has been slow and limited to a handful of countries. The primary objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of GM maize adoption in South Africa by looking at wholesale spot prices. We apply a threshold autoregressive model to time series data on the price of maize and GM adoption rates in South Africa to address the following questions: (1) Does the adoption of GM maize excite the growth rate of price of maize in South Africa; (2) Does the error variance of the maize price growth rate exhibit regime-switching behaviour to impact the volatility? The results show evidence that the adoption of GM maize influences the dynamics of the maize price growth rate in South Africa. Further, there is strong evidence that the error variance exhibits regime-switching behaviour with the posterior mean for the error variance in the first regime about twice as large as that of the second regime.",

This article utilised data from a survey of 223 small farming households in the Eastern Cape province, one of the poorest agrarian provinces in South Africa, to explore the exposure of smallholder farmers to climate change, their adaptive capacity and their vulnerability to climate shock across major agro-ecological zones. Data on the production of main staple foods, household assets and access to institutional facilities were analysed by means of principal component analysis. General circulation model scenarios were used with a crop model (EPIC) to explore the impact of future plausible climate patterns on farmers' income. Farmers in the Karoo zone are currently the most vulnerable to climate variability. A scenario analysis also showed that maize production in the Eastern Cape will be positively affected by climate change under both low-input and irrigated management systems, whereas potato yield will decrease. It is projected that smallholder farmers who significantly rely on maize can expect an increase of up to 45 per cent revenue by 2050 under the UKMO-HADGEM1 climate scenario if the average estimated future yields materialise. Both institutional and infrastructural support in the form of access to credit and irrigation facilities are recommended for adequate adaptation to future climate change impact, in particular climate volatility, which was not taken into account in our yield projections.",

This study also captures all secular and cyclical movements with the aid of rolling window analysis to ensure the robustness of the estimations. Empirical analyses are constructed based on monthly realised frequency data from 2006M1 to 2016M7. The empirical analysis from the full sample size shows that rice, sorghum, price inflation, a nominal effective exchange rate and oil price display weak pass-through among the investigated variables while banana, cocoa, groundnut, maize, soybean and wheat are net transmitters of spillover. Based on these revelations, several policy prescriptions for the agricultural commodity markets and their diverse responses to either exchange rate fluctuations or a dwindling oil price are suggested for Nigeria.",

The National Development Plan identifies the intended beneficiaries and states how they should be selected, but implementation of the plan is haphazard. A 2019 report by the Presidency's Land Reform and Agriculture Advisory Panel recommends that the beneficiary selection process be clear and transparent. In this paper, we respond to the report and expand on a proposal in the 2020 draft Beneficiary Selection Policy. Our study is based on a review of the relevant policies and the literature on beneficiary selection, and a profile of 833 potential land redistribution beneficiaries randomly selected from three provinces in South Africa. We highlight the flaws in the existing selection methods. Building on the suggestion of Vink and Kirsten (2019) of a tender or job application process, we suggest improvements we suggest improvements that could reduce inefficiencies and make the selection process inclusive and transparent.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that improving livestock productivity has the potential to boost food security, income, and employment for rural communities. While the technical efficiency of the livestock sector has been extensively studied in both developing and developed countries, few studies have analysed total factor productivity (TFP) and its components (technical change, technical, scale, and mix efficiency changes). To fill this gap this study specifically analyses the TFP growth of 26 beef cattle producing districts in Botswana using the Färe-Primont index. This index does not only allow us to understand how TFP varies amongst the districts but also how it has changed over time (between 2007 and 2014) as well as examining what has been driving that change. We also employ a feasible generalised least squares estimator for panel data to identify sources of productivity and efficiency growth. Results show that livestock TFP increased during the study period, and that this was driven by technological change, whilst efficiency change (TFPE) decreased. Further, we found that the decline in scale-and mix efficiency change (OSME) was largely responsible for the slowdown of TFPE, with a relatively smaller decline in technical efficiency change (OTE) also contributing. Districts with foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks and restricted access to export markets had lower TFP growth whilst proximity to livestock advisory centres (LAC), off-farm income, education and herd size were shown to enhance productivity and efficiency growth.",

The highest growth rates were experienced since the 2000s due to technical progress. Regression analysis indicates that mechanisation, research and development, weather conditions, and population pressure influence African agricultural productivity.

Net returns and risk, defined as the cumulative sum of shortfalls below a disaster target level of net return, were estimated for two long term crop rotation trials. One was conducted in the eastern Free State where maize and wheat in monoculture were compared with rotations involving fallow, drybean, soybean and sunflower crops. In the second trial located in the north western Free State monocropped maize was compared with rotations involving groundnut, soyabean and sunflower crops. Crop rotation and the associated diversification produced results varying from increased to reduced net returns and increased risk to dramatically reduced risk depending on crops involved and the net return level accepted as a disaster threshold. Compared to monoculture, groundnut improved net returns without affecting risk. Drybean and soybean improved net returns and reduced risk while sunflower was the most effective in reducing risk with little effect on the net return. Risk reduction in the eastern Free State was mainly due to rotational benefits such as improved yields. In the north western Free State, however, risk reduction was mainly due to the inclusion of crops with relatively low risk.",

The results show that strong energizer behaviours (such as current and planned business expansion and staff training), more business experience, and family assistance to become an entrepreneur, promote loan repayment, while lack of access to electricity (proxy for lack of access to services) negatively affects loan repayment. Policymakers and public and private financial institutions could give more attention to these factors when implementing policies to promote access to finance by, and the growth of, agribusiness SMMEs.",

Descriptive statistics involving cross tabulation were used to determine the impact of trust on the performance of the cane growers, which in turn has an influence on the performance of the whole sugar chain. The results indicate that farmers who have trust in the millers perform better than those without trust, and hence they contribute to the performance of the whole chain, in terms of more and good quality sugarcane supplied to the mill. This implies more sugar production and increased income to the industry as a whole. The results imply that a relationship founded on trust and mutual respect is more likely to succeed than a relationship of convenience supported by legal contingencies. Therefore, there is a need for honesty, fairness and absence of opportunistic behaviour between millers and cane growers for the industry to improve its performance.",

Thus, understanding the factors that influence agricultural prices is fundamental for sustainable growth in this sector and the rest of the economy. This paper investigates the short- and long-run impacts of monetary policy changes on relative agricultural prices in South Africa by employing Johansen cointegration analysis and the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) respectively. The results of Johansen cointegration analysis reject the long-run money neutrality hypothesis which suggests that the rate of increase in prices is not unit proportional to the rate of increase in money supply. On the other hand, the results of the dynamic relationships provide evidence of agricultural prices being overshot. Therefore, when a monetary shock occurs, the agriculture sector will have to bear the burden of adjustment, increasing farmers' financial vulnerability. Consumers also have to absorb short-run price volatility and overshooting of prices which in turn impacts on their ability to manage their cashflow optimally; this could be a substantial challenge in poor households. Due to the linkages between monetary policy variables and relative agricultural prices, it is recommended that agricultural policy makers and monetary authorities work closely in designing and implementing monetary policy in the country. This is important because monetary policies meant to stabilize the economy may have less desirable impacts on farmers and consumers, especially in the short run.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper argues that within the range of complementary activities necessary to secure the food security of marginalised groups in South Africa in places such as Greater Sekhukhune, the aspect of agricultural production is often neglected. A comprehensive approach to food security should focus on exploiting opportunities around increasing local food availability through production, as well as stimulating food accessibility by, for example, supporting small enterprises through micro-credit, and supporting food utilisation through education. In this way a range of options is created that vulnerable people can adopt to promote their livelihoods beyond survivalist strategies. This paper explores the issue of agricultural production within Greater Sekhukhune to provide insights into the challenges facing a comprehensive food security strategy that would guarantee food supply through a range of interventions. The study in the Greater Sekhukhune District in Limpopo Province was conducted through two sets of household surveys (2004 and 2006) and the responses to the agricultural production part of these surveys are discussed. Marked changes from 2004 to 2006 were observed. For “agrarian reform” to be a success, the necessary institutional framework needs to be in place to enable a broad range of services from government and non-governmental actors. The facilitation of such “joined up government”, although in existence in theory, requires concerted political will to become a reality.",

Descriptive statistics provide demographical information of buyers, their reasons for purchasing farms and the importance of specific characteristics of agricultural properties considered in such purchases. Analyses of variance convey more information regarding the different characteristics of agricultural properties considered by agricultural and lifestyle buyers. Survey results indicated that farm purchases for alternative purposes were substantial: more than half of all transactions in both the intensive and extensive area were for lifestyle reasons. Lifestyle buyers mostly rely on income from outside the agricultural sector for their livelihoods and financing of purchased properties, therefore they could focus on characteristics of farms unrelated to commercial agricultural production in their decision to buy agricultural properties. Characteristics such as the recreational opportunities provided by the property and its aesthetic beauty, including natural scenery, beautiful views and locations within a valley and set against a mountain, appealed to these buyers.",

The lack of empirical evidence has often resulted in premature negative conclusions about the impact of food aid on Swaziland's maize industry.

Variables used in the statistical analysis included quantity of cereal food aid; quantity of commercial maize imports; quantity of locally produced maize; official maize producer price; open market maize producer price; fertilizer price; fuel price; rainfall; and total area planted to maize. The impact of food aid was measured using the reduced form market equilibrium model consisting of maize quantity and maize producer price functions, estimated simultaneously through the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method. Analytical results revealed that food aid received by Swaziland does not lower prices of domestic maize and has no significant negative effect on the quantity of maize produced in subsequent seasons.

    "abstract": "Abstract Farm surveys in Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique were carried out to assess the determinants of fertiliser use given continued low yields, low organic matter and general poor soil health in southern African soils. Regression modelling showed that fertiliser use was influenced by household and farm characteristics. In addition, it was also influenced by social and human capital and farmers' perceptions of the effect of fertilisers on soil fertility. Farmers who perceived fertilisers as bad for their soil were less likely to adopt their use. This is a key result, as the emerging discussions on a green revolution for Africa, as well as the continued food crisis discussion, are prompting increased fertiliser use as an immediate intervention for increasing nutrient inputs into agriculture in the developing world. Increased policy efforts should be placed not only on increasing access to fertilisers but also on evolving farmers' perceptions and attitudes towards fertiliser use.",

Fortification of food is viewed as a means of overcoming some of the problems associated with poor nutrition. This study analyses the market for fortified cereal foods in Botswana. The specific objectives of the study are to: (1) determine the importance of various product attributes of cereal products in influencing the purchasing decision of consumers in Botswana, (2) assess the willingness of consumers in Botswana to pay for fortified cereal foods, and (3) develop recommendations to guide private strategy and public policy for fortification in Botswana. The study is based on primary data collected from 452 consumers in Gaborone and the south-east administrative districts using a clustered sampling approach. Results show that, for consumers, the most important attributes, listed in order of importance, were product brand, product quality, price, colour/appearance and nutritional value. Consumers knew little about fortified foods. There is a close correlation between residential area and knowledge about fortified foods, with rural residents having the least knowledge. Willingness to pay for fortified milled products was very low among consumers owing to limited knowledge about fortification and its benefits. The segment-target-position (STP) framework is used to develop strategic recommendations for a market-led fortification programme.",

The contribution of livelihood activities to household income, level of livelihood diversity and the relationship between livelihood diversification and adaptation to flood variability was determined. Data from a survey of 623 households in five villages, focus group discussions and key informant interviews confirmed livelihood diversification as an important strategy for household adaptation to flood variability in the Delta. However, the household income portfolio was dominated by public transfers, underscoring the weak socio-economic status of the households and the effects of multiple shocks over and above flood variability. The study concludes that livelihood diversification and other household adaptive strategies may be sufficient for current flood variations, but may be inadequate for dealing with global climate variability and change in future.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study compares a life cycle assessment (LCA) of pork production in the Western Cape with pork production in Flanders. The objectives of this study were to map and quantify the environmental impacts of producing pork in the Western Cape and exporting it to Antwerp in Flanders with the environmental impacts of producing pork in Flanders and delivering it to the same location. The impact categories included are (i) global warming potential (GWP), (ii) eutrophication potential, (iii) acidification potential, and (iv) energy use. By pointing out weak points in the different environmental impact categories, suggestions are made to lower the environmental burdens of pork production. Four main activities of the pork production chain were covered by the LCA, namely: (i) the feed provision activity, which includes the production of raw materials and feed, (ii) the pig farming activity, (iii) the slaughter house activity and (iv) the slurry (treatment) activity. An additional (v) pork shipping activity was added in the case of the Western Cape pork chain. A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment was carried out, with a functional unit (FU) of one kg of Western Cape or Flemish pork (carcass weight) delivered to the distribution centre in Antwerp. Flemish GWP, eutrophication potential, acidification potential and energy use are 56%, 65%, 62% and 59% respectively of the Western Cape equivalents. The exporting of pork accounts for less than 8% of environmental impacts in all impact categories. Potential exists in the Western Cape to compete on an environmental par when impacts are measured in terms of a per-area unit. It is therefore recommended that for future comparative South African-European LCA studies of pork or other intensive livestock or poultry production chains, an FU of one kg meat as well as an area unit be used when measuring total eutrophication and acidification impacts.

Fine wine can regularly fetch bottle prices that exceed several thousand dollars. It can be stored a long time and may increase in value with age. Fine wine quality and prices are extraordinarily sensitive to fluctuations in the weather of the year in which the grapes were grown. Wine is an experience good: that is, consumers often rely on \"expert opinion\" regarding quality and maturation prospects. This article describes the emergence and the unparalleled rise of wine economics since the 1980s to the present time and sheds light on its three main topics: finance, climate change and the role of expert opinion.

Through a household survey supplemented by informal interviews, this study attempts to understand the dynamics of livestock predation by carnivores at village level in Botswana. The study reveals that farmers perceive hyenas and lions to cause more livestock losses than other predators. In order to reduce predation, attempts should be made to put livestock in enclosures at night and also to herd them during the day. These practices comply with the conditions of the new government compensation policy for livestock losses caused by carnivores. The study recommends a review of the compensation rates and suggests that they should be closer to the market value. Such changes, accompanied by strict animal husbandry practices, may bring about the increased willingness of households to co-exist with predators.

We find evidence of diversification into high value crops farming, fertiliser intensification and milk market participation in areas experiencing improved roads.

This article sets out to develop a measure for resilience to provide a concise tool for measuring and monitoring food security in comparative ways across countries. It presents the results of the development of a resilience score tested using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) household data for five African countries from two different time periods per country. Cluster analysis was used to classify households into socio-economic groups. The first index used Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CATPCA) and the second a simple sum of assets. Both indices were able to detect changes in household socio-economic status over the data periods in all five countries. However, the results for the two indices were not always consistent. The simple sum method results matched the published national Millennium Development Goal data more closely than the Categorical Principal Component Analysis method. The simple sum of assets has potential as an impact indictor for development programmes aimed at improving household food security and as a national to Millennium Development Goal indicator. It provides a simple tool for tracking resilience from data that is routinely collected through multiple in-country surveys and available from national statistics.",

An input oriented variable returns to scale frontier identified twelve efficient firms, and nine more that are technically efficient but not scale efficient. The top third's overall efficiency score was 0.999. For the bottom third, the average efficiency score was just 0.346, which indicates that there is substantial room for improvement among bottom third producers in this production system. Overall, efficiency was correlated with stocking density, flock size, unit production cost and profitability, cumulative family experience of farming and the use of family labour, but not with farm size, breed choice or any proxy for individual experience or ability. Predation rates in particular were uncorrelated with productivity scores and reproductive performance was only weakly correlated with it. While most farms could theoretically improve their efficiency by intensifying their operations, a closer analysis of best practice firms revealed a spectrum of optimal intensities, including the possibility of restoring rangelands by deliberate understocking. Grazing strategy and the degree of labour self-sufficiency emerged as the key determinants of optimal intensity.",

Second, the Heckman two-step procedure was employed to investigate the effect of trust on milk market participation. The result from the Tobit model indicates that trust is an important factor influencing the intensity of milk marketing through the cooperatives. The following implications are worthy of consideration for improving farmers' trust and thereby market participation: improving the competency of the management, communicating and sharing of information, and democratic election of the management.",

Farmers' production decisions regarding maize and their response to policy incentives are critical for national food security and regional trade. The aim of the study was to estimate the supply response of the South African maize sector to price and non-price incentives. A Nerlovian partial adjustment model was applied to historical time series data of area under maize cultivation, measured in hectares spanning from 1980-2012 to determine the supply response. Results indicate a short-run price elasticity of 0.24 and a long-run price elasticity of 0.36, signifying that maize farmers are less sensitive to price changes than non-price incentives. The results confirm that non-price incentives such as rainfall and technology seem to have more effect on maize supply than price incentives in South Africa. Given the findings, the study recommends policies and programmes that focus more on non- price incentives, such as technology and infrastructure development, investment in irrigation and research services, as a means of stabilising maize production in South Africa.",

The empirical evidence from the study supports the observation that OIDI adoption intensity is influenced by income, farm size, dairy records, and dairy information access. To boost TDI adoption, the dairy development partners should link cooperative society members with agricultural credit lenders. Additionally, the dissemination of dairy information to farmers by the dairy stakeholders could spur TDI adoption, while providing dairy information and training farmers on dairy record keeping should be promoted to boost TDI and OIDI adoption.",

The increasing popularity of private sales is discussed and analyzed. These different outlets serve as the major marketing channels for livestock producers in developing areas. In marketing their livestock through the different channels, farmers experience a range of problems and constraints. The paper analyses these constraints and complaints and also shows how these affect the fanners' choice of a particular marketing outlet. The paper emphasises that farmers do not have access to market information, i.e. current prices, supply, etc., while auctioneers, the limited buyers at auctions and the speculators do have access to market information. It is therefore concluded that the marketing of livestock in developing areas can be improved through addressing the various problems in the different marketing channels as well as through providing farmers with sufficient market information. This will enable farmers to make informed choices in the marketing of their livestock.",

Results show that the estimated probability of a farmer in the scheme being current on loan repayments was higher for clients with higher levels of average annual farm gross turnover relative to loan size, and for clients with access to substantive off-farm income. This suggests that farm size (proxied by annual gross turnover) does matter when policymakers in South Africa consider future similar schemes designed to improve access to commercial farmland by people that previously could not buy farmland. Access to off-farm income could also be considered as a criterion in selecting potential farmers for such schemes, as it helps to provide additional liquidity to fund future operations and debt repayments.",

Although the invitation was quite unexpected, it is of course highly appreciated. When Prof Johann Kirsten phoned me with the request, I was initially not sure what topic I should address. The topic, which I have now formulated, is one which has fascinated me and certainly kept me busy for the most part of my career. I want to share with you some thoughts and perspectives, but will steer away from a laborious review or an abstract analysis. In doing so, I trust that this is appropriate within the spirit of the occasion, which is now a well established tradition in the Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa (AEASA). Let me start with a quotation which is at the core of the theme I want to unfold in this lecture. “Our most important resource is not land, nor capital and even less the climate. Our most important resource is not the gold under the earth's crust, or the oil that might be there. Our most important resource is our human material. We must develop our human material and make full use of it.” (Groenewald JA, 1973a)",

    "abstract": "Abstract A survey of 190 wine and table grape farmers in the Western Cape puts the average wage for farm labour at R928 per month in 2003 and R1123 per month in 2004. Output per worker has doubled since 1983. On farms with grape harvesters, labour is 30 per cent more productive (48 ton/worker) than on farms where wine grapes are picked by hand (37 ton/worker). At 9.75 tons per worker, table grapes are four times as labour-intensive as wine grapes. Resident men dominate the workforce on wine farms, while the resident female workforce is 20 per cent larger than the resident male workforce on table grape farms. Seasonal workers contribute a third of labour in table grapes, and brokers less than ten per cent in either case. In a single-equation short-run Hicksian demand function, wage, output, capital levels and mechanisation intensities are highly significant determinants of employment. Higher wages decrease employment and larger output increases employment. More mechanisation, measured by the number of tractors used to produce a ton of fruit, raises labour intensity too. Grape harvesters could not be shown to reduce jobs. The ten per cent rise in the minimum wage planned for March 2005 could reduce employment by 3.3 per cent in the wine industry and 5.9 per cent in the table grape industry, but it is more likely that the wage increase will be offset against fewer benefits. The average expected impact is about the same as for all agriculture and manufacturing as a whole.",

A land tax on these grounds is superior to an income tax. The tax, however, must be acceptable to the community. The administration of a land tax is costly as all properties need to be appraised individually and regularly. The rise in expenses and function of government has made such a tax inadequate to finance national government expenditure and land taxes are usually used to finance local government expenditure. Currently agriculture is heavily subsidised in developed countries which means that tax money is rechannelled into agriculture, after a portion of it is wasted (lost) in the administration of tax and subsidy schemes. More attention needs to be given to eliminating subsidies that do not meet efficiency and equity goals rather than embarking on new forms of taxation. In this context a subsidy on labour qualifies, whereas a subsidy on the purchase of land is an economic waste, as the subsidy becomes capitalised in higher land values.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The economy of Zimbabwe has been in shambles since 1991. Output has declined in most of the production sectors, leading to many job losses. Current debates on the problems facing the economy have focused on poor government's incentives and excessive interventions as major constraints of economic development. The government of Zimbabwe, on the other hand has emphasized an agriculturally led economic recovery programme. Specifically, the government has undertaken land reform and investment policies aimed at promoting small-holder agriculture in Zimbabwe. Is this a justifiable action taken by the government? The answer to this question necessitated the use of the 1991 micro SAM for Zimbabwe to empirically analyze the impact of small-holder agriculture on the economy of Zimbabwe. The goal of this paper is to quantify small-holder agriculture's true contribution to the economy in general and poverty reduction in particular. However, to make a more detailed analysis, the other sectors are also included in the analytical framework. The study uses the traditional impact analyses to measure the incidence of a sector specific policy on the economy. The results provide evidence that investment in small-holder agriculture should be seen as investment in the entire economy. The study clearly shows that small-holder agriculture promotes sustainable development and the inclusion of rural communities especially the poorest in economic activities.",

Sugarcane contributes approximately 82% of the income from field crops in KZN, with 72% of the crop planted by large-scale growers. Data obtained in 2006 via structured personal interviews of 76 large-scale sugarcane farmers from a stratified random sample of 110 farmers in two separate mill-supply areas of KZN were used to elicit farmers' perceptions of various sources of risk. The most important risk sources were found to be the threat posed by land reform, minimum wage legislation and the variability of the sugar price, in that order. Land reform and minimum wage legislation did not feature prominently in past studies of KZN farmers during the 1990s. Factor analysis identified additional risk dimensions that exist within the remaining risk sources. Regional differences between the two study areas were also evident. Recommendations include that government improve accessibility to information regarding future plans for land and labour policies, and that farmers become more proactive in terms of obtaining information to reduce uncertainty and resultant efficiency barriers.

    "abstract": "Abstract The dualistic nature of the South African economy manifests itself to a large extent in the agricultural sector, where ownership and access to land was previously reserved and is still mainly controlled by white farmers. This has contributed to the huge disparities in the income levels of black and white agricultural households. In this paper two South African household surveys are used to analyse agricultural inequality using various decomposition techniques. It is found that inequalities within agriculture are higher and more pronounced along racial lines than inequalities among non-agricultural households. Agricultural inequalities also differ structurally from those in the rest of society and are explained largely by differences in the ownership of income-generating assets, and less so by racial wage inequalities. Furthermore, an analysis of agricultural poverty reveals extremely high poverty rates and meagre incomes among black subsistence and small-scale farmer households. These results have important implications for the type of transformation required in the South African agricultural sector, adding weight to the notion that commercialisation is crucial if agriculture is to contribute meaningfully to poverty reduction among the rural black community.",

The South African futures exchange (SAFEX) is not immune to this volatility. Volatility increases the risk of paying higher prices for a specific commodity, and it also makes the use of derivative instruments to hedge against price risk more expensive. Given the importance of South Africa as a regional supplier of maize and price discovery mechanism, investigations into the volatility of the maize price are not only important, but also indispensable if all parties involved are to manage this risk. The question therefore is whether the SAFEX maize price volatility can be explained by using fundamental factors or whether this volatility is unexplainably high.",

Apart from a few private initiatives, biofuels have not seen a large scale, commercial production in South Africa to date. This article sketches a basic picture of the economic feasibility of biofuel production in South Africa, without any form of government support, at 2006 prices. It then takes the analysis a step further and with the aid of a set of scenarios, different potential outcomes, due to a range of possible policy implementation measures, are discussed and the results documented. The Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy's (BFAP) sector model is used to simulate the impact of various options on the potential biofuels industry and other related industries during the course of the 2007 to 2015 period. This study shows that a lack of government support for the local biofuels industry could seriously affect its economic viability, especially in the early stages of the industry's development. Additional issues, such as the impact on food and feed prices, also need to be taken into consideration.",

Firstly, South Africa's major markets for citrus are characterised according to a growth-share matrix to identify strategic country markets. Secondly, the paper uses an Indicative Trade Potential analysis to identify strategic markets that are high potential export countries. Thirdly, a gravity model is used to identify which strategic high potential markets are encouraging South African citrus exports. Out of South Africa's 51 major citrus export destinations, 44 countries are considered \"strategic\" markets. From these 44 strategic markets, 26 are high potential markets. Among the 26 high potential markets, an identified 17 countries represent the most attractive markets that possess opportunities for greater export expansion. These 17 countries can be prioritised for an export promotion strategy: six are in the EU, four are in Asia, and two are in Eastern Europe; while three are from Middle East and two from North America. The paper concludes that more aggressive trade policy efforts should also be directed towards nine countries which are \"high potential markets\", but exhibit trade-inhibiting features discouraging South Africa's citrus exports. Trade facilitation efforts and bilateral agreements with such countries could be considered as an option to \"lock in\" the benefits of unexploited export potential in key strategic citrus export markets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The twentieth century saw substantive shifts in the structure, funding and conduct of public agricultural research and development (R&D) and related regulatory and extension activities in South Africa. Following a long period of steady (and at times quite rapid) growth beginning in the early twentieth century, real spending on public agricultural R&D has essentially flat lined since the 1970s. There has also been an erratic pattern of funding per scientist and a loss of scientific personnel in recent decades. Notably, South Africa has lost ground relative to its competitors in international commodity markets, such as the United States (US) and Australia in terms of the intensity of investment in agricultural R&D. In the absence of changes to these trends, these developments may well have enduring, and detrimental, consequences for the productivity performance and competitiveness of South African agriculture. They deserve serious policy attention as the twenty-first century unfolds, with a firm eye to the long-run given the lengthy lags (often many decades) that typify the relationship between public agricultural R&D spending and productivity growth.",

To examine the capacity of the agriculture sector to act as a \"buffer\" in the presence of a negative external shock to the Free State provincial economy, two different shocks are considered: an increase in the international oil price together with a decrease in the international gold price and a devaluation of South African currency. In these simulations, the agricultural sector does not play a buffer role of absorbing labour displaced from other sectors. Our hypothesis was that in the presence of a negative external shock, the agricultural sector would be able to absorb, to some extent, the negative impact, especially labour. The argument is that when the rest of the economy suffers a slowdown, people will \"migrate\" back to agriculture and therefore the agricultural sector will grow and increase its labour demand, alleviating the impacts of the crisis. To analyse the impact of the agriculture sector on welfare and income distribution, an increase in agricultural production, industrial production and other sectors is simulated through increased labour productivity. The results suggest that the agricultural sector plays a significant role in reducing poverty and improving income distribution, but considering poverty the results suggest that the manufacturing sector increases income more than other sectors. Our hypothesis is that growth based on agriculture has a greater impact on poor income households than industrial-based growth. The assumption behind this is that more poor households rely on agriculture than on other sectors.",

The findings indicate that a significant proportion of middle- to upper-class consumers are generally willing to pay higher premiums for a reduction in both water usage and carbon emission in agricultural production, displayed through water and carbon footprint labelling. There exist heterogeneous preferences for water and carbon footprint sustainability attributes, with some being environmental sustainability activists and water sustainability advocates, while others are conservatives regarding environmentally sustainable products. About 86 per cent of the middle-class to upper-class respondents attaches a higher monetary value to low water usage relative to low carbon emissions. The preferences for ecologically sustainable product attributes differ significantly as a function of respondents' underlying attitudes towards environmental degradation and sustainability, socioeconomic characteristics and awareness of water scarcity situation locally.

Precisely the paper analyses the effect of participation on credit market access, fertilizer use and total incomes of its participants in the Kasungu district of Malawi. NASFAM is a form of producer cooperative with a number of socio-economic functions. Using data on income per capita, fertilizer expenditure and access to credit, this paper tests the hypothesis that participation in NASFAM positively impacted incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition. Employing Propensity Score Matching methodology to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATT) on programme members, this paper finds evidence that participation in NASFAM had a positive effect on all the endogenous variables. Membership enhances household level incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition and is hence in line with national goals of poverty reduction, the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) principles, the SADC's Regional Indicative Strategy Development Plan (RISDP) and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Based on these findings and the fact that credit and fertilizer access are still problematic in Malawi's rural areas, it appears that there is great need for NASFAM to expand to areas where it currently does not have activities. Such expansion would ensure food security over a wider range of rural households through improved input access.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT According to the Food Price Monitoring Committee (FPMC) (2003), milling and baking industries are highly concentrated, and most of the major millers are vertically integrated with bakeries. The Committee found that the baking industry is also characterised by a high level of market power, with six baking groups being responsible for 80 per cent of South Africa's bread production. Hence, this study aimed to identify the factors that restrict the development of agro-processing in the small wheat-milling and baking industries in the rural areas of South Africa. Data was collected by means of a structured questionnaire and by conducting 15 interviews with various small wheat-milling and baking firms in the supply chain as well as with major roleplayers. The study found that the small wheat-milling and baking industries have relatively high barriers to entry, including the ability to acquire the required capital to start operations; to establish a market; to acquire knowledge of the wheat-milling and baking industries; to uphold a well maintained infrastructure; to acquire marketing-management knowledge; and to have the necessary cash flow. The only barrier to exit deemed to prevail in the wheat-milling and baking industries is the ability to sell machinery at book value. The study also found that small-scale wheat millers and bakers felt exposed to wheat price volatility, as they had neither the cash flow nor the knowledge to counteract these price risks by way of risk-mitigating strategies available through derivative markets. The study therefore concluded that large-scale wheat millers and bakers have a competitive advantage over their smaller counterparts, in that they have the economies of scale, necessary skills, knowledge and cash flow to overcome obstacles in a short period. Moreover, smaller wheat millers and bakers can take several months to recover from setbacks, which sometimes prove to be detrimental. The study further made some recommendations concerning these factors, in order to facilitate small-scale wheat millers' and bakers' development and expansion of production.",

It demonstrates the importance of aspirations to informing agricultural policies and understanding the behaviour of farmers and their vision regarding their farms. The Heckman two-step regression model was used to determine factors affecting aspirations/willingness of farmers to expand in the first stage and their ability to achieve or realise those aspirations in the second stage. The paper identifies five key factors that influence farmer aspirations (willingness to expand), i.e., positive psychological capital, access to markets, access to credit, land tenure security, and membership in other social groups. Gender, asset ownership, access to markets and local resource use conflicts were significant in determining farmers’ ability to achieve those aspirations. The study reveals the importance of developing positive psychological capital among smallholders and affirms the need for affordable production credit. To better make use of irrigation schemes, there is a need to build the capacity of smallholders to achieve their aspirations through empowering women and improving access to physical assets and markets. Land tenure security concerns need addressing while supporting institutions that promote social interaction and learning remain vital for the growth of the smallholder irrigation sector.",

This heterogeneity, coupled with a large growth in the number of cooperatives in the country, offers an interesting perspective to study the determinants of the (in)efficiency of cooperatives. In this paper, we analyse the performance of Ethiopian agricultural cooperatives, focusing on the degree of technical (in)efficiency and its determinants. We use the stochastic frontier approach in which we account for heteroskedasticity and the monotonicity of production functions, presenting a methodological improvement with respect to previous technical efficiency studies. The results show that NGO- and government-initiated cooperatives are less efficient than community-initiated ones, implying that governments and NGOs should not interfere too strongly in cooperative formation. Cooperatives with a high degree of heterogeneity in members' participation are found to be about 98% less efficient, while cooperatives that have paid employees are 33% more efficient. Besides, results show that cooperatives in Ethiopia function more efficiently if they incentivize committee members through monetary compensation.",

Improved sorghum varieties are widely regarded as a panacea to extreme poverty. The paper uses endogenous switching regression to determine impacts of improved sorghum varieties intensification on household welfare. Household dietary diversity score and household food insecurity access score were used as outcome variables and proxies for food security. Cross-sectional data were generated in the Mid Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe in 2016 from 380 households in a survey conducted with five purposively selected wards. Social association groups, average weighted market prices, household income, age of principal decision maker, dependency ratio, ownership of draught power and storage facilities have significant (p < 0.01) implications on the adoption decision. Counterfactual analyses shows that farmers who allocate more land towards improved sorghum varieties are relatively better off in food diversity and food access. Intensifying improved sorghum varieties can increase dietary diversity by 35% while reducing food insecurity by 29–34%. Social networking can be strengthened through local, government and private partnerships to facilitate generation and efficient dissemination of sorghum production and marketing information. Improving the market prices can increase market size and enhance efficiency along strategic value chain nodes.",

An improved understanding of the key drivers underpinning the performance of cooperatives is important for informing government programmes and policies that target cooperatives. This study examined the financial efficiency, and its determinants, of 387 agricultural cooperatives in South Africa, using the Simar–Wilson methodology. Bias-corrected Data Envelopment Analysis estimates for financial efficiency were obtained in the first stage. The results indicated that many agricultural cooperatives are relatively inefficient, compared to the three best-performing cooperatives on the efficient boundary. In the second stage, a double bootstrap truncated regression model was used to obtain bias-corrected scores that excluded the best-performing cooperatives. The statistically significant efficiency determinants identified from the analysis were the age and size of the cooperative, the gender of the principal manager of the cooperative, its governance and the training indicators. The observed relationship between governance and efficiency may be attributed to institutions that prioritise non-financial goals by being relatively more willing to compromise on governance quality. Furthermore, deviations from sound institutional control mechanisms are more likely to emerge in cooperatives that have weak institutional and organisational arrangements.",

Current estimates point to over 1 billion tons of food lost and wasted worldwide, though nearly 10 percent of the global population is suffering from undernourishment and food insecurity. In Mozambique, about one-quarter of the population suffers from undernourishment and food insecurity. Estimates from FAO point to postharvest losses of maize in Mozambique at about 3.69 to 7.92 percent; this is less than one-fifth of the on-farm losses reported by other authors. In this study, an Equilibrium Displacement model is used to assess the economy-wide impact of postharvest losses of maize at the farm level. The impact of a 3 percent postharvest loss is tested. Results suggest that even this very conservative percentage of postharvest losses has a direct annual net cost of around $USD 28 million for both farmers and consumers domestically. This is equivalent to over 1 percent of the national budget. It is also higher than the average cost of food aid programs received over the last three years. Therefore, reducing postharvest losses of maize along with other interventions is crucial to achieve sustainable development and economic growth.",

    "abstract": "While adoption rates for inorganic fertiliser are relatively high in Ethiopia, application rates are generally considered agronomically suboptimal. Using recent data on Ethiopian smallholder maize producers, we showed that maize response to nitrogen, and the profitability of fertiliser use depended on maize agronomy. The agronomic optimum ranged from 0 to 344 kg/ha with a mean value of 209 kg/ha. The actual nitrogen application rates were only about half the agronomic optimum, on average, and were less than the farm-specific economic optimum on 80% of maize fields. The average economic optimum level was 145 kg N/ha, but when we account for risk aversion, the resulting average optimum level is very close to the average observed usage level of 88 kg N/ha. Addressing risk aversion may help to induce greater levels of fertiliser investments at current prices and yield response rates. Our analysis also suggests that key pathways for increasing the economic returns to smallholder fertiliser investments include: complementing nitrogen inputs with phosphorus inputs and improved varieties, using lower levels of nitrogen under intercropping and manure inputs, enabling farmers to delay output sales beyond the immediate post-harvest period, and lowering the costs of accessing input and output markets.",

Despite being declared an essential service when the COVID-19 regulations were promulgated and lockdown restrictions imposed, the value chain still faced multiple bottlenecks and disruptions that needed to be overcome to ensure food security through this period. This paper considers such bottlenecks and their impacts on major industries within agriculture, as well as the actions taken to address them. It highlights distributional challenges, which influenced accessibility to vulnerable groups, which was accentuated by the initial exclusion of informal traders from essential services – an omission that was later corrected. Furthermore, it notes severe impacts on non-food industries such as wine, where trade was restricted, but other sectors performed well and overall, agriculture still grew by 13% year on year and mostly keeping food inflation in check. Key to this performance was that real time communication and reporting mechanisms were put in place, allowing stakeholders to report bottlenecks quickly, from where they could be escalated and addressed through strong collaboration between government and industry.",

Climate change, competition in the international markets, and various South African policies were identified as major constraints for the competitiveness of the South African avocado industry. Thirteen strategic actions that could be used to improve the competitiveness of this industry are recommended. The study mainly focused on the South African avocado industry; thus, generalisations should be cautious.",

A survey of freehold and Trust farmers was conducted in the Madadeni district of KwaZulu to investigate these relationships. Despite the existence of title-deeds, it was found that many of the respondents did not have exclusive use rights to land. Non-exclusive use rights occurred where land was co-owned, mutually occupied by two or more members of a family or registered in the name of a deceased person. Land market activity was generally confined to rental transactions by individuals who had exclusive use of land. In the absence of zoning regulations, several landowners had leased plots to residential tenants, with some farms becoming entirely residential. Results of logit analysis indicate that investment in on-farm improvements is higher where tenure is private and secure. It is concluded that exclusive and secure property rights facilitate the land market, promoting efficiency in agriculture. Recommendations give due consideration to the equity implications of land sale and land rental markets and to the consequences of zoning.",

An analysis of natural resources and markets shows that limited potential exists in a regional context for trade in 'virtual water' through food imports. Policy options for intra- and intersectoral water reallocation must therefore receive priority attention. Based on experiences in other countries, emphasis is placed on successful innovations of markets in tradable water rights, local management, user-based performance assessment and water saving technologies in irrigated agriculture. The recently published National Water Policy for South Africa and draft National Water Bill that has been released for discussion are accordingly evaluated. With application of the theory of New Institutional Economics, a number of deficiencies in the accepted principles and policy measures become apparent. It is clear that the proposed water licences are insecure; this will not induce efficient market allocations nor will it enable effective participation of water users in water management. Further economic contributions in policy making are required for the design of unattenuated water entitlements in order to achieve correct pricing incentives.",

Without spatial integration of markets, price signals will not be transmitted from deficit to surplus areas, prices will be more volatile, agricultural producers will fail to specialize according to long-term comparative advantage, and the gains from trade will not be realized. The objective of this article is to indicate the extent of market integration between major Mozambican maize markets. Recognizing the statistical dangers and inaccuracies of using measures of price correlation to test for market integration, a new methodology for testing the state of food market integration is employed in this study, namely the parity bounds model, (PBM) as developed by Baulch (1997). This method provides a more reliable procedure for testing violations of spatial arbitrage conditions than conventional methods, because it compares time series of observed price differentials with transfer costs and explicitly recognizes that spatial arbitrage conditions are represented by inequality constraints. The results point to a failure of spatial arbitrage conditions between the Maputo and Chimoio markets about 23% of the time over the period",

In particular, it identifies the behavioural factors that contribute to the level of satisfaction that sugarcane growers perceive in their relationship with the millers. Using recursive models and multiple regression analysis, the results indicate that higher levels of trust lead to higher levels of cooperation that, in turn, lead to higher levels of commitment by the smallholder growers to the business relationship. Cooperation is also an antecedent of the benefits and of the satisfaction that these growers gained from the relationship. These results agree with a priori theory that trust, cooperation, strategic benefits, commitment and absence of opportunistic behaviour are essential elements for a successful relational exchange. The findings imply that both cane growers and millers need to focus on initiating, signalling and disclosing their behaviours in an effort to improve their relationship with each other. A relationship founded on trust and mutual respect is more likely to succeed than a relationship of convenience supported by legal contingencies. Therefore, relationships characterised by trust and physical and psychological commitment as well as cooperation between exchange parties is more important for mutual benefit and good quality relationship.",

Commercial land expropriated should be resettled on a private individual tenure basis by small scale farmers and not on a communal basis. Under a communal system the return (rent) on grazing land is zero while the return on arable land is low due to lack in permanent tenure. This explains idle arable land in KwaZulu in spite of population pressure. The rental value is the cost to the farmer for non usage of land if it can make a positive contribution. The market mechanism penalizes the commercial farmer for the non usage of commercial land. A land tax does not increase this cost and will thus not bring unproductive land into production. (The supply of land is not perfectly inelastic due to improvements). Taxes on agricultural land have certain advantages such as (a) avoidance less possible than income taxes(b) a wealth tax and (c) may better target to wealthy landowners who with the assistance of tax experts are better able to avoid taxes. Disadvantages of land taxes are that administration cost may be high and the tax is the same in good and bad years. Uittreksel Drie redes waarom die mark faal in 'n kommunale grondgebruikstelsel is (a) vrye toegang tot kommunale weiding wat 'n probleem is as die groep groter is as die naby familie (b) onvoldoende insentief om te belê in verbeterings soos weiding en voer as gevolg van “free riders” en (c) die geleentheidskoste van grond verskil van wat markkragte sal bepaal. Kommersiële gronde wat onteien is moet hervestig word op basis van 'n privaat grondbesitstelsel deur kleinboere en nie op grond van 'n kommunale stelsel nie. Onder 'n kommunale stelsel is die rente-opbrengs, (“rent”) op weiding zero en die op ploeggrond laag weens afwesigheid van permanente privaat besitreg. Dit verklaar waarom grond dikwels onbenut is in bestaanslandbou ten spyte van bevolkingsdruk. M.b.t. die kommersiële boer, die markmeganisme penaliseer hom indien by nie sy grond tot die optimum benut nie. Die “rent” of verhuurwaarde is die wins wat die boer inboet indien sy grond ongebruik word en is dus die geleentheidskoste van grond. Die aanbod van grond is nie perfek onelasties nie a.g.v. verbetering en 'n grondbelasting sal die aanbod na links verskuif en nie na regs dikwels gemeen word nie. Grondbelasting het voordele soos (a) omseiling minder moontlik (b) belasting op rykdom en (c) kan meer rig op welgestelde grondeienaars wat met behulp van belastingdeskundiges beter daartoe instaat is om inkomstebelasting te omseil. Nadele is dat administrasiekoste is hoog en die belasting is dieselfde in goeie en swak jare.",

The object is to determine whether land tenure and other socio-economic variables might contribute to differences in investment and herd productivity. Descriptive statistics show that levels of investment and herd productivity are higher on private farms than on open-access communal grazing. Private farmers are also better educated, more liquid, and have larger herd sizes, but do not differ from their communal counterparts in terms of age, gender, race or household size. Levels of investment in fixed improvements and operating inputs are negatively correlated with herd mortality, and positively correlated with calving and off-take rates, and with liquidity and private ownership of land. While these findings appear to support Botswana's agricultural policy of privatising some communal grazing land to individual farm households or to small, organized groups of farmers, it is clear that land tenure is not the only variable of policy interest. A more rigorous analysis of the data is required to untangle the causes of observed differences in herd productivity and investment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Farm worker equity-share schemes have received both positive and negative publicity since they were initiated by the private sector in the early1990's. This paper adds to the debate surrounding these land reform projects. In particular, it compares the results of case studies conducted by the Surplus People's Project (SPP) in 1998 with more recent (2001) case studies. The latter suggest that many of the concerns raised by the SPP, such as beneficiaries' participation and expectations, power relations between management and worker-shareholders, skills transfer and labour relations have been addressed. The paper also highlights those issues that remain areas of concern, for example, beneficiaries' tenure security, literacy levels amongst worker shareholders, skill and wage differences between men and women, and exit procedures. It is recommended that Department of Land Affairs (DLA) grants should be awarded only to beneficiaries of projects that have been co-financed by a bank or reputable investor as this ensures a thorough financial assessment of the project, and only to projects that can demonstrate a history of good labour relations. It is also recommended that the DLA should consider extending its grants to regular but seasonal farm workers who wish to participate in an established project. While farm worker equity-share schemes may not provide all the answers to land reform they have an important role to play in redistributing wealth and deracialising commercial agriculture in South Africa.",

A census survey of the beneficiary households was conducted in May 2002 to gather data on poverty indicators. Principal Component Analysis was used to construct an index of the standard of housing, which was then combined with variables measuring other symptoms of poverty (income, wealth and health) in a Cluster Analysis of the households. The analysis revealed five clusters representing four distinct groups of poverty; households relatively income and asset rich, households relatively income rich but asset poor, households relatively asset rich but income poor and households with the lowest incomes and assets. While income is an important indicator of current poverty, household wealth (measured in terms of saleable assets) indicates ability to cope with adverse shocks—a key issue as life expectancy is declining and old-age pensioners account for a large share of household income in the survey group. It is concluded that child welfare grants could be increased as pension earnings become less effective in combating the symptoms of poverty in this area. In addition, land reform grants may address poverty more effectively when used to purchase equity in joint ventures with commercial farmers than when used to purchase land that many of the beneficiaries cannot use or transact.",

Analysis of variance shows that these three factors and their effects are interdependent. The effect and influence of each on survival are therefore influenced by the levels of the other factors.

It is an ideal, which I hope to live for, and to see realised. But my lord, if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die. Nelson Mandela, 20th April 1964, Johannesburg This paper begins by arguing that agricultural economics has an important contribution to make to the economic transition of the new democratic South Africa. Policies are required to reduce unemployment, poverty and inequality, but does the work of agricultural economists provide the policy makers with the information necessary to make the correct choices? In this context, we update our recent work on technology, efficiency and productivity in South African agriculture, for both the commercial and smallholder sub-sectors. For the commercial sector, this means extending the total factor productivity index and estimates of the demand for labour. For the smallholder sector, there are new results on the impacts of GM cotton and white maize on output and employment. However, this piecemeal approach treats the two sectors as entirely separate, when they are actually interdependent. Thus, a Ricardian model of dualistic agriculture is used to explain the historical development of dualism in agriculture, especially how the native agriculturalists were impoverished by the colonists. Then this model is adapted to resemble the Harris-Todaro model of urban unemployment is order to represent the present dual agricultural sector. This allows the current policy options to be compared, although real data is needed to estimate the relationships and so the full analysis remains incomplete.",

In many cases consumer attitudes and perceptions of GM food products were revealed as fears, concern for, and avoidance of the new technology. The importance of GM foods in South Africa is increasing, even though the GM Food debate lags behind many other (often more developed) parts of the world. This paper investigates the knowledge, attitudes and acceptance of urban South African white-grain maize consumers regarding GM maize. Conjoint- and cluster analysis were used to develop clusters/market segments among the urban consumers of white maize. A range of additional questions was used to develop profiles of the identified market segments. These aspects covered demographics, GM knowledge aspects as well as GM attitude aspects. Four distinct clusters/market segments were identified with specific characteristics: \"Anti-GM, Brand aware\" cluster (35% of valid responses), \"Brand unaware, Farmer sympathetic\" cluster (20%), \"GM consumer benefit, Brand aware\" cluster (25%) and the \"Brand aware, Pro-GM\" cluster (20%). The most significant differences between the clusters were based on the consumers' attitudes towards GM food products.",

The survey showed that a significant number of commonage users are committed to their farming enterprises, as shown by five proxy indicators: Their readiness to plough their income into their farming enterprises; their sale of livestock; their desire for more land, and their willingness to pay rental to secure such land; their desire to farm on their own; and their desire to own their own land. The paper reflects on the significance of commonage in the context of the South African government's land reform policy, and argues that commonage can transcend survivalist or subsistence production, and can be used as a “stepping stone” for emergent farmers to access their own land parcels. Finally, the paper argues that, if commonage is to become a key part in a “step-up” strategy of land reform, then appropriately sized land parcels should be made available for commonage users, to enable them to “exit” from commonage use and invest in smallholdings or small farms.",

Two scale development procedures were carried out on randomly selected samples of 213 and 322 previously disadvantaged individual respondents within 14 and 11 wine business that cover the larger part of the wine industry chain. The results led to a 'feeling' self-report scale (5-dimensions) and an 'evolution' self-report scale (6-dimensions). The emerged dimensions are: Business ownership and control (BOC), Access to finance (ATF), Employment and Human Resources Management (EMP) [internal and external], Social capital/enabling environment (SOC) and Lobbying power and collective action (LOB). First measurement results indicate that respondents feel less empowered with respect to BOC and ATF as compared to EMP, SOC and LOB. There appears to be no gender or age differences, but there are geographical differences. The latter is mostly per farm, that is, a lot of variation in BEE is observed at the firm level. The scale can be used at the firm and industry level as a diagnostic tool to monitor BEE progress as a complementary and not a substitutive framework to the wine industry scorecard as an objective measure of BEE. Future research should focus on the gap between the two definitions and assessment tools in order to comprehensively capture BEE in its entirety. The scale can also be adapted to fit the context, for example, its use in the agricultural sector at large.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Evaluating the range of proposed adaptation measures to combat the sensitivity of agriculture to climate change effects involves evaluating complex interactions between human and natural systems. Integrated strategy-making and implementation in the agricultural sector to reduce the risks posed by climate change requires the consideration of multiple, interdisciplinary factors and the sensitivities of their interrelationships. Lack of information on the sensitivity of agricultural activities to climate change in Africa hampers climate change adaptation research on the region. In water scarce South Africa, the growth of the agricultural sector is threatened by projected decreases in water availability due to climate change. This paper shows how Bayesian networks may be used to facilitate cross-disciplinary participation in elucidating these sensitivities. Bayesian networks provide a graphical framework for mixing quantitative and qualitative information and can be characterised using information associated with varying degrees of uncertainty. This enables a variety of domain experts to test key driver-response interactions through sensitivity analysis and enables visualisation of the complex inter-relationships between inter-disciplinary variables resulting from the impacts of climate change scenarios on South African agriculture. The ability to represent the sensitivities between key variables for which varying degrees of data-scarcity and uncertainty occur provides agricultural sector researchers with a facilitation tool that may helps visualise and formulate climate change mitigation strategies. The results presented here illustrates the extreme sensitivity of water-scarce South African agricultural sector to projected climate change impacts and provides a framework in which tradeoffs between activities can be preliminarily assessed in strategy-making for adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The South African deciduous fruit industry has experienced difficulties in the past few years. Most deciduous fruit producers have suffered from increased globalisation of markets; trade liberalisation; deregulation of the industry; advances in information technology; changes in consumer preference; over-supply of deciduous fruit in South Africa's traditional markets and increased global competition, particularly from Chile. These factors have a continuous effect on the competitiveness of the industry and force deciduous fruit producers to position themselves as capable competitors in the global free-market environment. This paper measures the competitive performance of the South African deciduous fruit supply chains relative to those of Chile. An internationally recognised index, the Relative Revealed Comparative Trade Advantage (RTA) index and also data from both Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO, 2007) and World Trade Organisation (WTO, 2007) are used to measure the competitive performance. The results reveal that South Africa's deciduous fruit supply chains are shown to be competitive internationally, whereas Chile's deciduous fruit supply chains are strongly internationally competitive. In most cases, South African fruit products to which value has been added have a competitive disadvantage, contrary to the case in Chile. South African deciduous fruit competitive performance decreases when moving from primary to processed products in the chains, an indication that value-adding opportunities are still limited",

Population growth is projected at 3% per annum, implying increased domestic water use. In addition to these factors, the concern for ecological sustainability and increased water pollution due to increased industrial, mining and agricultural activities, water availability for sectoral production activities is expected to decline. This decline has an impact on sectoral output, value added and households' welfare. Using a computable general equilibrium approach, this study investigates the possible impact of global change on households' welfare. The simulation results show that water scarcity due to global change can potentially lead to a general deterioration in households' welfare. The poor households, whose incomes are adversely impacted, are the most vulnerable to the consequences of the impact of global change on water resources in South Africa. This vulnerability can only be reduced if welfare policies that maintain food consumption levels for the least and low-income households are implemented.",

This paper uses data collected from 500 emerging farmers across the nine provinces of South Africa to determine the accessibility and use of infrastructure by emerging farmers. Factor Analysis was applied on fifteen indicators of infrastructure. The principal components extraction method extracted four factors, namely distance to services infrastructure, tarred road conditions to the services infrastructure, visitation to general services infrastructure and agricultural support services infrastructure. The results show that services infrastructure is generally more accessible to emerging farmers than before. The factors that determine the accessibility to infrastructure services include the distance of the nearest town from the villages, the state of the roads that farmers use and the frequency of visits to the nearest town. The distance to services infrastructure is segregated from condition and usage. The results indicate that all services are in a more or less similar location and in similar condition in terms of access. The implication of this study is that policy should address farmers' access to services, which are sometimes in bundles, and the role of locating services in centres is pertinent as it stimulates agricultural and rural development.",

The black middle class, increasingly referred to as the “Black Diamonds” are the most powerful marketing trend during the last 10 years, as they have emerged as the strongest buying influence in the economy, and making inroads in understanding this market presents a good opportunity. The data used in this paper was collected from an integration of a consumer behaviour survey; as well as personal interviews and focus group discussions. The paper asserts that the key factors influencing the South African consumers’ behaviour are age, gender, income, race and wine drinking history. The paper also asserts that, not only is the black middle class different from the white middle class, but that different segments exist within the ”Black Diamonds”. The industry should particularly focus on marketing to women and the ”Start-me-up” age group, as there is limited consumer knowledge about wines, but a high willingness to experiment. The paper also suggests various new brand communication platforms that can be explored to reach this market as well as competition between industry stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Price volatility in agriculture is important because of the part it plays in the overall variability in profits. South African farmers have to contend with low profit margins, and price volatility therefore affects agricultural producers in South Africa to a considerable degree. The autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity/generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH/GARCH) approach is used to quantify the volatility in the price of the July white maize futures contracts that trade on the South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX). Volatility tends to increase from December through the early part of May, which makes the timing of marketing decisions important. As a second sub-objective, linear regression is used to identify the factors that cause changes in volatility over time. The release of new information on local and international growing conditions is found to increase the level of volatility in the price of the July white maize contract. Maize producers should therefore take the release of important information into account when developing their marketing plans for the coming marketing season. The usefulness of put options as a price risk management tool is highlighted by the results of this research. Keywords: price volatilitywhite maizeSouth AfricaARCH/GARCH",

The social value of urban agriculture, such as improving food security, developing a sense of community and promoting ecological conservation, is well documented. But in order to effectively contribute to development agendas, urban agriculture must also present viable, sustainable economic opportunities. This study sets forth vegetable box schemes as a context-appropriate, economically feasible urban agriculture enterprise for which there is growing consumer demand. A survey of 354 subscribers to vegetable box schemes in Cape Town is analysed, finding these households source half of their fresh produce and a quarter of their total groceries from box schemes. The study explores dimensions of consumer satisfaction and considers ways in which box schemes may be expanded. This paper also offers a brief comparison of different box scheme models in order to demonstrate that a development-oriented social enterprise model can compete with other for-profit models in the market.",

Findings from the Binary logistic regression model revealed that elements of social capital, namely flow of resources, quality of information, cooperation, trustworthiness and inclusion in decisions are important predictors of enterprise success. Strategies of fostering linking social capital that were recommended in the study include gathering enough information which assist in setting achievable targets, formulating a strategy for resource procuring and delivering, and formulating a standardised system for verifying training material and other information media for simplicity.

The paper further establishes the nexus between land ownership and outputs from homestead food garden programmes. The data was obtained from 500 maize-producing households. The findings demonstrate that participation in homestead food garden programmes could significantly enhance the welfare of rural households by increasing their yield and net returns. Participation in the programme increased maize yield and net returns by 43.37 per cent and 22.01 per cent respectively. Cultivating more than one hectare of farmland enhanced the outcome of participation in a homestead food garden programme more relative to cultivating less than one hectare. Homestead food garden programmes should be run in conjunction with land ownership. Our findings demonstrate the need for policymakers and evaluators of agricultural interventions to consider farmers' decisions to participate, programme outcomes and land ownership in their assessments in order to avoid biased judgement. The willingness of people to participate in farming should be paramount to the homestead food garden programme and land ownership policy, otherwise the redistribution of farmland to people who are not willing to farm will be meaningless.",

While there are a number of justifications for the Fairtrade organization's decision, there are authors who feel that meaningful \"fair trade\" cannot be achieved with the inclusion of commercial farms. This paper investigates the impact of Fairtrade on commercial farms and small-scale farmer cooperatives in South Africa. Fairtrade on South African commercial farms embraces a number of policy concerns related to land reform, BEE and sustainable development. The results of the study show that when commercial farms are included in the Fairtrade model, communities in which these farmers live benefit from developmental projects. In addition, in some instances, farm workers gain shares in the commercial farms, and benefit from the farm owners' knowledge and capital.",

Using a panel dataset of 26 agricultural districts (distributed across six agro-ecological regions) for the period 2004 to 2012, we estimate technical efficiency (TE) indices using a standard stochastic production frontier and meta-technological gap ratios (MTR) with a meta-frontier approach. The study finds that farmers use available technology suboptimally and produce far less than potential output. The average TE indices range from as low as 0.40 for Maun, 0.71 for Western and to 0.79 for the Southern region. The mean MTR also varies substantially across regions; high for Western (0.83), Southern (0.80) and Francistown (0.79) regions and low for the Maun region (0.39). A low MTR for the Maun region is attributed to the re-occurrence of FMD and human and wildlife conflict in this region, restricting the ability of farmers to fully reach their potential output. The results of this study have important implications for policy targeting. The study results allow us to identify the differences in productive performance between beef producers in each region of Botswana, and hence where policies to improve production technologies could be focused.",

Rural women diversify their livelihood strategies beyond agriculture despite its centrality to the rural economy. This study used the proportion of non- agricultural incomes to total household income as a measure of the degree of women's diversification away from agriculture in Msinga rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal. The Tobit regression model was used for investigating the dimensions of empowerment that influence women's decision to diversify away from agricultural- based livelihoods. It was found that women with higher levels of human and physical capital forms of empowerment, vocational and farm financial management skills were more likely to diversify away from agricultural-based livelihood activities. On the other hand, women with higher levels of social capital and legal resource empowerment were less likely to participate in non-farm activities. Socio-economic factors including being married and involvement in dry-land agriculture increased the likelihood of women to rely on non-agricultural incomes while higher husband's incomes and involvement in irrigation agriculture reduced the chances of women to diversify away from agriculture. It was concluded that certain dimensions of rural women's empowerment influence the extent to which they diversify livelihoods away from agriculture. Hence, this study suggests that policymakers need to consider using empowerment interventions such as human and physical capital forms of empowerment, vocational and farm financial management skills to increase women's diversification and reduce their household dependence on agriculture.",

    "abstract": "A country's comparative advantage is not only dependent on factor endowments. History, random events (wars, oil crisis, sanctions, etc.) and past government policies are important factors shaping a country's trade patterns. Such factors are recognised in both traditional and new trade theory. Therefore the formulation (and implementation) of industrial and agricultural export policy has to be cognisant of these factors. In the search for new markets or new product opportunities in existing markets to inform both trade policy making and business decision making, a major challenge is making sense of the huge volumes of available product and market information, which is one of the manifestations of \"big data\". Using an example from the South African fruit industry, this paper illustrates how the big data challenge can be tackled using the TRADE-Decision Support Model methodology. By means of this methodology an initial 1221 realistic export opportunties were identified in 107 markets. Of the overall 54 products in the fruit and nuts HS chapter 08 category, 22 have \"major potential\", representing about US$3.5 billion across 102 countries. Most of the potential for \"mature\" products lies in \"new\" markets from a South African agriculture exports perspective. Of this potential 80 per cent is found in 10 products (including grapes, apples, mandarins, and lemons and limes). Some non-traditional products such as bananas, cashew nuts, kiwifruit and guavas were identified. Europe still represents approximately half of the total estimated realistic potential in the short term, estimated at US$6 billion, followed by North America (22 per cent) and Asia (21 per cent).",

The nutritional status of the nutritionally vulnerable in Malawian communities should improve in consequence. However, there is little evidence from Malawi or elsewhere to confirm whether irrigation improves nutritional status at household level. Using data from the Third Malawi Integrated Household Survey of 2010/11, this article presents a basic assessment of whether increased use of irrigated farming by smallholders in Malawi might result in better nutritional outcomes for children in Malawian farm households and more diverse diets in these households. The association between the use of irrigation by farm households and the growth performance of their children aged six months to five years was positive but weak and not significant (P>0.05). The positive association between irrigated farming and the diversity in the foods consumed by farm households was somewhat stronger and significant (P<0.05). In particular, irrigation is shown to be an important component in reducing seasonality in household dietary diversity.Keywords: irrigationchild nutritiondietary diversityJEL Classification: D19I39Q15",

Southern Africa has suffered continued hunger despite a myriad of technological interventions that have been introduced in agriculture to address issues of food security, as well as poverty alleviation. IAR4D is a new approach that was recently introduced by the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa through the sub-Saharan Africa Challenge Programme as an alternative strategy to address the challenges that the conventional Agricultural Research and Development (ARD) approach has been facing. Data for this article has been derived from two sources: baseline and endline surveys of the sub-Saharan Africa Challenge Programme that were implemented in southern Africa.The findings of the study showed reduced food insecurity in the intervention sites when compared with counterfactual (clean and conventional) sites. This is a clear evidence that IAR4D has had some impact, as food insecurity has been reduced in the intervention villages where the programme was implemented, unlike the control villages where the programme was not implemented. The results also show that IAR4D has improved the quality of food dietary diversity and smallholders' coping strategies when compared with control sites. However, these results are not robust across sites. Given the positive impact, this article recommends the adoption of IAR4D over ARD as an alternative approach to addressing household food security by increasing agricultural production.",

The subsequent stock build up induces a prolonged period of weaker prices, and combined with additional actions imposed up to the end of July 2021, cost actors in the industry R3.6 billion in primary gross production value from 2020 to 2027, even without accounting for further value addition between bulk sale and retail value.",

Commercial agriculture and agribusiness are creating institutions (such as food safety standards and strategic partnerships), adopting existing private and public institutions (e.g. TQM, ISO 9000 and HACCP) or restructuring to add value to products and services, reduce costs and gain access to export markets. Government should focus its relatively scarce resources on providing physical and legal infrastructure (such as secure property rights and contract enforcement) to reduce transaction costs, including risk, so that markets work efficiently. A major challenge for local agricultural economists is to provide information about institutions that will promote the productive use of land in communal areas, and the competitiveness of emerging farmers on redistributed commercial farmland.",

Then, the question is how to give a practical content to these requirements, and how to avoid that technical farm relations could be emphasised without recognising the diversity in farming situations and without contextualising such technical relationships in the wider social, economic and political environment. In this prospect a research, based on rural household surveys, has been carried out in the Khambashe area of the Eastern Cape Province. On the basis of this example, the authors discuss the usefulness of household typologies to link social diversity and technical change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Liberalized fertilizer markets in eastern Africa typically deliver fertilizer to smallholder farming regions at prices that render its use unprofitable. Simultaneously, faced with little demand for fertilizer in these regions, fertilizer traders appear unwilling to invest in measures that might reduce farm-gate prices. A basic question throughout the region is therefore how to cost-effectively increase smallholders' access to fertilizer, under conditions of liberalized and privatised trade in the input. This paper explores that question for Uganda using data from a wide-ranging study of Uganda's fertilizer sub-sector. The prevailing system of fertilizer procurement and distribution is found to imply a market structure dominated by retail-level trade, high prices, and low net margins. The study concludes that there is no inherent pressures in the extant system of fertilizer procurement and distribution toward development of a wholesaling backbone that might allow capture of scale economies. But with imaginative and sustained investments in institutional innovation and strengthening, there is scope to reduce prices and increase net trading margins.",

A crop insurance programme (drought) for small-scale commercial farmers, who are not yet paying tax, has been recommended to government. The purpose in this research is to study the economic viability of such a programme drawing on the US experience. The US programme is well developed but heavily subsidised. During 1998 US growers paid $900 million in premiums while during 199598 the US government spent $1.2 billion per year on subsidies. An area insurance plan (farmers are insured as a group) is shown to be more appropriate for small farmers growing dryland field crops such as maize because risk is systemic (drought related) while adverse selection, moral hazard etc are overcome. Individual crop insurance will not be viable due to the cost of farm visits (verification of claims) and the non-availability of information. As a large part of the cost to government goes to administration of crop insurance it is recommended that an Income Equalisation Deposit (IED) scheme for small growers receive serious consideration with the government making a contribution as for example in Canada.",

A fresh approach to design is adopted that combines a case study in the timber industry, the lessons of history and the economics of organisational architecture. The results confirm that the transaction characteristics of the grower-processor supply chain influence the level of managed co-ordination, that small-scale farmers generate incremental transaction cost and that medium and small-scale farmers can compete with larger growers in the supply chain. The results, however, are inconclusive with respect to the role of contracting as an institution to overcome the barriers of entry to the timber industry. A series of proposals are then developed in order to reduce transaction cost and achieve higher levels of contract enforcement in smallholder contracting arrangements with agribusiness. This paper concludes that large numbers of small-scale farmers can be effectively incorporated in the supply chain but only if specific measures are taken to reduce transaction cost.",

A review of selected sectoral multipliers concludes this article. Agriculture's percentage share in South Africa's economy is relatively small and is constantly dropping as the latter expands and diversifies. Agriculture's most important contribution is obviously that of providing employment. Each sector is differently affected by changes in agricultural production and prices. Another important consideration is that the overall impact of a change in agricultural production, for example as a result of drought, is almost twice as great as its direct impact, therefore confirming the strong forward and backward linkage of the agricultural sector with other sectors in the South African economy. If the multipliers are taken into account, it is clear that the agricultural industry should enjoy a high priority in the allocation of South Africa's relatively scarce available capital, especially where the provision of employment is an important aim.",

Analyses of key variables over time are followed by multiple regression analyses with total farm debt as a dependent variable. The drought hit the gross income from field crops the hardest; the value of field crop production was on average 45,3 per cent per annum lower for the period 1982–85 than predicted by the long-term trend. On the other hand, deviations in horticultural and animal production were on average smaller than 8 per cent per annum. Multiple regression shows that drought, general economic conditions and the effects of structural inflation influence the debt burden of the farming sector. Real gross domestic product, interest rates, the ratio of input to output prices and the drought index all had a significant influence on the real debt burden of agriculture in the period 1970–85. The influence of these factors was also, without exception, relatively elastic. This means that a change in any of these factors will result in a proportionally larger change in real total debt burden.",

Agriculture earns much of its revenue through exports. Demand-pull inflation probably didn't cause the sharp food price increases. Fanners contribute to demand-pull inflation through injudicious purchases of inputs. Input prices rise faster locally than overseas. This decreases competitive power on international markets. Tariff protection of inputs and monopolistic conditions are contributory factors. Agricultural profitability decreases, debts rise and risks increase. Eventually this will result in smaller supply and higher food prices. Monopolies reduce agriculture's bargaining power. The Marketing Act attempts to improve this. Some boards, however, become statutory monopolies and contribute to cost-push. Such actions and the monopolistic actions of some Co-ops are harmful. In general, monopolies warrant more attention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study analyses survey data gathered from small and large poultry producers in the rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal, and highlights factors constraining the impact of commercial poultry production on the local economy. It was found that small-scale poultry production has the ability to initiate economic growth through the “export” of its products and to draw under-utilised resources such as labour into production. The impact of the subsequent multiplier effect is most likely strongest in the non-tradable, non-agricultural sector. Alleviating constraints for a large number of small enterprises is expected to impact more positively on the rural economy than if a few larger enterprises were encouraged to grow bigger. The descriptive results suggest that small producers face much higher transaction costs than larger producers. Government policies should focus on absorbing some of these transaction costs to nurture economic growth in the rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal, i.e. by improving education, physical infrastructure and technology transfer through extension. Other important interventions include the provision of mentoring and training services for new managers including institution, legal and financial management instruction.",

This paper resolves imprecise definitions of regular versus permanent status, and of casual versus seasonal status. It also examines casualisation and job shedding. Results show a decrease in the share of seasonal work and no change in the casual component of seasonal work. The job status of most farm women in the Valley improved as a result of legislative changes implemented since 1994. Outsourcing is present but insignificant at this point. On the whole data for the table grape industry of the Hex River Valley does not support the hypothesis that globalisation and labour market reform caused dramatic increases in casualisation.",

For the period 1991–2002, this elasticity estimate rose to −1.32 and −1.34 for OLS and 2SLS regression, respectively.

Trade reform focuses on substantial tariff reduction; although in the case of the EU, scenarios also include reduction in domestic support and export subsidies. The results show that a unilateral tariff reduction in a selected number of agricultural products amounts to welfare gains of US$21 million. These gains are three times higher when accompanied by extensive reforms in the EU.",

This study analyses factors influencing rural household labour allocation and supply decisions for competing livelihood activities, including wetland activities. The analyses employ the agricultural household framework, which takes into account that rural households are both producers and consumers. Results show that poor households are more dependent on wetland products and have less capacity to participate in off-farm opportunities, and hence allocate most of their labour time to farm and wetland activities. Better access to education is critical for enhancing employment potential in the non-farm sector, reducing pressure on wetland resources. Government policies that enhance access to education enable the poor to diversify into non-farm livelihood sources and provide necessary incentives for conserving wetland habitat. This has to be linked with broader rural development programmes such as improving access to markets, micro-credit and other small-scale income-generating activities.",

Production functions for the three outputs: milk production, animals and farm-produced feed, are fitted as a simultaneous system to model the farms' production activities. This simultaneous model is complemented by a single equation reduced form that is fitted as a frontier, which allows estimation of the relative efficiencies of the individual farms. The results show that, with data this detailed, it is possible to refine the model until it fits very tightly. Indeed, in the gross output model that includes cows there is nothing left to call inefficiency and what was clearly a frontier becomes a mean response function.",

Consumer, supply chain and network analyses are critical to finding an optimal solution that is sustainable enough to meet the changing environment. Industry-specific information regarding the structure and function of the beef value chain was gathered through interviews with industry leaders and experts; and specific consumer information was gathered through a consumer survey. The South African beef industry, like many other South African supply chains, is challenged by the increasing complexity and demand brought about by globalisation, increased volumes and competition, the shortage of skilled staff and pressures to meet changing customer needs. Consequently, the power has shifted from the supply side to the consumer. Although the industry has a good reputation, good management practices can further increase consumer confidence in beef.

In addition to accounting for approximately 40 per cent on average of total export earnings, coffee production provides a livelihood for a large proportion of the Ethiopian population in the form of jobs for farmers, local traders, transporters and exporters. Volatility in the price of coffee thus influences a large proportion of the population all along the coffee commodity chain within Ethiopia. This study uses the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity/Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH)/(GARCH) approach to quantify the volatility in the price of coffee. A distinction is made between producer, wholesale and export prices in order to compare the price risk as faced by the respective participants in the coffee chain. The volatility in coffee prices within Ethiopia is also compared to the volatility levels in Brazilian coffee prices, since Brazil is a major coffee producing country in the world. Coffee prices within Ethiopia were found to be more volatile than in Brazil. Producer prices were found to be the most volatile, followed by wholesale prices and export prices respectively. The high level of volatility in producer prices emphasises the need for efficient price risk management tools that should be available to coffee producers in Ethiopia.",

The authors applied the traditional (Engle-Granger) and the standardised (Enders & Siklos) Dickey-Fuller procedures to test for cointegration and asymmetry in price transmission. Four competing models, namely the Engle-Granger (EG), Threshold Autoregressive (TAR), Momentum Threshold Autoregressive (M-TAR), and Momentum Consistent Threshold Autoregressive (MC-TAR) models, were fitted. Following the application of a standard model selection criterion, the MC-TAR was chosen as the best. The following results were obtained: price transmission between producer and retail prices is asymmetric; the direction of causation runs from producer to retail prices; retailers correct about 2 per cent of the negative and 4 per cent of positive disequilibria every month; and it takes fewer months for negative shocks than positive shocks to be eliminated. In general, the results suggest that retailers respond more quickly to shocks that stretch their market margin than to those that squeeze it. This is typical of positive asymmetric price transmission. We attribute this to the anticompetitive behaviour that characterises the food market chain.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In many developing countries, land ownership remains a subject of contention. In South Africa, notwithstanding the strides that have been made to foster equitable land ownership, land reform policies have been unsuccessful in delivering land to the poor majority. Due to the nature of agriculture as a source of food production and national security, and the lack of farming skills and related competencies' equilibrium, programmes intended to deliver land to black people have been inadequate in their reach. Whereas policy has emphasised the urgency of solving equity issues in land ownership, equally challenging has been finding the right set of programmes to achieve this without triggering a perennial land ownership squabble. After 18 years of democracy, a need remains to find a balance between continuity in food production and equitable redistribution of land in South African agriculture. In this paper, we argue that it is possible to achieve equitable and fair redistribution of land without inhibiting agricultural production, through land sharing. We show that sharing land could help fast-track the development of a farming skills and related competencies' equilibrium between black and white farmers. The paper further demonstrates that the gains in land sharing far outweigh other programmes of land reform that have been used and suggested thus far.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The use of modern routine marketing strategies to minimize risk exposure is not a widely adopted practice among grain producers. The producers tend to use high risk strategies which include the selling of the crop on the cash market after harvest; while the high market risks require innovative strategies including the use of futures and options as traded on South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX). This is mostly due to a lack of interest and knowledge of the market. The purpose of the study is to examine whether the adoption of basic routine strategies is better than adopting no strategy at all. The study illustrates that by using a Stochastic Efficiency with Respect to a Function (SERF) and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) that the use of three basic strategies for each crop type, namely, a Put (plant time)-, (Three-segment-), (Critical Moment in production/marketing process) and Sell after pollination can be more rewarding. These strategies can be adopted by farmers without an in-depth understanding of the market and market signals. The results obtained from the study illustrate that each strategy is different for each crop. It also indicates that no strategy is worse than a specific strategy and that the choice between strategies depends on the risk aversion level of the producer. It is imperative to note that the use of hedging strategies is better than no strategy at all.",

The current paper uses a combination of literature review and analysis of anecdotal evidence to evaluate a set of hypothetical reasons for the decline. The world wool price clearly affected farm-level profitability, putting up to 50% of sheep farms out of business in some parts of the Central Karoo. If census data were properly collected, this in itself should not have affected TFP. The evidence for overgrazing and increasingly ineffective predator control was less convincing. For example, there is no conclusive evidence yet on whether game and lifestyle farms exert any negative externalities on remaining sheep operations. The cost-price squeeze resulting from falling prices and rising input costs has led to an extension of production systems and poor maintenance which will no doubt lead to a further decline in productivity. We concluded that the rate at which the Central Karoo is shedding sheep farming, and the reasons for and effects of it, should be investigated further.",

This movement towards addressing consumers' demand for food products with more advanced quality attributes has led to increasingly complex food qualification processes and a proliferation of standards. Accompanying these changes in the agro-food system is a growing consumer concern for food safety and quality. One important attribute of \"quality\" is the origin of a food product. This paper focuses on lamb originating from the Karoo region of South Africa and tests consumers' willingness to pay a premium for this specific origin attribute of the product. A random nth price auction was conducted to obtain willingness to pay estimates for a premium on a 500g packet of certified Karoo lamb loin chops. Various demographic and behavioural variables were linked to participants' individual bids in order to determine the possible influence of these variables on participants' bidding behaviour. A general positive willingness to pay for certified Karoo lamb was observed, with an average premium of R21.80/ kg recorded for loin chops. The impact of additional information was clearly visible as bids increased substantially after additional information regarding the product was introduced.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of EU mandates for biofuel use in the transport sector initially led to high expectations that African countries would benefit from biofuel exports to the EU. This market opportunity has not been realised, however, due to regulatory requirements for the production of biofuels that act as non-tariff barriers to the acceptance of African biofuels in the EU. This benefits producers of biofuel crops and processors in the EU by providing economic protection. In particular, the EU import regime fails to acknowledge the challenges faced by African (or other) developing countries in satisfying the requirements.Using a computable general equilibrium model for Malawi, we quantify the foregone potential benefits from biofuel production for exports to the EU arising from non-tariff barriers (NTBs) embedded in the sustainability criteria. Our results show that sugarcane-ethanol production under smallholder outgrower regimes would lead to both economic growth outcomes and rural development, whereas jatropha-biodiesel fails to increase rural incomes due to low profitability. While there is widespread agreement on the latter today, our study is the first to explore the failure of jatropha in Malawi in an economy-wide framework. The ethanol results, however, also hold if land clearing is forbidden, thereby preserving biodiversity as stipulated under the sustainability criteria in the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The EU NTBs embedded in the Renewable Energy Directive thus play a much larger role for countries in Sub-Sahara Africa than simply inhibiting investment opportunities and should be refashioned to lower the entry costs for developing countries.",

    "abstract": "The paper investigates if two groups of smallholder sheep farmers who farm using communal grazing land in the N8 development corridor of South Africa can be treated in a homogenous manner. Heterogeneous production environments should result in different production responses, which are unique to the production region. A better understanding of these unique responses could guide the development of improved strategies to increase smallholder livestock production in South Africa. A stochastic production frontier approach was used to evaluate two production districts before grouping the data and estimating the metafrontier. The metafrontier represents a homogenous benchmark for all producers. Results indicate that the two districts cannot be treated the same. Therefore a single production function and strategy cannot be used to improve productivity and efficiency of livestock production in both the districts. The conclusion is that the development of strategies to increase smallholder sheep producers, productivity and efficiency requires an understanding of the production, environmental and institutional factors that the farmers experience within that particular district. Considering the study areas used in the paper, attention to the more technical aspects of production and management can improve the farmers' productivity and efficiency.",

This paper investigates the determinants of social capital using data from farmers in dairy cooperatives in Ethiopia. First, principal component analyses (PCAs) are performed on the data set of dimensions of social capital: structural, relational and cognitive. After applying PCA, composite indicators are developed as measures of farmers' dimensions of social capital. Second, seemingly unrelated regression is employed to identify the determinants of the dimensions of social capital. The results suggest that marital status, education level and length of membership have a positive effect on the structural dimension. The relational dimension has a positive relationship with the ownership of a radio, the number of close friends, and membership in associations, while training access and number of close friends positively influence the cognitive dimension. The study concludes that improving farmers' social capital in dairy cooperatives requires investment in the educational system, creating and developing local associations, promoting cooperatives through mass media, and strengthening the existing training programmes.",

Contrary to the popular belief that rural households in developing countries generally own large herds of livestock for social reasons, communal livestock farmers in the study area who kept livestock for social reasons were found to own smaller herd sizes of cattle. This particular finding indicates that economic reasons for livestock ownership are more important than social reasons among smallholder livestock farmers in this study area. Access to markets and the ability to sell cattle were found to be the strongest influencing factors compared to socio-economic attributes such as marital status, social grants and off-farm employment. Losses due to theft and death were associated significantly with herd size. Recommended policy interventions aimed at increasing the herd size and income of smallholder livestock farmers include government introducing appropriate livestock subsidy programmes that could potentially assist farmers in expanding their herds, investments in efficient protection against wildlife intrusion from game parks, the establishment of well-functioning markets, improved access to roads and market information, and investments in farmers’ education to create awareness of new innovations and practices in breeding and veterinary services.",

However, some authors have asserted that policy makers should understand the values communities hold towards forests before recommending strategies for CBFM.

The Multinomial Logit Model was then used to investigate whether the values households hold towards forests, among other socio-economic and institutional factors, influence households' decisions to participate in self-initiated CBFM programmes. The study found that households' decisions to participate in community forest management depend, not only on the values they hold towards forests, but also on the forest management strategy being pursued. If a protection-oriented management strategy is pursued, households that hold more bio-centric values are more likely to participate, while households that hold more anthropocentric values towards forests are more likely to participate in managing forests when a utilisation-oriented strategy is pursued. Since rural households in KwaZulu-Natal are poor and overwhelmingly hold anthropocentric values towards forests, it was recommended that following the utilisation-oriented forests management strategy to meet the utilitarian needs of the communities would improve household participation, while reducing poverty and ensuring sustainable forest management.",

We find that wealthier households keep more livestock, but population density and access to markets are also key determinants. Moreover, even the wealthiest households switch from cattle to smaller animals in densely populated regions, where pressure on land is high and access to pastures limited. This has important policy implications since it questions the emphasis of most development programs by NGOs and governments in Sub-Saharan Africa which promote dairy cattle.",

Despite its multidimensional nature, the bulk of empirical studies continue to construct and use unidimensional indicators of SC, generating notable disparities in results derived from the use of these alternative measures. This study employed exploratory factor analysis to search for and construct composite measures capturing the multidimensional facets of structural and cognitive social capital (SC) in a rural communal setting in Africa. Our factor analysis revealed eleven factors describing a diversity of SC components, with clear evidence of multiple features of cognitive SC at the household level. On the other hand, evidence of presence of structural SC was limited, which is a general finding of household level analysis of determinants of SC. Not adequately accounting for elements of informal social networks, is an important weakness of our study, and we accordingly strongly recommend that SC research in developing countries should include, as indicators of structural SC, measures of informal social networks.",

The duration analysis approach is applied, providing a statistical method that permits the timing of the adoption event to be explicitly modelled in a dynamic framework. The results highlight the importance of social learning and information acquisition through extension services, media, and a network of fellow farmers in increasing adoption rates for fertilisers and improved maize varieties. Similarly, membership in farmers' associations, access to credit, and risk-loving behaviour positively affect the speed of adoption. Policy insights from the study suggest that strategies for promoting faster adoption should focus on providing information through agricultural extension services, media, and a network of fellow farmers. Additionally, farmers' cooperatives should be given priority as a dissemination pathway that can increase adoption speed for fertilisers and improved maize varieties.",

Using a set of indicators, including income source diversification and participation in social assistance programmes, households were placed in different trajectories, namely, dropping out, stepping up, hanging in and stepping in. A multinomial logit model was used to analyse factors explaining placement in a livelihood trajectory. We find that the explanatory factors are not the same for farmers in different pathways. The stepping-up of households is likely with increasing commercialization and significant asset accumulation. Furthermore, the stepping-in trajectory is constrained by initial land holding sizes but is more likely if a household has had experience with the cultivation of several different kinds of crops. We find that crop diversification reduces the chance of dropping out but also increases the possibility of hanging in, implying that the blanket recommendation to farmers to diversify crop production may not attain the same benefits to all farmers. This may well be complemented with useful extension services, especially for young farming households. Overall, the study findings point to the complexity and the need for context-dependent development approaches to provide sustainable escapes from poverty.",

Using prior information from a rapid post-disaster needs assessment and a social accounting matrix for Malawi, the author assesses distributional impacts and resilience enhancing pathways in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework. This study investigates the economic impacts of Cyclone Idai in Malawi, considering a mix of mitigating policies. Results reveal overall declines in production, trade and welfare. On average, gross domestic product (GDP) at factor cost decreases by 1.5%, primarily driven by sectoral output reductions. Consequently, exports plummet by 5.3%, while production losses lead to increased cereal imports due to soaring demand. However, borrowing and foreign exchange constraints limit imports of other commodities, except for essential food items. Consequently, household welfare deteriorates across all scenarios. A critical insight from this study underscores the significance of government policy choices in shaping economic outcomes during disasters. In Malawi's context, the study demonstrates that fostering a culture of saving, maintaining a government with restrained fiscal tendencies, and avoiding excessive taxation can mitigate production losses and induce investment. Additionally, ensuring exchange rate stability in the short term can help control rising relative prices and facilitate cost-effective imports, provided efforts are made to prevent domestic borrowing costs from escalating.",

    "abstract": "The South African fertiliser industry plays a crucial role in supporting agriculture and ensuring food security. However, the country's dependence on fertiliser imports and inefficiencies in the supply chain pose significant economic and environmental challenges. Although South African farmers have managed to improve fertiliser use efficiency over time, broader application of precision agriculture technologies can enhance fertiliser use efficiency in the future. Sustainable practices and informed policies are necessary to balance agricultural productivity with environmental protection. This study provides an overview of fertiliser import trends, key driving factors, and future perspectives on fertiliser sources and emerging technologies. The study highlights the importance of fertilisers in addressing nutrient deficiencies in key grain-producing regions, such as the Free State, North West, and Western Cape provinces. South Africa's reliance on imports exposes the sector to price volatility and disruptions in the supply chain, influenced by global events like geopolitical tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic. While stable suppliers of imported products like Saudi Arabia and emerging markets like Qatar offer opportunities, challenges remain, including high costs and environmental risks. Precision agriculture technologies offer promising solutions to optimise fertiliser use and mitigate environmental impacts. The article discusses how targeted strategies and the adoption of precision agriculture technologies, such as variable rate applications, can enhance fertiliser efficiency. It also explores the implications of global environmental regulations and alternative fertiliser sources. Ultimately, the study emphasises the need for targeted policies to ensure a sustainable fertiliser supply while meeting the evolving demands of South Africa's agricultural sector.",

Primary data obtained in a cross-section survey of 90 households selected across six communities in Ijebu-Division of Ogun State, Nigeria was used in estimating a system of energy demand equations and elasticities. The study reveals that an average household in the sample had about five members, headed by a 52 year old male that had about nine years of formal education. The mean monthly household consumption expenditure was 15,458.63, of which about 25% was expended on the seven commodities. While the influence of education and household size on household energy use were insignificant; income (budget size), household ownership of electrical/electronic appliances and automobiles, as well as age of household heads exercised significant influence on the relative shares of some/all of the seven energy commodities in household budgets in the study area. The income effects were positive for all the energy commodities, except firewood. Demand for petrol, diesel and domestic gas were income elastic. Thus, the study concludes that improvement in income would cause increase in demand for electricity and petroleum products in the study area, but worsening real income would place greater demand on biomass fuel.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Irrigation farmers in the Lower Orange River were surveyed during October 2003 in order to study whether water marketing has promoted efficiency and to identify factors that affect future investment in irrigation farming. Econometric procedures (principal component and logit model) indicate that purchasers of water rights produce lucrative export grapes and horticultural crops with relatively less raisin, wine or juice grapes and less field crops; are more specialised in production; have more livestock (probably liquidity factor) and have a less negative view of the five-year review period. The water market has facilitated a transfer of water use from relatively lower value crops to relatively higher value crops, and also promoted the use of more advanced irrigation. An investment model using Ridge Regression indicates that the following variables are associated with future investment in irrigation farming; expected profitability, risk perception and risk aversion (Arrow/Pratt). Results confirm that farmers who are more risk averse invest less in the future as can be expected from theory. Policies that increase risk in agriculture will have a significant negative effect on future investment in irrigation. What is significant from the results is that irrigation farmers are highly risk averse (down side). Results also show that farmers who feel that water licenses are not secure expect to invest less in the future. The latter effect is thus amplified as farmers appear to be highly risk averse. This has important policy implications, and measures should be taken to improve the perceived security of water licenses. This could be achieved by keeping farmers more informed about the practical implications of the National Water Act (NWA) and specifically water licenses.",

Sample survey data are used to estimate the parameters of a block recursive regression model. Some of the equations postulated in the model are estimated with two-stage least squares (2SLS) to account for likely correlation between endogenous explanatory variables and the error term. The results show that (a) respondents with secure land tenure (private farms) and larger herds use more agricultural credit than do those who rely on open access communal grazing to raise cattle; (b) secure tenure and higher levels of liquidity from long-term credit and off-farm wage remittances promote investment in fixed improvements to land; (c) liquidity from short-term credit and wage remittances supports expenditure on operating inputs; and (d) herd productivity increases with greater investment in operating inputs and fixed improvements, and is therefore positively (but indirectly) influenced by secure land tenure. It can be inferred that government should (a) uphold private property rights to land where they already exist; (b) privatise open access grazing to individual owner-operators where this is politically, socially and economically feasible; and (c) where privatisation to individuals is not feasible, government should encourage users to convert the grazing into common property by subsidising the transaction costs of defining user groups and the boundaries of their resources, and of negotiating and enforcing rules limiting individual use of common property. This first-step in a gradual shift towards private property might be followed by a conversion of user-groups into non-user groups organised along the lines of investor-owned firms where members exchange use rights for benefits rights.",

Consequently, it is important to measure the specific characteristics that consumers perceive as providing them with utility. In this article a hedonic pricing model is used to investigate the influence of different cowpea characteristics on cowpea prices in Senegal. The results provide valuable information for research institutions, producers, and traders. Cowpea plant breeders should emphasise large grain size as the main characteristic since buyers are willing to pay a premium for this characteristic. This should translate into higher returns on R&D. There exist differences between markets in terms of consumer preferences for testa colour and texture. The result is that sorting and grading of cowpeas according to these characteristics should increase profits, as there would be fewer discounts for undesired characteristics. The importance of adequate storage is also emphasized to protect seeds against insect damage. Finally, it appears that prices in different markets are not equally responsive to changes in the supply of cowpeas. Higher returns could hence be realized through more efficient sequencing of sales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In South Africa, the 1998 National Water Act has created two user-driven water resource management organisations, namely the Water User Association at the local level and the Catchment Management Agency at a larger catchment level. The paper investigates some challenges concerning the participation of smallholders in water resource management organisations involving also large-scale users. Specifically, the paper analyses the possible discrepancies between the needs of smallholders with regard to water and the functions of these organisations. A simple typology of needs concerning water is presented and used to classify the main problems faced by smallholders in selected case studies. In some of the cases studied, smallholders need above all funds for investment in waterworks and their operation. They are not directly affected by water resource management issue, a lack of overlap between their needs and the functions of a water resource management organisation might lead to their unsustainable presence within the organisation. In such cases, one alternative is to achieve cross-subsidization. The National Water Act calls for it, without providing specific requirement. The proposed creation of small-scale user forums in the Olifants Water Management area can be described as cross-subsidization. It might improve the internal organisation among smallholders and give them a voice. Some funds will be dedicated to forums' activities, but they are not entrenched as part of the core functions of the Catchment Management Agency. This analysis shows the importance of undertaking an assessment of smallholder water related needs to orientate the public participation process.",

There is an argument that the high level of taxation of agriculture in favour of industrialization is in part due to the underestimation of the supply response of the agricultural sector. This study tests the theoretical hypotheses that only price, non-price and natural disincentives respectively pose problems for agricultural growth. Johansen's approach to co-integration analysis was employed to test these hypotheses using the time-series data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statistical database. The long-run price elasticity of supply is 0.13 and capital shift supply 18 per cent. The implication of this is that much more in-depth research is needed to identify those factors that affect supply and to describe the effect of factors that shift supply in response to price incentives. This could provide valuable information for government in the use of appropriate policy measures and variables.",

The unpacks the trust relationship between large agribusiness companies and smallholder out growers, and shows that relationships characterised by social factors like trust, commitment, and cooperation enhance mutual benefit and quality relationships between parties. This study found that farmers perceive an element of opportunistic behaviour and a lack of cooperation by millers and therefore have limited trust in the millers. Consequently it was also found that satisfaction by cane growers on their relationship with millers has a positive relationship with their level of trust, level of commitment, relative dependence, perception of opportunistic behaviour by millers and perceived cooperation between themselves and the millers.

The data pertains to a survey of 356 cattle farmers from selected villages of Northern Ethiopia. Findings indicate that 94 per cent of the cattle owners were interested in procuring cattle insurance, and 77 per cent of them were willing to pay the benchmark annual premium of 4 per cent of the animal's value. The average number of cattle that each farmer was willing to insure was nearly three. The findings further indicate that income and education levels of the respondents, among other factors, influence the farmers' attitude towards participation in cattle insurance and the number of cattle to be insured by them. These findings suggest that educating farmers on the benefits of livestock insurance can stimulate this important risk management strategy. Public action may be required to incentivise insurance companies entering the market for the first time and to address the barriers to participation by poor households. Even though our study was restricted to some areas of northern Ethiopia, the findings can have a wider practical application for governmental and non-governmental institutions wishing to establish cattle insurance in developing countries.",

The government, in an effort to counter these challenges, has instituted various policies aimed at reversing the situation. This paper is aimed at examining spatial maize market integration in the presence of non-constant transaction costs and policies implemented. Findings indicate that market pairs close to each other were integrated, had a lower transaction cost and the price differential across markets were quickly corrected compared to markets further apart. Evaluation of the effects of policies on market integration shows the implementation of policies resulted in market distortion. The price difference between surplus and deficit markets were not corrected hence equilibrium was not achieved. When markets are poorly integrated, the price mechanism does not work and price signals cannot be transmitted thus allowing for efficient exchange of food products across spatial markets.To reduce transaction costs in the maize sector, the government should improve the road infrastructure connecting production areas with the markets and between markets. Harmonisation of the local government levies imposed on maize traversing different local municipalities will help reduce transaction costs. On the fertiliser subsidy, the government needs to collaborate with the private sector as it has a wide distribution network countrywide. This will ensure accessibility of the fertiliser by farmers in remote areas. Market forces should guide participation of the marketing board in the maize market. The board should not succumb to political pressure by purchasing maize at a higher price than the market prices.",

    "abstract": "This paper uses panel data from 1,160 smallholder farmers, especially participants and non-participants in twenty-three regional projects from five countries in East Africa – Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. In this paper, regional projects mean projects implemented jointly in at least three countries, thereby providing sustainable regional public goods. Propensity score matching analysis is used to determine the difference in net benefits accrued to the on-farm participants compared to non-participants. The propensity scores show that participants have overall higher crop and livestock productivity, enhanced household income, increased soil and water management, and access to biofortified foods compared to non-participants. These findings indicate that regional projects can catalyse the achievement of smallholder farmers’ food and nutrition security, besides enhancing achievements of the African Union Commission's Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",

In this paper, we study the relationship between a country's genetically modified (GM) food policy and the food self-sufficiency rate (SSR) under conflicting interests, with the example of GM crop regulation and GM maize production in South Africa. We develop a theoretical model of a small open economy and investigate the GM food policy as the outcome of a GM and a non-GM food groups' lobbying game that follows the model of Grossman and Helpman. The government maximises its payoff by considering the weighted sum of social welfare and contributions from interest groups. Our findings suggest that a lower GM food regulation supports domestic agricultural production, and we offer potential reasons why a country that has a low SSR still has a strict GM food policy regulation. We also find that the food SSR is a biased measure of food availability when both production and consumption change simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTEconomic and social stability depend on a healthy, functioning and affordable system of agricultural production and food distribution. In recent years, however, international and domestic food prices have risen considerably, partly as a result of rising oil prices. A growing body of literature indicates that world oil supplies will become increasingly scarce and expensive in the coming years, due to the depletion of easily extractable reserves. This poses a significant threat to agricultural production in South Africa, which is overwhelmingly derived from oil-intensive commercial farming. To mitigate the risk of serious disruptions to food production and distribution, the agriculture sector may require government support in the form of temporary fuel subsidies and, possibly, prioritised fuel access in order to cope with oil price shocks and potential fuel scarcity. Furthermore, to boost resilience and improve sustainability for the longer term, the agriculture sector should embark on a programme aimed at gradually reducing the reliance on petroleum products by adopting practices such as conservation agriculture and agro-ecological farming methods. In addition, since the current food distribution system is heavily reliant on road transport, and thus exposed to fuel price and supply shocks, the mitigation strategy should aim at a partial relocalisation of agricultural production and consumption, for example, by developing urban agriculture.Keywords: national food securityoil dependenceoil shockssustainable agriculturerelocalisationJEL CLASSIFICATION: Q180Q400",

It employs the two-step control function approach to impact evaluation. Results show plausible evidence of the positive impact of households' membership of farmers' groups on the adoption of improved technologies, particularly in the adoption of techniques such as making use of improved seeds, organic fertilizer and improved livestock breeds. However, for farmers to start making use of inorganic fertilizer, the impact is insignificant unless the farmer decides to use both organic and inorganic fertilizers simultaneously. Farmer group participation and household retention in groups in Uganda should thus be encouraged and should be used as an avenue for the dissemination of agricultural technologies in Uganda.Keywords: farmer groupshousehold membershiptechnology adoptionUgandaJel classification: Q01Q16",

The conventional agricultural research and development approaches used hitherto have not yielded much success in stimulating farmer participation in markets. New agricultural development approaches, such as the Integrated Agricultural Research for Development (IAR4D), view developmental challenges as multi-dimensional and as such require multi-pronged and integrated initiatives – better known as innovation systems – to overcome. Using data from IAR4D trials in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique, the study evaluates the efficacy of IAR4D in stimulating market integration and crop intensification. The impact of IAR4D on maize yield, estimated using the local average treatment effect (LATE) is significant in all the countries. Yields improved by margins ranging 107–149 kgha-1, which is quite substantial in a region where yields average around 1000kgha-1. These findings give credence to the proposition that innovation systems such as IAR4D are more effective in stimulating agricultural growth.

A review of the literature provided support for the use of assets owned by a household as an indicator of household resilience. Several methods of constructing household asset indices emerged from the literature reviewed. The application of four of these methods to Demographic and Health Survey data from six African countries is presented in this paper. The resulting indices were used to estimate individual socio-economic status scores for all households. All four methods performed similarly across the assessment characteristics, but yielded different results when the households were grouped into quintiles based on the estimated socio-economic status scores. As suggested by the literature, quintiles were used to classify the study households into categories of socio-economic status based on the estimated socio-economic status scores. However, socio-economic status was not evenly distributed across the study households making the use of a quintile approach inappropriate for grouping the households. Cluster analysis was applied as an alternative to the quintile classification to group the study households. Cluster analysis appeared to be a more effective approach to grouping households, both in that it does not assume an even distribution of socio-economic status across households – as the quintile approach does – and it provides a useful indication of changes in the per cent of households falling into different socio-economic status groups over time.",

    "abstract": "Following the application in March 2013 by the South African Poultry Association for increased tariffs to ensure the sustainability of South African broiler production, this article critically evaluates the effect of increased tariffs on broiler producers and chicken meat consumers in South Africa. Arguing beyond the level of tariffs, it highlights some of the deeper underlying drivers of competitiveness in the industry. From a self-sufficiency perspective, the need to support broiler producers is clear, yet the cost to consumers as well as the segment of the population that would have to bear the cost of higher tariffs is questioned. The proposed tariffs as well as two other possible scenarios are simulated within a partial equilibrium framework in order to determine the effect on the fundamentals of the South African broiler industry. Simulations highlight the difference in outcomes when imports originating from the EU are also included in the general tariff increase. Under the basic scenario that simulates the impact of the current tariff application by SAPA, consumer prices for whole frozen chicken will increase by 2.6% while producers will enjoy an increase in producer prices of approximately 5%. On average, local production will increase by 16 000 tons per annum in the long run. Although 5% is a significant margin on the bottom line for broiler producers and a 2% increase in the average consumer price seems to be digestible, one has to take a step back and ask the question why our chicken producers cannot compete against imported chicken.",

A qualitative review of industry structure revealed a great deal of similarity to market leaders globally. Price formation within broiler production contracts in South Africa utilizes the same tournament pricing used successfully in the USA, resulting in high levels of technical efficiency, however economic efficiency is lacking. Univariate time series analysis confirmed that the domestic price of chicken is more elastic to changes in the import parity price than changes in feed costs. Feed remains crucial to economic efficiency and while declining protein meal prices in the future is plausible given recent investment into the industry, marketing strategies that optimize the returns from an entire carcass could aid effective competition with imported products.",

It has invaded all nine South African provinces. The potential economic impact of R. pseudoacacia on agricultural production stems from the tree's ability to reduce the carrying capacity for livestock. This study estimated the potential economic implications of R. pseudoacacia on agricultural production in South Africa, specifically the livestock sector. R. pseudoacacia's potential distribution was calculated by using a maximum-entropy predictive habitat model, MaxEnt. The distribution of livestock, based on grazing capacity (ha/large stock unit) in South Africa, was then determined. The potential direct economic impacts were estimated by assessing the impact of the potential distribution of R. pseudoacacia on the carrying capacity for livestock. The results showed that an infestation of R. pseudoacacia has the potential to reduce the total gross margin in the livestock sector by between approximately R135 million and R674 million, dependent on the level of invasion. The potential levels of foregone income and business activity found in this study reaffirm the need to devote resources to develop a viable, economical and effective control.",

    "abstract": "This paper emphasises the impact of the ongoing liberalisation of agricultural policies and trade in agricultural commodities on spatial price transmission in agricultural markets. Based on a literature review covering a broad range of topics, the article derives four main conclusions. First, more market-oriented agricultural policies and trade liberalization improve horizontal price transmission in global agricultural markets. Second, in the integrated agricultural markets, some regions tend to lead the price discovery process, which is determined mainly by their role in international trade. Third, with the growing integration of agricultural markets, the significance of local factors such as seasonality is diminishing. Fourth, as markets become more integrated, spontaneous public interventions aimed at the stabilisation of domestic prices are less effective. These findings may help market participants at all stages of the food supply chain to better understand how policy deregulation and trade liberalisation affect price setting in agricultural markets and, consequently, enable them to adjust to these changes more effectively. Furthermore, the paper provides policy implications, as it distinguishes the institutional factors determining the degree of price transmission in agricultural markets and emphasises the decreasing effectiveness of domestic agricultural and trade policies as globalisation in agricultural markets continues.",

Land reform in South Africa has been criticised because of poor implementation and slow pace, accompanied by poor productivity in redistributed land. To explain this, it has been suggested that commercial farms are too large for emerging farmers who have little or no experience in commercial farming. Thus, there have been calls for measures to make subdivision of land easier and cheaper. To this end, cross–sectional survey data from 833 potential emerging farmers in three rural provinces are analysed to determine a viable income for emerging farm households as a basis for calculating a viable farm size, using the income aspiration literature, farm household economics theory as a point of departure. Off–farm income, farm income and aspirational income are included in the calculation. The viable income was matched to the existing commercial farm enterprise gross margins per hectare obtained from the Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy, which are then used as the basis for suggesting \"viable farm sizes\" for different emerging farm households.",

The Harvest of Hope programme provides credit, access to inputs and an outlet for organic vegetables. Comprehensive data on inputs are limited and in this study only land, labour, seeds and seedlings, compost and farmer experience are included. Non-parametric models are used to generate individual efficiency measures relative to best practice. The results revealed an average level of overall, technical and scale efficiency of 72.4%, 79.7% and 90.6%, respectively. Overall efficiency was negatively correlated with land holdings and the use of compost and seedlings. This is supported by the finding that the nine best-practice farms were characterised by a smaller scale of production, indicating that efficiency losses are experienced as greater quantities of inputs are used. In terms of area differences, Nyanga farms exhibit significantly higher technical efficiency, whereas farms in Khayelitsha are more scale efficient. Expenditure on compost and seed added value, although mulching or operator experience did not increase output substantially. The latter can be explained by the highly effective training programme provided that makes prior experience unnecessary to achieve good practice. Fully efficient farms are R2 600 per plot more profitable than inefficient farms, while farms that need a windbreak earn R700 less per plot per season than more sheltered operations. These results are the first of their kind for South Africa and lay the foundation for more effective extension to the sector.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTABSTRACTThe establishment of the World Trade Organization in 1995 and the subsequent proliferation of regional and bilateral trade agreements resulted in the decline of global tariffs. However, other trade and regulatory measures have increased and thus restricted potential trade to some extent. These measures, non-tariff measures (NTMs), have also affected intra-SADC trade as there was no evidence of growth in the trade that needed to accompany the decline in tariffs. The extent of the impact of NTMs on SADC trade is still not fully understood due to lack of such data, which has effectively affected the quality of research in this area. In this article, data on NTMs related to SADC agricultural products for ten countries was compiled to shed some light on these measures, as well as to make them transparent. The results confirm that these countries have increased their use of NTMs over the period 2000 to 2010. As a result, on average one product was subjected to 17 NTMs in 2010. The Southern African Customs Union is the leader in the use of NTMs, while Malawi had the least incidences of NTMs. Most of the NTMs are applied on fruits, meat, dairy, vegetables and cereal products. The use of sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) and of export measures was increasing faster than other categories were. Finally, there is an indication that NTMs are used as substitutes for the declining tariffs. NTMs are trade restricting, and if they are not addressed, they will continue to reverse the gains of the SADC free trade area, as well as other initiatives of trade liberalisation.Keywords: non-tariff measuresagricultural productsSADC tradeJEL classification: F150 and Q170",

    "abstract": "Small-scale aquaculture in Malawi contributes to nutrition and food security, and serves as a rural income diversification strategy. Nevertheless, its adoption is low. Drawing on a recent survey of 732 small-scale fish farms across the country, this study assesses the production, yield, profit, and profit per square metre of small-scale fish farms and explores their determinants using regression analysis. Most fish farms are owned and managed by individual farm-households, though communally owned farms are also present. Small-scale aquaculture is found to be profitable, though the gross margins are slim. Regression results reveal that production and profit are positively associated with the use of farms for both fingerling and grow-out production and the number of years the farm has existed, while yield and profit/m2 are positively associated with the use of high-quality inputs such as commercial feed and inorganic fertilisers. These results suggest that small-scale fish farmers in Malawi and other similar settings should adopt improved technologies and follow best on-farm management practices to increase production and profits. This study contributes to the discourse on the pathway through which aquaculture in Malawi can best contribute to the country's development.",

    "abstract": "When farmers implement GlobalGAP they incur specific input costs that arise from quality requirements of the technology. However, due to the difficultly in observing and measuring food quality, previous empirical studies seldom analysed the relationship between quality improvements in food production and total costs of production. They assumed that product quality itself was exogenous and hence had no effect on productive efficiency or cost of production. This study estimates the impact of GlobalGAP on costs of production while accounting for fixed cost improvements and quality endogeneity. Data were obtained from GlobalGAP-certified small-scale pineapple farmers in Ghana. The hypothesis that product quality was exogenous was tested and rejected. Consequently, a quality-adjusted translog cost function was used to identify the main contributors to cost increases on small-scale GlobalGAP-certified pineapple farms. The estimated function exhibited economies of size, implying that most small-scale adopters are unable to increase output and benefit from lower average costs. Production costs arising from improvements in quality imposed by GlobalGAP are most sensitive to changes in plantlet price, followed by wages, agrochemical price and expenditure on capital items. Smaller small-scale farmers are much more sensitive to increases in capital expenditure than are larger small-scale farmers. Key policy recommendations include joint ventures to increase nursery capacity and competition in the market for plantlets, scrutiny of mandatory fees impacting the cost of imported labour-saving inputs, facilitating sharing arrangements between smallholders to lower the cost of on-farm infrastructure, and research to identify constraints preventing certified farmers from exploiting size economies.",

    "abstract": "Lucerne hay is undoubtedly one of the most important forage crops used in animal nutrition globally. This article sheds light on the intricacies of the South African lucerne hay sector by offering an industry overview. Lucerne hay quality is categorised into different grades: Supreme, Prime, Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3, each exhibiting its distinct characteristics and attributes based on the nutritional value of dairy cattle. The producer price of lucerne hay is driven by supply and demand in the market. These fluctuations reflect the attractiveness of new producers entering or producers exiting the industry, indicating the sensitivity of market dynamics to external factors like weather and international demand. On average, South Africa exports 160 to 240 thousand tons annually, mainly to neighbouring countries and the Middle East. Over the last several years, the Chinese markets imported a growing volume of South African-produced lucerne hay. Weather conditions are one of the leading drivers of changes in the availability, quantity, and quality of lucerne hay in South Africa, impacting the producer price of lucerne hay in the local market. This article aims to provide insight into the dynamics of the South African lucerne hay industry. Additional research is required to understand the interactions of weather conditions (temperature variations, rainfall and occurrence of rainfall) on lucerne hay production and quality. Understanding international demand for South African lucerne hay will provide insight into the competitiveness of South African lucerne hay in the international market.",

    "abstract": "In the literature, the study of tenure and food security has largely involved separate lines of inquiry. In effect, insufficient research on the relationship between tenure and food security hampers the development of knowledge and policy guidance aimed at improving food and nutrition security. Drawing from this motivation, the authors study the relationships among tenure security, on-farm tree diversity, food security and dietary diversity. They employ Instrumental Variable approaches to examine the effect of tenure security and on-farm tree diversity on food security and dietary diversity. They find tenure security is inversely related with food insecurity as shown by its negative association with hunger scale, hunger index and hunger category. Furthermore, results suggest that tenure security improves minimum dietary diversity of women, while no significant relationship was observed with child dietary diversity. Moreover, on-farm tree diversity is positively related with minimum dietary diversity of women, which may point to higher accessibility and consumption of dietary food groups by women. Besides, the findings suggest that farmers leverage their human capital and land resources to enhance food security and dietary diversity. This underscores the importance of improving land access and ensuring tenure security for promoting on-farm tree diversity, food security and dietary diversity. It also highlights the need to explore the relationship between tenure security and food security. By recognizing the critical role of long-term tenure security, the study suggests that policymaking should gear towards developing strategies to foster on-farm tree diversity in order to improve food security and dietary diversity.",

Almost 22 per cent of arable land is unused. Evidence from a sample survey suggests that land rental is precluded by high transaction costs. Transaction costs are high because lessors consider renting to be risky as they could lose their right to land unless they farm it themselves. Nearly 70 per cent of households perceived that they would be dispossessed if they did not show some use of their arable land. Rental transactions were observed only where the risk was low, i.e. where the government or chief was lessor. Results of a diseriminant analysis show that surplus farmers rent in more land, invest more in agriculture and make greater use of credit and extension services than do deficit producers. Area rented was the most important of these discriminating variables. Of those respondents renting, 84 per cent claimed they would increase production if they could access more land. Expansion of farm sizes through renting improves the incentive to farm by lowering unit production costs and by increasing potential gains, as returns to information, innovation and management are scale dependent. Equity improves because rental transactions are voluntary. Inefficient land use is the result of an inefficient land market. Solutions may be found in efforts to reduce transaction costs in the rental market.",

The results support the concept of centre-periphery pattern of service infrastructure development. Polokwane is a major centre in the Province, and provide a composite of services. Its peripheries are regions, which have towns as centres. Health, local government and postal services are mainly found in such regional centres. The district centres provide mainly agricultural and justice services. Finally, local centres provide services of traditional authorities, agriculture and postal services. These patterns have major implication for infrastructure development policy and programs. They also need to be considered in current crafting of institutions for rural economic development.",

The case study confirms once more the power of market incentives in encouraging agricultural activity of peasant farmers even in the absence of functional research and extension systems.

Within this arena of agritourism, the product route phenomena have a somewhat unique character in the sense that three goals are combined namely tourism, produce sales and product brand promotion. The wine routes of the Western Cape that evolved through the years each present a distinct character to its visitors. A study of these routes revealed various interesting facts about modus operandi, problems and achievements, which is of significant value to those interested in establishing similar routes. There seems to be similarities in the reasons for the establishment of each route, being mostly that of the regional promotion of brand names and the promotion of the area itself, as well as promoting product sales. This case study of the Western Cape wine routes provides sound principles and inputs for the development of both the local tourism and local agricultural sectors in the endeavour to improve the quality of life for all through a strong and healthy, sustainable agritourism sector.",

This resulted in declining profitability and purchasing power parity of agricultural products, increasing debts and risk, and the weakening of agriculture's competitive position on international markets. Input price inflation creates cash flow problems for farmers and increases the necessity of a high level of operational management and conservative financial strategies. Individual farmers can possibly counteract the effect of input price inflation through increases in productivity and economizing on costs. Present competitive structures may however possibly result in accelerated input price inflation if increases in productivity and economizing on costs occur for agriculture in aggregate. Solutions will be dictated by general economic policy. More effective competition and the enlargement of effective demand through accelerated urbanization have, at least theoretically, potential possibilities.",

The paper computes the sectoral SAM multipliers and then uses household data on resettled families to simulate the impact of specific land reform models on the economy. The simulated results show that land reform, if well planned and systematically and carefully implemented, could generate economy-wide benefits for Zimbabwe and could lead to income redistribution in favour of low-income household groups, while maintaining an increase in households' aggregate income.",

Budget shares and expenditure elasticities were estimated for household consumption categories for the two study periods, allowing for a comparison of expenditure elasticities between the two seasons. Results suggest that expenditure elasticities for consumer expendables, durables and transport were highly elastic, while expenditure elasticities for the aggregate food category were negative (October) and highly inelastic (March). Analysis of the expenditure categories of tradable and non-tradable goods and services showed expenditure on tradable non-farm goods and services to have the greatest potential for demand-led growth with expenditure elasticities of 2.88 and 2.91, respectively. The category of non-tradable non-farm goods and services was not statistically significant for both periods and the category non-tradable farm goods and services was not statistically significant for October. A seasonal difference in expenditure patterns was apparent, suggesting that responses to income changes vary at different times of the year.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is increasing evidence that most of the fear expressed by consumers in terms of the link between cholesterol in the diet and heart disease is, amongst others, related to the amount of fat in red meat and dairy produce. The result is that many consumers are cutting back on, if not avoiding, red meat products. A major challenge ahead of the beef industry is to supply a product that complies with the demands of more sophisticated and health conscious consumers. But, even if the beef industry could respond positively to consumers' needs, it is uncertain whether consumers would pay more for beef containing less fat. In this paper the willingness of consumers to pay for less fat in selected beef cuts (T-bone and rump) was investigated with a log-linear hedonic price model. The results showed that more affluent consumers in Bloemfontein were (i) willing to pay for additional external fat (this was contrary to expectations). This was attributable to the culture of food consumption and traditional cooking style (braai). The result does not imply that the amount of external fat can be unlimited, but rather that current external fat levels are desired by consumers; (ii) seam fat had a negative impact on prices of the selected beef cuts in Bloemfontein indicating that reducing the amount of a less desired attribute could shift the demand curve outward; (iii) marbling fat did not have a significant impact on prices of selected cuts in Bloemfontein; and (iv) cuts classified as bone-in was discounted by consumers in Bloemfontein. The study further found that one can't merely assume that international trends are applicable to the South African situation, but this needs further research. It is hence proposed that a similar study is conducted for South Africa as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Reforms of agricultural marketing structures have been a major feature of agriculture in New Zealand and South Africa over the past two decades. The reforms in New Zealand varied, and were often measured and considered, with export control either officially or de facto existing in some sectors while others were cut adrift very quickly. Not surprisingly, the results have been mixed. In South Africa all controls were effectively cut adrift, and the jury is still out on the results. A feature of the New Zealand experience has been the adoption of new technologies and even new farming sectors. Productivity showed a distinctive break at 1984, the year of the reforms; up to that date an average of 1.5 percent, past that date an average of 2.5 percent. A similar analysis of productivity in South Africa shows that increases seem to be the result of labour shedding only. The results do not bode well for South African agriculture. The sector is hamstrung by poor physical resources; hardly benefited from the Agreement on Agriculture; seems to be hampered by a lack of innovativeness; and has to contend with the transformation of the sector. Reasons for optimism include the fact that the sector as a whole has benefited from deregulation of agricultural markets, and the prospect that new entrants will bring a new sense of innovation into the industry.",

    "abstract": "Despite the existing vertically coordinated (specifications contracting) relationship between the raisin producers from Eksteenskuil and their buyer, the farmers still face relatively high transaction costs. High transaction costs may cause the farmers to lose their share in the highly profitable fair-trade market for raisins and consequently decrease the contribution of raisin production to the livelihoods of the farmers from Eksteenskuil. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether a higher degree of vertical coordination will be more appropriate to economise the transaction costs faced by the farmers in order to allow them to continue benefitting from the fair-trade initiative. Based on the application of the frameworks of Mahoney (1992) and Peterson et al. (2001), a higher degree of vertical coordination in the form of a relation-based strategic alliance will be more appropriate than specifications contracting. The complementarity between the farmers and their buyer, created by the fair- trade initiative, contribute to the viability of a more vertically coordinated strategy. Similar incentives for private sector-buyers to procure from emerging farmers may create a similar degree of complementarity, and hence an incentive for such buyers to enter into vertically coordinated relationships with emerging farmers.",

Continued productivity benefits all the stakeholders that are involved in the process. Unfortunately, negative productivity levels have been reported in numerous South African land redistribution transfers in recent years. A game theoretic perspective is adopted to illustrate and argue that cooperation among key stakeholders, which could be enforced through long-term contracts between land buyers, sellers and new owners, may lead to maintenance and higher productivity levels and other benefits within the country's land redistribution process. Sugarcane farm transfer cases from two municipality districts in the KwaZulu-Natal province are used to show that the productivity rates in the post-transfer periods within cooperative land sales were more than 10% higher than the rates observed before such transfers. At the opposite end of the scale, the productivity rates in non-cooperative land sales dropped by 12% after the land was sold and taken over by new farmers. Also notable is that the prices paid by government for farms that became less productive after transfers were higher by more than 40% compared to prices paid for productive farms. The cases could be illustrative of the benefits of cooperation in land redistribution transactions.",

The objective of this paper is to determine whether fishery products exporters from Mauritius, a southern African small island developing state, also face similar issues. It first provides an overview of fishery products exports from Mauritius, before reviewing SPS requirements facing exporters. This paper finally reports on the findings of a survey conducted among Mauritian fish exporters to assess the importance of SPS measures as a factor affecting exports. Results show that SPS requirements have not acted as a major barrier for Mauritian exports to the European market but in fact have provided them with a competitive edge. It was, however, acknowledged that SPS requirements and private voluntary standards, to a smaller extent, were increasing in importance. The most important reported factors affecting exports are freight, and other direct export costs. The findings also show that the majority of fishery exporters have adopted a reactive compliance strategy. It is therefore proposed that Mauritian exporters should adopt a more proactive approach in their compliance strategy, increasingly moving towards new market opportunities such as private food safety standards.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThis paper uses a translog cost function approach to study the farm-level demand for poultry feed in Kenya. The study estimates the demand elasticities of the three common types of poultry feed; mixed feed, grain, and leafy vegetables. The estimated model was used to obtain estimates of Marshallian demand elasticities for poultry feed in Kenya for male-headed and female-headed households. The elasticities reported can be used by researchers and policy analysts to evaluate policy effects of changes in feed demand quantities within the livestock economy in Kenya. Moreover, these parameters can provide more reliable estimates of the total change in feed demand than relying on subjective measures of elasticities. Furthermore, the results of this study are essential in enhancing gender equitable policy formulation. Our findings show that own price elasticities of demand for all the feed types are negative and less than unit in absolute value for the sample of farmers surveyed, indicating that the feed types are relatively inelastic. The cross-price elasticities indicate that vegetables and grain are compliments while the rest of the poultry feed types are substitutes. The results also show that there are substantial gender differences in feed demand and elasticities of feed demand with respect to feed prices.",

This study investigated the influence of the World Food Programme's cash and food transfers on the diversity and quality of diets among recipient households in Mozambique and the implications of this for the design of systemic food assistance intentions. The study found that direct food provision improved dietary diversity, while cash enabled beneficiaries to purchase more nutritious foods and improve their diet quality. Both cash and food transfers have potential to generate demand for a variety of nutritious foods in the communities investigated through this study. Providing adequate rations of basic food with a cash portion could improve both dietary diversity and quality and stimulate demand for nutritious foods by addressing both income (purchasing power) constraints as well as stimulating demand for these foods. This demand could have a pull factor in terms of local food systems, stimulating demand not only for food but also for food system services – both upstream and downstream – provided a functioning market exists. Context analysis is necessary to understand if cash injections could lead to price spikes, eroding purchasing power and if the incentives exist for private traders to respond to demand.",

Deterministic efficiency frontiers produce measures of technical efficiency and technical change over time and the results for scale efficiency for each farm and each year show why the farm size results in previous studies are somewhat weak and contradictory. The scale efficiencies are very close to unity and switch from increasing to decreasing returns frequently over the period. This suggests scale efficiency is not important and although decreasing returns to scale dominates it lessens over time. The Malmquist TFP index is the product of technical change and efficiency change, but the usual contemporaneous version gives unreasonable results, as technical change and efficiency change move violently in opposite directions, making interpretation difficult. Since technological regression is not possible in such a short time period the sequential Malmquist is used as it prevents this occurrence. This shows that technological change has been very limited and that efficiency has also improved very little and thus the Malmquist TFP index has also grown very slowly, which bodes ill for South Africa's competitive position. The differences between the old and new districts are minimal, but growth was slightly higher in the newer regions.",

The underlying accounting policies and related notes on biological assets must be presented in such a way that users can understand the transactions and valuation considerations that affect their performance (IASB, 2018a). Financial statement valuations and disclosures are informed by the requirements of the prescribed International Accounting Standards, which presumes that users “have a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and accounting and have a willingness to study the information with reasonable diligence” (IASB, 2018a). The accounting standards thus urges reporters to consider the usefulness of the information disclosed in the financial statements, as it may influence the decisions of users (IASB, 2018a). In systematically documenting the decision-enhancing disclosure for biological assets as required by users, the reporters have a comprehensive guideline to ensure that the disclosure is objective and a more accurate presentation of the real value.

We next test the conventional explanations hypothesised in the literature – labour market imperfection related to costly monitoring of hired workers and omitted variable bias related to soil quality – and find that neither of them essentially explains the inverse relationship. More importantly, we account for agricultural intensification and found no relationship between plot size and productivity. This suggests that the inverse relationship posited in the literature could simply arise from neglecting the impact of agricultural intensification.",

It identifies 30% of farmland by farm size and type and provides estimates of financial performance in each class. Three redistribution scenarios are considered – proportional redistribution, targeting large bona fide operations and targeting lifestyle land. The basic premise is still willing buyer willing seller. Changing the acquisition rules hardly affects the number of beneficiaries or the cost of redistribution but demonstrates that it is important not to overpay for lifestyle land. A redistribution plan for smallholder and settlement-orientated land users is added to the commercial plan according to Aliber's ratios. Commercial redistribution will involve 33 farms with a combined area of 2113 km2 at a total cost of between R352–384 million (using 2015 prices) and will include scope to provide for 132 commonage farmers and 660 settlement-orientated land users. Two-thirds of the land involved was for sale in January 2019 or could be enticed onto the market relatively easily because it has a low opportunity cost in agriculture and the plan would reach as many beneficiaries as there were indigent households in the district in 2017.",

    "abstract": "Improved soybean varieties and agronomic practices have been widely disseminated to smallholder farmers in Malawi over the last 15 years. However, there is no empirical evidence on the welfare impacts of adopting improved soybean technologies. This paper estimated the poverty impacts of adopting improved soybean technologies using data from 1,234 households in six soybean growing districts accounting for over 80% of the total soybean production in the country. The results from an endogenous switching regression model showed that 32% of the sample households adopted improved soybean varieties and agronomic practices. The adoption benefits were higher for female-headed households and increased with the household head's education and cultivated land areas. A comparison of the observed and counterfactual incomes for adopters based on the international poverty line of US$1.90 per capita per day showed a 4.16 percentage-point reduction in poverty among the sample households, translating to over 150,000 people lifted out of poverty. The household head's education level, household size, cultivated land area, livestock size, and asset ownership are associated with the daily per capita income. The results point to the need for scaling up of improved soybean varieties and agronomic practices for greater impacts on poverty reduction among smallholders in Malawi.",

Our primary focus is on the distribution of TE over farm size, so that we may assess the productivity and efficiency relationship with land that has been discussed extensively in the literature. We hypothesize that the distribution of TE over farm sizes is non-linear. To test our hypothesis, we use the Living Standards Measurement Study–Integrated Surveys on Agriculture and a stochastic production frontier with Greene's (2005) true random effects framework. Specifically, we ask if smaller farms – within the range of farm sizes prevalent in Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda – are more technically efficient than larger ones after accounting for a number of attributes often ignored such as measures of the production environment, including transportation infrastructure, public extension visits, among other characteristics. The results confirm a robust overall inverse relationship between farm size and land productivity in all three countries. However, the relationship between farm size and TE is positive across some size segments, resulting in a U-shape distribution.",

It employs a double-hurdle approach to analyse the factors influencing adoption and intensity of ISMA technologies among households, using cross-sectional data of 643 farmers from the two states. The results show that the estimated coefficients of exogenous income and proximity to extension office are negatively significant (P < 0.05), while higher total farm income, polygamous households, past participation in on-farm trials, awareness of the technology, contact with extension agents and access to cash remittances are positive and significant (P < 0.01), and are the most significant factors likely to influence ISMA technologies adoption. Marital status, household size, farm size and access to cash remittances are most significant factors influencing adoption intensity. Maize farmers in the study area who adopted ISMA technologies obtained higher output than the non-adopters, which resulted in a positive and significant effect on their total farm income. Hence, policies targeted at increasing maize productivity through Striga management need to include ISMA technologies as a potentially feasible option. The study recommends actions to improve farmers’ access to financial services to increase their liquidity. Nevertheless, the most immediate action will be improvement in farmers’ access to extension services as they have proved to be a reliable source of information in the rural areas.",

However, it has become necessary to explore how this form of collective action affects farmers' productivity and efficiency. In this study, the impact of access to mutual labour support on productivity and technical efficiency was estimated using data collected from 592 smallholder maize farmers in Northern Ghana. The study uses a translog stochastic production frontier model, while accounting for sample selection bias that may emanate from both observable and unobservable household characteristics. Farmers with access to mutual labour support are significantly more productive and technically efficient than those without, with mean technical efficiency in the range of 0.62–0.71 for farmers with access to mutual labour support and 0.55–0.60 for those without access. Sex, education, spraying machine ownership, farm size, extension visits, access to credit, and membership of farmer-based organisation are significant determinants of access to mutual labour support. Policies to help farmer groups and extension agents promote mutual labour support accessibility among farmers are recommended.KEYWORDS: Mutual labour supportstochastic frontier modelselectivity biastechnical efficiencyViolin plotJEL CODE: Q12 Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

The results revealed that while within group performances were comparable across districts, there were huge differences in between group performance. These differences are partly attributable to natural resource endowments, but institutional arrangements also contribute significantly to local success. This suggests that to achieve rural regeneration public–private partnerships are necessary to address this issue.

    "abstract": "In most developing countries deforestation has reached alarming rates. In view of their relevance for the local economy (e.g., as a source of foreign exchange earnings and supply of fuelwood), an adequate management of forest resources should be pursued. In these economies forest exploitation and land conversion have often been seen as a temporary solution to structural problems. In this way, however, the same problems are even aggravated in the long run. The study first reviews recent explanations of tropical deforestation: a distinction is drawn between areas of substantial agreement on the one hand, and discordant results and interpretations on the other. In the main part of the analysis, based on cross-country data for the 1980s, regression models incorporating different sets of determinants of deforestation are applied. Compared to previous studies, the analysis tries to better account for the sequential timing of some of these determinants. Different patterns are identified among country groups, according to specific features of economic activities, macroeconomic and political environments, and climatic conditions.",

In realising a programme of rapid and effective land reform it is important that all possible options of land transfer to previously disentitled South Africans should be pursued. This paper briefly describes the different options for land reform in South Africa and discusses the progress made in implementing the land reform programme of the government and each of the options outside the programme. Based on current trends in the land redistribution programme and private land and a number of other assumptions it is estimated that around 0.39% of commercial farm land in South Africa could be transferred through a combination of models to less advantaged groups by the end of 1996.",

Attention is focused on interest groups opposed to changes in customary tenure, and policies designed to 'supply the institutional changes needed to support an active rental market.

The results indicate that the decision to sell or not to sell maize is influenced by income from off farm activities, past experience with marketing channel, access to agricultural information through news papers, participation in agricultural schemes, family members without education, and farm size. While the choice of maize marketing chain is influenced by transportation costs and farm size. Therefore efforts to maize farmers to easily access agricultural information in a manner that they can understand would have to be encouraged. Also policies that would enable farmers to organize themselves and organize their marketing activities to reduce transportation costs and increase the area under cultivation can ensure efficient utilization of the formal markets, and subsequently improve the fanners' income.",

Two requisites for the application of this proposed approach needs to be emphasized: (i) A reasonable level of data and information is required. It is however, believed that this data base is sufficiently representative for South Africa's various regions to determine major policy approaches and support programmes. The establishment of commodity based linkages and multipliers will further enhance these processes; (ii) In the present South African environment consultation and participation of all relevant groupings during policy making processes seem imperative. Each region will have to give content to this aspect in its own right.",

As a result this paper uses a Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) to determine whether wheat production would have a comparative advantage if produced under organic practices. The paper starts by analysing the comparative advantage of wheat under conventional4 practices, and later contrasts conventional with organic practices. The results of the analyses mainly indicate a comparative advantage for wheat grown under organic practices especially when the social cost benefit ratio (SCB) is incorporated into the analyses. This is because the domestic resource cost (DRC) criterion that is used by the PAM is confirmed to understate the social profitability of systems that use domestic factors intensively like organic wheat systems and favours systems that use less of these factors like conventional systems. The results also show the existence of distortions in the market even if wheat were to be produced under organic practises, although these are shown to be less than for wheat produced under conventional practices.",

Competitiveness was measured in terms of the Relative Comparative Advantage (RTA) using data from FAOSTAT 2002, while trade perspectives were examined using data from the World Trade Organisation and the Trade and Industrial Policy Strategies (TIPS) databases. The results of the RTA show that South Africa's agricultural food chains are marginally competitive internationally, whereas Argentina and Australia's agricultural food chains are internationally competitive. The analysis also shows that South Africa has managed to move up the value chain relative to Argentina and Australia. Nevertheless, competitiveness decreases in all three countries when moving from primary to processed products in the chains, which implies that value-adding opportunities are limited. Based on their competitive status, there is a potential in certain agro-food chains for supply chain integration and co-operation. Strategic alliances are important instruments for competitiveness. They create flexibility in operations, enhance technology transfer and networking and exploit possible complementary and supplementary relations between industries and organisations.",

Several studies have investigated various aspects of performance of these schemes but no single study has yet measured their performance using an objective set of criteria. Four categories of such objective criteria are proposed: poverty alleviation; empowerment and participation; institutional arrangements and governance; and financial performance. This paper focuses only on the financial performance criteria. Recognised indicators of financial performance are applied to balance sheet and income statement data provided by four equity-share schemes in the Western Cape province. This analysis highlights problems with several of the conventional ratios used to measure profitability, solvency and growth when they are applied to recently restructured farming enterprises whose 'empowerment' status attracts exceptionally high levels of debt capital to finance long-term investments. To avoid these problems it is recommended that, for equity-share schemes, profitability should be measured by the return on assets or dividend return; solvency by the debt/asset ratio; liquidity by cash flow projections; growth by changes in the (estimated) real value of shares; and workers' total returns by changes in the sum of the real wage bill, capital gains, dividends, interest and other benefits accruing to workers in aggregate.",

The methodological developments since the change to democracy ten years ago are viewed in the context of developments in this area of research carried out internationally. It will be shown in this paper that the modelling and computing techniques have vastly improved during the past decade, both in an ongoing attempt to refine existing models, and in an attempt to extend the modelling framework to make provision for issues that cannot be sufficiently captured in the standard comparative static models. These extensions include dynamic modelling, global modelling, environmental modelling and micro simulation. The paper highlights the non-trivial data requirements of this type of modelling. The national statistical agency, Statistics South Africa, supports general equilibrium modellers by their development of input-output tables, social accounting matrices and, more recently, supply and use tables. This decade has therefore witnessed an improvement in the data for the construction of national level social accounting matrices. Requirements for provincial level data have however not been met sufficiently, posing huge challenges for provincial and regional modelling. The lack of primary data has however stimulated development of advanced data estimation techniques that can be applied to overcome this data challenge. Application of general equilibrium techniques to analyse agricultural issues in South Africa still remains limited and substantial support and training of researcher is still needed to expand domestic capacity in this field of research.",

Total gross margin risk resulting from production risk of alternative deficit irrigation practices was quantified using an irrigation simulation model and stochastic budgeting procedures. Results showed increasing production variability with increasing levels of deficit irrigation, especially when rainfall has significant potential to contribute to the production process. Risk-averse decision makers are more willingly to adopt deficit irrigation schedules for maize due to increased effective rainfall. The conclusion is that the potential to use rainfall more effectively through deficit irrigation is a key variable determining adoption of deficit irrigation strategies by risk-averse decision makers. Localized weather forecasts may improve acceptance of deficit irrigation by risk-averse decision makers. The value of information for weather forecast might be low because of high risk premiums placed on full irrigation by risk-averse decision makers.",

In order to manage this scarce supply of water, we need to value it. This study focuses on the value of water in the agricultural sector, in particular the marginal revenue of water for six irrigation commodities namely avocados, bananas, grapefruit, mangoes, oranges and sugarcane. A quadratic production function was fitted with an SUR model specification in a panel data study from 1975 to 2002 to obtain marginal revenue functions for each of the six commodities. We found that mangoes are the most efficient commodity in its water use relative to revenue generated (marginal revenue of water equals R25.43/m3 in 2002) and sugarcane the least efficient (marginal revenue of water equals R1.67/m3 in 2002). The marginal revenue of water is not an indication of the true \"market\" price. Neither is it an indication what the administered price should be. The marginal revenue of water is rather a guideline for policy makers to determine which industries or commodities within an industry can generate the largest revenue per unit water applied.",

This represents 3.8 per cent of the farmland originally available for redistribution in 1994. The annual rate of land redistribution in the province fell from a peak of 1.06 per cent in 2002 to 0.41 per cent in 2003, following an increase in the real price of farmland. Transactions financed only with government grants accounted for almost one-half of the redistributed farmland. However, the quality of farmland financed with grants awarded under government's land redistribution programme was poor relative to that financed privately. The LRAD programme introduced in 2001 improved government's contribution to land reform, attracting private capital and expertise into the process. Unfortunately, the number of transactions financed with a combination of LRAD grants and mortgage loans fell from 14 in 2002 to just six in 2003. It is recommended that all reputable banks (and not just the Land Bank) should be allowed to approve LRAD grants for eligible clients. Previously disadvantaged women gained less land, and much less land wealth, than did their male counterparts. Somewhat surprisingly, women were well represented in transactions financed by Ithala Finance and Investment Corporation to establish emerging sugarcane farmers. However, the same was not true of clients financed by the Land Bank.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The pace of rural-urban migration relative to urban job creation is of particular relevance in relation to the level of urban unemployment and poverty in many developing countries. Faced with high levels of urban unemployment and other socio-economic problems governments in developing countries adopted several policies to ameliorate the situation. Since such policies were mainly urban biased in nature it not only failed in most cases but also in some instance exacerbated the situation by stimulating more rural-urban migration. Rural-urban migration occurs where there is economic disparity between rural and urban areas. Some economists therefore, argue that boosting agricultural productivity and/or income can reduce the incidence of economic problems partially posed by rural-urban migration. In this paper, an attempt is made, using a recursive equation system and a South African data set for the period 1965–2002, to measure the indirect agricultural input elasticity of rural-urban migration. The results indicate that narrowing the urban-rural income differentials can reduce the massive rural-urban migration and high urban unemployment in the country. It is furthermore shown that developing agricultural land and infrastructure and increasing fertilizer use can boost agricultural income, reduce rural-urban migration and is consistent with policies aimed at curbing urban unemployment.",

The analyses acknowledge the importance of quantifying the probability of failure or success when making investment decisions. Risk is incorporated into a standard net present value analysis using risk simulation. De-trended historical auction prices of live game and on-the-hoof prices of weaner cattle were used to quantify price variability. The stochastic net present value analyses indicate that game ranching is more profitable than cattle farming. Although an investment in a limited number of common game species is financially feasible, the cash flow analysis indicates a decreasing probability of making more money with game when annual cash flows are compared to those generated by means of cattle farming. Both the high-value game species scenarios are financially unfeasible during the first five years. These infeasibilities stem from a high probability of not covering instalments to finance game purchases, the extent to which these instalments are not covered, and the high probability of shortfalls in consecutive years.",

This is the first empirical study on South African grain producers' preferences to adopt derivative contracting and is based on the survey data of Grain South Africa for 2006. With the application of separate binary logit models for each major grain commodity, this paper establishes that different grain farmers are significantly heterogeneous. The results also show that grain farmers' preferences to adopt derivative contracting are mostly influenced by the farmers' prediction of daily grain prices and trends, farm size and various geographic characteristics. From a policy perspective it has been indicated that food and income insecurity will be reduced if farmers can adopt derivative contracting at large scale since it will enable the producers to produce staple food on a continuous basis at a relatively profitable level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fresh water resources provide a platform for complex and often emotional issues to develop, particularly in resource scarcity situations. Bulk water infrastructure contains elements of a public good and proved vulnerable to failures in market and government driven allocation strategies. Common to both are uncaptured costs and benefits due to shortcomings in cost quantification techniques. Natural ecosystems stands to lose the most since ecosystem services are often not quantifiable in monetary terms and therefore neglected in allocation decision-making. This paper took on the challenge of expanding current decision-support in order to promote more inclusive long-term water management. A case-study approach with the focus on a choice related problem regarding different long-term bulk water resource management options was applied in the Western Cape province. The paper incorporated components of economic valuation theory, a public survey and a modified Delphi expert panel technique. Both spatial and temporal dimensions of the decision-making context were expanded. Two surveys were completed to accommodate these expansions. The first focused on public preference in water allocation management and the relative merit of accommodating public preference in highly specialised decision-making such as long-term water allocation decision-making. The second survey utilized a modified Delphi technique in which an expert panel indicated the relative merit of two alternative long-term allocation strategies. A willingness to pay for “greener” water was observed and may be used to motivate a paradigm shift from management's perspective to consider, without fear of harming their own political position, “greener” water supply options more seriously even if these options imply higher direct costs to public.",

However, the profitability of VR application of inputs has not yet been investigated under South African conditions. This paper studies the maize yield response to variable-rate application of phosphorus (P) and the profitability thereof in South Africa, on the basis of data collected on a 104-hectare experimental field on a farm in the Bothaville district. The strip-plot design of 180 strips was used for this on-farm research experiment. This design involved treatments that run in the same direction across the field as planting and harvesting. The objective is to determine the maize crop response functions under different P rates and to estimate the profitability of VR relative to the single-rate (SR) application of P. The methodology involves modelling maize yield response functions for P under VR and SR treatments, and for different management zones. A spatial quadratic regression model is developed, according to which yield is estimated as a function of applied P, the treatment and management zones. The results indicate that yield response to P varies between VR and the SR application methods, as well as between management zones. Variable-rate treatment results in higher profits than the SR treatment.",

Results of a ridge regression analysis show that dairy herd size, the level of farm debt, annual production per cow, technology and policy changes over time, and the ratio of trading income to total milk income influence the long-term competitiveness of these milk producers. To enhance their competitiveness in a deregulated dairy market, relatively small and profitable EG milk producers should consider increasing their herd sizes, as the importance of herd size in explaining competitiveness suggests that size economies exist. All EG milk producers should consider utilising more pasture- and forage-based production systems to lower feed costs and select dairy cattle of superior genetic merit to improve milk yields on pasture.",

    "abstract": "Mushrooms have been cultivated in Swaziland since 2001 as part of a long-term programme that seeks to improve rural livelihoods through commercial production of non-conventional high-value commodities. Despite the availability of niche markets, and various forms of support received by producers, Swaziland is still a net importer of locally consumed cultivated mushrooms. This study uses a value chain approach to identify the underlying factors constraining local production and producers' participation in mainstream markets. Understanding the nature of these constraints and how they can possibly be alleviated is very important from a policy perspective as this process will inform the formulation of improved market access strategies required to achieve the programme's overall objective. The results indicate that availability of marketable surplus is affected by production constraints emanating from lack of access to key inputs and services, which are centralised and fully controlled by the government. While producers currently attain higher gross margins (in absolute value and as a proportion of consumer price) compared with other actors in alternative marketing channels, their efforts to participate more profitably in mainstream markets are hampered by poor value chain governance and lack of vertical coordination, subjecting both producers and buyers to various forms of transaction costs. In attempting to address the identified constraints, this study calls for privatisation of key services, allowing the government to assume a monitoring role. Further recommendations are also made towards institutionalising and strengthening collective marketing under different options, which reflect producers' socio-economic status and the prevailing institutional environment in Swaziland.",

This recent (re)appreciation of the role of nutrition as a fundamental element of development policy and a driver of economic growth generates the need for new analytical tools to determine the potential nutritional gains of development programmes and policies as well as the costs of not acting on nutrition imperatives in multisectoral public policy initiatives. This shifts the focus of policy analysis towards multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary domains, creating a need for training and research that spans multiple disciplines in which most graduates and professionals do not yet have the training and tools to conduct appropriate analyses. Capacity is essential to address critical skills shortages and high demand and professional development to keep pace with change. This paper identifies what the implications of recent development imply for agricultural economics training institutions, research and the profession in general and in particular in South Africa.",

This hurt the three vertical value chains as constraints in the laterals choked key segments of the verticals. (2) Vulnerability of the whole value chain emanated from vulnerability to shocks of critical \"hotspot\" linchpin segments (such as livestock auctions) or infrastructure (such as at ports). (3) Collective, industry-level \"pivoting\" was crucial both to organize the private sector response and to interact with government to course-correct on COVID-19 policies. (4) Responses to pre-COVID-19 challenges (such as drought and international phytosanitary rule changes) had prepared the beef and citrus value chain actors to respond collectively to the pandemic challenges. (5) Individual firm- and segment-level \"pivoting\" was also crucial for resilience, such as cattle auctions going on-line with the help of e-commerce firms.",

Leveraging on the proposed unifying lens, a cross-sectional dataset from a survey of 230 cattle farmers in the Okhahlamba Local Municipality is employed in the analysis of a Double Hurdle model. In line with the transaction cost hypothesis, the preliminary results suggest that education and cattle productivity influence positively the decision to participate in cattle markets, and given positive decision, the supply volume increases with proximity to rural towns. Vindicating the store-of-wealth hypothesis, the results also show a negative effect of access to water sources on the market participation decision, coupled with a positive and negative effects of cattle productivity and expected price, respectively, on supply volumes.

We used the Malawi Third Integrated Household Survey data, commissioned by National Statistical Office, in which 5 711 households were randomly sampled and interviewed from March 2010 to March 2011. The article fits a simulated maximum likelihood multivariate probit to the data. With respect to the policy variables considered in the analysis, unlike higher education levels and older household heads, younger household heads are more likely to keep small ruminants and non-ruminant livestock. Extension contact and credit access did not promote the keeping of small ruminants and non-ruminant livestock. There is a strong location bias towards keeping small ruminants in the central region of Malawi while there is also a bias against keeping pigs in southern Malawi. Reshaping extension packages toward well rounded crop-livestock messages is an important factor to consider in promoting small ruminant and non-ruminant production in Malawi.",

Maize area planted in the short run or the long run (or both), is found to depend on two sets of variables. One group changes the quantity or supply (area) of maize directly, like own price, the prices of substitutes like sorghum and sunflowers, and complementary intermediate input prices. The other variables change the supply environment, like rainfall, farmer education, R&D and cooperative extension. Sorghum is found to be a secondary crop dominated by expected changes in the maize variables, and the area planted depends simply on intermediate input prices and rainfall over both the short and long run. These results further illustrate the dominance of maize and maize policies in production decisions in the summer-rainfall areas of South Africa.",

The study is based on a cross sectional survey of 125 small-scale cattle farmers interviewed in the Venda region of the Northern Province. Empirical multivariate and the logistic regression analysis show that liquidity, human resource, satisfaction with the programme and structure of production significantly influences farmers' willingness-to-pay. However, the most important factor influencing both the willingness-to-pay and the dipping frequency is liquidity (employment). The results of this study have important implications for the delivery of veterinary services particularly in developing regions.",

First, it uses a general circulation model (GCM) to model future climate change in the Western Cape, particularly with respect to precipitation. Second, a sector mathematical programming model of the Western Cape farm sector is used to incorporate the predicted climate change, specifically rainfall, from the GCM to determine the effects on key variables of the regional farm economy. In summary, results indicate that future climate change will lead to lower precipitation, which implies that less water will be available to agriculture in the Western Cape. This will have a negative overall effect on the Western Cape farm economy. Both producer welfare and consumer welfare will decrease. Total employment in the farm sector will also decrease as producers switch to a more extensive production pattern. The total decline in welfare, therefore, will fall disproportionately on the poor.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this study was to perform causality tests between agriculture and the rest of the economy using a Granger (1969) causality test procedure. Years of bi-directional causality were found between agriculture and manufacturing and services sectors before 1975. During this period, markets were major actors of economic activity and various positive measures, which encouraged the participation of the private sector in economic activity, were implemented. The contribution of agriculture to growth in the manufacturing and services sectors was not significant between 1978 and 1998. This can be attributed to two factors. Firstly, various policies that discouraged private sector participation in economic activity were implemented during the socialist era (between 1978 and 1992). Secondly, although markets were major actors of economic activity between 1992 and 1998, the economy was in a process of transition. Thus little can be expected in such a short time. The contribution of agriculture to growth in the manufacturing sector has been improving since 1989. It is concluded that the freer agriculture is from policy constraints, the higher its contribution becomes to growth in the manufacturing and services sectors.",

The elasticity of substitution between input pairs in South African agriculture has declined considerably from 1960–1972 to 1973–1985. Total agricultural production seems to have more flexibility in dealing with input price variation than either wheat or maize production as distinct sub-sectors. U.S. agriculture exhibits much more flexibility in dealing with especially machinery price variations. The relative rigidity of the South African agricultural production process may at least partially be attributed to present competitive structures.",

The study results indicate that factors that influence farmers' decisions to adopt soil conservation technologies may not necessarily be the same factors that influence the subsequent decision on levels of adoption. Farmers' knowledge of the effects of soil erosion, age of the household head and farm labour availability were found to be the main factors influencing the adoption of soil conservation technologies by smallholder farmers, while factors that usually affect profitability at farm level such as output level, labour and land size were the main influencing factors on the extent of adoption. The implication of these results is that different policy prescriptions on soil conservation should be guided by the goals the government wants to achieve. For example, the government may want to persuade more farmers to participate in soil conservation or alternatively, to encourage farmers already using the technology to intensify their involvement.",

Commodity futures markets should be efficient to play the most effective role in price risk management. This paper tests for weak-form efficiency in the South African Futures markets for wheat and sunflower seeds by examining the predictability of daily futures price changes. The results suggest that futures price changes for both wheat and sunflower seeds are partially predictable from past price information. The implication is that past price information does contain additional information that could be used to forecast the future price once the current future price is known. But when taking into account the brokerage costs and the time value of money, out-of-sample predictive performance of the model indicates that trading decisions based on the direction of predicted futures price changes do not lead to profitable trades for either crop. Hence, the evidence suggests that there is no strong support for weak-form inefficiency in South African futures markets for wheat and sunflower seeds. The results further suggest that there is no trend in market efficiency over time for wheat and sunflower seeds, except for the wheat December contract.",

    "abstract": "Abstract FR Tomlinson Commemorative Lecture held on 6th June 2006 at Elsenburg. Agricultural policy in the past was characterized by elementary objectives such as stabilisation, protectionism, deregulation and producer interests. Future policy direction faces the complexity associated with post-modernism. In this regard, global markets are considered increasingly saturated, unfair, inequitable, volatile, concentrated and dominated by supply chains and retailers. Agricultural firms are moving beyond a producer orientation towards firms that focus on creating value from size, non-farm business, service orientation, more open management style, greater human capital, accelerated self-renewal, innovation, marginalizing commodities, retaining and unlocking further value from traditional business. Furthermore, contemporary issues like land reform and empowerment remain key challenges but suffer from deficiencies in bureaucracy, beneficiary selection, forms of ownership, and generally incentives to engage markets. Empowerment efforts however favour asset acquisition instead of human capital formation and entrepreneurship. Addressing these challenges requires a reconceptualisation of the role of the state and markets. The argument strongly advanced is for greater integration between state and market whereby markets are incentivised to perform and execute economic programmes.",

The previous study proposed four broad criteria to measure performance: poverty alleviation; empowerment and participation; institutional arrangements and governance; and financial performance. This paper does not aim to assess the performance of existing equity-share schemes but to develop a methodology for the first three criteria based on empirical analysis of data gathered in 2004 from a land reform project in the Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal and seven established equity-share schemes in the Western Cape. Poverty alleviation is measured using a transition matrix of households grouped by four different symptoms of poverty: current income, wealth, health and a principal component index of housing quality. Eight categories of indicators are recommended for empowerment and participation: control and ownership; skills transfer; understanding; information; outcomes; trust; outreach; and participation. A scorecard applying norms based on empirical evidence gathered at the equity-share schemes in the Western Cape is used to test the indicators. A scorecard approach is also applied to institutional arrangements and governance, which are measured using three categories of indicators: accountability, transparency and property rights. The proposed performance measures are relevant, manageable in number and have feasible norms based on empirical evidence. These indicators and their norms need to be tested on a wider scale and monitored over time. Future research should be undertaken to determine weights for the empowerment and institutional indicators.",

Empirical recursive models show that a high level of satisfaction in the working relationship results in these farmers trusting the pack-house agent more. High levels of trust, in turn, lead to higher levels of both commitment to, and cooperation in, the supply chain. A simultaneous-equation model showed that EFO members with higher levels of commitment tend to be more cooperative, and that members with higher levels of cooperation tend to be more committed toward the working relationship. These results suggest that strategies to improve the working relationship with the pack-house agent need to promote satisfaction, trust, cooperation and commitment. For example, co-investment in better crop storage facilities at farm-level would promote satisfaction and hence trust. There is also scope for more cooperation in the planning of new organic crop products to grow and market, and to remove some price uncertainty by giving EFO farmers more information about prices that they will be paid by the pack-house in this supply chain.",

Previous international research on farmers' forward pricing behaviour found inconsistent results with respect to the relationship between risk aversion and the use of forward pricing methods. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is used in this research to investigate the relationship between the proportion of maize Vaalharts maize producers are willing to forward price and risk aversion. The quantity decision is modelled conditional on the adoption decision to ensure that the modelling procedure does not force the same variables to influence the two decisions in the same way. Regression results showed that more risk averse farmers are forward pricing a larger proportion of their crop produce. The main conclusion from this research is that the relationship between farmers' risk aversion and the quantity of maize forward priced is consistent with expected utility theory in spite of the fact that farmers needs to be less risk averse to adopt forward pricing. Future emphases should be placed on the factors affecting the adoption of forward pricing as risk management tool in order to promote risk management. Especially research that will change farmers' perception about forward pricing is necessary.",

The ability of minimise unit costs of producing milk, while not curtailing output levels, is often a determining factor of the long-term survival of dairy farms in South Africa. In this study, average cost curves showing the variation of unit cost with output are estimated for dairy production in the KwaZulu- Natal Midlands of South Africa, using a panel of 37 farms for the period 1999 to 2007. The results show that economies of size exist, with larger farms able to produce any given level of output at lower costs compared to their smaller counterparts. The study found that the long-run average cost curve (LAC) for the sample of dairy farms is L-shaped rather than U-shaped. The best farmers, in terms of average costs of producing a litre of milk, are found between the 100 000 to about 170 000 litres of milk per year output range and these were found to spend less than R1 per litre.",

Soybeans are the only field crop produced in sufficient quantities in the province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) that the South African industrial biofuel strategy identifies as a potential biodiesel feedstock. Results from a mixed integer linear programming model suggest that significant government support is required to stimulate biodiesel production, and support the notion of Funke et al. (2009), who contend that the incentives and commitments outlined by the industrial biofuel strategy are inadequate to both establish and sustain a domestic biodiesel industry. Under baseline assumptions, a minimum implicit subsidy of R4.37 per litre is required to draw soybean-based biodiesel production into the optimum solution. Results also show that the implicit subsidy is sensitive to changes in the soybean oilcake (by-product) price and the soybean (input) price.",

The study shows that seed quantity and access to credit are the most significant factors influencing the adoption of mulching technology. Yam farmers in the study area who adopted mulching technology were found to experience a higher output supply than non-adopters, which resulted in a positive and significant effect on their output and net return.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article is based on research conducted in early 2012 in the Cape Winelands municipality in South Africa. It considers the gendered dynamics of employment in two wine export value chains. In one of the chains, produce is packaged and branded in South Africa for export and in the other, bulk wine is sold for packaging and branding in Europe. The research draws on a survey of workers and in-depth interviews with managers, industry and farm worker support organisations. It considers the possible impact of the adoption of a Code of Conduct on labour standards by the Swedish alcohol retail monopoly, Systembolaget. The research reinforces findings over more than a decade that female workers are concentrated in lower paid, more fragmented and insecure employment. The findings reveal that processors are more or less compliant with national labour standards, but supplier farms are less so, especially in bulk chains. Monitoring at the individual farm level is missing. This makes it difficult to track compliance of codes down to farm level. The study queries the sustainability of initiatives to improve labour standards on farms, should costs be borne entirely by producers who are already facing a cost-price squeeze.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Biological assets should be valued at fair value less point of sale costs only if an active market exists. The quoted price in an active market is the appropriate basis for determining the fair value of the asset. The objective of this research was to identify the challenges in respect of fair value reporting on the part of small- and medium-sized entities that publish general purpose financial statements, but that do not have public accountability in implementing the requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities. Through the research it was established that in Kenya the commodity markets operate in a simplified auction system with no clear price discovery mechanism. The lack of an active and transparent market is a serious challenge in terms of the application of fair value to biological assets. Consequently most of the farmers prefer to model the market information available. In the light of the diverse nature of agricultural produce, this article recommends virtual trading and development of commodity futures in order to reduce the market access cost, to improve accessibility to market information and to transform the role of middle traders to that of market linkages.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Despite receiving substantial support from the public and private sectors, the mushroom industry in Swaziland is still characterised by extremely low production volumes largely because few farmers have opted to include the mushroom enterprise in their farming systems. Considering the prevailing conditions that favour oyster mushroom production, there is a need to understand why many farmers are not engaged in this enterprise. This study uses cross-section data to identify factors that influence farmers’ decisions of whether or not to participate in oyster mushroom production. Using two-stage probit least squares and two-stage conditional maximum likelihood estimation procedures, the results indicate that apart from the level of farm diversification and farmers’ perceptions towards mushrooms, decisions of whether or not to produce are influenced mainly by institutional factors. Bearing in mind that mushrooms are not plants but fungi, farmers are bound to have mixed perceptions towards the enterprise and these perceptions are likely to have an influence on its acceptability. However, as established from the results, with improved awareness, training and mentoring, farmers are likely to develop positive attitudes as they would understand the circumstances associated with the production of edible mushrooms. Evidence drawn from this study suggests that policy interventions aimed at creating an enabling environment for the enterprise may remain ineffective unless they are paralleled by improvements in rural infrastructure and access to markets.

In so doing, it criticised previous studies and extended a technique developed by Hansen (1999) to handle inferential biases due to some specification errors. The results indicated that coffee growers benefit little from positive changes in the world price compared with participants in the auction markets. This is attributed to the presence of information asymmetry in the coffee value chain, created by an increased concentration of markets. In addition, domestic markets could play a role in this, as they are major outlets for the majority of the coffee produced.

This paper uses the Constant Market Share (CMS) methodology, which enables one to analyse export changes in order to quantify the competitiveness factor, and its separation into general or specified competitiveness. This analysis is performed for two periods – 2002–2007 and 2008–2013 – in order to test if the 2007–2008 global economic and financial crisis had a significant impact on the South African pear trade. Thus, the main objective of this work is to investigate if SA lost competitiveness during these years in relation to its competitors. The results show evidence that, before the global economic and financial crisis, the structural effect of the SA exports contributed most to the sales growth of pears to the EU, and a general competitiveness effect contributed to a lesser extent. After the crisis, exports continued to grow but at a slower rate, and that the composition of the contribution to the sales growth to the EU changed completely. From 2007 onwards, specified competitiveness was the main contributor to the export growth of SA pears, even counteracting the negative, post-crisis impact suffered by the the exports' structural effect.",

    "abstract": "Maize is an important staple crop in southern Africa that has often been prioritised from a policy perspective, particularly in the imposition of export controls under periods of perceived uncertainty. This tendency has been particularly relevant in Zambia, which has also emerged as an important surplus producer in southern Africa in recent years. Its favourable transport differential and non-GM maize has helped Zambia grow its share in Zimbabwean maize imports at the expense of South Africa, but exports into Zimbabwe remains competitive between the two countries and particularly during periods of export control in Zambia, South Africa typically steps in to supply the deficit. This study therefore evaluates the extent of price transmission between Zambia, South Africa and Zimbabwe under two exogenous regimes defined by periods of open trade and trade controls imposed by the Zambian government. It uses secondary data of monthly white maize prices in these three markets to quantify the long and short run price relationships under different regimes. While several authors have noted that trade is not a prerequisite for price transmission between markets, this study finds evidence that the imposition of policies that inhibit trade also influences the rate and nature of price transmission between markets. Periods of open trade were characterised by efficient transmission of prices from Zambia to Zimbabwe, which is in line with typical trade patterns, but during periods of trade controls, no relationship was found between Zambian and Zimbabwean markets, with prices being transmitted from South Africa to Zimbabwe instead.",

As a small landlocked country, Rwanda sought to develop the capability to produce silk, a high value-to-volume ratio product, as a means to overcome the constraints of high transportation cost of exports. Sericulture was also seen as a handy strategy to boost rural farmer income by putting previously less productive land to use for mulberry plantations. Because sericulture was not introduced randomly, this study relied on observational data and applied propensity score matching to estimate its income and poverty reduction effects in six rural districts. The results indicate that sericulture adoption had beneficial effects both on increasing income and reducing poverty. The strengthening of related skills development and the supporting infrastructure remains crucial for the sericulture to successfully diffuse and yield economic benefits commensurate with its potential.",

    "abstract": "The dairy industry has great potential to improve living standards for the poor in Tanzania and more so for smallholder farmers who account for the largest share of milk consumed nationally. To increase production efficiency and overall output, the Government of Tanzania and its development partners are promoting dairy market hubs (DMHs) to enhance access to milk markets, inputs and services. However, there is limited empirical evidence on the degree to which these potential benefits translate into real benefits in dairy production and income, particularly for smallholder farmers. This paper therefore, examines the effect of DMHs on smallholder farmers' income. Using primary data collected from 461 smallholder dairy farmers in four districts in two regions of Tanzania (Tanga and Morogoro) the study employs quasi-experimental methods combining propensity score matching and difference-in-difference (DD) to estimate treatment effects. The results indicate that participation in DMHs increased household dairy income by 4.07 percentage points on average for the period 2014 to 2016. Participation is encouraged by group membership, land owned and quantity of milk sold. It relates negatively with milk price and negatively, though weakly, with age. These results suggest that it would be productive to support livestock producer groups across all potential dairy areas to move towards forming DMHs. Specific actions that could facilitate this are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is often used to analyse the effects of policy changes because of its ability to capture multi-sectoral inter-linkages within the economy. The results of a CGE analysis largely depend on the database, policy shock and elasticities. Trade elasticities, such as the Armington elasticities, play a central role in CGE models to determine the demand substitution between commodities from different sources as a result of changes in relative prices. Because of their role, modellers are keen to know the correct elasticities for use in CGE models. Despite their importance, elasticities for South African agricultural commodities are outdated, leaving researchers to rely on value judgements. We address this limitation by estimating the Armington and export supply elasticities for individual and aggregate agricultural commodities using updated time-series data (1980–2016). The results for the two sets of trade elasticities show that estimates for an aggregate agriculture tend to be inelastic compared to estimates for an individual product, indicating a higher sensitivity of products to relative price changes. The Armington estimates were found to be closer to unity for the majority of products, suggesting that agricultural imports are imperfect substitutes for domestic products. The export supply elasticities for grains were found to be more elastic than for fruit and meat, implying that domestic grain production is relatively more responsive to price changes in the export markets. The long-run estimates for the two sets of elasticities were found to be larger than the short-run estimates for all agricultural products.",

The study involved a sample survey of farmers, and in-depth interviews with farmers, extension officers and other government staff, and leaders of farmer associations. This particular paper explores two themes that emerged in the course of the larger study: first, what is popularly known in South Africa and elsewhere as the \"culture of dependency and entitlement\", and second, the forms of support that government chooses to offer to small-scale farmers. The paper argues that government is stuck in a vicious cycle whereby it seeks to placate expectant small-scale farmers with material support, which it can most effectively do via problematic group projects; although generally ineffective, the practice has the effect of maintaining widespread demand for such support, even to the point that small-scale farmers form group projects for the sole purpose of attracting it. In seeking to compensate for the weaknesses of this approach, government has sought to introduce compensatory measures such as \"strategic partnerships\", sometimes with the ironic consequence that small-scale farmers no longer play a role in farming in \"their\" agricultural projects. The paper concludes that the government in the Eastern Cape needs to return to the basics of effective extension support aimed at supporting individual farmers; to the extent material support is still needed, it should no longer be given away for free.",

Said supply surplus has to be sold off via conventional trading channels, resulting in a head-on competition between certified and uncertified producers. The analysis at hand sheds light on the revenue gains of certified producers via price discrimination on conventional Southern markets, and the consequences for uncertified producers.",

A cross-sectional research design using a stratiﬁed random sample of 279 households was sampled along the urban-rural continuum in Morogoro and Iringa, Tanzania. The results show that household assets ownership varies signiﬁcantly in areas regarded as urban, peri-urban and rural. Using binary logistic regression, household food accessibility improves as household head's education and the number of household members earning income increase. Conversely, food accessibility worsens as household size, the proportion of consumption expenditure on food, and reliance on aid increase. It is concluded that although household assets ownership varies greatly along the urban-rural continuum, its food accessibility status is influenced by factors such as household head's education level, number of members earning an income, household size, the proportion of consumption expenditure on food and reliance on aid. Household's location does not aﬀect its food accessibility. Therefore, household's heads should be given appropriate technical skills to enable them to improve their household food accessibility. More job opportunities should be created mostly in rural areas and people should be sensitised to practice family planning.",

The dataset consists of 2368 households (4736 plots) across eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The study utilizes a multinomial endogenous switching regression model in the empirical estimations to account for sample selection bias caused by observed and unobserved farmer attributes. In addition, the study employed Mundlak fixed effects criteria to address plot level heterogeneity. The results show that joint adoption of SAPs improves total value of output and reduces hidden hunger, relative to adoption of SAPs in isolation. Specifically, an increase in total value of output is at most USD8,288.66/ha whiles decrease in cereal self-provisioning capacity is at most 647.69 kg per adult equivalent. The results therefore suggest that joint adoption of the SAPs should be promoted over adoption in isolation. The results also indicate that the benefits associated with adoption of SAPs, either in isolation or jointly, vary across Africa. This therefore implies that compatibility and potentials of the SAPs in various locations of Africa should be considered when promoting uptake of SAPs.",

The simulation of the gravity equation shows that removing technical barriers will have a 0.1% increase in South Africa's orange exports to the EU, suggesting that the growth potential of the EU market is somewhat limited by some additional factors such as low demand growth, and South Africa's diversion to higher-return markets. Nonetheless, reducing technical barriers still has a fairly significant impact on South Africa's other major markets, particularly China, the United States, Canada and Russia. This is an important result, not only because the analysis generally affirms the tightening of technical barriers in key markets, but also because the analysis unpacks the cross sectional idiosyncrasies of technical barriers across major export markets.",

Comparing the other two interventions, consumers would benefit more from a better regulatory environment than from a reduction in cow prices, while producers would benefit more from a reduction in cow prices than from better regulations. If all policies are implemented simultaneously, even greater benefits would be realised; consumer surplus would increase by 85 shillings annually and producer surplus would increase by over one billion shillings in real terms.

The econometric results indicated that use of social grants had a positive impact on the level of fertiliser use, while increasing dependency on social grants had no significant negative impact. The positive influence of social grants on the amount of inorganic fertiliser used suggests that these grants play a significant role in alleviating the liquidity constraints faced by poor farmers. This result is consistent with the presence of credit constraints that limit poor households’ ability to invest in modern farming technologies. To increase technology adoption among the poor, the study recommends that policymakers should address imperfections in the rural credit markets, increase smallholders’ assets in order to increase their risk-bearing capacity and improve the expected profitability of using inorganic fertiliser.",

    "abstract": "A survey was conducted in 1995 among 135 commercial farmers in KwaZulu-Natal to analyse labour remuneration and farmers' perceptions about the impact of labour legislation recently extended to agriculture. Farm labour remuneration normally includes cash wages and payments in kind (such as rations, housing, land use rights and clothing). The study suggests that, all things being equal, farmers who pay relatively lower cash wages tend to provide more rations per worker and allocate more land use rights. Most respondents agreed that there is some need for labour legislation in agriculture, but the majority perceived the present legislation to be time-consuming and costly, and wanted the legislation to be less ambiguous, more flexible and less extensive. Labour legislation has increased transaction and wage costs in farming and could lead to the substitution of own machinery, contract machinery or contract labour for own labour. Survey respondents indicated that, if minimum wages were imposed, cash wages would be paid and perquisites would be charged for. If the minimum wage was set above present wages, labour would be replaced with machinery and contractors. Respondents would prefer an industrial council to determine minimum wages (if they are imposed), accounting for enterprise and regional differences.",

A sector can generate profit growth through productivity growth or price over-recovery, or both. The course that is taken, however, has important implications for its longer-term competitive positioning. The South African agricultural sector showed a steady decline in its performance since 1973. The decline is attributed to the cost-price squeeze; incrcases in productivity did not compensate for decreases in price recovery. The decline reached its lowest in 1983 when the growth in productivity overtook the negative effect of the terms of trade.",

    "abstract": "In South Africa a recent government study laid the foundations for improving access to financial services for rural people. More is however needed than simply stating the policies. It is argued that policies do not differentiate target groups adequately. This can result in inefficient implementation of policies. The concept of a broad range of institutional possibilities to improve access to financial services, none of which specifically provides a conclusive model, is considered to be realistic. The idea is to muster this range of possible forms into a co-ordinated effort to increase access to financial services for rural people in all rural areas. This paper emphasises the reality of the situation when choosing policy directions. NGOs, commercial banks and the Post Bank do not hold the primary key to improving access to financial services in rural areas in South Africa. Several studies discussed the broad range of possible institutional forms in the rural areas of South Africa. The role of decentralised financial systems has not been the focus point of any of these studies. It is argued that fertile ground exists in South Africa for decentralised financial systems to address access problems at the local level. Decentralised systems also cannot be the solution to all intermediation problems. A multi-pronged approach is proposed, harnessing all institutional forms into a comprehensive strategy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The “poor but efficient” hypothesis of T.W. Schultz is by now generally accepted. Agricultural progress and entrepreneurship are however hampered by various bottlenecks. The absence of appropriate technology and related know-how is at least partly the result of misguided perceptions concerning appropriateness and a bias favouring large farmers among agriculturalists. Land tenure arrangements form another obstacle, as does lack of productive assets and factor markets. These considerations prevent entrepreneurial development. Tenure and size relationships are inseprable, with the latter largely a function of entrepreneurial ability. Action to rectify these stumblingblocks will depend on sound financing, which in its turn influences and is influenced by entrepreneurial ability. The crucial factor is not property, but ownership and entitlement. Lease is often preferable to purchase. In land relationships, the land market, which implies at the least rental of use rights, is the crucial factor. Decisions involving financial structure are closely associated with both entrepreneurship and financial results. Credit should be evaluated within this framework. Loan tying can produce perverse behaviour and results, and subsidized interest is seldom beneficial. State lending institutions have a poor track record internationally, while the experience with credit cooperatives appears to be mixed. Small lender groups have proven themselves as appropriate intermediaries, since they foster selfhelp and entrepreneurship. The solution obviously does not lie in only one factor. Synergy exists between technology, tenure, infrastructure and finance in the fostering of entrepreneurship and agricultural progress.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The importance of livestock in rural households is well known and their role in the households well documented. Despite the important social and cultural value of livestock, especially cattle, there is a growing tendency amongst rural households to sell livestock. This paper is based on research into livestock marketing in developing areas. The research investigates the reasons for selling and marketing channels used by rural households. This paper specifically considers the role of speculators, auctioneers and butchers in the marketing of livestock in developing areas. The increasing popularity of private sales is discussed and analyzed. These different outlets serve as the major marketing channels for livestock producers in developing areas. In marketing their livestock through the different channels, farmers experience a range of problems and constraints. The paper analyses these constraints and complaints and also shows how these affect the farmers' choice of a particular marketing outlet. The paper emphasises that farmers do not have access to market information, i.e. current prices, supply, etc., while auctioneers, the limited buyers at auctions and the speculators do have access to market information. It is therefore concluded that the marketing of livestock in developing areas can be improved through addressing the various problems in the different marketing channels as well as through providing farmers with sufficient market information. This will enable farmers to make informed choices in the marketing of their livestock.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Production costs of beef vary because of seasonal changes in the weather and a seasonal variation in prices, which because of its counter-cyclic effect, could have a stabilising effect on supply. The analysis shows that the permit/quota scheme increases the price at the main city abattoirs and it depresses the price farmers receive on country auctions. If permits/quotas reduce production by as little as 5%, then the value of the permit/quota is estimated at R52 per animal. Large feeders who are allocated quotas receive a windfall gain, but the small farmer who does not receive a quota because he is an irrigular supplier is harmed. The effect of quotas is to restrict beef production artificially. This is in direct contrast to the effect of research on output, that is, to promote productivity. Because the pressure to sell cattle is greater during droughts, the quota value increases then. Quotas then aggravate the farmers' position during adverse times by limiting the offtake. After good rains quotas may have no value or a negative value as feeders sell cattle just to maintain their quotas.",

Farmers who adopted Bt cotton benefited from the new technology, according to all the measures used. Average yield per hectare and per kilogram of seed was higher for adopters than for non-adopters. The increase in yields and the reduction in chemical application costs outweighed the higher seed cost, even in a poor production season due to unusually heavy rainfall. Bt adopters suffered far less of a fall in yields than those who did not adopt. As yields and gross margins are partial measures of efficiency, deterministic and stochastic efficiency frontiers were measured. Both methods confirm the farm accounting results, showing that Bt cotton adopters were more efficient. For 1998, the results showed that adopters averaged 88% efficiency, as compared with 66% for non-adopters. In 1999, the equivalent figures were 74% and 48%. Similarly, the determinist frontier results for both years show that adopters were over 62% efficient, while non-adopters averaged only 46%.",

The analysis are carried out using a computable general equilibrium (CCE) model calibrated to a social accounting matrix (SAM) for South Africa. The results indicate that agricultural trade liberalisation will have positive impacts upon the economy, but that the extent of the benefits is dependent on whether agriculture can remain competitive by improving productivity. There is a downside to increasing agricultural productivity; employment levels will fall unless there are other changes that stimulate employment. The results provide in sights into some of the reasons why agricultural employment in South Africa has fallen in recent years, despite the fact that liberalisaiion might be expected to enhance employment prospects.",

This study reveals that these farmers can produce efficiently, even when subjected to opportunity cost assumptions that apply to their traditionally white commercial counterparts. Given additional prospects for strong linkages with the rest of the rural economy, speedy implementation of public investment programmes is warranted so as to level the playing field in the agricultural and rural economy",

    "abstract": "The paper gives an overview of the socio-economic profile of access to resources and social behaviour of rural households of the Northern Province of South Africa. It is based on the survey conducted in 24 villages covering 586 households. The preliminary results reflect a number of disparities among men and female household heads and their occupations. Women farmers tend to dominate the agricultural sector, while men are predominantly in the service and industry sectors. Also, male headed households have more members than female headed households, which are mostly single parents and have higher percentage of members under fifteen (reflecting high fertility rates). Unemployment is rife, coupled with a significant number of old (retired) people, and more women involved in subsistence agriculture. Migration is prevalent, and is a source of support for households to supplement their livelihood, since farming is not enough to meet household requirements. There is still a gap in access to water and land resources. These results pose major challenges for agriculture in the new millennium since access and distribution of resources will be imminent.",

The agricultural activities on the farms are merely non-commercial. Wool is considered as a by-product of keeping sheep, which are slaughtered on special family occasions or sold live. A sample of farmers in three villages of the former Transkei (Mhlahlane, Xume and Luzie) was interviewed. In Luziea shearing shed was built to organise the marketing of the wool, leading to a higher revenue from wool. The farmers however are not able to convert this into a positive gross margin. A small number of farms succeeds in maximising the production of wool given the relative large investment. The negative result of wool farming on the other farms is partly compensated by high benefits from the sales of live sheep. Also in Xume a shearing shed was built, and extension on production practices is provided. But no marketing of wool through the shearing shed was done at the time of the survey. The existence of a shearing shed should be essential for a higher retail price for wool and extension does have a positive influence on the benefits of the farms. However, the production practices are not adapted to the production of wool only, so that the use of inputs is too high for the generated output.",

The Industry has kept records on R&D expenditure, yields, rainfall and related factors over a 75-year period. Sugar cane yield was measured in tons sucrose to account for quality improvement. In this function, R&D expenditure lagged three years was significant (t = 6.5) in explaining increased sucrose production per ha. Other highly significant variables in this model were rainfall (t = 5.2) and real cost of production (t = 8.4). A dummy interaction with R&D was significant (t = 2.9) implying a greater impact for R&D technology during the period 1959 to 1975 than either before or after this period. The standardised regression model indicated that the R&D variable was one of the most important variables in explaining yield. Using the elasticity of production estimate for the R&D variable of the un-standardised model, a Benefit/Cost ratio for this variable of 1.41 was estimated, if benefit of millers is excluded and 1.59, if the gain to millers is included. In the latter estimates, the exports realisation price of sugar was used as the appropriate shadow price. A real internal rate of return was estimated at 17%. A unique feature of the South African Sugar Industry is that research is privately funded by the industry, which implies that the distortionary impact of taxes need not be accounted for, as is the case with public funded research.",

Results showed that the portfolio of irrigation schedules for a risk averse farmer may include schedules with high production risk, due to the interaction of resource use between alternatives when water is limited. Owing to the difficulty of implementing the best portfolio of irrigation schedules, the optimised schedules may best be used to benchmark the efficiency of second best alternatives that are easier to implement.

These include household monthly income, current household monthly expenditure on meat, relative price of pork, preference for value-added pork products, price of substitutes (the most preferred household meat type), and response of household to change in pork quality. The result obtained was further analyzed to compute partial effects and to conduct simulations for significant factors. Analysis of partial effects revealed that quality assurance and value-adding lead to much greater probability of pork consumption by households. Simulations conducted on the base category of pork-consuming households revealed that quality assurance and value-adding have relatively high potential to almost double and more than double household pork consumption respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study tests the hypothesis that an efficient rental market for cropland is a significant determinant of agricultural investment in the communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal. An efficient rental market creates an opportunity cost for under-utilisation, which tends to transfer resources to more effective users. The efficiency of a rental market is compromised by the presence of transaction costs that reduce returns for both lessees and lessors. Transaction costs include risk arising from a possible breach of the rental contract. Potential losses caused by a breach of contract can be reduced by introducing a credible third-party to witness the contract. Likewise, moral hazard can be reduced by contracting with trusted persons. Data from household surveys conducted in two communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal were used to estimate a regression model explaining levels of investment in crop production amongst tenant farmers. The results confirm that tenants invest more when they contract with friends or family, and if their contracts are formally witnessed by a credible third-party. Interventions that reduce potential losses caused by a breach of contract are therefore expected to promote market efficiency and investment in crop production. In the short-run, the Provincial Department of Agriculture should sanction rental contracts negotiated by lessors and lessees. Ultimately, legal reform that leads to predictable contract enforcement in the communal areas is required to improve market efficiency and levels of investment in agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Physical Externality Model is used to illustrate the potential limitations of blindly adopting formal models for economic investigation and explanation in varied geographical contexts. As argued by institutional economists for the last hundred years the practice limits the value and relevance of most general economic inquiry. This model postulates that the geographical location of farmers along a given watercourse, in which water is diverted individually, leads to structural inefficiencies that negatively affect the whole farming community. These effects are felt more severely at downstream sites and lead to a status quo where upstream farmers possess relative economic and political advantages over their counterparts elsewhere. In the study of the Kat River basin these predictions appear to be true only in as far as they relate to legal and political allocations and use of water resources. In terms of lawful uses of land resources aimed at expanding citrus production, the model's predictions are not met. The status quo is however fully explained by the implications of having adopted formal water scheduling rights by upstream farmers as well as other geographical factors. Hence, the case for investigating the effects of important institutions within general economic research is strengthened.",

A farm-level analysis of data from the Ceres hunting club's logbooks reveals that four out of five farms have experienced no predator damage whatsoever. For those reporting problems, the typical loss was in the region of one per cent of the estimated turnover. Lynx (caracal), leopards and feral dogs were responsible for most of the damage. Black-backed jackals were not a serious concern, but were also more difficult to catch. Lynx and feral dogs were controlled with ease. Death of some innocent animals was also recorded. The hunting club system thus appears to be succeeding in controlling certain predators, albeit with adverse consequences to other animals. Exploratory statistical analysis establishes that livestock losses lead to increased control efforts, which in turn leads to the death of more targeted and untargeted animals. There is even some evidence that more control efforts reduce stock losses in the following year.",

One such trend is land-use changes; the fact that some investors purchase farmland in South Africa to not farm – for the sake of investment only. Research that was done in 2011 in the south-eastern Nama Karoo confirmed that purchasers buy farmland at significant prices primarily as investments, although not on a grand scale. The research was done quantitatively and qualitatively. It was confirmed that in this part of the Nama Karoo, like in many other parts in South Africa, there is indeed a trend of new investors purchasing land for its sheer beauty and natural magnificence, something that they believe will increase in value and which is a sound investment for the future. Questions were asked: How might this impact on farmland values and how will property valuers interpret this changed land use? And, how should farmland be valued in future if this trend prevails and expands? The research confirmed that investors buy farmland for secondary (non-agricultural) reasons, which result in land prices almost double the average. Pure investment is a primary driver in the decision-making process and is based on a view that the future capital growth is enough to justify the investment. It was also shown that the typical investor is around 50 years old, financially extremely well off, and mostly professional. As potential non-commercial farmland owners, they are also not necessarily applauded by current commercial farmers.",

    "abstract": "Various studies interrogate the issue of food inflation from a commodity level vantage point but fail to relate how commodity prices manifest in retail prices, and ultimately, how it impacts food inflation. This study uses vertical price transmission analysis, with time series econometric techniques, to determine how underlying commodity prices manifest in final retail prices and the associated reasons for it. Implications for food inflation are also reflected on. Two value chains, namely wheat-to-bread and maize-to-maize meal are considered due to their importance as staples in low(er) income consumer diets in South Africa. Results indicate full price transmission in the wheat-to-bread chain but incomplete price transmission in the maize-to-maize meal chain. In addition, prices in the wheat-to-bread chain are determined at producer and consumer level and bi-directional transmission takes place, whereas maize prices are determined at retail level and transmitted through the chain, to commodity level. Symmetry in price adjustment was not rejected in both chains. Implications of the findings for staple food inflation is that it does not seem that the price determination and price transmission processes in these chains are contributing factors to the inflationary pressures that these chains have experienced over the past decade. Symmetric price transmission in both chains seems to suggest no opportunistic behaviour on the part of firms to exploit situations where commodity prices decrease.",

The technical efficiency estimates associated with observed and adjusted production levels are obtained using data from the Rice Statistics survey of 2009 in Madagascar, Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania and Uganda. Risk aggravates farmers' inefficiency; continuous efforts are needed to mitigate risks in order to increase production.",

This study also compared the results of the linearised AIDS and the full nonlinear AIDS (NLAIDS) models. According to Lutkepohl, normality test for joint residuals, the linearised AIDS model that used Turnquist price index, was the best system and, based on the Akaike criteria, the linear approximate (LA) AIDS outperformed NLAIDS. The results of the non-nested test for LAAIDS versus Rotterdam showed that LAAIDS is more appropriate for red meat and fish demand in Iran. Price elasticity for fish and red meat showed that they are elastic. Cross elasticity from LAAIDS and NLAIDS showed that fish and red meat are substitutes. Allen-Uzawa elasticity results indicate that the two goods are strong substitutes. Income elasticity indicated that red meat and fish are considered to be luxury goods.",

What are less well understood, however, are the drivers that reallocate scarce human and physical resources across occupations and space, and without which agriculture and industrial development, and hence structural transformation, will stagnate. One such endogenous driver is entrepreneurship. This paper begins with the reappraisal of African agriculture and focus on the literature on entrepreneurship in Africa's structural transformation. Then a conceptual model to describe how entrepreneurship reallocates farmers out of agriculture into non-agricultural activities and locations is presented. Recent empirical evidence that is broadly consistent with this model is discussed. Implications and challenges for entrepreneurship development policies and further research are outlined.",

We aim to make two main contributions. First, we analyse the electricity dependence of the agricultural sector and assess how loadshedding impacts the sector's various economic activities. Second, we employ Interactive Qualitative Analysis (IQA) to determine the cause-and-effect relationships of loadshedding on the agricultural sector. We purposively selected 27 senior managers from the Western Cape agricultural value chain to participate in the study. The IQA reveals eight categories influenced by loadshedding: operational capacity and scheduling, input supply and availability, output quality and volume, financial implications, biological and fixed assets, socio-economics, and product selling price. The biggest cause for disruption is operational capacity and scheduling, and the biggest effect is product selling price. Solving the loadshedding problem and preventing knock-on effects require collaboration between firms, industry, and government. The government needs to create an enabling environment: sound regulatory framework, incentives to invest in renewable energy, and access to low-cost capital. The industry then takes responsibility for disseminating government strategies to firms and providing feedback based on firm-level experience.",

The comparison informs recommendations for sustainable farm development. The process entails a stepwise analysis of land suitability, enterprise potential, infrastructure status, operator capacity, inherent limitations and external risks of the farm. An expert panel considers quantitative and qualitative data to establish suitable development measures. Applied to a land reform initiative, ±2000 farms entailing 1.86 million hectares were evaluated, detailing corrective measures for each farm. Roughly 59% of the evaluated farms were potentially commercial, but only 7% performed accordingly. Correlations between farmer capability and farm performance, as well as between infrastructure and performance, were evident, indicating that post-settlement support is vital. As risk and limitation scores increased, farm viability tended to decrease. The tool accurately determined viability based on available resources (natural and physical), resulting in evidence-based policy advice. The evaluation informed land reform policy recommendations, proposing more coordinated support to improve access to services. The tool would also be useful for farmers to reflect on enterprise performance. The visual, sequential nature of the evaluation facilitates sound decision-making. The tool has potential as a valid agricultural development evaluation instrument.",

Respondents identified changes in the cost of farm inputs, government legislation (tax, labour, and land redistribution), the Rand exchange rate, and product prices as the most important sources of risk. Factor analysis of risk sources showed that various dimensions to risk exist, including changes in government policy, enterprise gross income, credit access and cost changes. Computers, a risk management tool, are more likely to be adopted by larger farm operators who have higher levels of education and who use more information sources, whilst operators of extensive production systems are less likely to adopt computers.",

The evidence suggests that the South African experience is no different from that which is generally observed internationally. The present situation in South African agriculture subsequently provides both an unique and necessary opportunity for advancing a market assisted land reform program. Managing the imminent debt crisis, increasing efficiency, improving food security and addressing some of the racial imbalances in South Africa's farm sector following market liberalization and the withdrawal of other privileges can be facilitated through a market assisted land reform process, rather than through a much more costly, inefficient and inequitable blanket debt relief program. It will also have the added advantages of increasing employment at a low cost and adding to the rural safety-net. In addition, the market assisted process provides a mechanism for efficient and quick land reform without most of the problems and excessive procedures associated with a state or parastatal-led expropriation and redistribution mechanism.",

Large monetary transfers have resulted from government policy with a bias towards more powerful producer interest groups. Transfers significantly exceed the welfare gains to producers. However, the per capita gain for producers is greater than the per capita loss for consumers creating an incentive for producers to continue lobbying for the current South African maize policy. Intervention results from market failure followed by political failure where interest groups manipulate government for their own benefit. As long as vested interests remain, policy reform seems remote. A new political dispensation may shift vested interests towards consumers away from producers. Policy reform is discussed along with conditions to facilitate this process of reform.",

Most of the formal marketing systems are not suited to serve the township market, and consequently this sector experiences access problems which results in a largely inadequate supply. This situation threatens food security in the townships and informal settlements. The marketing vacuum left by the formal systems, however, provided entrepreneurs an opportunity to market food in this sector. This paper therefore deals with the situation where entrepreneurs started marketing red meat in the Cape urban townships. It largely describes the ground level activities of these traders whose operations are generally described as informal.

    "abstract": "Following world wide trends, closer integration of agriculture into the macroeconomy has exposed farmers to the effects of changes in interest rates, exchange rates and prices that are associated with changes in monetary policy. In South Africa, farmers are faced with persistently high innation, nuctuating interest rates and declining rand exchange rate. A general equilibrium simultaneous equation model was constructed to analyse the impacts of monetary policy on South African agriculture. Annual data (1960-1987) were used to estimate equations representing the field crop, horticultural, livestock and manufacturing sectors, and the money and foreign exchange markets. The interest, innation, and exchange rates were determined endogenously and key macrolinkages whereby the impacts of monetary policy are transmitted to agriculture were simulated. Due to insufficient degrees of freedom, the model was estimated by two-stage principal components. The estimated model was used to simulate the dynamic impacts of an expansionary monetary policy on agriculture. In the short run. this causes the real interest rate to fall, exchange rate lo depreciate, and general level of prices to rise. Depreciation of the exd1ange rate and higher domestic innation raise input prices. Increased cost effects of higher input prices outweigh the reduced cost effects of lower real interest rates causing real field crop and horticultural supply to decrease. Increased stock effects of lower real interest rates and increased cost effects of higher input costs impact negatively on livestock supply. The resultant decrease in agricultural supply causes commodity prices to rise which lowers real demand for agricultural products. The net effect is a decline in real agricultural income for the sectors modeled.",

    "abstract": "South Africa is entering a whole new era in water management. In the face of efforts to curtail runaway government spending and protect the environment, water institutions must foster the conservation and efficient allocation of existing supplies. They must also take water's growing recreational and environmental value into account. The crucial question is, can the current water institutions meet today's requirements? Despite the resulting inefficiency and waste, traditional resource economists continue to identify taxes, regulations, subsidies, and governmental allocation as solutions to today's water problems. Internationally, there is enough evidence to prove that central allocation with almost any resource gave rise to gross inefficiency. The main reason is the distortions on the value placed on resources within such a centralised planning environment. Resources are either valued to high or to low. What is the value of freshwater and how can water be allocated in such a way as to reflect the scarcity value of water? A non-linear spatial equilibrium model was developed to simulate the impact of a potential water market in the Upper-Berg River: Western Cape. This paper explores water markets as an alternative to central water allocation decisions",

The joint determination of the wage rate and the number of workers necessitated the use of a simultaneous estimating procedure. The Two Stage Least Squares method was used. The results appeared consistent with a priori estimates. A demand elasticity close to unity was found while the supply curve appeared very elastic. Competition was shown to exist between the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors in the labour market. Since the demand curve was not inelastic, and the supply curve was very elastic, it is debatable' whether unskilled agricultural labourers would be able to increase their long-run real wages through trade union action. Sociopolitical considerations, although important, were not considered. Trends in the wage rate and employment were studied. It was also shown that the agricultural control measures do not assist the labourers through increased wages.",

This study uses survey data and a recursive model to show that; (a) different modes of land redistribution observed in the province of KwaZulu-Natal afford different levels of tenure security to historically disadvantaged people, and (b) that insecure tenure harms agricultural performance through its adverse impact on credit use, improvements to land, investment in seasonal inputs and crop yield. Tenure is least secure on farms acquired by user groups. Government's recent policy shift in favour of owner-operated farms is therefore supported. However, where this family farm approach is not feasible, government should approach the dual goals of outreach and agricultural performance by establishing non-user groups resembling the equity-sharing companies that have redistributed wealth to farm workers in the Western Cape province.",

Improved service quality and emphasis on mobilising savings would help clients and enable the DFIs to diversify their portfolios. Better access to branches and lower loan approval times (improved screening and administrative procedures) could also lower client transaction costs. Charging a suitable interest rate spread is necessary but not sufficient for lenders to achieve subsidy independence. Reducing arrears through stricter loan contract enforcement (borrower accountability for loan repayment, lower collateral specific risks, secure and transferable collateral) will also promote financial viability. Providing both savings and loan services together would reduce borrower access costs, and allow savings to serve as a form of collateral and borrower information for lenders.",

This research was aimed at identifying, isolating and estimating seasonal, cyclic and trend components of beef prices for the Witwatersrand controlled market. The traditional decomposition approach in combination with analysis of variance and regression techniques were used. Statistical significant typical price components were isolated and estimated for all grades and super prices. These components were used to create static forecasts in order to predict a general change in the movement of prices. Although this research was primarily aimed at the identification and isolation of cycles. explanatory elements in the form of rainfall and supply indicators were added. This research indicated that beef price cycles are relative stable and are partly self generating processes, depending on price expectations, supply cycles and rainfall cycles.",

A discriminant analysis of 82 farmers surveyed in the Highveld Region during July and August 1987 indicates that it is the farmer more exposed to risk, with lower liquidity, greater experience and more debt, who insures comprehensively. The latter producer also tends to have an unfavourable return on assets with a small or nonexistent livestock enterprise. With respect to hail insurance, results indicate that it is the older farmer with low gross farm and off-farm income that tends to insure. Further insight into economic forces influencing farmer participation is important as it may aid policy-makers in the adjustment of present and the formation of future policies regarding such risk management strategies as crop insurance.",

A crop insurance programme (drought) for small-scale commercial farmers, who are not yet paying tax, has been recommended to government. The purpose in this research is to study the economic viability of such a programme drawing on the US experience. The US programme is well developed but heavily subsidised. During 1998 US growers paid $900 million in premiums while during 1995–98 the US government spent $1.2 billion per year on subsidies. An area insurance plan (farmers are insured as a group) is shown to be more appropriate for small farmers growing dryland field crops such as maize because risk is systemic (drought related) while adverse selection, moral hazard etc are overcome. Individual crop insurance will not be viable due to the cost of farm visits (verification of claims) and the non-availability of information. As a large part of the cost to government goes to administration of crop insurance it is recommended that an Income Equalisation Deposit (IED) scheme for small growers receive serious consideration with the government making a contribution as for example in Canada.",

The SIM-DY-SIM Model was used to simulate optimal returns, decision and policy variables under varying conditions of capacity share. LP results show that wheat has the highest MVP of R0.39/m3, with maize exhibiting the lowest value of R0.09/m3. The MVPs generated with SDP range between R0.06/m3 and R0.35/m3 on the whole farm basis, with revenue to the farmer increasing with an increase in CS content and increased percentage water release. However, the MVP of water decreased with the increased supply of the resource—a phenomenon that follows the general rule of decreasing marginal utility of a resource as more of it is used.",

Second, the caloric requirement for an average household's is estimated by using the daily caloric requirement of each member of the household. The household uses its income from non-farm sources to purchase food and where necessary supplemented with income from the sale of nonfood agricultural production. In both cases minimum farm size is influenced by output levels and by profitability of crop production under IRWH techniques.",

Furthermore, a system of tariff rate quotas was introduced in compliance with WTO regulations. This study uses a partial equilibrium comparative static model to measure the welfare effects of further liberalization in the livestock industry of South Africa, particularly in meat products using four policy scenarios. The traditional method of welfare analyses using the CS and PS was applied, while the EV was used to integrate a well-behaved objective function. Although the CS and PS could have over-estimated welfare due to the fact that the demand system used in this study is non-linear, they still gave useful information sufficient to compare the impact of trade liberalization on consumers and producers of livestock products. Furthermore, the EV explains the income change necessary to attain the welfare level resulting from trade liberalization given the current prices. When expressed as a percentage of the real gross national income and real disposable income, the values are quite marginal. The results from both methods of welfare measurement suggest that it is worth considering the effects on producers if further trade liberalization is envisaged in the South African livestock industry.",

It is, however, questionable whether it is inherently suited to a commodity-based marketing system in a marketing environment that requires marketing systems to convey far more information than commodity-based systems do. Historically, mohair has been considered a commodity and the marketing system for mohair has been structured accordingly. It is, however, argued that, the exchange between mohair growers and the buyers of greasy mohair requires increased levels of coordination to govern the exchange in a transaction costs efficient manner. The inefficiencies created by an inappropriate or incomplete marketing system for South African mohair are expected to lead to a loss of consumer value and a loss of potential profit throughout the mohair supply chain if a more coordinated governance structure is not implemented to curb these costs and augment the current spot market exchange.",

The effects on factors, households and the government are also analysed. The results show that the benefits to the wheat industry are highly concentrated and smaller than the loss of income caused in other sectors. Welfare is negatively affected, especially for low-income households, for whom the effects are exacerbated by increases in relative food prices.

While the Caribbean nations signed the full EPAs, some of the African countries only singed interim agreements with the EU and a number of West African countries chose not to sign any EPA. Using the case of Botswana's export markets, especially in agriculture, it is argued that the interim Southern African Development Community (SADC) EPA, which was signed by Botswana and her neighbours, with the exception of South Africa, may have been economically sensible in protecting Botswana's rural poor, at least in the short run. By tracing trade flows from the border to specifically poor sectors of the country, the importance of the beef exports sector to the poor and rural communities was found. The potential effects on the most significant exports of tariff bands associated with preferential agreements with the EU were found to be most beneficial in comparison to the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) and the South Africa-EU Trade Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) tariff bands. But it is also argued that the EPA will most likely have far reaching long run costs on regional economic development and institutional integration, within the SADC and Southern African Customs Union (SACU).",

The differentiation between breeds according to their genetic growth potential was identified and used to increase feedlot profitability and sustainability. The unique growth and feed intake data of different breeds was generated through a feedlot feeding experiment. The PMFP model was developed to incorporate the variable economic value and the unique production data of each breed into a model. The PMFP model can determine alternative PMFPs for any price scenario. The results indicate that breeds can be differentiated in terms of genetic production potential. The seven breeds used in this study can be divided into three groups in terms of their estimated PMFPs for the specific scenario. The Brahman, Bonsmara, and Afrikaner can be grouped together with a PMFP of 16 weeks for the Brahman and Bonsmara, and 15 weeks for the Afrikaner. The second group included the Simbra and the Angus, which have a PMFP of 21 and 22 weeks respectively. The Simmentaler and Limousin have a PMFP of 27 and 26 weeks respectively, which groups them together in the final group. In conclusion, additional Gπ can be generated by each breed by feeding them according to their unique PMFP. According to the case study the additional gross profit that can be generated by the implication of the PMFP-model was 6%.",

Investment into research and development of livestock vaccines has potential to generate new technologies that can benefit the livestock sector and result in control of diseases such as Rift Valley fever (RVF) and lumpy skin disease (LSD). Veterinary research and development efforts have focussed on the development of an improved, combined LSD RVF 2-in-1 vaccine, using new generation technologies. Through collaborative, multidisciplinary research, it is possible to create solid economic arguments that guide policy and investment on strategies for controlling livestock diseases. Using Monte Carlo simulation through various vaccination scenarios this paper evaluates ex-ante the costs and benefits of an LSD RVF 2-in-1 vaccine on dairy production in South Africa. Simulations over a 15 year period yielded positive net present values at R830 641 and R13 954 073 with internal rate of return at 32.4 per cent and 32.9 per cent for small scale and large scale operations, respectively. The results of the study provide decision makers with solid economic arguments regarding the potential benefits of investing in new generation vaccines for control of RVF and LSD. Continuous awareness on the importance of the vaccines, particularly for small-scale farmers is recommended for improved livestock productivity.",

    "abstract": "Though consumer studies have received significant attention in the field of marketing management, research on consumer attitude towards food supply technologies is needed. This paper investigates the relationship between consumer attitude and preference towards the usage of a 'milk ATM' as the point of sale. Based on data obtained from 296 consumers (convenient sampling), PLS-SEM was used to analyse the proposed conceptual framework. Furthermore, multiple group analysis was conducted to test for group differences between male and female consumers. The findings reveal that whereas the consumer utilitarian and hedonic values are significantly related to preference towards milk ATM purchase intentions, the former are more strongly related to preference than hedonic values. Moreover, there are significant differences between male and female consumers regarding the effect of utilitarian consumer attitude on preference. As a response to consumption goals of trading pasteurised milk, the findings demonstrate that milk ATM consumers are motivated by numerous value dimensions. These dimensions additively contribute to preference and intentions to purchase milk from milk ATMs. This research informs the policy makers and practitioners about the potential of milk ATMs as a point of sale for milk. However, to realise this potential, it is necessary for investors to further examine the core values sought by the consumers and improve in that core value delivery.",

The four items added to the second survey created the opportunity to study how emerging structures differ when the lists change. The principal component analysis conducted on the longer list identified a new common concern about growing government control over private enterprise that came to light as a result of adding four extra items.

Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) data on groundnut prices from 2005 to 2018 were used. The Vector Error Correction Model was used to analyse the extent of market cointegration, both in the long and the short run. The speeds of adjustments in groundnut markets were found to be very slow. It takes long for the systems to revert back to equilibriums in the long run. In all regions, very few markets are cointegrated. Although the speed of adjustment is slow in most of the cointegrating vectors, Southern region markets depict the fastest speed of adjustment towards long run equilibrium. Irrespective of the speed of adjustment, more markets are cointegrated in northern and central regions than in the southern region. Relevant policies are needed that promote smooth flow of information from surplus to deficit areas. Market infrastructure is also needed in the country.",

This study examined the factors that influence the choice of milk marketing channels among 251 smallholder farmers in Zambia participating in milk production and marketing using a multinomial logit model approach. Three milk marketing channels were identified: direct, traditional, and modern. Relative to the base category (direct), the results indicate that gender and volume of milk produced positively influenced participation in the traditional marketing channel. However, off-farm income had a negative influence on the selection of the traditional marketing channel. Gender, education, distance to major markets, and volumes of milk produced influenced the decision to participate in the modern marketing channel. There seems to be an underutilisation of the modern marketing channel. The study identified the following factors to stimulate participation in the modern marketing channel: (i) concerted value chain investments, (ii) government intervention in the form of policy changes, (iii) increased access to market information, (iv) support services, and (v) transparency in the milk value-chain. Understanding the factors that influence farmers' participation in the informal channels enables tailored policies to support the formalisation of existing structures in the informal sector.",

The ECM was the preferred model because it corrects for some of the limitations observed in previous studies that investigated the supply response of beef in South Africa. Using rainfall, real producers' price of beef, lamb, pork, chicken, yellow maize, imports and cattle population to represent climatic, economic, trade and demographic factors, respectively, as identified in the literature, the supply response of beef in South Africa was modelled as the number of cattle marketed for slaughtering. This article confirms that beef producers in South Africa respond to economic, climatic, trade and demographic factors in the long-run. In the short-run, however, the article shows that cattle marketed for slaughtering are responsive to climatic factors (i.e. rainfall) and imports of beef. Animal demographics, producer price of yellow maize and the producer price of beef were found not to have a short-run effect on cattle marketed for slaughtering.",

Over the subsequent century and more, the growth in public support for agricultural R&D, extension and technical services has waxed and waned and the policies and public institutions directed at them have changed markedly. In the early 20th century the focus was on tapping technologies and expertise from other countries. Subsequent changes in agricultural R&D mirrored broader agricultural and economy-wide policy thrusts. The period through to the Second World War saw an expansion of the area farmed, mostly involving white farmers. During the decades immediately following the war, public R&D mainly supported intensification and promoted technological change by large commercial operators. The early 1980s heralded large structural changes in agriculture and the economy generally and policies were enacted to redistribute land to black farmers, with associated shifts in the focus of public research and extension services. The emphasis given to regional versus more centralised cum national research and extension agencies has changed dramatically as well over the decades. As food security and associated agricultural productivity concerns resurface, the R&D policies and institutions supporting agriculture are likely to be revisited, hopefully with an eye to the long-run nature and ramifications for agricultural R&D.",

The main premise of the programme is to address the racially skewed land distribution pattern inherited at independence in 1980. While the programme has been accompanied by an overall reduction in agricultural production which has created widespread food insecurity throughout the country, empirical research on the impact of the programme on the agricultural productivity of its beneficiaries has been limited. This paper uses data on beneficiaries of the programme and a control group of communal farmers to (i) investigate the presence of agricultural productivity differences between beneficiaries and communal farmers, and (ii) examine differences in chemical fertiliser use as a possible source of these differences. The results suggest that FTLRP beneficiaries gain a productivity advantage not only from the fact that they use more fertiliser per hectare, but also from attaining a higher rate of return from its use.",

As a profession, agricultural economists have not kept pace with a number of new developments in economics; have ignored the lessons of history; have lost their connection with the everyday realities of farming; and have paid insufficient attention to new developments in systems thinking.",

At the core of the debate are the current levels of global population growth and resource consumption, and its effects on living standards in the foreseeable future. While this is well explored in a global context, little research has been done to explore the long-term relationship between population growth and food security in the context of a particular developing economy, such as South Africa. This paper explores long-term trends in population growth and agricultural output in a South African context. Similar measures are also considered for various Southern African Development Community (SADC) member countries, as well as various top countries in the 2015 Global Food Security Index, to explore the relative position of South Africa (a developing economy). This paper shows that the South African per capita cereal production has steadily declined since the 1970s, while the opposite is true for the top countries in the 2015 Global Food Security Index, as well as the world on average. It also demonstrates the need to consider the state of food security of individual countries or regions (as opposed to a global view). Aggregate global data may obscure cases where a food security crisis is closer than anticipated and imported grains may become an increasingly volatile alternative.",

The paper reports on the comparative advantage in the production of wheat in South Africa and reveals the various distortionary effects, if any, of the policy environment on the production of wheat in the country prior to 1997. The paper concludes that South Africa has a strong comparative advantage in the production of wheat, especially, in the inland areas. Favourable climatic and soil factors as well as abundant and relatively cheaper domestic factors of production may be some of the reasons for this strong comparative advantage. The inland areas have better RCRs due to higher inland transportation costs. However, wheat production under irrigation seems to have no comparative advantage. This is mainly due to the implicit subsidy on irrigation water.",

    "abstract": "The demise of the Maize Board in South Africa in 1997 placed responsibility for maize marketing in the hands of individual producers. Given the inelastic nature of maize supply and demand, these farmers now face considerable price risk. In the absence of the Maize Board, price risk management mechanisms have evolved to serve maize farmers. Results of a postal survey of commercial maize producers in 1998 indicate that maize farmers are making increased use of the forward contracting market relative to the spot market. The percentage of respondents using SAFEX increased markedly over a three-year period, the hedging ratio rising from 27 percent in 1997/98 to reach 49 percent for 1998/99 and 1999/2000. Survey respondents were divided into lower- and higher- level users of price risk management tools, based on their scores for an index of price risk management. Higher-level users tended to operate larger farms, and be younger, less experienced, but more educated, computeradopting operators who were less likely to individually own their operations. Farmers perceived their marketing management skills to be relatively weak. Maize marketing education seminars and magazine articles explaining available marketing alternatives could increase farmers’ use of price risk management tools. Further research opportunities lie in the estimation of optimal hedging ratios in a South African context and the monitoring of farmers’ marketing activities as the maize market matures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The main challenge for agricultural economists is effectiveness rather than efficiency. Effectiveness is the channcling of resources and efforts to those endeavours rendering the highest returns. Efficiency is the extent to which it is done well. Agricultural economists should be system directed problem solvers. Failures to clearly recognize interactions between levels or activities in the total system cause expensive problems. Effectiveness requires such recognition aimed at improving human welfare. Grave inequitabilities occur in South African agriculture and food consumption. Production and consumption are both dualistic, without agricultural economists analyzing inequitabilities meaningfully. They have been effective neither in dealing with problems of commercial agriculture nor with the macro environment in a holistic sense, nor with institutions, nor with consumption economics. The already low effectiveness has been further decreased by some tool-oriented research. In South Africa, effectiveness implies more accent on problem-solving analysis: adaptive and maintenance research. Efficiency requires use of appropriate logic, analytical tools and data. It has lately been lowered by overemphasis on so-called elegant analytical tools and simultaneously, neglect in proper data collection. A reorientation is needed in this respect. SAMEVATTING Die hoofuitdaging vir landbou-ekonome is eerder effektiwiteit as doeltreffendheid. Effektiwiteit is die kanalisering van bronne en bemoeienis na daardie pogings wat die hoogste opbrengste sat oplewer. Doeltreffendheid is die mate waar toe dit goed gedoen word. Landbou-ekonome behoort sisteemgerigte probleemoplossers te wees. As daarin gefaal word om duidelik die interaksies tussen vlakke of aktiwiteite in die geheelsisteem te erken, veroorsaak dit duur probleme. Effektiwiteit vereis sodanige erkenning gemik op verhoging van menslike welvaaart. Ernstige onbillikhede bestaan in die Suid-Afrikaanse landbou en voedselverbruik. Produksie en ook verbruik is dualisties sonder dat landbou-ekonome onbillikhede betekenisvol ontleed het. Hul was ook nog effektief in die hantering van probleme van die kommersiële landbou, nog van die makro-omgewing holisties gesien, nog van institusies, nog in verbruiksekonomie. Die reeds lae effektiwiteit is verder verminder deur sommige metodiek georiënteerde navorsing. In Suid-Afrika impliseer effektiwiteit meer nadruk op probleemoplossingsanalise: aanpassings- en instandhoudingsnavorsing. Doeltreffendheid verg die gebruik van gepaste logika, analise metodes en gegewens. Dis in onlangse tye verlaag deur die oorbeklemtoning van sogenaamde elegante analisemetodes en tegelykertyd 'n velwaarlosing van behoorlike data-inwinning. 'n Reoriëntering is in hierdie verband nodig.",

Almost all the water trades (permanent and rentals) observed in this study were from farmers above the gorge to farmers below the gorge. In order to study whether the water market promotes efficiency the data were subjected to several statistical analyses (Principal Components, Ridge Regression, Logit). It is concluded that in the transfer of water some attributes in the purchasing area such as lower production risk (sugar cane) and lower financial risk and better cashflow (bananas and sugar cane) were more important than the income per cubic meter of water. Water supply in this area is highly irregular while farmers were found to be extremely risk averse especially as far as down-side risk is concerned. The average water price in this area in recent years (2002 to 2003) was between R2,000 and R3,000 per ha (1ha = 8,000 cubic meter). Buyers are large progressive farmers that purchase (and rent) from many sellers (or lessees). It is concluded that information (sale prices and rents) is asymmetrical. Few permanent transfers have taken place in the Crocodile River in recent years. It is concluded that there are reasons why transfers at present are not processed and role players should discuss these reasons and possible solutions before further action is taken.",

Increasing awareness of the economic value of biological diversity has resulted in industries seeking to exploit traditional knowledge and biodiversity through opportunistic behaviour (biopiracy). This is also happening in South Africa, where numerous industries are developing new products. Recent advances in the field of biotechnology have created the need for greater intellectual property rights protection. The protection of traditional knowledge has however long been ignored as developed nations and large industries have sought to promote self-serving systems of protection. In this paper the example of an indigenous medicinal plant is used to analyse and describe the extent to which patent and trademark protection is able to protect traditional ethno-botanical knowledge in South Africa. The study therefore aims to contribute to an understanding of the value that traditional knowledge holds for the sustainable development and economic growth of communities, and how such knowledge can be protected.",

While projections of known reserves indicate sufficient coal for 114 years, air pollution from coal power plants causes serious environmental damage. The production of lignocellulosic biomass for generating bioelectricity seems to be an appropriate option in order to become less dependent on fossil fuels. In this article, the potential for producing this type of biomass was investigated for the Cape Winelands District Municipality (CWDM). First, the potential area for production in a Short-Rotation Coppice (SRC) system was identified by means of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). After assessing suitable tree species and their productivity rates, an annual supply of about 1.4 million tonnes per year could be expected, using exotic species such as Eucalyptus cladocalyx. Three scenarios were assessed by means of farm modelling. The first scenario describes woody biomass production as a single production activity...",

Following maize market deregulation and subsequent entry of private buyers in the Zimbabwean grain sector, marginalised poor farmers remained confined to the low return private buyer market that offered very low prices, as they avoided GMB whose payment plan was uncertain and delayed. The question therefore was: To what extent did farmers' risk aversion attitude and time preference explain the poor farmers' choice for low return private buyer market at the expense of the high return GMB market? Using survey data obtained from 433 maize farmers in Makonde and Zvimba districts, an instrumental variable probit regression model was estimated. The results confirmed that risk aversion attitude and time preferences (as measured by farmers' discount rate) reduced the likelihood of a farmer participating in a high return state-owned GMB market. Poor farmers were found to be more risk averse and impatient than non-poor farmers in marketing channel selection. Their high risk aversion attitude and impatience constituted the greatest market impediments that restricted them to the low return private buyer market. To make agricultural markets work for poverty reduction the study recommended that policies that promote the development of risk transfer markets and futures markets for maturity transformation of farmers' payments are critical in guaranteeing effective participation of poor households in high return markets.",

    "abstract": "In developing countries, where few incentives exist for private sector investment in research, public investment in agricultural research and development (R&D) is critical for technological change that stimulates agricultural development, food security and poverty alleviation. This article analyses trends for key indicators in agricultural R&D in South Africa, building on the work of Liebenberg et al. (2011). The paper uses data collected from a range of sources including the Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) surveys comprising data for the period 2000–2014. Results show fluctuations in agricultural R&D spending, although there was a general increase in gross spending on R&D at national level, reflecting a continued trend of increased funding for non-agricultural research. Research spending intensity ratios for South Africa remain higher than the recommended 1 per cent. Despite the harsh economic environment and lower than expected economic growth in South Africa since 2011, the government continues to provide the major source of funds for the Agricultural Research Council (ARC). When compared with countries in Africa south of the Sahara, South Africa continues to rank second in agricultural R&D investment, whilst it invests much less than its BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India and China) counterparts, despite having the highest research intensity ratio. The article supports Liebenberg et al. (2011)’s recommendations for revisiting policies for long term support of agricultural R&D and explores mechanisms for the ARC to establish sustainable funding streams for agricultural R&D. Recommendations for establishing comparable research spending intensity ratios are also made.",

Using Vector Error Correction and Threshold Vector Error Correction models, our study complements the traditional investigations of linear vertical integration with the analysis of possible asymmetries in price transmission. We adopted monthly retail price series from July 2004 until January 2014. The retail price allowed us a better understanding of how an inefficient market system taxes consumers than did the wholesale price normally used in the literature. We found a low speed of vertical price co-integration for white teff with different features at the regional level. Our results show linear or symmetric price transmission for the Amhara and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region regions, revealing the relative efficiency and competitiveness of the market. On the other hand, we found the presence of non-linear price transmission for the Oromia and Tigrai regions; this asymmetry result pronounced towards positive price shocks implying a persistent price rise that worsens the livelihood of final users. Based on our findings, we suggest, among other measures, providing better market infrastructure, encouraging market participation for the product, introducing and disseminating cultures and institutions that bring producers and sellers closer, increasing the productivity of producers and the supply of their produce, and strengthening farmers' organisation as measures of policy intervention to enhance efficiency and competitiveness of the white teff supply chain in Ethiopia.",

Simulations are carried out to remove EU tariffs on fruit products, non-tariff measures (NTMs) and other influential factors accounting for the unfilled portion of the TRQs. A large proportion of quota under-fill is explained by the presence of NTMs which include aspects of the TRQ administration methods on the exporter side. The results of the simulations show that the increase in exports is greater with the removal of NTMs than with tariff removal. The findings of the equivalent variation (EV) measure of welfare show a welfare loss of −US$14 040 in South Africa when quota fill is simulated without the removal of NTMs. Partial trade liberalisation characterised by the removal of only tariffs, exhibits smaller welfare gains (US$31 943) compared with the combined liberalisation of tariffs and NTMs which improves welfare by US$221 834. The study concludes that the trade liberalisation process of fruit products TRQs should simultaneously implement full tariff liberalisation with TRQ expansion and the reduction of NTMs.",

In 2003 the moratorium was replaced by a strict, costly and politicised regime for regulatory approval which is impossible for African exporters to satisfy. Further, co-mingling of unapproved GMOs with conventional crops has meant refusal of shipments. The EU NTBs have also inhibited a productivity enhancing technology as African countries feared loss of markets given their inability to segregate GMOs. Further, absence of GMO use has meant little investment in GMO-based tropical crops. Biological science is not static and the declining cost of genomic information combined with low cost gene editing technologies means that gains in productivity can be obtained without transgenics. Genomics uses improved information on the genetic make-up of a plant to enhance its performance using its existing genetic material. Thus, the speculative risks associated with transgenics should not arise for genomics. The falling cost of genomic information and implementing technologies, may create opportunities for African-based developers of genomic-based crops. This paper explores the potential of a relatively open regulatory regime for genomic-based crops from Africa entering the EU including the potential for African adoption and plant breeding.",

Results indicate that there has been no technical progress in the sector over the past decade and group members are falling further behind their own benchmark as time passes. Relative rankings have remained stable, with most of the group riding the peaks and troughs of good and bad years without breaking rank. There is clearly room for fresh thinking. Drought does not offer a simple explanation for the observed trends. This group's total factor productivity is inversely correlated with farm size despite evidence that their technology is increasing returns-to-scale. This is difficult to explain. Woolled sheep seems to be the solution to drought, but too much land under planted pastures lowers overall efficiency. There is much more investigation to do, including to cast the net wider so that a more sophisticated efficiency model can be fitted. There was no information on heat stress or rainfall variability, or the date of adoption of conservation agriculture, which is known to be a good strategy against unreliable rainfall. We also could not model the effect of farmers' skills and ambitions on their performance. The study's main contribution is to debunk the myths that rainfall places an absolute limit on performance and that a larger scale of operation is always beneficial.",

The purpose of the research is to determine the method of valuation that is the most appropriate and reliable for the valuation of a broiler farm. A sample of 15 out of the 196 contract broiler farm valuations was selected in the Mpumalanga and North West provinces in South Africa. The size of the broiler houses was at least 1 000 m2. Broiler units with a minimum of four houses were taken into account. Data was gathered by means of assessments of previous valuations as well as physical valuations done in the field and analysed statistically. Figures were tested for normality; differences between the overall means were determined by the analysis of variance using the ANOVA test; the correlation coefficients between the two different methods and the dependable variable were determined; and regression analysis was fitted. The differences in the coefficient of variance between the two sets of data used indicate that the cost approach has a smaller variation around the mean. The income approach, on the other hand, indicates a more realistic approach, because the basis is the net margin and not a norm for replacement and depreciation. Although differences do exist, a strong correlation exists between the two methods.

Typical farm models for the study area were developed for this purpose. The results of this study showed that the higher income due to genetic selection compensates for the investment in fencing material.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Agriculture is a very important sector in Namibia as approximately 70% of the country's population relies on it for a living, while it contributes to 5.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Due to the low rainfall in the southern parts of the country it is predominantly used for sheep farming while the central parts are used for cattle farming. There are basically four different marketing alternatives for sheep from commercial producers in Namibia. The live export of sheep to South Africa always was the best-priced market for Namibian producers. Since the SSMS had placed a limit on the amount of sheep that may be exported, the number of local slaughtering for export and local consumption has increased. These market options, however, results in a lower producer price and the average price for mutton and lamb in Namibia had thus decreased in comparison with the prices in South Africa. A focus group study was used to derive a collaborative marketing strategy for farmers. After conducting a risk analysis and setting short, medium and long term objectives, a SWOT analysis and TOWS matrix assisted the producers in deriving a strategy. After discussing every strategic option, the group decided that they will first market to the Windhoek market through a group-owned butchery. They will target the higher income groups, by selling high-value cuts in large quantities and low-value cuts to the low-income groups, thereby integrating further down the supply chain and gaining a larger proportion of the consumer dollar.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The advent of grid electrification in the Sandveld region of South Africa in the 1980s increased the utilisation of groundwater resources for commercial irrigation purposes. In the wake of the consequent increased pressure on the resource, it behooves landowners to use water more productively and responsibly. This paper calculated the marginal product value (MPV) of irrigation water for potatoes and vine production in this region to assess and to allow the comparison of the productivity of irrigation water with other commodities and regions. However, the results suggested that the scope for leveraging changes to water use behaviour in the Sandveld solely through water pricing is limited. Given that electricity is a critical input for the utilization of groundwater, we suspect that the price of electricity would be a suitable lever to influence irrigation behaviour. In light of the imminent Government electricity price hikes, we advise some further investigation on the impacts these impending hikes will have on irrigation farming in the study area. We suspect that pumping costs (as opposed to the price of water itself) will become the most limiting factor for irrigation water use in the Sandveld in the foreseeable future. A mixture of water and energy pricing strategies therefore lends itself as a more pragmatic policy approach to follow in order to influence irrigation behaviour, as opposed to a sole focus on water pricing.",

In the semi-arid North West Province of South Africa water scarcity and the soon to be implemented water charges have urged farmers in small-scale irrigation schemes to evaluate the efficiency of their water use. Data on 60 farmers were used to estimate the level of technical efficiency and the effect that drainage water re-use could have on efficiency levels. This effect of water reuse was simulated by a 5, 10, 15 and 20 per cent reduction in water use at farm level. A Malmquist productivity index was calculated to evaluate the effect of these reductions. The main finding was that under current farming conditions many farmers operated at suboptimal levels of technical efficiency. While a reduction in water use evidently increased factor productivity for most farms, the effect clearly varied strongly between farms. This confirms the need to take a systems approach for this type of evaluations.",

This study examines a proposal to apply this strategy to small-scale farmers in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), using soybeans as feedstock for biodiesel production. First, it is argued that value-adding cooperatives established under South Africa's current Cooperatives Act, No. 14 of 2005 (hereafter the Cooperatives Act) would fail to attract the capital and expertise needed to process biodiesel owing to ill-defined voting and benefit rights. Second, a mixed integer linear programming model is used to determine the viability of producing biodiesel from soybeans, viewed from the perspective of the smallholder as grower and co-owner of the processing plant. It is concluded that smallholder participation would require a rental market for cropland, co-ownership of the processing plant in a non-traditional cooperative or investorowned firm, information and training, and a high level of government subsidy.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The purpose of this paper is to explore the state and agriculture at the subnational sphere; an area currently receiving little attention in the South African agricultural economics fraternity. It is argued that South Africa's Constitution bestows certain decision-making and legislative powers on its nine provinces and that public goods and redistributive policy options are available to the agricultural sector. As about two-thirds of South African agricultural expenditure (83% if conditional grants are included) takes place at provincial level, it was shown that provincial dynamics are relevant. While the characteristics of tribal populations in provinces are found to be important, a poor alignment between provincial agricultural expenditure and certain elements of consequence (employment, value addition, etc.) can be shown. The paper also deconstructs the commonly used terms “state” and “agriculture” at a provincial level and dwell on the concept of the rational civil servant. In the case of the state, the challenge of moving beyond institutionalised silos is discussed. It is shown that agriculture consists out a multitude of actors, that representation often overlap and that similarities with a “tragedy of the commons” can be observed in the way some of the actors maximise personal gains. To understand the system non-traditional schools of thought such as “social economic systems” and “bounded rationality” may provide answers.",

As a result, the studies suffer index number bias and a number of shortcomings that are due to the underlying price and quantity data. These shortcomings include inconsistencies over time in the inclusion of production originating from homeland farmers as well as changing statistical methods and definitions used in forming the national estimates of agricultural production. By addressing these data and measurement issues, including the use of the Fisher Ideal indexing methods, we generate an output quantity index that differs substantially from those presented in past studies. For example, the hybrid Törnqvist-Theil approach suggests that South African agricultural output grew by an average of 2.96 per cent per year over the century spanning 1910–2010, whereas a Fisher Ideal aggregation of the same underlying price and quantity data suggests a growth rate of 3.33 per cent per year.Keywords: agricultural productionDivisia indexesJEL Classification: E01Q16C43",

    "abstract": "Farm households respond to market uncertainties and household demand for food commodities by diversifying their farm-level crop portfolio. However, it is unclear if farmers' crop mix also responds to unpredictable climate variability. We use primary data from 267 randomly selected respondents and apply a multinomial logit model to test the hypothesis that crop portfolio choice is an ex-ante mechanism to manage climate risks in the absence of crop insurance. The results suggest that access to information on climate variability does influence the mix of maize, cassava, sweet potato, and sorghum, which smallholder farmers in Kisumu County, Kenya grow in various combinations. Access to credit services, farm size, gender of household head, farming experience, and distance to nearest market also influence the farm-level crop mixture. These findings imply that policies geared towards incentivizing a better crop choice portfolio at the smallholder farm level should address climate variability awareness. In addition, encouraging crop-variety mixes that are tolerant to climate risks would enhance resilience in food systems among these smallholder farmers.",

The study utilises cross-sectional farm household-level data collected in 2017/2018 from a randomly selected sample of 323 farmers in Arsi Highland of Ethiopia. We estimate the adoption and causal impact of improved varieties by utilising endogenous switching regression complemented with a binary propensity score matching methodology. This helps us estimate the productivity and welfare effect of technological adoption by controlling for the role of selection bias problem stemming from both observed and unobserved heterogeneity. Our analysis reveals a consistent result across models indicating that adoption enhances wheat productivity per hectare by 0.63 tons/ha and household welfare by 31%. Even farm households that did not adopt would benefit significantly had they adopted. Education, wheat price, farm machineries, crop rotation, row planting, social capital (such as informal network, core trust, and institutional trust), training on varieties selection, and information on seed availability are found to be the main drivers behind the adoption of improved wheat varieties.",

    "abstract": "South African sheep farmers receive different prices for animals of different age, carcass form and fat level. Older animals trade at a substantive discount to the younger animals due to the perceived tenderness and juiciness of the younger animal. There is however a question whether the size of the discount is warranted given that certain cuts from older animals are preferred by consumers for specific purposes. This paper applies an experimental auction combined with sensory tests to establish the consumers' willingness to pay for sheep meat products from carcasses with different age categories. In this way the paper endeavours to test whether the price differentiation in the mind of the consumer (through its perceived intrinsic value) corresponds with the price differentiation at the abattoir level. Consumers' sensory assessment results and average bid prices via the experimental auction indicated a difference in preference towards the three age classes for the stew meat, loin, and leg cuts respectively. The results validate previous results with trained panels and confirm the specific consumer preferences for specific cuts of different age categories. It was also found that the difference in the bids for different age categories was far smaller than the difference in abattoir prices for the different age categories.",

    "abstract": "Most countries within Southern Africa are reliant on cereal imports from South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) region, cereal insecure countries are often import-dependent. Changing income levels, pandemics, climatic conditions and the trade environment all create a wedge and put pressure on food self-sufficiency. This paper uses a robust dynamic approach of a five-country panel to investigate the key determinants of cereal self-sufficiency in the SACU region. Long-term and short-term effects of selected variables are tested using a dynamic panel data model. The key long-term drivers for cereal self-sufficiency are identified and the short-term results reveal that land surface and rainfall are statistically most significant at a level of ten percent. The Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test suggests that SACU member states could propose further macroeconomic harmonisation and good governance to stabilise national income to cushion against the possible increased cost of cereal production especially in Lesotho, Eswatini and Namibia. The adoption of climate smart technology to safeguard against rainfall variability and reduce the carbon footprint is important to foster an increase in agricultural productivity. A lack of effective harmonised policies may lead to an acceleration in cereal production insecurity and increased poverty.",

Club data refers to any convenience sample obtained from a study group, consulting firm, cooperative or producer organisation. The study develops a stochastic frontier production function model with the inefficiency effects of pasture-based dairy farming in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. The analysis for 2012–2018 involves 49 adopter farms, and controls for inter-calf period, nutrient use efficiency and the amount of extension contact. Results are robust to functional form specification and there is no evidence of frontier-shifting technical progress for the Cobb Douglas or translog model, but there is a clear productivity benefit to engaging with the private extension service provider working locally (adoption). Productivity rises at 0.91–1.06% p.a. over time and by 1.54–1.62% p.a. with each extra year of the extension. Large farms close to the private extension provider’s base of operations benefit most from being in the group. This case study is important because it documents productivity growth in the period since 2010 and puts the effect of extension on productivity growth back on the local research agenda.",

For the empirical analysis, rural household survey data, which was matched with rainfall variability data and experimentally generated measures of risk preference, was used. The results show that increased rainfall variability prompts households to reduce the application of productivity-enhancing inputs, such as fertiliser, but bolsters the application of low-risk inputs such as manure. These results are robust to alternative specifications and support the theoretical predictions developed. The findings suggest the following policy implications for chemical fertiliser use among risk-averse smallholder farmers in areas characterized by rainfall variability. First, developing more weather-resilient crop varieties and irrigation could stimulate higher use of chemical fertiliser by producing more stable yields. Secondly, weather index insurance (WII) could incentivize higher chemical fertiliser use by reducing income risk and easing liquidity constraints. Thirdly, social protection such as cash transfer programmes could lead to a higher use of chemical fertiliser by serving as insurance against income risks (i.e., through providing regular and predictable financial resources).",

We collect data on resilience components such as education, asset ownership, dwelling characteristics, water access, and sanitation facilities. Principal component analysis is used to generate factor weights for constructing the Resilience Capacity Index, which measures overall household resilience capacity and individual resilience components. The resilience capacity is then used in regression models to assess its mitigating effects on food security during conflicts and shocks. Our results indicate that resilience capacity significantly reduces the adverse effects of conflict and shock on food security. In Malawi, household head education contributes most to food security, while in Uganda, water access is the most critical component. In Malawi, water access resilience diminishes the impact of conflict, sanitation resilience reduces the impacts of flooding, and dwelling characteristics lessen the effects of drought, although the effect size is small. In Uganda, asset ownership resilience mitigates the impacts of drought, while sanitation resilience reduces the adverse effects of conflict. These findings highlight the importance of different resilience components in enhancing food security under various adverse conditions.",

However, these methods have proven ineffective in managing the full impact of drought. Consequently, policymakers are increasingly interested in promoting Index-based Pasture Insurance (IBPI). This paper aims to assess subsistence livestock farmers' preferences for IBPI. A simple random sampling method was used to select 110 subsistence livestock farmers for data collection. A discrete choice experiment—Conditional Logit and Latent Class models and incentivized lottery games were used to elicit preferences for insurance contracts and loss aversion. The findings indicate that subsistence livestock farmers have a favourable attitude toward IBPI contracts that protect against drought-related pasture degradation. The Conditional Logit model shows that farmers prefer transparent contracts that reimburse with feed and vouchers rather than cash. However, they derive negative marginal utility from basis risk and premium. However, the Latent Class model reveals heterogeneous preferences for IBPI among farmers. Farmers are also loss-averse, but loss aversion did not influence their preference for IBPI. Therefore, the primary recommendation for insurance providers is to consider customizing IBPI attributes to increase adoption among subsistence farmers.",

Twenty-five farm commodities and seven agribusinesses are explicitly included in the model. The coloured and black populations dominate provincial expenditure on fresh and processed farm commodities, suggesting that future demand growth depends on income increases among these household groups. In the aggregate, agriculture’s contributions to job creation, value added and government revenue significantly exceed those of the nonagricultural sectors; agribusiness exceeds other nonagricultural sectors because of their backward links to production agriculture. Within agriculture, horticulture and livestock subsectors make the most significant contributions to the macro economy. Similar patterns are found with respect to generating household incomes, and in the equality with which such incomes are distributed. Household economic behaviour is explicit. Spending by the poor is found to be more labour intensive than spending by the rich, and generates greater impacts on value added (GGP), gross operating surplus and the demand for most farm and non-farm commodities. A composite ranking of macroeconomic contributions to development is constructed. Nine horticultural enterprises and broilers comprise the ten top sectors.",

In view of their relevance for the local economy (e.g., as a source of foreign exchange earnings and supply of fuelwood), an adequate management of forest resources should be pursued. In these economies forest exploitation and land conversion have often been seen as a temporary solution to structural problems. In this way, however, the same problems are even aggravated in the long run. The study first reviews recent explanations of tropical deforestation: a distinction is drawn between areas of substantial agreement on the one hand, and discordant results and interpretations on the other. In the main part of the analysis, based on cross-country data for the 1980s, regression models incorporating different sets of determinants of deforestation are applied. Compared to previous studies, the analysis tries to better account for the sequential timing of some of these determinants. Different patterns are identified among country groups, according to specific features of economic activities, macroeconomic and political environments, and climatic conditions.",

An analysis of natural resources and markets shows that limited potential exists in a regional context for trade in 'virtual water' through food imports. Policy options for intra- and intersectoral water reallocation must therefore receive priority attention. Based on experiences in other countries, emphasis is placed on successful innovations of markets in tradable water rights, local management, user-based performance assessment and water saving technologies in irrigated agriculture. The recently published National Water Policy for South Africa and draft National Water Bill that has been released for discussion are accordingly evaluated. With application of the theory of New Institutional Economics, a number of deficiencies in the accepted principles and policy measures become apparent. It is clear that the proposed water licences are insecure; this will not induce efficient market al locations nor will it enable effective participation of water users in water management. Further economic contributions in policy making are required for the design of unattenuated water entitlements in order to achieve correct pricing incentives.",

The micro lending industry has been accused of charging usurious interest and exploiting the consumers. This has led to the Department of Trade and Industry passing a Usury Act with an aim of protecting the consumers. The Act imposes interest rate ceilings on loan finance provided by money lending institutions. These ceilings are proposed to be linked to the prime rate. Given this, it is not possible for micro lenders to charge full-cost recovery interest rates. This paper tries to highlight the effects of interest rate ceilings on the micro finance market. It argues that the biggest cost component of microlenders is administration costs and not the cost of capital, thus linking ceilings to the prime rate is illogic.",

In this paper the focus of the analysis is on establishing whether the country has a Comparative advantage in the cultivation of sugar cane. The results from the Policy Analysis Matrix show that South Africa has no comparative advantage in the production of sugar cane under current world market conditions, principally due to the high level of support from import protection policies. However, the world market price for sugar results from a thinly traded market. Thus, an attempt is made to measure comparative advantage under different assumptions about the domestic and world price of sugar, and the exchange rate. At an assumed price of $307 per ton, South African growers show strong comparative advantages even with the current exchange rate. When the exchange rate is allowed to fall, production is even more viable, despite input price increases that result directly and indirectly from the higher cost of imports.",

Demand functions indicate that the elasticity of fresh milk demand increased over time to near unity at retail level, due to growing proportion of Black consumers and increasing prevalence of substitutes. Elasticity estimates of industrial milk varied from −0,47 at the farm level to −0,93 at retail level. Elasticities of industrial milk was also found to increase over time. Income elasticities for fresh and industrial milk using cross sectional data were +0,44 for fresh milk and +0,40 for industrial milk. Estimates agree with the Slutsky-Schultz and Hicks Allen relation (Wold and Juréen) stating that as a rule income elasticities of necessity are smaller than price elasticities. The increase in the price elasticity of milk implies that consumption has become slightly more price responsive and that price may become a more important feature in the selling of milk. The supply elasticity of industrial milk was estimated at +0,55 at farming level.",

Data were deflated with a commodity price index and natural logarithmic partial adjustment equations were estimated with two-stage least squares to determine demand parameters for each product. Theoretically expected results were obtained and, owing to variability in seasonal data, results were generally highly significant. Beef is confirmed as the dominant commodity in the red meat market, having cross-price flexibilities with mutton and pork of 0,30 and 0,20, respectively. All goods other than pumpkins are shown to be normal and fruits and vegetables (having many substitutes) are shown to be demand elastic. All products are normal goods, with the exception of pumpkins (income flexibility of −0,74), which are inferior. Apples and pineapples were found to be the dominant fruits and onions, tomatoes and cabbages had the most significant cross-price effects on the system of vegetable demand equations.",

The Malmquist is appropriate because prices do really exist for major inputs such as land and labour. The small size of the cross section is overcome by using the sequential version of the Malmquist, which accumulates the annual data, so increasing the stability of the frontier. The regional MFPs are the natural peer group for producing a national MFP, so the problem of choosing peers, in earlier work on international comparisons does not arise. The results show that the national MFP grew at an average rate 1.57% per annum. However, disaggregation by enterprise shows that the livestock MFP declined at a rate of 0.34% per annum while that for crops grew at 3.37% per annum. Decomposition of the Malmquist shows that there was positive technological change combined with decreasing efficiency. Comparisons of the regional results show a very clear pattern whereby the advantaged regions are able to exploit new technologies whereas the resource poor, geographically disadvantaged areas have been stagnant and have thereby fallen further and further behind the best practice frontier.",

The number of transactions increased with associated equity and efficiency gains. This study explores changes in variable transaction costs by examining changes in the type of rental contracts observed over time. A census survey of 39 households participating in a total of 73 rental transactions was undertaken in the original study area during November 2000. The data revealed growth in the variety and length of rental contracts, supporting other evidence of declining transaction costs. In particular, a linear regression model estimated to quantify the partial contribution of factors affecting contract length shows that the introduction of witnessed written lease agreements has facilitated longer-term rentals for a wide range of contract types, even in cases where the lesson and lessee are strangers. The evidence suggests that government extension staff could playa key role in sustaining rental markets for cropland in communal areas by absorbing sonic transaction costs, training tribal councillors and disseminating information.",

For each crop the Cobb-Douglas production function model is used to investigate the allocative efficiency of the maize and cotton producers. The tests for allocative efficiency are performed by estimating the equations for the Cobb-Douglas production function model. The findings of this paper show that the SSC farmers are utilising the fertilizer resource efficiently but they are under-utilising land, seed and insecticides. These producers are over-utilising labour and capital.",

It indicates that these programs provide mainly curative health services but the issue of sustainability has continued to dodge most of them. It establishes that, for trainees to continue actively providing services, continued professional development obtained through regular refresher training and entrepreneurship exemplified by proper record keeping are important. It therefore recommends that policy review is needed to address the role of CBAHWs and appropriately integrate their activities within the formal animal health delivery system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study presents a production function analysis of fresh milk production in the Highlands of Eritrea, where most dairy farmers in Eritrea are located. To ensure representative production functions, this region was divided into three relatively homogenous study areas, namely Central Zone, Mendefera and Dekemhare. Most data for the study were collected in a survey of 120 respondents using a structured questionnaire. To obviate the problem of multicollinearity among explanatory variables, ridge regression was used to estimate milk production functions for each study area. Production elasticities of variable inputs, marginal products (MPx), values of marginal products (VMPx), marginal rates of input substitution (MRS) and least-cost combinations of purchased concentrates and forage were estimated for the three regions. The VMPs of all inputs for Central Zone dairy farmer respondents were estimated to be greater than their input prices, implying that the resources were under-utilized from a profit-maximising perspective (i.e. where VMPx = Px). However, respondents in Mendefera and Dekemhare used concentrates in excess of optimum levels (i.e. VMPx < Px). Analysis of the least-cost combination of purchased concentrates and forage suggests that dairy farmer respondents were also not allocating these resources on a minimum-cost basis. However, the profit maximizing and least-cost criteria assume perfect knowledge, a risk-free environment and competitive markets. Improved information, farmer training and better infrastructure (roads and telecommunications) to promote competitive markets could help to enhance resource allocation decisions by dairy producers.",

Risk is incorporated into the model as the negative deviation of the actual gross income from the expected value of an activity's gross income. The model includes crop production (permitting and optimising a crop rotation system), dairy production and wool sheep production. Relevant data from a farm in the Swartland region of the Western Cape were used to test and validate the model. The results show that the adoption of crop rotation is superior in terms of gross margin to that generated from a mono-crop strategy. Empirical results also indicate that the complex interrelationships involved in a mixed crop-livestock farm operation play a major role in determining optimal farm plans. These complex interrelationships favour the introduction of crop rotation in the crop production activities of the farm under investigation. Solutions of the model with risk indicate that the crop rotation strategy and animal production levels are sensitive to different risk levels, and that the incorporation of risk greatly affects the level of land allocation to crop rotation and animal production level of the farm. Finally, the results suggest that the introduction of crop rotation is of paramount importance in improving the profitability and sustainability of the farm, thus the inclusion of forage crops such as medics into the integrated crop-livestock production is beneficial for sustained profitability.",

This study examines the attributes of small-scale sugarcane contractors that affect their quality of service as perceived by small-scale sugarcane growers (SSGs). Information was obtained through interviews conducted with 114 contractors sampled in ten mill group areas in KwaZulu-Natal between September 2002 and July 2003. Further interviews were conducted in the same time period with SSGs for information on contractor service quality (transport and general service timeliness, meeting of daily rateable delivery requirements, low downtimes, good staff management, and minimal disagreements on service terms). Results show that factors affecting a contractor's perceived service quality include gender, training, the quality of information used (industry focused information sources such as the South African Sugar Association Experiment Station (SASEX)3 and the Ingede magazine, or general sources such as the radio), and sugarcane tonnage transported (size of business). Being a male contractor and having a larger business positively influence service rating as perceived by SSGs. The importance of the quality of information used and increased training levels highlights the need for the continual provision of relevant information and training for sugarcane contractors by extension services (government, SASEX and milling companies).",

The objective of this study was to determine the price attributes of Döhne Merino wool in South Africa using a hedonic model and data from 83 registered Döhne Merino farmers in South Africa. The results indicated that the price of Fleece wool was most sensitive to changes in the staple strength, staple length, and fibre diameter, while clean yield had a lower impact. Fibre diameter had the largest effect on the price of Pieces wool, followed by staple strength and staple length. The Bellies wool price was very sensitive to changes in clean yield, followed by staple length. It is recommended that Döhne Merino wool with higher staple strength and longer staple length should be produced due to the price premiums that could be earned. The findings provide evidence of the demand for quality attributes associated with wool and could aid Döhne Merino wool producers in deciding how to maximise their profit. Woolgrowers and other interested stakeholders could use this information to ensure that wool quality meets market demand.",

    "abstract": "Livestock production remains vulnerable to animal disease, threatening the productivity and food security of smallholder farmers. Application of primary animal health care (PAHC) practices is considered a cost-effective method for farmers to prevent and control livestock diseases. Using data collected on 593 smallholder farmers in five provinces of South Africa, this paper uses partial proportional odds (PPO) modelling to evaluate the determinants of livestock keepers' choice of PAHC practices. Access to animal handling facilities, contact with animal health practitioners, farmers' associations, household income and positive perceptions about vaccines had a positive influence on the farmer's choice of PAHC practices, while negative perceptions about vaccines had a negative influence. Increased timely delivery of animal health services and provision of animal handling facilities is recommended to expedite increased farmers' uptake of PAHC practices. Development of animal health policies using the \"One Health\" approach is advised to ensure a collaborative, multisectoral and transdisciplinary effort at local and national level to achieve optimal health outcomes. Use of the PPO model is a departure from the norm in the literature for determining a farmer's adoption strategies. The model proved to be instrumental as it predicted significant variables extra to those usually applied in multinomial models.",

The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of introduction of a rice-based mixed cropping system to the seasonal wetlands (ondombe in the local language) from agronomic, social, and economic perspectives. For this purpose, we used a simple methodology with a multidisciplinary approach for yield and household survey and scenario analysis in northern Namibia. The yield survey revealed that in ondombe, rice showed a higher yield performance than that of pearl millet and sorghum, even in a drought year. The farm household survey showed that introducing a rice-based mixed cropping to ondombe could help local farmers enhance crop productivity by reducing labour and providing high rice yield. In addition, scenario analysis based on the yield and household surveys conducted in these regions suggested that the introduction of the mixed cropping system to ondombe could compensate for one-fourth of the governmental urgent food import budget even in drought years. Therefore, this system is an effective option for sustainable agricultural production and environmental management in the studied region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Managing a profitable commercial agricultural business requires more than effective budgeting and financial bookkeeping. Due to dramatic changes in the agricultural decision-making environment over the past 15 years, farmers have to realise that farming requires effective risk management. A successful farmer is one who can identify these risks, match them up with expected returns and make the best decision on future actions. The farmer must be able to look strategically into the future and position the business in a way that ensures long-term sustainability and survivability. To forecast effectively, it is vital for the agribusiness to predict the effects of various risks on the financial position of the business. This research attempts to develop a simulated dairy management model that can be used as a farm management tool. Normal distributions were used to simulate the movement of maize prices under different scenarios. This model was applied to a 2007 case study, and it was found to be a suitable tool for financial analysis and scenario planning. By utilising different sets of input values, the model gives an indication of the possibility of risks involved in different scenarios. However, the model is in a rather crude form, and further development should be undertaken to account for the interaction between variable inputs. The model highlights the importance of a change in strategic direction, while it is useful in analysing the scenario outcomes of new strategies.",

The study uses a microeconomic approach, the unit cost ratio (UCR) method of competitiveness analysis, to assess changes in the relative competitiveness of EG milk producers from 1983–2006. Findings of previous research indicate that dairy market deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s caused lower real milk producer prices, increased uncertainty and higher exit rates in the South African dairy industry. Results of the UCR analysis suggest that EG milk producers were not competitive based on the net local price received for milk but were competitive when dairy cattle trading income was included. This suggests that dairy cattle trading income played an important role in enhancing the profitability of EG dairy enterprises in the study period. Further UCR analysis revealed that the top one-third of EG milk producers were relatively competitive from 1983–2006 due to higher real milk prices and lower unit costs. A panel data study of individual EG milk producers could be used to identify other important factors affecting milk producer competitiveness over time.",

Knowledge about the presence of a central market and its price dynamic effects on satellite markets will assist the effectiveness of food assistance and other humanitarian food price support interventions. This is of particular interest to constant food aid recipients such as Ethiopia. This article intends to empirically investigate as to whether or not there is a central maize market that dictate and lead price information flow over the regional wholesale maize markets in Ethiopia. If such a dominant maize market exists, then how does its price affect the maize grain prices of major regional wholesale maize markets in Ethiopia? The extended VAR procedure of Toda and the Yamamoto Granger Causality approach is used to test the central maize market hypothesis. Furthermore, we use the system of seemingly unrelated regression model to examine the effects of the central market price on three wholesale regional maize market prices in Ethiopia. The results indicate that Addis Ababa wholesale maize market influences the maize price formation of all regional maize markets examined in this study. Therefore, interventions targeting the central wholesale market could successfully provide a buffer for local maize surplus and consumption markets against undesirable price shocks stemming from the central market.",

That transformation is in part attributable to South Africa's investment in the national maize cultivar trials, which have facilitated the adoption and use of maize cultivars that are highly adapted to commercial farmer localities, causing considerable gains in yields. The economic value of the public investment in the trials remains unknown. This study uses experimental yields spanning 1977 - 2012 to attribute the influence of the national maize cultivar trials to maize yield improvement on farmer localities in the Highveld region of South Africa. Using attribution methods, the study estimates that 24.3 kg per hectare of extra maize yields accrued to commercial maize producers because of the national maize trials. The economic value of these investments was found to be R1.4billion (in 2012 currency values). The study estimates that South Africa received R37 of benefit for every rand invested by the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) in the trials.",

    "abstract": "The article analyses the operation of poverty traps in South African agriculture through an analysis of the 2007 agricultural census. The poverty trap is a self-reinforcing mechanism in the market in which small variances in initial conditions can result in bimodality into differential economic steady-states resulting in multiple equilibria. Reasons for this include the savings trap, creating locally increasing rates return due to indivisible lumpy capital inputs; the technological trap in which the diminishing marginal rates of technological substitution diminishes productivity growth; the demographic trap in which population growth reduces the capital-labour ratio, increasing consumption and pure time costs; the stochastic returns trap in which producers without access to risk smoothing mechanisms assume greater risks; and the liquidity trap in which present and future capital values exceed current agricultural revenues. The study demonstrates that the failure of land reform and small-scale agriculture assistance programmes is thus a product of market failures, not policies. The analysis indicates that locally increased returns, symptomatic of the savings trap exists with initial average expenditures of smaller firms exceeding the average incomes. The technology trap is also evident with average incomes of small firms is also very low relative to the average capital asset values. The mean productivity of workers in terms of revenue per employee supports the argument for productivity declines in small firms due to the demographic trap. Initial declines in income per ton outputs of smaller firms validate the stochastic returns poverty trap.",

To this end, we fit a stochastic frontier production function with inefficiency effects. We find that dairy farmers who use hired labour are significantly less efficient than those who use own and family labour. This supports the labour market imperfections hypothesis. To test the technical efficiency hypothesis, we segment our sample into small, medium and large farmers based on the number of cows in milk. We find that small farmers are the most efficient (78.5%), followed by medium (75.9%) and large (75.1%) farmers, but the differences are not statistically significant.

The study findings show that majority of farmers (57%) are highly innovative, with process innovation being the most popular type of innovation.

The role of policy in explaining these relationships is discussed, while some conclusions are also drawn. The findings have specific implications for land reform. The inverse farm size-efficiency relationship, which is also present in South African agriculture despite a history of policies favouring relatively large mechanised farms, implies that significant efficiency gains can be made if farm sizes in the commercial sector becomes smaller. An important element in such a process would be the removal of all policies and distortions favouring larger farms relative to smaller farms.",

    "abstract": "The processes of both irrigation development and policy formulation are influenced by complex interactions and environmental changes. A holistic, systematic description and analysis indicates a gradual shift of emphasis from individual to Cooperative to public irrigation schemes. For all schemes, variable availability of water and quality of soil presented limitations. The adaptation of extensive or intensive farming practices, viable sizes of farming units, and unrealistic expectations reflected in high land prices, created problems. Following a learning process, it is clear that attention to marketing opportunities, managerial ability and access to capital must be stressed. These factors must definitely be incorporated in current reform initiatives for land settlement. In the case of small-scale irrigation farming, priority must be given to improved utilization of existing schemes, preceded by feasibility studies and accompanied by investment in human capital. Entrepreneurial initiative in the market process must therefore be supported and facilitated by government authorities.",

    "abstract": "A number of technology transfer (diffusion) programmes involving amongst others veterinary surgeon services subsidised by the government, were launched in the former homelands of South Africa between 1980 and 1993. Many of these programmes were discontinued after the general election of 1994. In order to evaluate the adoption of technology in Qwaqwa, a former Sotho speaking homeland, two Logit models were fit using the conventional definition of an adopter and an adapted definition, which included potential adopters with the adopters. Where the conventional definition of adoption was estimated, livestock income per LSU, ram technology, roads and suppliers of livestock inputs are significant variables contributing to adoption. The results of the adapted model reveal that farming efficiency (weaning percentage), type of farmer (sheep as percentage of the total small ruminant herd) and ram technology, prove to be significant variables predicting adoption. It was also found that the characteristics of potential adopters gravitate more to adopters than to non-adopters. These results indicated that the adapted definition presented a more accurate prediction than the conventional definition. The results of this study indicate the policy necessary to further accelerate the diffusion of veterinary surgeon services by means of the development of a better infrastructure, the reintroduction of subsidised veterinary surgeon services at the sheering sheds as well as a better flow of information to farmers in Qwaqwa.",

Agricultural R&D in South Africa is fundamentally different with a more adaptive character, resulting in a shorter lag of five years between research spending and changes in TFP. In this situation, the long-run profit function input demand and output supply elasticities are too high, resulting in overestimation of returns to R&D. A potential solution to this problem is to use a short-run profit function in the calculation of returns to R&D. Several other inputs are held fixed and the result is a short-run return to R&D in South Africa that compares favourably with lone-run return levels that have been established for the northern hemisphere.",

By working together farmers can, in principle: identify members' needs and consolidate demand; aggregate members' economic power, and address market failures. These capacities would seem to make farmers' organisations the ideal partners in the area of agricultural technology transformation, which can be described as technology development and transfer. This is proven by the strength of “Organised Agriculture in South Africas commercial farming”. This paper draws on research focused on emerging black farmers' organisations in South Africa and their involvement in agricultural technology. This research makes it clear that the key to effective change in the technology development supply system in South Africa, and thus to much needed productivity increases amongst black small farmers, is held by the technology system itself in the absence of significant support, small farmers' organisations (as currently constituted) can be expected to play a restricted role—if any at all—for they are not yet sufficiently united, powerful or technologically-aware to force the opening of doors on their own initiative. One of the major lessons which must be drawn h this is that broader support to farmers' organisations to build capacity and particularly to develop internal communication mechanisms is likely to have to precede support for particular technology initiatives.",

Cultivar strategies vary from one with a relatively high expected gross margin and associated high variation in gross margin to one with a relatively low expected gross margin and small variation therein. Cultivar strategies have a highly significant effect on accumulated net worth. The effect of cultivar strategy is not influenced by the various inflation conditions or asset/liability ratios. Optimal cultivar strategy limits losses in poor years, but simultaneously produces a big enough expected gross margin to compete with other strategies. Farmers with liquidity problems should adopt a conservative strategy. Only in years without liquidity problems should a cultivar strategy with a higher expected yield and at the same time a higher probability of a loss be followed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Following world wide trends, closer integration of agriculture into the macroeconomy has exposed farmers to the effects of changes in interest rates, exchange rates and prices that are associated with changes in monetary policy. In South Africa, farmers are faced with persistently high inflation, fluctuating interest rates and declining rand exchange rate. A general equilibrium simultaneous equation model was constructed to analyse the impacts of monetary policy on South African agriculture. Annual data (1960–1987) were used to estimate equations representing the field crop, horticultural, livestock and manufacturing sectors, and the money and foreign exchange markets. The interest, inflation, and exchange rates were determined endogenously and key macrolinkages whereby the impacts of monetary policy are transmitted to agriculture were simulated. Due to insufficient degrees of freedom, the model was estimated by two-stage principal components. The estimated model was used to simulate the dynamic impacts of an expansionary monetary policy on agriculture. In the short run, this causes the real interest rate to fall, exchange rate to depreciate, and general level of prices to rise. Depreciation of the exchange rate and higher domestic inflation raise input prices. Increased cost effects of higher input prices outweigh the reduced cost effects of lower real interest rates causing real field crop and horticultural supply to decrease. Increased stock effects of lower real interest rates and increased cost effects of higher input costs impact negatively on livestock supply. The resultant decrease in agricultural supply causes commodity prices to rise which lowers real demand for agricultural products. The net effect is a decline in real agricultural income for the sectors modeled.",

The results show that convexity of the profit function in all prices holds in milk production in South Africa. Milk production and livestock trading activities are complements in the multi-input, multi-output dairy farms studied. Both activities used purchased and self produced feed inputs intensively, with a higher intensity in purchased feed use. The two variable inputs are gross complements in the long-run and net substitutes in the short term. The long-term expansion effects overshadow short-term substitution between these inputs. The high intensity of purchased feed use has implications for the animal feed sector in terms of facing increased competition for already limited natural animal protein sources (fish meal, bone meal, etc).",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Simon Brand Memorial Lecture was delivered on 26 September 2007 at Johannesburg. For decades, earnings from farming in many low-income countries have been depressed by a pro-urban bias in own-country policies, as well as by governments of richer countries favoring their farmers with import barriers and subsidies. Both sets of policies reduce national and global economic growth. They also add to inequality and poverty in developing countries, since most of the world's billion poorest people depend on farming for their livelihood. Over the past two decades numerous developing country governments have reduced their sectoral and trade policy distortions, while some high-income countries also have begun reforming their protectionist policies. Drawing on results from a new multi-country research project, this paper examines the extent of South Africa's reforms relative to those of other temperate-zone Southern Hemisphere countries, of Northern Hemisphere rich countries, and of other developing countries. It concludes by pointing to the scope and prospects for further pro-poor policy reform at home and abroad.",

    "abstract": "Studies on perceptions of, and adaptation responses to, climate change have not paid sufficient attention to location and neighbourhood effects. Moreover, although one often regards perceptions as preconditions for adaptation, some direct and underlying factors may influence perceptions and adaptations in opposite ways. To assess determinants of perceived directions of climate change and adaptations by farmers, the paper formulates ordered response and multinomial choice models accounting for the location and neighbourhood effects. Relative to a survey of rural households in the Ethiopian Nile basin, perceptions of long-term climate trends are found to substantially vary across regions, altitudes, distances from markets, and neighbourhood characteristics, with climate reference scales being themselves non-uniform across respondents. The inclusion of proxies for local spatial dependence and clustering in multinomial logit regressions on adaptation decisions provides further insights, relative to individual- and farm-specific features. Adaptation measures turn out to be largely independent from degree of awareness of negative trends in climate changes. This highlights the importance of adaptive strategies coordinated at regional and national scale, such as preventive measures of control of pest damage risk due to increasing temperatures, and specific interventions for semi-arid agro-climatic zones.",

One area not vigorously pursued in understanding the farmers’ adoption process is the role that farmer classification of on-farm soils plays in adoption and impact of sustainable technologies such as the fertiliser trees. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate adoption rates and impact of fertiliser trees on heterogeneous soil types according to farmers’ classifications. Using data randomly collected from 324 households in the 2011 farming season in Chongwe district of Zambia, it was found that farmers were able to classify the dominant soils on their farms into sandy, clay, sand loamy and loamy soils. Most of the farmers (60%) who perceived their soils to be sandy also indicated facing soil fertility challenges. Perception of being on sandy soils was significantly associated with adoption of the fertiliser trees. Propensity score estimates showed that the technology significantly increased maize productivity on soils perceived to be sandy and sand loamy. The non-significant impact results of the technology on relatively perceived high fertile loamy and clay soils could be indicative of diminishing marginal effect of the technology on already fertile soils. Although adoption of the technology on relatively fertile soils is important for fertility sustainability, its promotion on farms with degraded soils could ensure full expression of its potential, and hence, increase its adoptability chances. Targeting of farmers who receive fertiliser tree seedlings should embrace this condition.",

Previous research has shown that many factors influence feedlot performance and profitability. It is, however, very difficult to judge an animal’s inherit feedlot performance before it enters the feedlot. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the animal traits of Santa Gertrudis bulls and the feedlot profitability of these bulls. Analysed traits included the sheath score, capacity score and build score as high scores for these traits are believed to be associated with better feedlot performance. The data for this study was collected from 48 Santa Gertrudis bull calves. The profitability of feeding cattle was expressed as the Total Margin (TM) and Feed Margin (FM). Given the nature of the dependant variables, Ordinary Least Squared regressions were used for the analyses with TM and FM as dependent variables. Results show that although both models were significant, the sheath score was the only individual trait that proved to be significantly correlated with both TM and FM. Sheath score proved to be negatively correlated with TM and FM while it was expected, through popular belief, to be positively correlated. This implies that animals with lower sheath scores, thus with sheaths closer to their bodies, perform better in the feedlot and may affect the TM and FM positively. The magnitude of this trait still remains under question and further research is required.",

    "abstract": "It is well accepted that biological innovations, particularly varietal improvements, have greatly contributed to agricultural yield and output growth in the past. At the same time, public funding for breeding programmes such as at the Agricultural Research Council in South Africa has dwindled. In an effort to confirm the importance of continued funding of varietal improvement programmes, this paper estimates the benefits from wheat varietal innovations and attributes them to the different institutional sources (public, private and others) that have contributed to varietal changes in South Africa. The empirical analyses used data on market shares of wheat varieties planted by farmers and annual quantities of wheat produced across different wheat-production areas in South Africa (summer dryland, dryland winter, and irrigation). A vintage regression model was estimated to calculate the proportional yield gain from wheat varietal improvements. The results indicated that the rate of gain in yield as a result of releases of new wheat varieties (variety research) was 0.8 per cent per year (equivalent to 19.84 kg/ha/year) for dryland summer varieties, and 0.5 per cent for both irrigation (equivalent to 32.20 kg/ha/year) and dryland winter varieties (equivalent to 16.65 kg/ha/year). The attribution of benefits among different institutional sources confirms that not accounting for attribution of benefits by source and time period results is overestimation of benefits to any specific research programme. Attribution of benefits by institutional source showed that Sensako dominated, while the share of the ARC-SGI substantially declined, after deregulation of the wheat sub-sector. The results highlight the impact of the decline in public funding for wheat variety improvement research after deregulation and provide a strong argument for continued public funding for variety improvement in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "The national beef cattle improvement scheme was introduced by the South African government with the objective of improving the biological and ecological efficiency of beef production through genetic improvement and enhanced cattle management practices. This has been achieved through various structural and technological changes targeted at increasing beef production and promoting sustainable production systems. Despite the technical success of the programme, and the substantial investment made into it, there is limited information on the returns to investment made in the beef improvement scheme in South Africa. Using time series data from 1970–2014, the study uses an econometric approach modelled through the Almon Polynomial Distribution to estimate the lead period and rate of return from investment in beef cattle improvement research. The lag effect and absence of a lead-time suggest that research impacts beef production in the current year of investment. A marginal rate of return of 32 per cent implies that South Africa received R32 for every rand invested towards the scheme. This suggests that the research investment is worthwhile and motivates for continuation of the beef cattle improvement research given significant and positive economic efficiency measures.",

Results showed that 30.6% of the participants preferred to purchase their beef from a certain brand. Correlation results showed that higher educated, younger and consumers from higher income groups were more likely to pay attention to a less familiar beef brand. Consumers in higher income groups, however, took longer before paying attention to the brand label for the first time. No significant correlation was found for a more familiar beef brand. When new beef brands plan to enter a market, they should identify a market that has a large number of young, highly educated consumers who earn higher incomes, since they are more likely to pay attention to an unfamiliar beef brand.",

On the contrary, distance to input and output markets have a negative and significant effect on the adoption of alternative teff production technologies. The MESR model results reveal that, while full technology adoption is the most productive and profitable option, adopting any of the alternative technologies also substantially improves the productivity and profitability of smallholder teff producers.

    "abstract": "The recent global recession, caused by the financial crisis of 2008–2009, resulted in a significant drop in global merchandise trade. However, international trade in agricultural and food products seemed more resilient. This poses the question as to what extent recent and previous economic recessions have had an effect on the trade flows of these specific products. An understanding of this connection will assist the agricultural sector to pro-actively strategize for future economic downturns in their respective export markets. Hence this study uses South Africa's exports of fresh fruits and wine as a case study and applies an import demand model to analyse the relationship between export flows, several demand factors and economic shocks in its traditional export markets over the last 28 years. The results reveal that change in real per capita income is a much more significant determinant of import demand for South Africa's fruit and wine than the incidence of an economic recession. Contrary to general perceptions, economic downturns even positively affected the import demand for wine and apples.",

Results show that, at whole farm level, the average financial gains in margin above variable costs from improving technical and cost efficiency amount to R21 335 and R21 581, respectively. Importantly, the gains represent potential increases of 246% and 249%, respectively, in margins above variable costs. Improving the levels of efficiency with which the farmers use their inputs thus may contribute substantially to increase the contribution of raisin production to the livelihoods of raisin farmers from Eksteenskuil. The close comparison of the potential gains suggests that the current emphasis of extension services on maximising output levels should be extended to also promote the use of inputs in cost minimising combinations. Farmer-to-farmer skills transfer has a major role to play in supporting the farmers to use their inputs in a technically efficient manner. Extension officers and other support services should pay more attention to developing the skills of the farmers to be able to select the least cost combination of inputs.",

Considering the changes, the impacts on the farm labour market and wage and non-wage working conditions are analysed. The legislation focused on includes the Extension of Security of Tenure Act 62 (ESTA) of 1997, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 (BCEA) of 1997 and minimum wage legislation. Farmers believed legislation had both positive and negative effects, which were compounded by changes in the political and economic contexts. The case study reveals that government has a role in improving the status of farm labourers, with education and healthcare services requiring special attention.

However, experts have reasoned that the quantity of resources is as important as the quality of spending. If resources are allocated efficiently, more could be achieved with the same resources. Ensuring an effective strategy and basis for prioritising crop research investments so as to improve productivity is a major challenge in Zambia and other African countries. This study investigates the economic returns of investment in crop research and sets priorities for research investment using the Dynamic Research Evaluation for Management (DREAM) model. The findings show that maize, soya beans, groundnuts, cotton, millet, sunflower and sorghum are the crops that should receive priority in terms of funding for research under the efficiency objective. However, the study showed that the allocation of financial resources towards crop research in Zambia is not aligned with the social and economic returns of that investment. Nonetheless, positive returns from crop research investments were obtained, which suggests that investing in crop research is worthwhile but that attention needs to be paid to the appropriate research priorities. This is critical for improved competitiveness in Zambian agriculture. The study recommends further investment in and robust prioritisation of crop research, complemented by improved infrastructure, institutions and markets for a thriving agricultural sector.",

Respondents represented the broad spectrum of the food industry and data were collected in three rounds.

In round one, experts designed promising pricing strategies. The pricing strategies were divided into four broad categories and these were: A. Taxes; B. Government interference and insurance; C. Packaging; and D. Price and discounting strategies. The strategies were subsequently evaluated on eight criteria using a time-budget model incorporating Sleep, Leisure, Occupation, Transportation and Home-based activities (SLOTH). Results were analysed using median and inter-quartile deviations scores. The results revealed reasonable consensus among experts and a varied list of promising pricing strategies. The panel agreed on the potential success of offering small gifts, providing price cuts on healthy foods and discounting healthier foods more frequently. Also, it was found that experts gave higher rates to pricing strategies for which the implementation responsibilities could be placed elsewhere.",

The technical inefficiency effects for the farmers involved are significant and the null hypothesis that the explanatory variables in the model for the inefficiency effects have zero coefficients is rejected. The technical inefficiency effects are negatively and significantly related to the size of the farms. Elasticities of mean outputs with respect to the different inputs, together with the technical efficiencies of the wheat farmers, are estimated for both the translog and the Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier production functions. However, the Cobb-Douglas function is not an adequate representation of the data, given the specifications of the translog stochastic frontier production function.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A number of technology transfer (diffusion) programmes involving amongst others veterinary surgeon services subsidised by the government, were launched in the former homelands of South Africa between 1980 and 1993. Many of these programmes were discontinued after the general election of 1994. In order to evaluate the adoption of technology in Qwaqwa, a former Sotho speaking homeland, two Logit models were fit using the conventional definition of an adopter and an adapted definition, which included potential adopters with the adopters. Where the conventional definition of adoption was estimated, livestock income per LSU, ram technology, roads and suppliers of livestock inputs are significant variables contributing to adoption. The results of the adapted model reveal that farming efficiency (weaning percentage), type of farmer (sheep as percentage of the total small ruminant herd) and ram technology, prove to be significant variables predicting adoption. It was also found that the characteristics of potential adopters gravitate more to adopters than to non-adopters. These results indicated that the adapted definition presented a more accurate prediction than the conventional definition. The results of this study indicate the policy necessary to further accelerate the diffusion of veterinary surgeon services by means of the development of a better infrastructure, the reintroduction of subsidised veterinary surgeon services at the sheering sheds as well as a better flow of information to farmers in Qwaqwa. 'n Hele aantal tegnologie-oordragingsprogramme, wat onder andere veterinêre dienste wat deur die regering gesubsideer is, insluit, is tussen 1980 en 1993 in die voormalige tuislande geloods. Verskeie van hierdie programme het ná die algemene verkiesing van 1994 doodgeloop. Ten einde die aanvaarding van tegnologie in Qwaqwa, 'n voormalige Sotho-sprekende tuisland, te evalueer, is twee logistiese modelle gepas waar daar gebruik gemaak is van die tradisionele definisie van 'n aanvaarder en 'n aangepaste definisie wat die potensiële aanvaarder by die aanvaarder-groep insluit. Die betekenisvolle veranderlikes waar die tradisionele definisie van aanvaarding geskat is, is lewendehawe-inkomste per GVE, ramtegnologie, paaie en verskaffers van lewendehawe, wat bydra tot aanvaarding. Die resultate van die aangepaste definisie dui daarop dat boerdery-effektiwiteit (speenpersentasie), tipe boer en ramtegnologie betekenisvolle veranderlikes is wat bydra tot die voorspelling van die aanvaardingsproses. Dit het verder aan die lig gekom dat die karaktertrekke van die potensiële aanvaarder meer neig na die aanvaarders as die nie-aanvaarders. Die resultate dui verder daarop dat die aangepaste definisie 'n meer akkurate voorspelling as die tradisionele definisie vir aanvaarding van die gebruik van veterinêre tegnologie gee. Die resultate van die studie dui op beleidsaspekte wat nodig is om die oordraging van veterinêre dienste te versnel deur middel van die ontwikkeling van 'n beter infrastruktuur, die herinstelling van gesubsidieerde veterinêre dienste by die skeerskure en die verbetering van die vloei van inligting na boere in Qwaqwa.",

Data drawn from Deeds of Transfer were stratified and analysed by race, gender and mode of land acquisition. The results indicate that 18885 hectares of commer cial farmland transferred to disadvantaged owners in KwaZulu-Natal during 1998. This implies an overall rate of redistribution of 0,35 per cent, down from the 1997 estimate of 0,43 per cent. As in 1997, there were marked differences in both the quantity and quality of farmland transferred by different modes of redistribution. In 1997, private purchases accounted for 46 per cent of the total men redistributed, and for 73 per cent of the total market value of farms purchased by disadvantaged entrants. In 1998, these proportions increased to 74 and 91 per cent respectively—due mainly to n substantial cut in the number of transactions financed with government grants. Once again, farmland purchased with government grants wm of much lower quality than that financed privately. In contrast to 1997, disadvantaged women were poorly represented in land transactions resulting from bequests and cash purchases, and remained poorly represented in transactions financed with mortgage loans. In aggregate, they gained less than half of the area gained by disadvantaged men, and—after excluding inheritance transactions—gained less than half of the land value (wealth) gained by their male pees.",

This paper provides a framework for integrating environmental values into macroeconomic policy-making in South Africa. This is done by focusing on 1) the different theories on the linkage between the economy and the environment, 2) conceptualising the input of environmental values in the macroeconomic policy arena and 3) making recommendations for incorporating environmental factors into South African macroeconomic policy.",

    "abstract": "Important water issues in South Africa relate to equity, efficiency of use, quality (return flow pollution) and instream uses such as the environment. Farmers in South Africa pay water rates whether or not water is used and water is not volumetric priced. Water markets can attach an opportunity cost price and scarcity value to water. Opportunity cost pricing by the state has received no support in the international economic literature largely because of estimation problems. Water markets have started to emerge in the Lower Orange River and in the Fish and Sunday's rivers in the Eastern Cape in South Africa but there are two reasons why agricultural water markets do not release water in South Africa. The first reason is that the only water trades that have taken place in these rivers are between non-users of water and intensive users. It may take time before all sleeper rights (water not used) are activated which is also the case in Australia. Secondly, irrigation farmers in South Africa along the Orange and Sunday's rivers are permitted to irrigate a larger area if they adopt water saving technology such as drip irrigation. Although this water saving technologies will reduce water application per ha, the consumptive use of water per ha may not decrease and will increase if a larger area can be irrigated. Agricultural water markets are thus increasing the use of water and not promoting its conservation. It is thus recommended that transfers should be based on consumptive use if return flow is significant.",

High yielding varieties and new production technology have vastly increased the world's agricultural production and provided rural incomes and affordable food for large parts of the population. While production research has received considerable attention, until recently, post harvest activities have not received much attention. Post harvest research has significant contribution towards the alleviation of poverty, food insecurity and the sustainable use of resources. The objective of the paper is to assess the post-harvest constraints affecting main staple grain crops in three regions of the Limpopo Province. Some of the most common post harvest constraints revealed by the study are, weevils, rodents and transport for produce from the field to home Chemical, biological and indigenous control measures are used by the smallholder farmers to alleviate some of the post harvest constraints. The results of the study seem to indicate that more research work should be done especially on the use of indigenous knowledge towards the alleviation of post harvest constraints.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of the comparable sales method to value farm properties requires that professional valuers must think like a typical buyer of farm properties in a particular area. The Stellenbosch district, located on the periphery of the Cape Metropole, is a famous wine-producing area. The typical buyer is sophisticated and wealthy: someone for whom lifestyle could probably be just as important as the income generating capacity of the wine estate. A variety of site and situational factors have to be considered by the valuer: some of which are easily identifiable and quantifiable, where others are more elusive. This study aimed to identify and order the more important motivations as perceived by typical buyers in order to provide guidelines to valuers. An empirical study was done to determine buyers' and property characteristics, and buyers' ratings of possible motivations for buying land in Stellenbosch. Factor analysis provided a hierarchy of motivations. Terroir is the dominant site factor and the most important motivation, followed by location relative to Cape Town, the aesthetic beauty of the property, accessibility of the property, potential for new/more vineyards, meso-climate and the status of the “address”.",

The new technology was the introduction of maize silage into the feeding programme of a dairy farm in the midlands of KwaZuluNatal. A model was developed using historical milk data from a nine-year period. The model was used to forecast subsequent milk production on the dairy farm had maize silage not been introduced, and these forecasts were compared with actual production after the introduction of maize silage. Milk production was more than 320,000 litres greater than forecast in ten seasons over a four-year period after the introduction of silage. During the same period, production was more than 14,000 litres less than forecast in one season, with the remaining six seasons estimated to be within 5% of observed values. This resulted in an estimated net gain of 305,668 litres of milk above the amount expected had silage not been introduced, representing an average increase in production of 18% per annum.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Given demands on public funding, the question arises whether agricultural research should be the responsibility of the public or private sectors, or whether the state should play a facilitating role. These issues are studied using the management and success of R&D in the South African Sugar Industry as an example. The usual answer is that research should be publicly funded if it is a public good and privately funded if a private good. It is shown that even if aspects of research have clear public good characteristics, then it is still possible to internalise externalities. Sugar cane farmers pay a levy of about 1.0% of the value of the crop to finance their R&D package, which includes research, training and extension. The sugar growers decide on the amount of the levy themselves. A possible reason why sugar farmers agree to this levy is that a bottom-up multidisciplinary research programme is followed in which they have a direct say. Scientists from different disciplines work together on a single crop. The South African government should consider the Dutch example where the role of government has shifted from administrator of institutions to stimulator (sponsor) of research. Government should thus still play a critical role in R&D funding in South Africa and there is concern that State funding has declined. Private incentives for research may be weaker in the case of generic research with broad applications across commodities. However, in the latter case it will be expected that different commodity organisations will embark on joint projects as has happened in the past.",

The aim was to explore, understand, and describe the perceptions of farmers of having a trained lay health worker (LHW) on the farm. A qualitative study design was applied. Data were collected during six in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions with participating farmers. The results show that farmers remained positive about the concept of having a trained LHW on the farm, but became frustrated with the lack of recognition of their and the LHWs' contribution by the public health service. Farmers who are willing to participate and remain active are key to introducing a farm community-based LHW intervention. Sustainable LHW interventions are dependent on public health sector support and recognition of all role players.",

In this regard, this paper uses a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) microsimulation approach to revisit the effects of taxing water pollution on poverty and inequality at the level of a river basin. We combined the commodity and factor price changes from a regional environmental CGE model, after introducing the water pollution tax, with household survey data from the 2012 National Income Dynamics Survey (NIDS) to explain the welfare impacts. The result shows that the tax policy will in general have adverse impacts in terms of welfare, poverty, and inequality. However, the tax policy coupled with a supply-side compensatory measure such as subsidising water pollution abatement has the potential to reduce regional poverty and inequality as well as improve the ecological status of the river. Our finding has policy implications for national and regional water resource managers.",

The correlated random effects estimator is also used to explore two dimensions of minimum tillage ripping adoption: changes in adoption within a household over time (within-household effect) and differences in adoption between households at a given time (between-household effect). Results reveal that age and gender of the household head, the head's level of education, household labour, hectares cultivated, ripper ownership, loan access, receiving conservation farming advice and distance to agricultural service providers are some of the key determinants associated with the three stages investigated using the triple hurdle model. The correlated random effects results demonstrate that while certain factors enhance or inhibit the expected value of hectares ripped within a given household, it is not always the case that these factors have a similar effect when the analysis is between households. This article highlights policy options to enhance ownership of rippers, support smallholder farmer access to loans, facilitate development of agro-dealer networks, and innovative approaches for disseminating conservation farming information to farmers.",

We specifically consider the role of liquidity–related variables within a context of the perennial export crops, a contribution that has received less attention in literature. Our analysis reveals that variables related to demand for liquidity at the household level are strongly correlated with the selling of tea at the farmgate by smallholder tea farmers in the study area. The results also show that the household context (farmer's age, education and residence), farm characteristics (volume of output and age of tea plantation) and institutional variables (group membership and extension) are key determinants of household selling decisions. In addition, we find evidence that farmgate selling has a positive influence on crop productivity. We recommend strengthening of mechanisms that enable farmers to engage better with the existing market channels and encourage greater competition, in place of policies seeking to curtail the operations of farmgate traders.",

Three approaches were used for the evaluation: the stochastic cost frontier to determine inefficiencies and the causative institutional and socio-economic factors; cost-factor demand systems; and the supply response analyses to determine the elasticity estimates of policy variables. The results from these approaches are supplementary and seem to support the need for government interventions in institutional and socio-economic factors that have a high public good component in order to expand dairy establishment in the marginal zones.",

Liberalisation of trade was simulated assuming a reduction in import tariffs, the tax rate on factor use and export subsidies in four steps of 25% points each. Such simulations were run in the GLOBE model then adjusted and used as a policy shock to the PROVIDE model. The results show that the weighed average world price (adjusted) changes will range between −19.6 to +3.8% for imports and between −3.0 and +29.7% for exports at 75% liberalisation. The results from the single country CGE model show that the South African economy would respond positively to the world price changes, with government and macro variables showing minimal but positive responses. Household consumption expenditures generally show positive changes, implying increased factor incomes. Not all sectors will be positively affected even though the overall effect is positive.",

The results show that the beef cattle prices are integrated and exhibit a long run relationship. Formal (for grade A) and informal (grade C) beef cattle prices suggest that they adjust to long-run equilibrium at different speeds. For instance, prices in the formal markets adjust to disequilibrium at about 81 per cent, while prices in informal markets adjust to disequilibrium at 63 per cent. Granger causality results indicates the log price of grade C beef cattle in the informal market does not cause Granger log price of grade A beef cattle in the formal market, log of wholesale beef price of grade A beef and log of export beef price of grade A unidirectional at the 1 per cent level of significance. The adjustment can be attributed to the objectives and the nature beef markets understudy, coupled to the lack of efficient price information linkages between formal and informal beef cattle markets.",

These were measured using composite indices extracted using principal component analysis, and these indices were regressed against the consumers' purchase probability of meat alternatives. The study's results showed that meat alternatives were perceived as a pricey symbol of class and status. This was found to have a two-sided effect on consumer behaviour. On one hand, the products' position encouraged purchase among the survey respondents and encouraged them to recommend the products to their peers and on the other, it discouraged consumption with their families. As this finding shows that meat analogues remain niche products in the study area, the study offers recommendations on ways to improve product performance in the niche market. It also suggests changes in the products' marketing that could assist in launching them into the mainstream food market of South Africa.",

Using the preliminary results from the DBSA's evaluation reports of the FSP's in Venda, Lebowa, KaNgwane and Kwazulu, this paper shows the possible effects the FSP strategy have of farmers farming on small farm size of between 1 and four hectares. This is done by comparing farmers using the FSP services and those who do not. The paper concludes that the FSP strategy has positive effects on farmers operating on small areas of 1 hectare or less, but these effects can be increased by ensuring farmers' access to more secure arable land. In addition, improved marketing structures, favourable price policies and institutional change are important requisites. It is also argued that the FSP is not a deliberate strategy to perpetuate black farmers as the FSP contributed significantly to the economic well-being of the small farmers. However, certain policies will have to be reviewed to increase access to improve all other services. Finally it would appear that presently and even in the post-apartheid South Africa the sustainability of the FSPs will depend on land reform and institutional change, price policies and improved marketing systems.",

Lesotho is a net importer of maize grain, the major staple, implying that maize pricing and marketing policy affect food security. Results indicate flexible informal marketing channels, fixed formal marketing channels and declining real producer, mill-gate and consumer prices in recent years Falling real South African Maize Board export grain prices and evidence of subsidies to commercial Lesotho mills explain these price trends. Changes to the one channel formal marketing system and nationally administered price structure that would encourage an open market system with less restrictive interregional maize trade are recommended.",

Urban consumers tend to consume more bread, and less maize meal than rural consumers. Urban consumers consume more meat than poverty-stricken rural dwellers. The same is true with respect to fruit and ready-made foods. Both quality and price are important considerations for consumers' food purchases, particularly rural consumers. Price appears to be less important to the higher income (> R2000 per month) consumers in purchases of bread and meat, but rather important in vegetable purchases. Almost 60 per cent never consume food at away from home food establishments.

In a mixed cropping system, maize, beans and other vegetables are grown between the mango trees. The production of these crops is mostly for household consumption, while mangoes are grown for selling purposes. This article analyses the economic situation of the farms, by conducting a financial analysis of the cash flow of the mango production, and comparing the farm indicators of two groups of farmers. The objective is to develop strategy proposals for strengthening the mango farm business. The financial analysis shows that the average selling price farmers receive for achar mangoes is not high enough to make investments in a mango orchard profitable. From the farm analysis it can be derived that farmers should increase specialisation in mangoes by planting more trees per hectare, and introduce pruning and a more adapted input use. Other possible strategies are the increase of management knowledge, improvement of the knowledge on farm production techniques, improvement of the farm environment and a better adaptation to the macroeconomic environment.",

Given the inelastic nature of maize supply and demand, these farmers now face considerable price risk. In the absence of the Maize Board, price risk management mechanisms have evolved to serve maize farmers. Results of a postal survey of commercial maize producers in 1998 indicate that maize farmers are making increased use of the forward contracting market relative to the spot market. The percentage of respondents using SAFEX increased markedly over a three-year period, the hedging ratio rising from 27 percent in 1997/98 to reach 49 percent for 1998/99 and 1999/2000. Survey respondents were divided into lower- and higher- level users of price risk management tools, based on their scores for an index of price risk management. Higher-level users tended to operate larger farms, and be younger, less experienced, but more educated, computer-adopting operators who were less likely to individually own their operations. Farmers perceived their marketing management skills to be relatively weak. Maize marketing education seminars and magazine articles explaining available marketing alternatives could increase farmers' use of price risk management tools. Further research opportunities lie in the estimation of optimal hedging ratios in a South African context and the monitoring of farmers' marketing activities as the maize market matures.",

Where possible explanations of certain parameters are put forward with the aim of identifying the economic problem with regard to farm labour. Two structural trends in South African commercial maize production are evident in the summer rainfall areas. The period 1915–1970 witnessed a large expansion in cultivated farm area, probably because tractors replaced draught oxen. Larger areas could he managed and more labour was required. Demands on labour for harvesting were heavy until the introduction of the combine harvester alleviated this problem. These trends were strengthened by policies aimed at lowering the costs of capital, giving rise to some of the socio-economic concerns expressed in this paper. In the winter rainfall region where wheat is cultivated the expansion in cultivated area took place before 1945. The period under consideration (1945–1987) therefore only saw the substitution of labour for machinery, especially in the period 1945–1970. It thus seems as if labour related developments in the summer rainfall area trailed that in the winter rainfall area.",

Following on some of the pioneer work on this subject, this paper applies the concept of ‘growth linkages’ in the analysis of smallholder agriculture production in Eastern Cape. It shows that an injection of smallholder income into the rural economy will result in significant rural income growth beyond the initial injection. Exploitation of this potential would require a deliberate policy focus to aid agricultural transformation in the smallholder farming areas. Such support should be directed towards activities in which smallholder farmers have a comparative advantage, such as in citrus and livestock in Eastern Cape. Such a policy will then favor autonomous development of rural non-tradables, such as rural services, local construction materials, and perishable prepared foods.",

    "abstract": "During the past fifty years, the controlled marketing system in South Africa created inflexible marketing structures. These structures inhibited growth in the demand for agricultural products, increased the farmers' exposure to risks, limited private enterprise and effectively reduced competition in agricultural marketing. Contrary to the objective of the Marketing Act to reduce marketing risk for the farmer, it actually rendered the trade effective protection. Proponents of controlled agricultural marketing wrongly believed and are still believing that to limit effective competition in agricultural markets by restricting the number of traders and controlling the whole distribution channel, farmers as well as the consumers would gain from such systems. A study of concentration in the marketing structure of red meat showed that the red meat industry is virtually controlled by only three organizations. Excessive horizontal as well as vertical concentration exist and were effectively created, promoted and maintained by the red meat scheme. Oligopolistic and oligopsonistic structures were found throughout the red meat marketing system and market shares of 40 per cent plus, for the largest organizations are not uncommon. Market sharing in the form of joint ventures, supply control and restrictive registration limited competition while exemptions to Class 2 and Class 3 abattoirs strengthened the oligopolistic-oligopsonistic market structures. The lack of competition may affect deregulation of the red meat industry and normalising private enterprise due to the barriers of entry created by the concentrated structure of the marketing system.",

These components were used to create static forecasts in order to predict a general change in the movement of prices. Although this research was primarily aimed at the identification and isolation of cycles. explanatory elements in the form of rainfall and supply indicators were added. This research indicated that beef price cycles are relative stable and are partly self generating processes, depending on price expectations, supply cycles and rainfall cycles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent decades, significant international assistance has been provided to assist the establishment of market information systems (MISs) in a range of developing countries, including many in Africa. However, experience with state-run MISs, looking to provide current price information to market participants, has not been encouraging. Volatile horticultural markets provide particular challenges for such MISs. Therefore, it is suggested that it might be more appropriate to provide other types of marketing information to inform the production and marketing decisions of smallholder producers. This paper reports on recent efforts by the national extension agency, Agritex, to provide such information to smallholder horticultural producers in two districts of north-eastern Zimbabwe. Drawing on an initial evaluation of this pilot programme, the paper suggests that: 1) in the Zimbabwe case, the extension service may provide a viable vehicle for dissemination of marketing information to smallholder (horticultural) producers; 2) information on new crops and market opportunities is valued more highly by farmers than information on current market prices; 3) such information should complement, not supplant, traditional production extension advice. The paper concludes by considering some of the issues pertaining to the continuation and expansion of the pilot programme.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Most economists agree with the proposition that a minimum wage set above the market clearing equilibrium wage will cause unemployment. What happens when a minimum wage is set below the equilibrium wage is, however less clear. This is partly because the literature shows that the effect of a minimum wage will depend on the reason for its implementation. The literature also shows that the effect of a minimum wage depends on a range of macro level considerations. In this paper the international literature on the effects of a minimum wages is reviewed, and lessons are drawn for the implementation of a minimum wage in South African agriculture.",

However, this article argues that these results do not show the real state of competitiveness that exists in these sub-sectors, mainly because RCA measures should not be used to make definitive conclusions whether an industry, sector or sub-sector is competitive, nor whether it uses scare resources efficiently. RCA measures explain in more accurate ways, relative to a simple analysis of export trends, how a country features in the context of world trade. Hence, one possible application of RCA measures is to deduce the impact of changes in trade policies on an industry, sector or sub-sector. Cognisance should also be taken that the RCA measures fail to distinguish between a region's factor endowments. Finally, it appears as if both the beef and maize sub-sectors have adjusted favourably since the implementation of the Marrakech agreement and subsequent deregulation of the domestic market. Favourably in this context means that both sub-sectors appear to have discounted the changing trade and regulatory environments into their respective supply chains. The question of how competitive these sub-sectors are relative to their international counterparts however remains unanswered, and will require a more in-depth analysis of the complete chains for these sub-sectors.",

Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) compiles and disseminates different CPI aggregates, including the Consumer Price Index; the Core Index; CPIX; and the Food Price Index or CPIF. StatsSA has gone to considerable trouble in complying with international best practice in the calculation of the CPI. Nevertheless, three problems still remain, namely that StatsSA works with an unsatisfactory definition of rural areas, that no provision is planned for sales through informal sector outlets, and that no provision is made for food consumed away from home.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Investments in productive assets by broad-based black economic empowerment (BEE) enterprises in South Africa (SA) during the 1990s have been constrained, in part, by a lack of access to capital. Even if capital can be sourced, BEE businesses often face a liquidity problem, as conventional, equally amortized loan repayment plans do not take into account the size and timing of investment returns, or there are lags in the adjustment of management to such new investments. This paper describes five alternative loan products to the conventional equally amortized loan: the single payment non-amortized loan; the decreasing payment loan; the partial payment loan; the graduated payment loan; and the deferred payment loan. Recent SA experience with the graduated payment loan and the deferred payment loan suggests that there is scope to alleviate the liquidity problem if a wholesaler of funds can offer such terms to private banks and venture capital investors who then on-lend to finance BEE asset investments that are otherwise considered relatively high credit risks. This would shift the liquidity problem away from the client to the wholesaler of the funds, but requires access to capital at favourable interest rates. Such capital could be sourced from empowerment funds earmarked by the private sector, donors and government.",

The sum of coefficients test and the speed of adjustment test are used to determine whether or not prices move up in the same fashion as they move down, over daily and weekly data frequencies. Out of the four commodity futures markets studied over varying data frequencies, only daily wheat is price asymmetric. Wheat daily prices respond faster to price decreases than to price increases. The implication of the results is that past prices do affect current prices and contain information. Hence, the weak-form efficient market hypothesis appears to be contradicted for wheat futures market. Another important implication of the results is that implementing policies accounting for asymmetric behavior through price limit and margin policies will improve the functioning and stability of wheat futures market in South Africa.",

The study starts with a general overview of the total and agricultural export performance of these selected countries in a global context and their specialization indexes for food. This is followed by a comparison of the total value, total mass and value per tonne of agricultural exports to the EU and of their exploitation of seasonal differences with the northern hemisphere in terms of relative emphasis on particular product groups and value/mass ratios of their major products. Comparison is made of the impact of their location relative to EU ports in terms of transport cost and duration of trips and the efficiency of their own ports. The conclusions reached is that in order to remain competitive, South Africa will have to add value to carefully selected non-seasonal products. Seasonal production will have to expand with a sharper focus on market windows becoming narrower due to research and development conducted by both northern and southern hemisphere competitors. The overview motivates an even more aggressive research and development (R&D) programme by South African agriculture and food industries in order to remain competitive on export markets, especially given the rapidly changing environment. For example, the introduction of much faster ships which will decrease South Africa's present advantage of having the shortest distance to the EU among the other southern hemisphere competitors.",

In the Foothills only apples and peaches were investigated, and both show a comparative advantage of equal strength. In the Senqu River Valley the result for apples and peaches are mixed, i.e. apples show a comparative advantage, whilst peaches show a comparative disadvantage.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates possible causes of poverty afflicting a community of land reform beneficiaries in the Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal. The 38 beneficiary households had previously been clustered into four groups displaying different symptoms of poverty. Linear Discriminant Analysis was used first to distinguish households that were relatively income and asset “rich” from those that were relatively income and asset “poor\", and second to distinguish households that were relatively income poor but “asset rich” from those relatively asset poor but “income rich”. In the first analysis it was found that “rich” households could be distinguished from “poor” households using just two indicator variables; gender of the household head and family size. Larger, female-headed households have lower income and wealth per adult equivalent. In the second analysis, it was found that the “asset rich” had more human capital whereas the “income rich” owned vehicles and had fewer dependants per worker. Policy recommendations therefore point to education and vocational training -especially for women, better access to transport, jobs and banking facilities (to mobilise savings) in the long run, and improved and better targeting of social welfare grants for the chronically poor in the short run. These interventions are also expected to increase the demand for family planning and contraception, which in turn helps to reduce family sizes and the premature loss of breadwinners.",

    "abstract": "Wheat is South Africa’s second most important grain crop and is produced in winter rainfall, summer rainfall, and irrigation regions. Despite being a net importer of wheat, the country has stringent wheat quality requirements as per the Agricultural Products Act (Act No. 119 of 1990). This paper investigates the effects of the quality requirements in different regions and the wheat industry as whole. Forward regression and benefit–cost analysis were applied to data on wheat area planted, seed adoption rates, prices, and cultivar performance from 1999 to 2016. A total of 31 527 observations from winter, summer and irrigation regions were used, each accounting for 4563, 8824 and 18 140 cases respectively. Forty-nine cultivars were used for trials during this period. Results show that stringent quality requirements have resulted in losses of approximately 39 000 tons from 1999 to 2016. The benefits of pursuing the prevailing quality standards amounted to R400 million while the costs amounted to R514 million, far exceeding the benefits. The resulting benefit–cost ratio was 0.78, implying that for every rand invested in breeding for quality alone, 22 cents is lost. It can be concluded that government intervention through quality standards has led to more losses than gains. In addition, investments made towards quality improvement alone have not been recovered due to the high standards. There are therefore cogent reasons to consider relaxing the quality standards to allow for higher wheat outputs, thus unlocking growth in local wheat production.",

    "abstract": "Cultivar choice is an important production decision by which producers aim to achieve highest returns with the lowest risk, for yield optimisation. Cultivar testing through evaluation trials provides information on selected cultivar characteristics and performance under different conditions, which farmers use to minimise risk elements associated with limited cultivar performance information. In South Africa, the Agricultural Research Council conducts national wheat cultivar trials funded from public resources. However, the economic value of the programme remains unknown. The study estimates aggregate economic benefits associated with the programme using data from 1998 to 2016 and attribution methodologies used in other studies, modified within the context of this study. Yield gain estimates are used as indicators to estimate the contribution of seed choice to yield growth at selected levels of the assumed plausible yield gains. Overall, the study estimates that 0.04 ton (40 kg) per hectare of extra wheat yields accrued to wheat producers as a result of cultivar trials in the period under consideration. The net present value was found to be R173 million (in 2016 prices), while South Africa received R4.33 for every Rand invested into the programme. An estimated MIRR of 7 per cent suggests that investments into the programme have been a worthwhile use of public funds. The observed yield gains and favourable efficiency measures motivate continuation of the programme.",

Four competing models, namely the Engle–Granger, threshold autoregressive (TAR), momentum threshold autoregressive (M-TAR) and momentum consistent TAR models, were applied.

Past studies have focused on the impact of ISPs on crop production, food security and poverty. Little attention has been devoted to assessing their impact on crop diversification, which is a strategy for managing production risk and improving soil fertility under cereal-based smallholder production environments in SSA. Meanwhile, there is growing debate on whether ISPs may conflict with the crop diversification strategy by promoting crop concentration. We estimate cropland allocation and diversification models to test this hypothesis for two ISPs in Botswana, Accelerated Rainfed Arable Programme (ARAP) and Integrated Support Programme for Arable Agriculture Development (ISPAAD), using panel data of agricultural regions and the cropping seasons of 1978/79 to 2013/14. Results reveal that ISPs have induced increased concentration on cereals, away from beans/pulses and oil crops, leading to reduced cropland diversification. ARAP induced a 6.7 percentage point rise in cereal area share and a 5.2 (1.4) percentage point fall in beans/pulses (oil crops) area share. Similarly, ISPAAD induced a 4.4 percentage point rise in cereal area share and a 4.1 percentage point fall in beans/pulses area share. By discouraging legume production, ISPs may lead to soil fertility loss, as legumes may help rebuild nitrogen stocks in soils.",

The paper follows a stepwise approach to test the causality of variables affecting production decision-making during periods of volatility, such as drought or floods Testing the OLS results for robustness, if was found that the inclusion of dynamic estimations such as ARDL and ARCH/GARCH approaches were required. Findings show that effective rainfall is the main determinant for livestock farming in the Namibian arid areas, much more than stocking rates or other variables suggested in earlier literature. Advanced analysis shows that the inclusion of known rainfall cycles in production decision making can improve the farm gross margin by 15.9%, which reduces volatility. The findings call for extension services to avail early warning systems that will enable livestock farmers to cushion the impact of gross margin volatility. Cushioning the cattle industry against gross margin volatility will provide positive impact on the national economy.",

This study employs both the Engle-Granger's and the Johansen's tests for cointegration in order to examine the efficiency of the futures market in South Africa for white maize, which is the most important commodity traded on the South African Futures Exchange by volume. Near spot and futures prices are found to be cointegrated, and there is evidence to indicate that this market is both unbiased and without a risk premium, indicating a weak-form efficient market.

The focus is on the agricultural economic scholarship per se and not on the policy and practice issues of the discipline. Following the review of agricultural economic research output in South Africa the paper then also raises questions about relevance and impact of the discipline and the quality of training. Given these concerns the paper makes the case for improved coordination and perhaps consolidation of the discipline and presents a proposal for the establishment of a national institute that will consolidate and improve training at the various universities as well as adequately fund and direct research.",

    "abstract": "The Namibian red meat industry is the backbone of the local agricultural sector, contributing almost 75% to total agricultural output. Through its export activities, the red meat industry is also an important generator of foreign exchange. However, Namibia exports its red meat to only a few trading partners, including South Africa (46%) and the European Union (EU) (29%). This is raising concerns because Namibia could lose its preferential (i.e. duty- and quota-free) market access into the EU with the expiry of the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (IEPA) in 2014, while over-reliance on only a few markets increases the export sector's vulnerability to external shocks. Namibia therefore needs to diversify its markets for red meat. The purpose of this paper is to identify new export markets as realistic alternatives to the traditional main markets of South Africa, the EU and Norway. A Decision Support Model (DSM) was applied as the market selection tool in this study. The DSM consists of four filters that systematically analyse export opportunities against factors such as macroeconomic risk, market size, market concentration, shipping costs and tariff barriers. Two hundred and thirty-one countries and 28 red meat products were put through this filtering process. The analysis revealed that the most promising alternative export markets for Namibian red meat include Hong Kong, Switzerland, Qatar, Bahrain, Singapore, Malaysia and China. The DSM results constitute an important foundation for more in-depth research into demand patterns, as well as other possible deterrents, in the identified markets.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Climate change is an additional challenge for the African continent, which is already facing many challenges. It increases the uncertainty regarding the probability of flood occurrence, making weather less predictable, rainfall more uncertain but heavy storms more likely. This necessitates rethinking and changing the traditional ways of planning and dealing with floods. When flooding occurs according to a predictable pattern, an optimal package of flood damage control measures can be planned in advance, but when flood events become unpredictable due to climate change, the optimal package of flood damage control measures will change, cannot be planned with sufficient certainty in advance and different management strategies are needed. In this study a benefit cost analysis was applied to compare the merits of different structural flood mitigation options for Soweto-on-Sea, with and without climate change. The option with the highest net benefit remains the clearing out of the river channel for both (with and without) scenarios. In order to protect/improve the quality of life of the urban poor flood victims, the economic dimension of flood control planning, which is implied when using benefit cost analysis to select the best flood mitigation option, is insufficient. Besides the economic dimension, the social and environmental dimensions must also be included, suggesting that a multi-criteria decision analysis procedure be used.

    "abstract": "Abstract The European Union (EU) has remained South Africa's biggest trading partner, with total exports destined for the Union constituting about 30 per cent of South Africa's total exports in the last ten years. However, owing to recent developments, new market opportunities, especially in the developing world, have emerged, with countries like China capturing some of South Africa's total exports. Analysts like Sandrey and Jensen (2007) have argued that such developments signal a significant change in the relevance of the EU as South Africa's main trading partner. This paper, however, argues that, even with the rise of emerging markets, South Africa still needs to take the EU seriously and remain strategic in its relationship with the Union. Even though total export flows to countries like China have risen exponentially since 2005, they still constituted only about 5 per cent of South Africa's total exports in all other sectors in 2008. More specifically, agricultural export data shows that, since 1997, EU-destined exports in the sector have been growing at a rate above that of agricultural exports to the world. The trends could imply that the ongoing implementation process of the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) between the EU and South Africa remains relevant for economic growth and probably for poverty alleviation as well.",

In this article, the GTAP database and the associated general equilibrium model is used to assess the potential welfare and trade gains from such an agreement. The results show that there are comfortable welfare gains for South Africa derived from a better use of land, labour and capital (enhanced allocative efficiency); increased net investment increasing the amount of capital employed in the economy; and a small contribution from increased labour employment. These gains are negated somewhat by terms of trade that go against South Africa. However, an FTA with Mercosur is not good for the South African agriculture sector. Imports of agricultural products increase dramatically, mostly in terms of increased imports of secondary (processed) agricultural products. Export gains are modest, but are largely from trade creation rather than trade diversion. Furthermore, there are marginal reductions in the prices of all agricultural products, which benefits consumers but harm producers. Overall, the FTA is bad news for South Africa's commercial farmers. Whether small-scale and emerging farmers benefit depends on whether they are food deficit or food surplus producers.",

However, more recently, empirical evidence has shown that food price shocks are persistent and have a strong bearing on inflation outcomes. This paper shows that this is indeed the case for South Africa. South African food prices are volatile and the price shocks are persistent. Food inflation is an important determinant of underlying inflationary pressures in the South African economy. Thus, policy should give particular attention to food price movements if inflation is to be kept in check.Keywords: inflationmonetary policyfood policyJEL CLASSIFICATION: E31E52Q18",

    "abstract": "The objective of this article is to estimate the maximum value of crop hail insurance according to the financial extent of hail risk's impact on the enterprise in two regions, North West (low hail risk area) and Mpumalanga (high hail risk area). The difference in the cumulative probability distributions of the Net Present Value (NPV) of the margin after interest and tax in the event of hail and in the event of no hail will provide a graphic indication of the financial impact of hail. To determine if the decision maker is willing to pay in order to remove the impact of hail on the enterprise, the utility weighted risk premium (UWRP) must be calculated with the use of stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) analysis. The calculated maximum benefit (or UWRP) that the decision maker will receive through the elimination of hail will set the upper limit for the cost of crop hail insurance. The results indicate that hail does have a negative impact on the financial position of the farms in North West and Mpumalanga. The effect of hail risk in Mpumalanga is, however, more severe. The calculated maximum benefit (UWRP) from the elimination of hail damage in two regions is R83.50/hectare in North West and R708.70/hectare in Mpumalanga. The conclusion can thus be made that decision makers in both regions will be willing to pay for crop hail insurance, but much more so in Mpumalanga than in North West.",

In the estimation of physical capital such as machinery and implements, a possible approach is to use the ratio of the value of tractor sales to overall expenditure to impute overall machinery sales. The use of a constant ratio over an extended period results in increasingly incorrect estimates and fails to reveal the changing nature of mechanisation. In this article, the problems with such an approach are highlighted through an analysis of the historic share of tractor sales to overall machinery sales in South Africa. This article establishes that the current methods have led to underestimation in the overall value of machinery and implements sales in South Africa by approximately a billion rand per annum for recent years. An alternative method is suggested and the implications of a new capital formation series are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The South African wheat industry has been under severe pressure in recent years. Prescribed high wheat quality, which is enforced via cultivar release criteria, is believed to have negatively influenced the productivity and competitiveness of producers. The main hypothesis is that producers deliver lower yields because of high quality requirements and are not compensated for this high quality since prices are still determined by the lowest import parity price. Whether or not this is actually the case must be determined, firstly, by identifying the factors that influence the price of wheat, and secondly, by identifying the factors that do not influence the price of wheat but nevertheless have an adverse effect on producers’ productivity. In this study, a hedonic price model, built on the premise that price is a function of all the characteristics that the product possesses, is used to precisely determine the factors that impact – or otherwise – on price levels in the South African wheat industry. The authors apply the hedonic price model using a three-step process to obtain the best-fitting model for the available data. The results reveal that variations in price are mainly a function of Colour, P/L, Defects and Fall, and that these factors should form the basis of the prescribed quality to producers. By knowing the wheat characteristics that must be included in, and excluded from, the release criteria (prescribed quality) system, producers will be able to produce goods that positively impact their productivity as well as their competitiveness.",

The changing rural-urban wage differential; and the demise of traditional institutions as well as the drought of the early 1980s were important factors in the changes described. An important conclusions is that no single factor caused the development of a commercial agriculture, but that a package of prime movers was necessary. The broad consequences of the transformation in agriculture has significance for both those with agricultural resources, as well as those without. One of the most important consequences of the change is the creation of a commercial farming class, and conversely, the creation of two other groups; a group of wage labourers and a group of land right holders who lease out their land.",

    "abstract": "Despite recognition of the need for special strategies to address the widespread incidence of rural poverty in developing countries, initiatives aimed at bringing about a transformation of the rural standard of living have not had a consistent impact on reducing poverty. The failure of the most recent of these interventions—integrated rural development—has left a policy vacuum as donors and countries struggle to find new ways to reduce rural poverty. Recent initiatives designed to put in place decentralized mechanisms for rural development offer possibilities for building on the essential principles of integrated rura1 development while avoiding problems associated with an over-centralization of functions and responsibilities. This paper examines the potential role for decentralization in designing improved rural development programs. Some of the recent efforts to implement programs of decentralized rural development are described and analyzed. The paper concludes that although decentralization initiatives have a long history, much more needs to be understood with respect to the various components of decentralization if sound advice is to be given to policy-makers. A conceptual model is suggested that incorporates the essential elements of decentralization processes and relates them to rural development outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This paper has two objectives: first, to identify the main contaminants responsible for high treatment costs in the Umgeni catchment area, and second, to predict treatment costs from observed levels of contaminants. A partial adjustment model of treatment costs is estimated for the DV Harris plant, which draws water from Midmar Dam, using ordinary least squares regression and principal component analysis. The model highlights important policy issues and explains 61% of the variation in chemical treatment costs. Environmental contaminants have a marked impact on treatment costs. Treatment costs increase when levels of alkalinity, sodium and turbidity fall. Conversely, costs rise with higher levels of dissolved oxygen and water stability. Paradoxically, clean water - typical of Midmar Dam - is expensive to treat. Treatment costs also rise when concentrations of the algae, Chlorella, decline. Apparently the level of Chlorella varies inversely with the level of other, more harmful, contaminants. SAMEVATTING: ONTLEDING EN VOORSPELLING VAN WATERBEHANDELINGSKOSTE BY DIE DV HARRIS-AANLEG IN DIE UMGENI OPVANGSGEBIED Hierdie artikel het twee doelwitte : eerstens om die belangrikste kontaminante wat vir hoe behandelingskoste in die Umgeni opvangsgebied verantwoordelik is te identifiseer en tweedens om behandelingskoste van waargenome kontaminantepeole te voorspel. 'n Parsele aanpassingsmodel van behandelingskoste word vir die DV Harris-aanleg, wat water van die Midmardam onttrek, gepas met die gebruik van gewone kleinste kwadrate regressie en hoofkomponente-analise. Die model beklemtoon belangrike beleidskwessies en verklaar 61% van die variasie in chemiese behandelingskoste. Omgewingskontaminante het 'n belangrike effek op behandelingskoste. Behandelingskoste neem toe met dalings in peile van alkaliniteit, natrium en troebelheid. Aan die ander kant styg koste met hoer peile van opgeloste stuurstof en waterstabiliteit. Dis paradoksikaal dat skoon water - wat tipies in Midmardam aangetref word - duur is om te behandel. Behandelingskoste styg ook met dalende konsentrasies van die Chlorella alge. Die Chlorella peile varieer blykbaar omgekeerd eweredig tot peile van ander, meer skadelike kontaminante.",

A log linear function was used to estimate direct, cross and income elasticities. The analysis reveals that the demand for beef and mutton/goat is elastic while the demand for pork and chicken is inelastic. The results of further analyses indicate that mutton/goat is a substitute to beef while pork and chicken are complements to it. In the mutton/goat equation, beef is a substitute to mutton/goat while pork and chicken are complements to it. Both the beef and the mutton/goat equations indicated an income elasticity of more than one. High income elasticities for these two types of meat perhaps indicate that if improvements can be made in both production and marketing, more of these meat types would be consumed at every increase in income. In both the pork and chicken equations, beef and mutton/goat are found to be complements of these meat types. Pork and chicken are substitutes to each other.

'n Log-lineere funksie is gebruik om direkte, kruis- en inkome-elastisiteite te skat. Die analise toon dat die vraag na beesvleis en skaap/bokvleis elasties is terwyl die vraag na vark- en hoendervleis onelasties is. Die resultate van verdere analises toon dat skaap/bokvleis 'n substituut vir beesvleis is terwyl hoender- en varkvleis komplemente daarvan is. In die skaap/bokvleisvergelyking is beesvleis 'n substituut vir skaap/bokvleis terwyl vark- en hoerdervleis komplemente daarvan is.

This study identifies economic factors affecting family size choice to provide policy makers with a strategy for reducing fertility. A neoclassical utility framework was used to analyse linkages between family size decisions and socio-economic variables. Household utility for services and standard of living was maximised subject to the resource constraints of time, labour and income. A demand curve for children was specified within a simultaneous model of family decision making. A stratified sampling technique was used to collect household data from Ulundi and Ubombo in KwaZulu. One hundred and seventy five women in three equal occupational strata were interviewed. The simultaneous model was estimated by two-stage least squares regression analysis. Dummy dependent variables were estimated by probit analysis. Child education, women's opportunity cost of time and formal market participation were negatively related to fertility, rcnecting substitution from numbers of children (time intensive goods) to fewer, more educated children(less time intensive) as opportunity costs rise. Child labour was positively related to fertility. Strategics to reduce population growth rates should therefore include improvements in women's education and employment opportunities to raise their time costs, and time saving devices to reduce demand for child labour.",

Beef production fluctuates due to its dependence on Namibia's environment which is characterized by unpredictable weather, periodical droughts, political and structural changes, distorted market signals and lack of clear incentives for change. Namibia was divided into sixteen homogeneous ecological and veterinarian areas. Supply response of beef is analysed in each area by using multiple regression techniques on biological and economic time series data. Results show that the producers' price of beef does not generally play a major role in the supply response of beef. Environmental factors and cattle numbers play a major role in determining the annual number of cattle marketed. Deficiencies in the marketing systems for beef contribute to environmental problems and resource degradation. Beef production should be based on knowledge of market outlets and on high standards of farm management. Attention should be given to the removal of impediments to the creation of new markets that would allocate resources effectively and produce net benefits to the society.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper aims to determine patterns used by emerging farmers to participate in the market economy. The eight components of participation (six crop sales, livestock sales and off-farm earnings) were subjected to factor analysis. The results indicate that there are five sources of market participation; viz. sales of staples, cash crops, snacks, livestock and off-farm earnings. That is, participation in the market through one of the sources may or may not be preconditioned by another source. Implications for food security are that commercial isation of both maize and beans should be promoted to ensure starch and protein intake respectively, while cotton and vegetables will provide income and employment, livestock as a food risk management base, and off-farm income as a livelihood enhacing mechanism. Die doel van hierdie bydrae is die bepaling van patrone wat deur opkomende boere gebruik word om aan die markekonomie deel te neem. Die agt komponente van deelname (ses oesgewasverkope, veeverkope en verdienste buite die plaas) is aan faktoranalise onderwerp. Die resultate toon dat daar vyf bronne van markdeelname is: verkope van stapelvoedselgewasse, kontantgewasse, versnaperinge, vee en verdienste buite die plaas. Aldus kan deelname aan die mark deur een van die bronne deur 'n ander bron geprekondisioneer word, of dit hoef nie die geval te wees nie. Die implikasies vir voedselsekuriteit is dat kommersialisering van beide mielie- e n boontjieproduksie bevorder moet word om stysel- en proteïninname onderskeidelik te verseker, terwyl katoen en groente inkomste en indiensneming sal verskaf, vee 'n voedselrisikobestuurbasis sal verskaf en buite-plaas verdienste 'n bestaansverbeterende meganiesme sal verskaf.",

Coupled with the advance in technology, a borderless society is emerging that necessitates a rethinking of traditional agricultural policies. This paper analyses this trend by presenting an overview of issues currently affecting agricultural trade, both globally and in South Africa. The latter has undergone a significant deregulation and liberalisation process of its own. Coupled with global trends towards even further deregulation, especially during the 1999 round of multilateral trade negotiations, agricultural industries and economists will be required to focus their attention in this direction. While the former need to devise strategies that will enhance their international competitiveness within a deregulated environment, the latter will have to become involved in the policy debate surrounding this issue. This necessitates, however, on both sides, an improvement of theoretical knowledge of international trade, as well as an understanding of global issues.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews the rationale for policies aimed at limiting the conversion of farmland to non-farm uses from the perspective of the economic theory of property rights. Policy measures to restrict the conversion of agricultural land to non-farm uses are commonplace in many countries. Typically, these policies are introduced to address long-run food security issues and possible externalities associated with incompatibility in land uses. The paper argues that the presence of externalities in the land market does not warrant farmland protection policies. Farmland protection policies in themselves can be a source of policy failure. It concludes that well-defined property rights along with nuisance and trespass laws, are necessary and sufficient for efficient allocation of land and can be a better alternative to farmland protection policies.",

South African manufacturing of farming requisites as a whole are relative marginally competitive in the international area. However, positive trends in competitiveness is observed. The agricultural machinery industry is not competitive but is improving. The fertiliser industry is becoming increasingly more competitive while in the pesticides industry there is a decrease in the ability to compete internationally. From 1995 there is a relatively high and positive correlation between the competitiveness of the input industry and the agro-food industry in South Africa.

It could be beneficial for managers of agricultural businesses to determine which business units perform the best and the worst in terms of customer satisfaction and which units most influence customer satisfaction. A major agricultural business in central South Africa took part in this quantitative research study of which the target population was all active customers providing income above R100 000 to the agricultural business. The response rate was 35.8 per cent. The results indicated that customer satisfaction towards retail shops has the biggest impact on overall satisfaction of all the business units. Almost 99 per cent of the respondents make use of this business unit and retail shops are generally considered to be the “window” through which customers view the agricultural business. The best performing business unit was grain storage, while mechanisation (workshops) was considered to be the worst performing business unit for the participating business. When these two business units were tested separately from the other business units, it was found that mechanisation (workshops) had the biggest impact on customer satisfaction, indicating that if the participating business were to consider improving customer satisfaction of the agricultural business as a whole, it should rather focus on the worst performing business unit, because a small improvement in the customer satisfaction of this business unit could increase customer satisfaction substantially for the business as a whole.",

In 2006, a proposed industry strategy was drafted. One of the main topics in this draft is the proposed blending percentages, namely, 8 per cent for bio-diesel and 10 per cent for ethanol. This would affect the South African animal feed industry, because Dried Distillers Grain with Solubles (DDGS) is a by-product of ethanol production from maize. The effects can be seen by applying the Agricultural Products Requirement (APR) minimum feed cost formulation model. According to the APR model, the total cost of animal feeds would decline at various blending percentages. Consumption of protein-rich raw materials declined most markedly at a 10 per cent blending of ethanol. These raw materials are mostly oil cake, which is currently imported from various countries. Some animals used more DDGS than others in their diets. According to this study, broilers used the most DDGS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Over the past few years the world has witnessed substantial developments in the global production and the production capacity of ethanol. This tremendous growth in the industry is mainly driven by the following: petroleum prices, the reliability of traditional crude oil exporters along with political motives, adverse pollution effects and more specifically, emission gases from fossil fuels. Together with this growth, various researchers locally and globally have focused on ethanol production, but little work has been done on the economic impact that ethanol production will have on the animal feed industry. In order to simulate the results, the two main scenarios were analysed using two different models – namely, the BFAP model and the APR model. By applying the BFAP model to these scenarios, the equilibrium prices of animal feed raw materials were simulated for the year 2015. The APR model was then applied to these prices in order to evaluate the impact of ethanol production on the animal feed industry. Two main scenarios are constructed with four combinations; the main variables in the scenarios are the oil price and the blending ratios of biofuel. The results revealed that there is no significant effect on the animal feed industry. Various raw materials are affected, but only by small percentages. The only raw material that shows any significant change is lucerne, with a 20 per cent decrease in consumption. The greatest effect is the replacement of imported protein raw materials by DDGS (dried distillers grains with solubles). In terms of the animal feed costs, there was only a 2 per cent decrease with the introduction of ethanol production. Under a scenario of high blending ratios and oil prices, the yellow maize price increases by R169/ton and the soya oilcake price decreases by R347/ton.",

Monte Carlo simulation of a springbuck-based meat production enterprise was used to quantify the risks that would be faced by springbuck ranchers. Springbuck ranching has been proven a viable alternative in the production of highly nutritious and healthy meat (venison) that is in high demand in European markets and more recently, with a promising and increasing local demand as well. The results indicate that in the Eastern Cape Karoo, springbuck ranching for meat production is a viable business. As the call for more environmentally friendly rangelands utilisation economic systems intensifies, rangelands owners in the Eastern Cape Karoo have a practicable option. At the very least, an alternative to broaden their incomes with springbuckbased meat production exists.

Food security is defined as the ability of a country or region to assure that the existing food systems will provide the total population with access to a timely, reliable and nutritionally adequate supply of food over the long term. This implies, amongst other things, that increased domestic food self-sufficiency and the stockpiling of domestic grain reserves are no guarantee for food security. These processes can even be counter-productive to food security if it is done in an ineffective way and the price of food is increased. In the case of South Africa it seems that the supply of food is not a serious problem. Globally seen it also seems that South African agriculture can, at least potentially, provides in the food requirements of the growing population over the medium to longer term. Policy should thus concentrate on the other elements of food security. The effectiveness of any food policy will partly be determined by the degree in which the comparative advantages of certain regions, products and farming systems are recognised in the policy-making process. A movement towards a freer market is necessary to achieve success in this regard.",

Long run relationships were established using cointegration and time varying parameters estimated to analyze the macroeconomic impacts at various stages of financial sector reform. The results indicate that the interest rate had the most significant effect on real net farm income which was exacerbated during the reform process.

    "abstract": "Abstract Measurement of natural resource quality is useful for objectives such as macro production analysis, decisions regarding goverment capital expenditure and agricultural aid programs. Land prices can serve as indicator. Land prices are however influenced by external factors as well as quality of the land. The role of external factors, such as the use or expected use of land for non-agricultural purposes, goverment aid programs and monetary conditions must thus be eliminated so that land prices can be used as barometer of resource quality. A similar study was done in the USA with states as observation units. International indexes with countries as observation units were calculated in another study. In this paper a South African resource quality index with statistical regions as observation units is presented. Good statistical fits were obtained. The following factors contributed significantly to the determination of resource quality indexes: stability of rainfall, irrigation and percentage of land under natural pasture.

In the calculation of the total support to agriculture in South Africa, the Producer Subsidy Equivalent (PSE) was used to determine the internal support received by producers. The PSE was not calculated on a product-specific basis, but for agriculture as a whole. Agricultural support in South Africa has increased steadily during the past few years. With the exception of the drought relief programmes in 1992/93, support amounted to approximately R4 billion a year since 1991/92. Market price support is the largest component of domestic support and has contributed about 48 percent of total support during the previous four years.",

The provision of a livestock marketing system was aimed at giving farmers satisfactory returns for their animals. This has not increased the turnover of livestock among the farmers, despite farmers stating that they keep livestock as a source of income. The major drawback to farmers more fully utilising the marketing facilities is that the majority of the households have insufficient livestock to meet their social and cultural needs and to have animals to sell on a regular basis.",

They are also more likely to have access to credit as compared with those stockowners who operate on open access with no restrictions on the use of the commons. The results have some positive implications for the formation of pup schemes to manage livestock production in communal grazing areas in south Africa.",

An expert panel of scientists and commercial apple fanners were dram into an interactive, computer assisted dialogue to design alternative apple production systems requiring significantly scaled-down investment. Within imposed capital constraints, production technologies were designed using horticultural integrity and feasibility as criteria. Each model was then subjected to economic analysis. Net present values for 10 and 20 year orchard lives, internal rates of return and other criteria are applied. The analysis explores feasibility within the particular constraints of small-scale faming such as available household labour and risk averseness. One model passes most feasibility tests under a wide range of conditions. Assumptions within that model should form important considerations for small farmer establishment programs. Lastly, a portrait of a possible two hectare apple farm is presented.",

The results from this study reveal that the key determinants of the main inputs purchased and used by smallholder farmers in the former Lebowa namely fertiliser, seed and other inputs (chemicals, veterinary services and feeds) are; credit, non-farm incomes, extension services and location. productivity is in turn determined by the application of fertiliser, use of other inputs, training and location.

The Swartland is one of the more stable wheat producing regions and the drastic cut in wheat prices during the 1988/89 season caused large-scale dissatisfaction amongst the producers, which in turn led to an investigation into restructuring possibilities in the Swartland. The point of departure was the creation of a representative farming model for the Middle Swartland subregion. Information was gathered by means of postal questionnaires. The dynamic linear programming technique was applied to this model over a twelve year period. The risk factor was then incorporated by applying the Target MOTAD programming technique to the model. A single cash injection of R130 per hectare was necessary to get the DLP model to function successfully. In the DLP model the solution stabilised after a five year period, while the risk model stabilised after eight years. Different cropping and livestock patterns were derived from the models. The general conclusion is that the restructuring of farming patterns in the Swartland has definite potential.",

For these purposes, solid evidence of the social gains of past investments is needed, as well as appropriate criteria for planning and priority setting, Returns on investments in technology development and transfer have mostly been evaluated in economic terms, using the rate of return as a measure of efficiency. However, these means are not equally appropriate for the impact appraisal of all research and development programs. Some impacts are difficult to quantify or only materialize over a longer period of time. For this reason, projects should not be prioritized according to efficiency measures alone. Non-market costs and benefits should be evaluated on an equal footing to their market-based counterparts. This paper proposes a comprehensive conceptual framework for assessing the impact of agricultural research and development. It reviews the concepts and methodologies involved in these kinds of appraisals and refers to their application in empirical impact studies conducted in South Africa to date.",

However, given a global regulatory environment that entrenches the notions of international competition (on both regional and global levels), to \"catch-up\" and compete is exactly what agribusiness has to do. An analysis of the agro-food and fibre complex reveals a remarkable achievement, namely that, despite difficult local conditions, the agricultural industry succeeded in operating more competitively for the last eight years. On the primarily level the sugar, groundnuts, oranges, apples, grapes and wool industries establish themselves as \"winners\" in the global trading environment. On the value added level the maize flour, apple juice, grape juice and raisins industries have distinguished themselves as \"winners\". Agribusinesses in these industries clearly started to focus on the \"right stuff\". Unfortunately, some \"losers\" also emerged, while some industries created a positive \"turnaround\" situations.",

Since 1992, with the implementation of EC Regulation 2081/92 and2082/92, the EU has adopted a similar system to that of the French. It is proposed that the Branch Agriculture: Western Cape, adopt a similar legislated system, to firstly provide the institutional framework for local producers to differentiate their products according to geographic area, and secondly, for future trade possibilities with the EU, our main export market. New Institutional Economics is used as a base from which it is hypothesised that by Legislating the concept of Geographical Indications, the incentive structure of the institutional framework will change, reducing the transaction costs associated with the organisation of this system, and thus making it feasible for ‘qualified' producers’, to differentiate their products in this way. The paper first looks at the theory of New Institutional economics and then uses the theory to compare the effectiveness of using Collective Trademarks and Geographical Indications in differentiating a product based on geographic area. GI legislation can be viewed in terms of defining-better the property rights associated with a geographical name and thus reducing the transaction costs surrounding the organisation of this marketing structure.",

These businesses, therefore, need to work closely with public institutions to prevent crime and disease, and find appropriate ways for local communities to benefit from tourism. Internet users mainly derived income from game ranching and game-based tourism, and were less likely to offer hunting services. Younger operators, those with more formal education, larger operations, businesses with more managers, and firms that focus on middle-income groups, also tend to practice Internet marketing and offer on-line bookings. This suggests business opportunities to develop Internet marketing plans to complement these operators' existing sources of competitive advantage.",

This study aims to quantify actual use of management instruments by a sample of commercial sugarcane farmers in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) that are commonly associated with risk management, and uses factor analysis to investigate the extent to which these farmers bracket their management decisions. Data were obtained in 2006 via personal interviews of a stratified random sample of 76 large-scale sugarcane farmers in two separate mill-supply areas of KZN. Respondents were asked questions regarding risk-related management strategies, including diversification of on-farm enterprises, investments and management time. Factor analysis identified six management choice brackets, collectively explaining 77% of the variance in all of the 12 risk-related management responses considered. Recommendations that stem from these findings include that policy makers create a more enabling business environment and that government make labour legislation more flexible. Farmers need to search for information more proactively and develop management strategies that reduce barriers to efficiency. Future research based on time series data could be important to identify how management portfolios and choice bracketing levels change over time.",

Colombian carnations enter the EU duty-free under the GSP+ incentive scheme which is less secure than the trade agreement between the EU and Kenya. If the EU withdrew preferences from Colombia, would Kenyan flower exporters be better off in the UK carnation market? The results of study showed that Colombian exports benefited from tariff-free access to the UK where the benefit was due to both trade creation and trade diversion. Additionally, the competition between Colombian and Kenyan carnations was found to be insignificant and there was no evidence that GSP+ negatively affected Kenyan carnations. The results showed that competing exporters (Kenya, the Netherlands and Spain) could actually be better off when Colombian carnations are given duty-free to the EU.",

The Armington framework (source-differentiation) is often used when estimating import demand for a similar product from different sources; however, the results of this study indicated that country of origin is not a factor in the Netherlands when importing Nile perch. Results showed that the responsiveness of importers to price changes was the same regardless to the supplying country. Likelihood ratio tests fail to reject the hypothesis that the own-price and cross-price demand estimates were equal across the three exporting countries. It was also shown that the origin-specific expenditure and own-price elasticities were not significantly different across the three exporting countries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biodiversity offsets for a river create the incentive for cooperation amongst stakeholders with benefits to the environment. Because of the isolation paradox supporting institutions need to be created to facilitate cooperation. Environmental pollution caused by mining activity is a problem in the Olifants River (East) in South Africa. The catchment surface is fractured by mining activities and water is drained into underground aquifers, after which it seeps into streams. Mines have been permitted to release nutrients in the streams during periods of high flow, which is called the “controlled release scheme”. A main problem is the effluent leakage from old disused mines during times when river flow is low and not sufficient dilution of nutrients is possible. DWAF (Department of Water Affairs and Forestry) has accepted ownership of these mines but they may not have the technology (which is expensive) to desalinate the effluent. In an offsetting arrangement, incentives can be provided to existing mines to desalinate water from these defunct mines by allowing them to discharge a given amount in the Olifants when the water flow is sufficiently high. The above arrangement will cost the taxpayer nothing while discharge during low flow periods is reduced. A discussion was held with stakeholders of the Olifants River Forum during 2006 and support was received for some of these policy options. It is shown how offsets can mitigate negative effects of dam construction. It is further proposed that tradable pollution permits be adopted which are subject to a rule that discharges in the river are only allowed when flow is sufficiently high and that trades may only occur within certain parameters.",

Results support the notion that self-selection occurs and that estimates that do not consider selection-bias would be biased.

Thus, policy makers should consider these differing effects when designing development projects to increase tea yields.",

    "abstract": "The spread of invasive alien plant species (IAPs) contributes to the management complexity experienced in primary agriculture and increases the costs of maintaining the land in its productive state. Equally important to the clearing of IAPs are the land use options post-clearing. This study was conducted on private farms at the Mokolo River catchment to determine the most viable agricultural land use option after clearing IAPs. System dynamics modelling is used as a data analysis tool. The outcomes of this study indicate that early restoration of the farm area invaded by IAPs is more beneficial than restoring when the area is heavily degraded. Some of the gains from early restoration are a minimum unit reference value (URV) of R7.05 (instead of R8.29 or R9.08) per cubic metre of water produced by clearing IAPs through a co-financing strategy by the private sector and the state. Moreover, a negative net income is generated through extensive agricultural production while positive net income is generated though intensive agricultural production from 2008–2030. Therefore, this study suggests that intensive agricultural production is economically viable and has the potential to co-finance the government’s activities of clearing IAPs.",

Constraints include a lack of transport services, a lack of road infrastructure, communication infrastructure and storage facilities. Farmers also need training and a regular source of market information. Provincial Departments of Agriculture can play a role in providing this information and training. Infrastructure, however, is a function of other government departments and in some cases private companies. The establishment of rural processing facilities should be encouraged. Farmers can also seize some marketing opportunities by working together in their production and marketing activities.",

The two studies, which both used a questionnaire survey for data collection, enabled a comparison between dryland and irrigated agriculture. The analysis showed that agriculture adds to rural livelihood in a modest way only, and hardly ever constituted the main source of household income. For the majority of households in both the dryland and irrigated production environments the main source of income consisted of State transfers of which pensions were the most important. In the area, three of the four factors identified by Lipton (1996), namely access to agricultural land, research and development of appropriate technology, and rural infrastructure were found to require reform for local small scale farming to become a viable livelihood option. The only factor which did not appear to present a major constraint was access to markets. Relative to the present level of production, the market in the rural area itself is sufficiently large to absorb most produce, usually at prices higher than those offered by formal markets. In future, access to markets could become a constraint if production by small scale farmers were to be increased significantly.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Women in rural areas of less developed areas of Southern Africa are involved in many agricultural production activities especially the production of food. These areas are known to be characterised by low agricultural productivity. Research was conducted to determine factors which lead to low productivity among women farmers. The hypothesis put forward was that low productivity amongst this class of farmers could be due to problems they encounter in the production process. The research was undertaken in the rural areas of Lebowa. Five schemes not linked to a development agency were selected at random. The reason for excluding schemes attached to development agencies was to ensure that only farms on which management is solely by farmers themselves are included. Data was collected by means of a questionnaire survey. Major constraints towards increased production were identified as: shortage of land; inadequate irrigation water; lack of management abilities; limited control over factors of production; limited education; unavailability of credit and inefficient market outlets. The following measures are suggested in order to improve agricultural production:- increase in the number of land holdings with freehold ownership of land; provision of efficient market outlets; infrastructure, credit and irrigation water; and provision of better qualified extension workers to improve farmers' knowledge of farming.",

Attention is devoted more specifically to changes in respect of the number of farmers and farms, farm sizes, types of enterprise, the lease of land and part-time farming. An effort was made to answer the following questions in respect of every structural component: — What changes have recently occurred? — What were the most important socio-economic forces behind these changes? — What socio-economic forces should have an important influence on these changes in the near future? — What are the effects of these changes on their structural components likely to be? — Is the direction which the changes are expected to take desirable from the point of view of social welfare? Briefly, the finding was that important changes, caused by a variety of factors, are taking place in respect of every structural component and that the direction which these structural changes are taking is not very desirable from the point of view of social welfare. Possible courses of action to deal with this problem are discussed.",

Ten game farmers' economic returns were therefore compared with those of beef cattle producers. Investment per hectare was found to be comparable. Game farmers invest more in fencing and more in animals, expressed in Rand per animal unit. Gross and net incomes comparable to those of beef fanners can be obtained with game. Returns on capital are also comparable but low; neither game nor beef cattle farming appear to be attractive fields for investment. Game farming appears to be more risky than beef production. Game fanners should devote more attention to financial management and records.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Overwintering of livestock has been regarded as a major problem in the Drakensberg grazing regions, which are characterized by high rainfall, cold winters and uneven topography. The latter limits arable land and this leads to mixed farming. The natural vegetation is predominantly sour veld; natural grazing becomes unpalatable and indigestible in winter. Farmers have for long handled this livestock overwintering problem by moving animals to grazing outside the region. The practice has been dying out. Linear programming was used to determine optimal livestock and cropping systems. The most profitable farming enterprise was shown to be dairying. Grazing and arable land should supply the dairy herd with its roughage needs and after these needs are satisfied, the remainder of arable land should be used for cash crops (maize and dry beans), leaving no room for either beef cattle or woolled sheep. If the farmer does not want to keep dairy cattle, his second best choice—with much lower profitability—is a combination of cash crops and woolled sheep. Sheep numbers have to be adjusted to the ability of natural grazing and crop residues to sustain their nutritional needs. It does not pay to use arable land to produce feed or pastures for sheep. Beef cattle cannot compete economically with either dairy cattle, sheep or cash crops. Thus, the main problem in this region is not overwintering, but rather selection of optimal farming systems.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The competitive position of South African agriculture has been well researched in recent papers by the South African Agricultural Union “Die Mededingendheid van die Landbou…”, in the paper “Ekonomiese Knelpunte in die Landbou…” and research by Groenewald, “Veranderings in die pariteitsposisie van die Suid-Afrikaanse Landbou”. In these papers the worsening competitive position was discussed and it was shown that input prices have increased more than product prices, producer prices have increased more than export prices, interest on farm debt is choking farmers because of more market related interest rates and import tariff protection has escalated input costs. These factors, coupled with the crippling drought, have magnified the farmers financial and cash flow problems. This paper focuses on some possible short-term changes. It will be shown that the rand exchange rate has fallen more than can be explained by inflation rates, leading to a corresponding increase in export prices since 1983. The theme of this paper is also that food production in South Africa is profitable, that agriculture is basically efficient and that farmers should be allowed to feel market forces. South African farmers are also assured of a steady growth in local demand because the South African population growth rate is a high 2,9% compared to less than 1% in the USA. The income elasticity of demand for food is also much higher in South Africa than in the USA, indicating higher potential growth in local food demand.",

It was only during the past decade that the agricultural sector managed to use capital more efficiently than before 1960. This is in contrast with other sectors in the economy which experienced declining capital productivity over the past three decades. However, substitutiing capital with labour is since 1985 no longer to the advantage of the industry. Several shortcomings in the measurement of capital efficiency are shown, the most important of which is inconsistent data collection by the relevant authorities. Given certain economic prospects, doubt is expressed about the flexibility of the agricultural sector to maintain the increasing tendency in capital efficiency.",

(1997:298-299) attribute the differences in results to two main reasons.Firstly, they contend that the analysis of Van Zyl et al. (1995) is based solely on total factor productivity calculations that do \"not specifically estimate technical (in)efficiency of production, but overall productivity, of which technical efficiency is a component\".Secondly, land area or farm size is adjusted for quality differences by Van Zyl et al. (1995), while this is not done in the analysis of Ngwenya et al. (1997).It will subsequently be illustrated that the first statement is not the reason for the different results.More importantly, however, the failure to adjust land areas for differences in quality is a serious shortcoming and leads to erroneous conclusions.In both cases, therefore, the contentions and results of Ngwenya et al. (1997) should be treated with due circumspection. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUESContrary to the assertions of Ngwenya et al. (1997), the analysis of Van Zyl et al.

    "abstract": "The farm sector of the Western Cape is modelled using a sector mathematical programming model to determine the effect of different water policies on output, prices, welfare and employment. Two scenarios are analysed, namely the effect of a restriction of water available for irrigation, and an increase in water tariffs. Results show a relative shift away from (intensive) irrigated production, and a decrease in producer welfare, especially for irrigation farmers, under both scenarios. When water availability is decreased, the negative effect falls disproportionately on the poor as employment decreases. In the long run the negative effects are severe, as there is a relative shift out of industries where the Western Cape has a competitive advantage. DIE UITWERKINGS VAN WATERBELEIDE OP DIE PLAASSEKTOR IN DIE WESKAAP Die plaassektor van die Wes-Kaap is gemodelleer met die gebruik van 'n wiskundige programmeringsmodel teneinde die effek van verskillende waterbeleide op produksie, welvaart en indiensneming te bepaal. Twee scenarios word ntleed, naamlik die effek van 'n beperking op die water beskikbaar vir besproeiing en 'n verhoging van watertariewe. Die resultate toon 'n beweging weg van (intensiewe) besproeide produksie en 'n afname in produsentewelvaart, veral vir besproeiingsboere, onder beide scenarios. Wanneer waterbeskikbaarheid verminder word tref die negatiewe effekte veral die armes met 'n afname in indiensname. Oor die langtermyn is die effekte ernstig aangesien daar 'n relatiewe verskuiwing is weg van bedrywe waarin die WesKaap 'n mededingende voordeel het.",

However, collateral must have secure and transferable title, it must be marketable, have low lender liquidation costs and lenders must be able to attach the collateral. Study results for rural and micro-enterprise finance institutions in KwaZulu-Natal showed that assets such as vehicles and equipment were not effective as collateral due to high costs in attaching the asset. Cessions on crops were often constrained by flaws in collection mechanisms. Secure and transferable property rights were important preconditions for land to have value as collateral. Collateral substitutes such as joint liability mechanisms were less effective when lending to large farmer groups (30-60 members) compared with small groups (4-6 individuals) of micro-entrepreneurs operating in urban areas",

    "abstract": "A major limitation of the conventional market integration analysis is its neglect of the factors that underlie the cost associated with moving commodities across local markets. For instance, the existence of integrated markets implied by interdependently determined prices and stable spatial and temporal price spreads does not say much about the competitiveness and efficiency of local markets, or about the nature and determinants of the costs of market intermediation. Furthermore, while more efficient methods are being proposed to analyze price interdependence, the implications at the farm level and for agricultural transformation are not part of the analysis. One would, however, expect reforming governments to be more interested in issues such as i) the implications of market integration for the operation of local markets, ii) its impact on the process of domestic market reforms, iii) strategies to improve the degree of integration, and iv) the benefits of doing so. Market integration analysis may be helpful in providing a photograph of the operation of local markets at a given point in time. However, the process of market reform in the context of structural and institutional deficiencies, rather than being a one-shot issue, involves a lengthy transition process from a state-run to a private-sector-based distribution system. Unless it is extended to examine, among others, how market integration affects the process of adjustment in local markets, integration analysis will be of limited help as a tool for market policy research. The approach outlined in the present paper proposes an extension that is based on two premises. First, that the impact of the shod in the central market prices does not only affect the short-term level of the local prices, but also their time path. Second, that the long-term impact is determined by the degree of integration and is affected by any accompanying changes in local arbitrage costs.",

Twenty-five farm commodities and seven agribusinesses are explicitly included in the model. The coloured and black populations dominate provincial expenditure on fresh and processed farm commodities, suggesting that future demand growth depends on income increases among these household groups. In the aggregate, agriculture's contributions to job creation, value added and government revenue significantly exceed those of the nonagricultural sectors; agribusiness exceeds other nonagricultural sectors because of their backward links to production agriculture. Within agriculture, horticulture and livestock subsectors make the most significant contributions to the macro economy. Similar patterns are found with respect to generating household incomes, and in the equality with which such incomes are distributed. Household economic behaviour is explicit. Spending by the poor is found to be more labour intensive than spending by the rich, and generates greater impacts on value added (GGP), gross operating surplus and the demand for most farm and non-farm commodities. A composite ranking of macroeconomic contributions to development is constructed. Nine horticultural enterprises and broilers comprise the ten top sectors.",

Research centred on the white maize industry. Results show that regional differences within the market for maize are of cardinal importance, making country-wide generalisations dangerous and a regional marketing strategy imperative. One of the most significant results for the strategic marketing of maize meal is that a single population estimate for income elasticity is inadequate, especially when 94% of maize meal is consumed by a single consumer group - the Black population. Indications are that for Blacks in South Africa, maize is a normal good if seen in a national context. Consequently, as incomes fall or as relative prices rise, less maize is consumed. This is supported by urban price elasticities. It is proposed that this could have had a substantial effect on maize consumption in the past and have important implications for the marketing of staple food in a new South Africa.",

This study identifies economic factors affecting family size choice to provide policy makers with a strategy for reducing fertility. A neoclassical utility framework was used to analyse linkages between family size decisions and socio-economic variables. Household utility for “child services” and “standard of living” was maximised subject to the resource constraints of time, labour and income. A demand curve for children was specified within a simultaneous model of family decision making. A stratified sampling technique was used to collect household data from Ulundi and Ubombo in KwaZulu. One hundred and seventy five women in three equal occupational strata were interviewed. The simultaneous model was estimated by two-stage least squares regression analysis. Dummy dependent variables were estimated by probit analysis. Child education, women's opportunity cost of time and formal market participation were negatively related to fertility, reflecting substitution from numbers of children (time intensive goods) to fewer, more educated children(1ess time intensive) as opportunity costs rise. Child labour was positively related to fertility. Strategies to reduce population growth rates should therefore include improvements in women's education and employment opportunities to raise their time costs. and time saving devices to reduce demand for child labour.",

A spreadsheet model, developed for this purpose, has the following novel features:- it is interactive and readily allows for scenario analysis; the price of protein is endogenous in the South African model as it is generated by an international model; income elasticities of demand are permitted to decline with GNP growth; it incorporates estimated rates of technological progress in livestock production, and predicts the resulting real price change. Total protein consumption is projected at 1.54 million tons by 2010, a 24% increase from 2000, and 1.96 million tons by 2020, a 58% increase from 2000, under base population growth and low income growth. Broiler, egg and pork product prices (projected to decline in real terms because of expected technological advances) contribute to increasing protein usage even in the absence of significant real income growth rates. Population growth remains the most important demand driver and scenario analysis reveals that alternative population growth rates impact significantly on projections. The negative effect of HIV/AIDS on population growth and the subsequent restriction on potential protein use is evident.",

Hayami and Ruttan (1985:95) noted that institutions, like technology, must also change if development is to occur.

This study estimates a multinomial logistic model using 1993 integrated household survey data to examine the effect of household socio-economic and demographic characteristics on the decision to consume staple foods in South Africa. Results of the analysis indicate that socio-economic and demographic characteristics of households are important factors influencing the decision to consume staple foods. Empirical results indicate that, holding all things constant, the change in the probability of consuming staple foods for a unit change in income and price is very low. The results demonstrate that developing marketing strategies and government policies that target specific market segments is an effective means of promoting the use of staple foods. Findings from this study suggest that the household decision to consume staple foods could decline given increased urbanisation and changing tastes and preferences in South Africa.

    "abstract": "Irrigation farmers in the lower reaches of the Vaal and Riet Rivers are experiencing substantial yield reductions in certain crops and more profitable crops have been withdrawn from production, hypothesised, as a result of generally poor but especially fluctuating water quality. In this paper secondary data is used in a linear programming model to test this hypothesis by calculating the potential loss in farm level optimal returns. The model is static with a time frame of two production seasons. Linear crop-water quality production functions (Ayers & Westcot, 1983; adapted from Maas & Hoffmann, 1977) are used to calculate net returns for the eight most common crops grown. Results show optimal enterprise composition under various water quality situations. Leaching is justified financially and there is a strong motivation for a change in the current water pricing system. SALMOD (Salinity and Leaching Model for Optimal irrigation Development) is the Excel Solver model used to derive the preliminary results, but is currently being developed further in GAMS (General Algebraic Modelling System). Useful results have already been obtained on which this paper is based. The ultimate aim for SALMOD is a mathematical model using dynamic optimisation, simulation and risk modelling techniques to aid in whole farm and system level management decisions to ensure sustainable irrigation agriculture under stochastic river water quality conditions.",

Thus, proper planning of irrigation areas and scheduling of irrigation events in order to stay within water quotas has become more important. Currently, the available methodologies to assist irrigation farmers overlook the complexities and interrelated relationships between crop-area planning and the multi-stage nature of irrigation-scheduling decisions within a stochastic dynamic environment. This paper contributes to knowledge through the development of a bio-economic model that uses evolutionary algorithms to optimise water use, taking cognisance of the complex interrelationships between crop-area planning, the multistage decision-making nature of irrigation-scheduling decisions, and the stochastic dynamic environment under conditions of limited water supply. The results show that gross margin variability is reduced and the expected outcomes are improved due to improved irrigation-scheduling decisions made sequentially in multiple stages. Multi-stage decisions tend to make the impact of risk aversion less profound because taking account of unfolding weather information is risk reducing. Ignoring the risk-reducing impact of sequential decision-making will over-estimate the cost of water restrictions. Caution is hence necessary when formulating agricultural water-allocation policies based on crop water optimisation models that overlook the complex nature of irrigation decisions.",

    "abstract": "This paper quality adjusts machinery inputs for South African agriculture. It does this by treating different qualities of machinery as separate inputs. Thus, quality adjustment becomes quantity adjustment when there is sufficient disaggregation. This matters because many mechanical and chemical inputs have been transformed by technological progress. If this is not taken into account, the inputs are under-counted and total factor productivity (TFP) calculations are not accurate. Gandidzanwa and Liebenberg (2016) estimated the proportion machinery to implements and used this series to scale up the tractor series, instead of assuming fixed proportions. This study quality adjusts the machinery and implements input series by applying a greater level of disaggregation and by careful monitoring of model turnover. The number of models monitored was increased tenfold. Removing tractor improvements resulted in a price index that grew more slowly than the official index. Thus, the tractor stock value series is deflated less and by 2015 was 53% larger than in the official figures. The service flow entering the TFP calculations will be similarly increased, so there is less residual to be attributed to TFP growth. If all the inputs were equally undercounted, the TFP estimate would be double its true value.",

In order to do this, the aggregate distortion estimates were first updated to account for the past decade, and then the wheat value chain was disaggregated for the marketing years starting in October 2000 and ending in September 2014. The results highlight how aggregate distortion estimates as developed by Anderson et al. (2006) and calculated by Kirsten, Edwards, and Vink (2009) for South African agriculture in essence mask the inter agent distortion differences in a vertical value chain. The focus in this article is on the measurement of the disaggregated distortions, while further research on the structure of the industry (its competitiveness at all levels of the value chain) and the role of the exchange rate is required to increase our understanding of the real incentives that confront these agents.",

The study found that initially, 47% of the respondents claimed to know what Listeriosis is. Data validation, and a WTP experiment, however, suggest that there is social acceptability response bias. The proportional odds model further showed that education level is significant in explaining the level of food safety knowledge, but income is not. These results serve as an approximation of the degree of information asymmetry between low-income, urban food consumers and the South African government.",

Of 450 respondents to a voluntary survey, distinctly different groups of producers emerged concerning their longer-term strategic planning and how they experience and absorb current threats and challenges. Unsupervised learning on the dataset is imposed using a cluster analysis to explore the commonalities and the underlying factors why producers would expect to exit or not. Factors that we hypothesised might play a role included a producer's age and financial position, rural safety concerns, labor problems, industry-related problems, and opportunities for off-farm earnings. The factors the potentially exiting producers had in common were financial difficulty, which was uncorrelated to turnover, problems with access to dependable labor, uncertainty regarding land reform policy, and rural safety concerns. Intention to retire also played a role, although to a lesser extent. It is more often a combination of factors, rather than a single factor, that makes a producer more likely to decide to quit and sell in the future. With the exclusion of farm safety concerns and labor problems, the identified factors in this study are in step with those found internationally.",

The current study measured household resilience in the fisheries sector. We collected primary data from 405 respondents. We used TANGO International's resilience capacity indices (RCI) and concentration indices (CI) to measure resilience and assess the inequality in the household resilience among fish value chain actors, respectively. Our findings show that the lowest average resilience capacities index (RCI = 31.14; p < 0.001) was among households in the lowest income quintile, and the highest resilience capacities index (RCI = 59.74; p <0.001) among the highest wealth category. Regarding inequality in resilience, an overall positive concentration index (CI = 0.12; p <0.001) was found. This means that wealthier households are likely to be more resilient than less wealthy households. In terms of policy, the government may consider extending the urban COVID-19 cash transfers to poor households in fishing communities.",

    "abstract": "High feed costs are always top of the list of factors affecting business performance for any poultry producer in South Africa. Producers may react to a significant increase in the price of a variable input, such as feed costs, by reducing production. This study evaluates the impact of feed costs on the supply of eggs in South Africa from 1970 to 2009 by estimating simultaneous equations for the demand and supply of eggs, since the decisions of suppliers interact simultaneously with the decisions of consumers. It was found that fluctuations in supply of eggs were not primarily due to changes in feed costs. Since eggs have few close substitutes and their demand is price inelastic, higher prices of eggs did not significantly influence the demand and supply of eggs. However, the supply of eggs in South Africa in the period 1970 to 2009 was heavily driven by the increasing demand for eggs rather than feed costs. Population growth and rising levels of disposable income resulting from improved job opportunities associated with economic growth, factors such as affirmative action and employment equity policies, created an ever increasing demand for eggs that led to the increase in supply of eggs in South Africa during the period 1970 to 2009.",

For some, the competition law remedies and in particular the discount remedy that was adopted, following confirmation by the Competition Tribunal, constitutes a key measure of “success” for the case(s). This paper evaluates this claim by examining the design and effectiveness of the discount remedy, from a comparative perspective. We find that the period before, during and after the Pioneer Foods discount remedy, was characterised by increasing wheat prices. The discount remedy induced responses from Pioneer Foods’ main competitors resulting in even wider gains for consumers than Pioneer Foods’ own price reduction commitment.Keywords: cartelsfinesdiscount remediesJEL codes: L13L40L41L66",

    "abstract": "Agricultural economists have continuously raised questions about their role in the wider economy and society since the discipline's establishment. This led to continuous reinvention, development and stretching of the discipline's boundaries. We have seen the same critique by scholars in other disciplines; many of these evolved to thrive or regressed to die. This begs the question, is the agricultural economics discipline evolving and adapting to change or regressing and facing extinction? To answer this evolutionary question, I use the three key pillars that make up the hereditary material of a discipline as a conceptual framework: research, teaching and association. I use several data sets to diagnose the health of each of these pillars to ultimately comment on the health of the discipline. Our findings indicate the weakest pillar as the association. Although our research and teaching pillars are not as strong as we want them to be, we are in the process of reinforcement. In conclusion, the agricultural economics discipline is not in crisis, at least not yet. I also acknowledge that the emergence of crisis does not always lead to the end of a discipline, but it promotes educational reflection and reform to lead to disciplinary evolution.",

The location of agriculture also has substantial logistic, policy and market performance implications. To facilitate analysis of the spatial dynamics of agriculture, we developed a collection of new ADM 2 boundary files whose geographical dimensions and naming standards map directly to the 18 agricultural censuses that report farm inputs, outputs and related statistics for South African agriculture over the period 1918–2017. The statistical aggregates – representing Magisterial and Municipal Districts –, changed in number, area size and boundaries over time. Cross-referencing these changing statistical aggregates to our newly digitised census boundaries, is an essential step for any geospatial assessment of the causes and (productivity and environmental) consequences associated with the changing physical footprint of South African agriculture over the past century.",

In addition, it also considers what factors are restricting the acceleration of this rate of exit from a land-supply perspective with respect to barriers to exit. The prospect of structural change from such acceleration is also explored using three scenarios. An agent-based mathematical model is used to implement the three scenarios. This model is constructed from a dataset of 450 commercial producers across South Africa. The results suggest that a reasonable amount of arable land could be available for redistribution, with only modest structural change regarding animal production, despite drastic alterations in veld. These results provide some guidelines on how assistance for struggling producers can make land available for efficient producers, which could make the sector stronger. All potential exiting commercial producers have common reasons for doing so, which could be used to initiate a positively inclined, structured discussion on land supply.KEYWORDS: Barriers to exitagent-based modellingstructural changeproduction outputcommercial agricultureJEL CODES: Q12Q15 AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Stefan Mann, Gabriele Mack and Jan C Greyling for their comments in previous draft of the paper.

Privatisation, however, is but one instrument towards rural restructuring and land reform. Farming is essentially a private sector action. Ownership of assets and the right to decision-making are vital elements for successful farming. The choice of farming model will therefore be important.

    "abstract": "Abstract In many African countries, a high proportion of the population resides in the rural areas and derives their incomes mainly from agriculture. This notwithstanding, there is a growing evidence that incomes from nonfarm employment sources are increasingly becoming important among the rural population. Using Botswana's rural household survey data, this paper examines the relative contributions and implications of agriculture and nonfarm employment to rural household incomes. Contrary to the popular held view that most rural households derive their income mainly from agriculture, the findings of this analysis clearly indicate that nonfarm employment is the dominant source of income in the study area. It accounted for 53% of the average total farm-household income of P4787 (1USS = P2.49). Remittances alone contributed a substantial share of 37% and constitute an important source of income for most households in the area. On average, 40% of each household's labour force were migrant workers. As regards employment in the area, agriculture employed more than 88% of the active labour force in the villages. The relatively low contribution (47%) from agriculture implies that the potential for savings, investment and development of entrepreneur skills among most people in the area is limited. This situation is likely to encourage rapid rural-urban migration of a considerable proportion of the youth in the area. It suggested that development strategy of Botswana government should concentrate on sustainable agricultural growth and establishment of rural enterprises to increase both income and employment sharer of agriculture and non-agricultural activities, respectively, as well as rural entrepreneurship",

Export demand was influenced by the world price (real) of yellow maize and lagged exports. Export supply was explained by the lagged domestic producer price, lagged exports and random shocks in supply. The price elasticity of export demand estimated directly from the model was high (-37.90), but lower than that estimated by Johnson's indirect method (-181.30). Export supply in the short- and long-run was price inelastic and relatively more responsive to supply shocks. These results support a priori expectations that local yellow maize producers are price takers on the world market and that export supply reacts sluggishly to changes in the lagged producer price of yellow maize. Climatic variation was the major determinant of export supply. Implications for future yellow maize export supply of potential world trade liberalisation and niche marketing are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The concept of the Farmer Support Programme (FSP) is one of serving and supporting all small farmers, including part time farmers, so that they can be more efficient in competing in agricultural resource markets and gain better control over their own destiny. Using the preliminary results from the DBSA's evaluation reports of the FSP's in Venda, Lebowa, KaNgwane and Kwazulu, this paper shows the possible effects the FSP strategy have of farmers farming on small farm size of between 1 and four hectares. This is done by comparing farmers using the FSP services and those who do not. The paper concludes that the FSP strategy has positive effects on farmers operating on small areas of 1 hectare or less, but these effects can be increased by ensuring farmers' access to more secure arable land. In addition, improved marketing structures, favourable price policies and institutional change are important requisites. It is also argued that the FSP is not a deliberate strategy to perpetuate black farmers as the FSP contributed significantly to the economic well-being of the small farmers. However, certain policies will have to be reviewed to increase access to improve all other services. Finally it would appear that presently and even in the post-apartheid South Africa the sustainability of the FSPs will depend on land reform and institutional change, price policies and improved marketing systems.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY This paper explores some of the policy and institutional choices to which the agricultural economics profession has most to contribute over the coming few years. The starting point of the paper is that policy needs to address aims of both efficiency and greater diversity within the sector, diversity being seen broadly as involving a wider range of participants in terms of ethnicity, gender, and aims and resources, as well as large, medium and small producing and service enterprises. The policy agenda is defined (section II) in terms of three linked elements: the analysis and choice of policy and defining a strategic vision; the reform of institutions and organisations; and public expenditure management. In all of these, the paper suggests there is an active role for economists. Policy analysis is discussed in section III. No single definition is found which adequately captures the complex of activities involved. The relationship between political and technical dimensions of policy analysis is discussed, and the view expressed that there has in recent years been an unusually wide scope for policy reform in agriculture in South Africa but that this may inevitably reduce in the future. Considerable progress has been made in defining policy to promote efficiency and growth; less progress has been made with defining policy for achieving greater equity. A challenge for policy analysis is to combine (a) a holistic approach to understanding the problems and to linking the sector upwards to the macro-economy and horizontally to other sectors, with (b) identifying practicable means of implementation. The shortcomings of the information base for policy choices are discussed, as is the role of economists in addressing them, but the problem with inadequate information is often as much on the demand side as on the supply side. This is followed by a brief discussion of the growing use of participatory processes in policy analysis in increasingly open societies. Section IV distinguishes institutions in the sense of the rules of the game from institutions as organisations, noting that the South African government has a range of instruments under both of these categories for implementing policy in agriculture. There exist institutional economies of scale which mean that a more active state role is necessary to promote medium and small-scale farming than to promote commercial farming. However, interventions need to be selective and strategic and to avoid the many past pitfalls. The paper suggests that the New Public Management may have much to offer as an approach to institutional reform in rural and agricultural development, but that it is no overall solution, and government is still faced with large tasks of ensuring that it builds up the capacity to manage its role. The importance of private sector capabilities if these approaches are to be successful is noted. The paper briefly discusses decentralisation, community support and the roles and limitations of civil society organisations as a part of new approaches to supporting rural and agricultural development. While all of these will have a part to play, a realistic view needs to be taken of the likely pace of progress. The paper discusses the types of policy analysis skills required, whether inside or outside of government, to allow government to play a more selective and strategic role. The paper suggests there is a good deal of scope for government to contract outside organisations to undertake a range of policy analysis, but the need for a critical minimum mass inside government remains. Section V discusses the third element of the policy agenda, public expenditure management. This may to be addressed at three levels: contributing to budget discipline at the macro-economic level, and to a rational inter-sector allocation of resources; allocative efficiency within the sector to ensure maximum effectiveness in achieving goals for agricultural development; and technical efficiency in the way funds are spent, to ensure maximum value for money. Economic analysis has a great deal to offer in ensuring these three levels are addressed effectively, principally through applying market failure analysis and measuring the cost-effectiveness of measures designed to achieve political and social objectives. The paper suggests that the failure of departments of agriculture in many countries to measure outcomes, and inputs and outputs, and therefore to be able to demonstrate value for money, has contributed to the decline in their budget share. Section VI applies the three perspectives developed above to a set of measures designed to support growth and equity in agriculture. The importance of the enabling framework at the level of the macro-economy and the legal system, among others, is noted, together with the importance of agricultural economists undertaking analysis at this level to identify distortions which will affect sectoral performance, and to be prepared to engage with ministries of finance and of trade. Several ‘inclusive measures’ are discussed, which constitute the bulk of the agenda of sector departments, including: • rural infrastructure; • the knowledge system (primarily extension and research); and • output markets The importance of measures which are targeted on political and social objectives, such as land reform, basic social and economic services, and community support, is noted. The sobering experience in sub-Saharan Africa with attempts to target rural financial services on groups who had formerly been neglected by the formal banking sector is discussed. Finally, section VII draws out several broad conclusions, and identifies some priority elements of an agenda for agricultural economists in contributing to agricultural policy in South Africa.",

Production models run on an annual basis, whereas trade models run on a monthly basis to capture seasonality of fresh orange markets. This model compares a base scenario with a scenario of the Free Trade Agreement between South Africa and the European Union. Results indicate that the Free Trade Agreement has minor positive effects on the South African fresh orange industry. The difference in gross margins in 2011 is predicted to be approximately two percent. This is lower than the tariff cut in the months June until September because of no benefits on the local market and in other months on the European Union market.",

    "abstract": "The agricultural sector in Uganda has for long been characterised by a clear dichotomy between the rural cash economy (dominated by coffee, cofton and tobacco production) and the subsistence economy (production of staple foods such as millet, sweet potatoes, maize, bananas, cassava and beans). The on-going transformation of the rural economy to a cash economy has resulted in staple food crop, in addition to meeting the subsistence food needs, becoming important cash crops and sources of income for rural households. The growing use of food crops for cash has led to a concern that it is contributing to the increasing signs of food shortages in rural households. This paper uses cluster analysis to determine whether this is the case and how commercialisation relates with other food security determinants like production levels and non-farm income. The highly commercialised households are found to be comparatively less food secure.",

The aim was to sensitise decision-makers to probable trends in those factors that will shape cargo space availability. The main finding was that the supply of airfreight to South African producers is aggravated by the unbalanced availability of cargo space on southbound and northbound trips originating from Cape Town. If the price and quantity of cargo space were determined by supply and demand, an imbalance couldn't arise in a perfect market, as prices would balance cargo space supplied and demanded. However, airfreight tariffs are rigid per weight level. The result is that items with a higher mass per volume unit represent a higher income per palette, and are therefore preferred by export agents. This finding has implications for future growth in the industry.",

The problem of food insecurity in the countries of the region is, however, intricately linked to the wider problem of poverty and the main source of both of these problems is rural stagnation. This paper analyzes the critical linkages between food insecurity and rural stagnation in Southern Africa. Strategies and options for incorporating rural Southern Africans into a self-sustaining process of economic growth are examined with an emphasis on promoting rural employment and incomes. These include leveraging farm/non-farm growth linkages for maximum rural employment; promoting agriculture-based income diversification; and strengthening the linkages between the rural and industrial sectors. A number of strategic and tactical preconditions that must be met to ensure success and sustainability are also addressed in the paper, including: the need for an integrated approach in tackling the nexus linking poverty, food insecurity and environmental degradation; empowering rural people and rural communities; increasing security of tenure; facilitating the role played by women; and creating the right policy enabling environment.",

    "abstract": "The political transition of South Africa coincided with considerable change in the agricultural policy environment. Although considerable attention has been given to these changes at a national level, the provincial, or second tier of government, attracted very little attention up to date. The objective of this paper is to investigate the reasons behind the subtle but significant differences between the agricultural and political interface in South Africa's nine provinces. It is shown that the relationship between the agricultural appropriation and the net farm income in the provinces cannot be explained by the pressure group approach. As this approach is predominantly used in South African agricultural economics literature on the relationship between politicians and the agricultural sector, this is a significant finding. A weak correlation was found with variables such as employment, net farm income, capital intensity and agriculture's slime of gross geographic product. Variables that show a strong correlation include the rural to urban income gap, the number of farms as a percentage of economically active population (underscoring the significance of labour-ownership versus land-ownership) and expenditure on food as a percentage of household expenditure. These findings indicates that a new framework needs to be explored.",

This paper provides a framework for integrating environmental values into macroeconomic policy-making in South Africa. This is done by focusing on 1) the different theories on the linkage between the economy and the environment, 2) conceptualising the input of environmental values in the macroeconomic policy arena and 3) making recommendations for incorporating environmental factors into South African macroeconomic policy.",

The estimated returns from these schemes are higher than the returns from aggregate livestock research, which provides some information for decisions on research funding allocations.

There was no long-run relationship between white maize futures and spot prices for 1997, but there is evidence of a long-run relationship between these price series in 1998. Furthermore, the 1998 futures price was an unbiased predictor of future spot prices for both the annual and three-month contract.

    "abstract": "This study found that a water market emerged within the Lower Orange River for river water rights. The market emergence is attributed to the scarcity of water in this region and the demonstrated demand by farmers for a change in the allocation of these rights. Transfers were facilitated by authorisation of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry permitting transfers of water rights, and the enabling environment defined by the regional Water Affairs office. Improving water trade could be achieved by the delegation of authority to the regional Department of Water Affairs to approve transfers, extending support to market transfers of canal water, and ensuring that water extraction is closely monitored as river water use increases in future. A discriminant analysis indicated that water rights transferred from farmers with potential to irrigate wine grapes, raisin grapes, and field crops to farmers with potential to irrigate table grapes, representing the highest valued use of the water. Farmers stated that the proposed new Water Law created much uncertainty about their water rights, stifling water market activity, and that it will lead to underinvestment in irrigated agriculture. Overcoming such institutional and legal barriers for market performance will require that water use allocations be specified for reasonable periods, be inherently secure, and water trading be permitted through the relevant legislatures.",

If water marketing is to achieve its full potential, markets must be designed to minimise these costs. A water allocation model was used to determine the effect of transaction costs on trade. The model includes whole farm non-linear programming models embedded in a spatial equilibrium framework to simulate a water demand function for agriculture in the Berg River as well as demand functions for urban water users in the larger Cape Town region. Positive mathematical programming (PMP) is included to calibrate the regional model to the exact observed base year resource use. The results clearly demonstrate the negative impact of high transaction costs on water trade.",

Estimated price elasticities of supply and demand enable the model to project equilibrium consumption and price until 2020. The model incorporates as growth parameters: income growth, population growth and income elasticity of demand. It also allows for income elasticities to decline as incomes rise. Assuming a 3% annual growth in supply, the model forecasts that real price for protein meal will remain relatively constant to 2020. However, if supply increases linearly price is forecast to increase 22% by 2020.

An earlier survey showed that most rural households in KruaZulu-Natal purchased staple foodstuffs in large towns. This study uses New Institutional Economics, and especially the transaction cost model, to examine household decisions relating to sources of purchased food. In both study areas, the results show that the vast majority of respondents engage in both personal and impersonal transactions, and that between 30 and 40 per cent of respondents still purchase staple foodstuffs from neighbours. Most sample households purchased food in towns where they operated a formal bank account. Outlets without banking facilities and supermarkets were avoided. These findings contradict the importance attached by some households in these areas to the role of informal constraints in rural household purchasing decisions.",

    "abstract": "The deregulation of the single channel marketing system for wheat poses new challenges to producers and advisors in the Western Cape Province. This deregulation is simultaneous with a number of other changes in the socio-political, economic, marketing and technological environments. In facing these challenges it is necessary to incorporate such diverse trends as globalisation and individualisation within a single framework. In the first part of this paper the development of a model, combining spatial data, resource attributes, crop characteristics and financial/economic data in an interactive model is described. This is followed in the second part by the evaluation of the impact of certain macro-economic variables on farm-level enterprises. This is done with the aid of six scenarios. It was found that, under certain specific conditions (i.e. low international wheat price, zero tariff protection and 40 percent of production being exported), wheat production in the Western Cape is unprofitable. However, if an import tariff on wheat of 30 percent (fob, ad valorem) is introduced and the marketing mix is changed to only 20 percent of local production being exported, then ceteris paribus, wheat can be profitably produced on 68 percent of the area. This allows the opportunity for structural adjustments and cost reducing practices. If the cost of production is lowered by 20 percent and the import tariff removed, then, ceteris paribus, wheat can be profitably produced on 59 percent of the area. Even more important than the results from the scenarios is the fact that a methodology was developed through which the impact of macro-economic variables on farm level profitability can be investigated. As this methodology allows for the identification of specific areas or farms that will be adversely affected, specific remedial measures can be implemented. This methodology will be an important tool in the hands of decision-makers.",

The objective of such an index is to determine the business confidence of agribusinesses as accurately as possible. Some 80 agribusinesses in South Africa are at present participating in the AGRIBUSINESS CONFIDENCE INDEX. For the first quarter of 2002 the index points to a 20% improvement in the business confidence of South African agribusinesses compared to the same period the year before, while in the second quarter the index was up 14% on the previous year. This increase in confidence goes hand in hand with some other positive trends in the agricultural sector of South Africa regarding competitiveness and investment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent research suggests that an Income Equalisation Deposit (IED) scheme could be a feasible new risk management tool for commercial farmers in South Africa. This prompted a study of practicing consultants' (tax experts) views on determining what types of farmers would be likely to use the scheme. During 2000, a postal survey of 24 consultants was conducted mainly in KwaZulu-Natal, and in the Maize Triangle and surrounding areas. Each consultant was to review nine scenarios (eight plus a control, giving 192 observations) and decide whether they would recommend an IED scheme for each scenario. A statistical experimental design was used to structure the scenarios, allowing for main and interaction effects between variables that could influence the potential use of an IED scheme. Discriminant analysis revealed that, ceteris paribus, farmers with higher annual net farm incomes (>R300,000), lower debt/asset ratios (<15%), more variable net farm incomes, and less off-farm income would most likely use an IED scheme. In terms of ranking, ceteris paribus, high risk maize farmers, intermediate risk maize farmers and high risk livestock farmers are more likely to use an IED scheme than are low risk maize farmers, low and intermediate risk livestock farmers and diversified farmers. These results support the use of an IED scheme as a risk management tool as higher risk farmers are more likely to make use of the scheme.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The concept of capacity-sharing (as a specific type of demand-orientated water management strategy) is a relatively newcomer on the South African water management regime and much debate is currently under way regarding the viability of the concept for the South African context. One of the main features is that it decentralises and integrates water management to a much greater degree than state-dominated management regimes. However, as the concept of capacity-sharing allows a greater degree of decision-making autonomy to the private decision-maker, the question could be asked to what extent the management of a capacity-sharing regime would be exposed to opportunistic behaviour from private irrigators. If it is heavily exposed, there are considerable scope for opportunistic decision-making behaviour under private decision-makers and therefore problems of moral hazard/adverse selection and rent seeking could present itself. Therefore, the question arises what safety features do capacity sharing present to confine possible opportunistic decision-making practices. This article discusses two areas within a capacity-sharing regime that are likely to be exposed to opportunistic decision-making behaviour. Possible safety-features from capacity sharing to account for this type of behaviour are identified and discussed briefly. This article concludes with the notion that capacity sharing does feature some properties that could minimise opportunistic behaviour from private decision-makers.",

Amongthe problematic usages that have been identified are fundamental misunderstandings about the influence of sample design and size on statistical significance, an excessive focus on statistical significance to the exclusion of economic and policy significance, and a harmful conflation of these two very different types of significance. An analysis of 51 agricultural economics papers reviewed and presented at an African conference in 2010 finds improper usage of statistical significance that is comparable or worse in nature and extent to that found in a previous meta analysis focusing on published articles in the American Economic Review in the 1980s and 1990s: well over half of the papers employed what is termed “sign” and “asterisks” econometrics. Overall, the findings underline the need for clearly stated and consistent analytical methods in producing papers as well as for careful review and selection of papers that employ regression analysis.",

Price leadership was found in beef. All meat prices, excepting beef, take more than a month to adapt fully to changed market conditions. It can therefore be deduced that the meat market as a whole functions in a poor form of effectivity. The total adaptation time in respect of pork, mutton and fish prices is twelve, eight and twelve weeks, respectively. It appears that beef prices lead poultry prices, but that poultry prices follow shortly after. The whole effect takes twelve weeks to filter through. It appears, however, that poultry prices have effectively succeeded in moving closely with beef prices.",

Adaptation regression lines of cultivars were used to determine economic optimum fertilisation levels for different maize cultivars at different locations. The conditions for such determinations are that the reaction of at least one cultivar on fertiliser must be known, and that the relationships between yields of different cultivars must be available. The variances between observed and predicted cultivar yields are relatively small. The proposed method should thus be satisfactory for the prediction of yields.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the past fifty years, the controlled marketing system in South Africa created inflexible marketing structures. These structures inhibited growth in the demand for agricultural products, increased the farmers' exposure to risks, limited private enterprise and effectively reduced competition in agricultural marketing. Contrary to the objective of the Marketing Act to reduce marketing risk for the farmer, it actually rendered the trade effective protection. Proponents of controlled agricultural marketing wrongly believed and are still believing that to limit effective competition in agricultural markets by restricting the number of traders and controlling the whole distribution channel, farmers as well as the consumers would gain from such systems. A study of concentration in the marketing structure of red meat showed that the red meat industry is virtually controlled by only three organizations. Excessive horizontal as well as vertical concentration exist and were effectively created, promoted and maintained by the red meat scheme. Oligopolistic and oligopsonistic structures were found throughout the red meat marketing system and market shares of 40 per cent plus, for the largest organizations are not uncommon. Market sharing in the form of joint ventures, supply control and restrictive registration limited competition while exemptions to Class 2 and Class 3 abattoirs strengthened the oligopolistic-oligopsonistic market structures. The lack of competition may affect deregulation of the red meat industry and normalising private enterprise due to the barriers of entry created by the concentrated structure of the marketing system. Uittreksel Die beheerde bemarkingsstelsel in Suid Afrika het, gedurende die afgelope 50 jaar, onplooibare markstrukture geskap. Die strukture het groei in die vraag na landbou produkte beperk, produsente blootstelling aan risiko's vergroot, private inisiatief aan bande gelê en mededinging in landbou bemarking effektief uitgeskakel. In teenstelling met die Bemarkingswet se doelwit van risiko-vermindering vir die produsent, bied dit egter effektiewe beskerming aan die handel. Voorstanders van beheerde landbou bemarking het verkeerdelik geglo en glo nog steeds dat die uitskakeling van mededinging in landbou-markte, deur totale beheer van die distribusiekanaal en beperking van die getalle middelmanne, die produsent sowel as die verbruiker sal bevoordeel, 'n Studie van konsentrasie in die bemarkings-struktuur van rooivleis toon aan dat die hele bedryf feitlik deur slegs drie firmas beheer word. 'n Hoë mate van horisontale sowel as vertikale konsentrasie kom voor, wat effektief deur die rooivleis bemarkingsskema geskep, bevorder en onderhou word. Oligopolistiese en oligopsonistiese strukture is regdeur die bemarkingsstelsel gevind, en markaandele van 40 persent en hoër is nie ongewoon vir die grootste firma nie. Markdeling in die vorm van gesamentlike ondernemings, toevoerbeheer en beperkende registrasie beperk mededinging, terwyl die toegewings aan Klas 2 en Klas 3 abattoirs hierdie markstrukture versterk. Die gebrek aan mededinging mag die deregulasieproses en normalisering van private inisiatief beinvloed weens toetrede beperkinge wat deur die gekonsentreerde markstrukture geskep is.",

This can lead to selection of ill-adapted cultivars. Stochastic dominance and MOTAD take both the expected value and variance into consideration.

Five selected strategies (aid measures) were evaluated according to certain criteria in a simulation model. The results proved that there are relative advantages to the various strategies in terms of the liquidity and solvency of the farm business. Only a few strategies succeeded in bringing about a significant improvement in the financial position of the firm. The success of financial aid measures depends heavily on the addressing of external problems such as inflation and interest rates. Other assistance, of a non-financial nature, should also be made available.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The South African grain-producing regions have suffered severe fluctuation as regard national yields, resulting in measures being taken in respect of certain cereals to bring the supply in line with the national demand. The Swartland is one of the more stable wheat producing regions and the drastic cut in wheat prices during the 1988/89 season caused large-scale dissatisfaction amongst the producers, which in turn led to an investigation into restructuring possibilities in the Swartland. The point of departure was the creation of a representative farming model for the Middle Swartland subregion. Information was gathered by means of postal questionnaires. The dynamic linear programming technique was applied to this model over a twelve year period. The risk factor was then incorporated by applying the Target MOTAD programming technique to the model. A single cash injection of R130 per hectare was necessary to get the DLP model to function successfully. In the DLP model the solution stabilised after a five year period, while the risk model stabilised after eight years. Different cropping and livestock patterns were derived from the models. The general conclusion is that the restructuring of farmina patterns in the Swartland has definite potential.",

Supply, demand and production risk, including interactions with production substitutes, are considered. The model is tested by imposing all of the policies which were in operation at that time to see if it adequately simulates the prevailing situation. The model is used to evaluate the possible structural effects of subsidising farmers to change over land under cash crop production to pastures for beef, taking into account the inter-relationships in grain markets in Southern Africa. These effects are evaluated under different marketing policies with regard to changes in land use, prices, labour requirements and producer and consumer welfare. The main conclusion reached from this analysis is that by reforming or helping some industry or group of producers, its problems are merely transferred to other industries or producers owing to the inter-relationships in agriculture and the economy. It emphasises the need for an overall policy plan.",

The better manager will have the larger farm over the long run. The above principle was empirically tested in the Vaalharts Irrigation area by means of cross sectional regression equations with gross income as dependent variable. The result confirms the following: i) If management is ignored, constant returns to size is encountered; and ii) when managerial quality is however included in the model as independent variable, increasing returns to scale is found. This result thus supports the theory and a general conclusion is that optimal farm size is a function of management.",

In the mutton/goat equation, beef is a substitute to mutton/goat while pork and chicken are complements to it. Both the beef and the mutton/goat equations indicated an income elasticity of more than one. High income elasticities for these two types of meat perhaps indicate that if improvements can be made in both production and marketing, more of these meat types would be consumed at every increase in income.

Supply response to price incentives is inelastic as the potential gains to farmers are limited by small farm sizes. A land rental market could improve efficiency in farming and also has equity advantages. Institutional changes are needed to encourage land rental. Overstocking occurs primarily because grazing land is a common property resource. Unlike most solutions to overstocking (e.g., cattle taxes and quotas), privatisation of grazing land would also improve the incentive to upgrade herd and pasture quality. It is recommended that private access to grazing be encouraged in areas where it is more acceptable to households.",

Public regulation and public enterprise brought in their wake gross inefficiency and inequity. Public enterprise could not maintain production efficiency. This, together with increasing regulation, created an ever-increasing burden of social services, monopolies, increased taxation, deficit budgeting and inflation. Governments and the public became increasingly unable to carry these burdens. This led to policies of deregulation and privatisation with improved effectiveness, efficiency and public finance as motives. Competition is vital to efficiency. Privatisation takes on different forms, depending on what is privatised and to what extent: provision or production. Persistence or formation of monopolies, changed objectives, staff and management problems and accountability present distinct pitfalls with deregulation and privatisation. These pitfalls must be overcome and avoided. Diversity and dualism in South African food needs and agricultural production imply too much needed diversity in products and market structures for a regulated environment. Deregulation and privatisation are needed.",

The high level of concentration and intra-regional trade is mainly a result of trade agreements such as Lome. This has led to greater inequality with respect to beef trade. Beef producers in the SACU are vulnerable to changes in EU trade policy. Trade relations between South Africa and Namibia are intense, but not between South Africa and Botswana. Botswana prefers to trade with the rest of the world and specifically the EU. Beef trade with the rest of the world is becoming more important for South Africa, and this must be disturbing to Namibian beef producers.

Twenty per cent of farmers surveyed have adopted both practices, however, forty-nine per cent have adopted neither. A chi-square test shows a strong association between the two practices, implying that a farmer who tests soils on his farm is also likely to use fertilizer. Results support expectations that farmers who adopt more recommended technologies and farming practices are more productive and more efficient producers of coffee. A discriminant analysis identified land fragmentation, availability of wealth and liquidity, and education of the principal farm decision-maker as the most important factors influencing the adoption of recommended and appropriate farming practices on coffee farms, followed by gender of farm operator, and farm information acquired by farmers. Transformation of Rwandan coffee farming requires policies that (a) remove obstacles to the development of an efficient land market in order to reduce land fragmentation and to transfer land to more efficient farmers; and (b) improve rural education and liquidity, and reduce gender discrimination in order to improve farmers' abilities and promote adoption of recommended farming practices.",

In hierdie situasie ontstaan die probleem om te bepaal in watter volgorde gewasse 'n optimale opbrengs sal lewer. Die probleem kan met behulp van lineAare programmering (LP) opgelos word. Deur van die duale probleem gebruik te maak, kan die primale probleem baie vereenvoudig word. Die oplossings van die vereenvoudigde probleem gee aanleiding tot die formulering van strategieA«. Hierdie formulering vereenvoudig die probleem nog verder tot 'n LP met net een beperking (die rugsakprobleem), wat dit moontlik maak om dit vir 'n klein aantal gewasse met die hand op te los. Hierdie strategieA« kan ook gebruik word om die probleem met behulp van speleteorie op te los. Die formulering volgens speleteorie kan gebruik word om ander vertakkings op die plaas in berekening te bring.\nDifferent types of crops are planted in winter grain regions. These crops can be planted in even more combinations. Crops that are planted on the same land in successive years do influence one another. In this situation the problem of which sequence of crops to plant arises. If appropriate assumptions are made, this problem can be solved with linear programming (LP). The complexity of this problem, however, increases dramatically with an increase in the number of crops as well as the number of years considered. Another problem with this formulation is how to choose the boundary conditions. Furthermore the solution to this problem is degenerate. In practice it is found that farmers prefer a cycle of crops in a rotary crop system, because it simplifies the management of the system. If the assumption is made that a farmer uses a cycle of at most three years, the problem of the boundary conditions is solved. If the dual formulation of this problem is considered it is evident that the problem has a specific structure. The structure of the problem as well as the fact that the solution to the problem is highly degenerate can be exploited to simplify the solution of the problem substantially. If the correct selection of solutions from this degenerate dual problem is chosen this selection can be used to formulate a simplified model in terms of strategies for the farmer. If the problem is formulated in terms of these strategies, the problem is further reduced to an LP with one constraint (the knapsack problem), which makes it possible to solve this problem by hand for a relative large number of crops in the rotary crop system. These strategies can also be used to solve a more generalised problem. Consider nature to be a player in Game Theory. The strategies of nature can be defined in many ways. The amount of rain per annum, for example, could be strategies used by nature to play a game against the farmer. The farmer in return can then use his strategies and the knowledge of Game Theory to maximise his profit. The problem can be generalised further if it is formulated in terms of Game Theory. In this generalisation the Game Theory model is expanded to incorporate a number of different situations with the use of extra constraints. The first of these situations is to incorporate other enterprises with the rotary crop system. The farmer could, for instance want the solution to contain at least a certain amount of feed for his cattle. The second situation is when the farmer has knowledge of the weather patterns, which implies for the Game Theory model that the farmer has knowledge of his opponent's strategies. Both these situations are incorporated in the model. Finally, a case study is presented in which the use of the model is demonstrated. Relevant data from the Swartland region are used. A dry year, an average year and a wet year were used as strategies for nature. The solutions drawn from these data were confirmed with a farmer from the region, who agreed that the solutions appear to be reasonable if it is compared to what is found in practice. The most frequently chosen strategies were the ones that contain wheat and clover. The solutions indicate that a farmer should plant less clover and more grain if it is a dry year, whilst it is better to increase the amount of clover planted if the rainfall is higher.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The research was conducted for a representative 50 ha farm in the Onderberg region in Mpumalanga province, where farmers use a combination of centre-pivot, drip, and dragline systems of different sizes to grow sugarcane. The main intention was to establish a multi-period linear programming model capable of economically evaluating a farm's expansion decision-making process for farmers faced with investment decisions in alternative irrigation systems, taking into account the available initial capital of the farm. A linear programming (LP) model was used to assign a mainline for a total of twelve irrigation system combinations based on the assumption that the farmer wishes to start with a 30 ha centre-pivot investment. The Generalized Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) was used to formulate the farm growth model as mixed integer dynamic linear programming (MIDLP)for a 15-year planning horizon. Based on the results, farmers are initially forced to invest in lower-cost irrigation systems when they lack capital to start a farm business due to the time value of money. They only consider lowering operating costs by investing in capital intensive irrigation systems when they have more own capital or borrowing capacity.",

Macadamia nuts are identified as the nut product category with the highest export potential. The second aim is to select a potential target market for macadamia nuts. Based on an analysis of market attractiveness indicators, Germany is selected as the target market for South African macadamia nuts. The third aim is to develop a market profile, outlining market characteristics and requirements for entry into the German market for South African macadamia nut exporters, in order to enhance the exports of South African macadamia nuts to Germany. This is achieved by providing exporters of the product identified with the market information required to maximise exports.",

Deterministic price behaviour patterns (cycles) and rainfall cycles resulted in cyclical supply variation through a process of herd expansion/liquidation. This apparently promoted inefficient management strategies at farm level and distorted production and marketing of beef. Significant seven year supply cycles for beef were isolated and used to determine producers' supply response flexibilities to rainfall and price cycle variation. Multiple regression analysis with distributed lag models were used. Significant lagged supply responses indicate that price signals were distorted and aided the climatological inflexibilities of beef production. Nominal beef producer prices were not stabilised and the control measures, employed for this purpose, effectively reduced farmers' marketing opportunities and thereby increase their exposure to production, price, marketing and income risks. Controlled marketing of red meat failed to stabilise producer prices of beef or to promote the producers' interests.",

    "abstract": "A major role of agricultural policy is to identify policy changes that may induce technological innovation and productivity growth throughout the food system, in order to increase the living standards of people who must relate to it in one way or another. While food market reform has been subject to contentious and often emotional debate over the last decade in Africa, the debate has generally been over assumptions about how food markets work in reality as opposed to theory, and how markets actually respond to particular forms of policy change. The lack of consensus is partially due to a shortage of empirical, ground-level information linking specific policies to specific impacts. It is in this context that we draw on applied analysis in Southern Africa to make some observations on recent food market reforms and their effects on the performance of food systems in the region. The latter part of this paper considers how potential food market reform in South Africa will alter relative prices, trading incentives, and distributional consequences within the region. Particular emphasis is given to Zimbabwe and South Africa, the two largest traders of maize in the region. (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)",

In this paper various market scenarios for wheat in South Africa are simulated with the use of a regional linear programming model which incorporates negative-sloping demand functions, substitution in demand between wheat and maize, and income risk. The model is used to predict changes in product prices, production levels, location of production and welfare transfers under the different market scenarios. A free market simulation showed a distortion in production patterns of the major crops caused by the price support policy. The domestic free market equilibrium price of wheat was predicted to be about 15 per cent lower than the mean fixed price. Owing to the strong price relationship between wheat and maize there is no significant decrease in the wheat price in a free market for winter cereals only and when maize is the only crop marketed under a fixed price system. The social cost analysis showed clearly that to reduce social costs a combined marketing policy for wheat and its related industries is required.",

    "abstract": "Abstract DBSA's effort to introduce a small holder farmer support system through its funding programme was partly motivated as a response to the ineffective but costly large scale project approach in black agriculture. The aim was to construct a paradigm shift in policy thinking as well as to institute a shift in investment to provide access to support services to large numbers of small holders in homelands. It was further argued that such an approach conceptually constitutes the normalization of an agricultural support system which could provide a basis for integrating black and white agricultural services and for policy reform in South Africa. The programme approach also provided the basis to support farming within an integrated rural context. The FSP approach to agricultural development achieved the status of an important strategy for rural development in South Africa's homeland areas and it is estimated that 55 000 people are presently directly supported by 35 FSPs. Its application is characterised by a flexible “learning by doing” and “user friendly” approach. This philosophy largely explains the expansion and related changes in the implementation of FSPs. It is expected that FSPs will expand into a major development strategy in South African agriculture, especially in the rural sector in the homeland areas. Uittreksel Die Ontwikkelingsbank van Suider-Afrika se pogings om 'n doeltreffende kleinboerondersteuningsprogram daar te stel was gedeeltelik gemotiveer deur die waarneming dat grootskaalse en sentraal beheerde projekte in die tuislandgebiede relatief min voordele meebring. Kostes was hoog, gemeenskappe was nie na behore ingeskakel nie en daar was min, selfs geen, sprake van onathanklike kleinboere nie. Die kleinboerondersteuningsprogram van die Ontwikkelingsbank was dus daarop gemik om groot getalle kleinboere met dienste en hulpverlening te bedien. 'n Geïntergreerde ontwikkelingsbendadering is gevolg. Die kleinboerondersteuningsprogram het tans status as 'n belangrike landelike ontwikkelingsprogram. Ongeveer 55000 persone baat direk by 35 programme. Die Ontwikkelingsbank het veral 'n pragmatiese “leer deur ondervinding” benaderingvoorgestaan en heelwat belangrike aanpassings is sedert die instelling van kleinboerondersteuningsprogramme in 1987, reeds aangebring.",

    "abstract": "The policy analysis matrix (PAM) framework was employed to analyse the comparative economic advantage in production and explore the impact of policy distortions on agricultural competitiveness in Malawi. The study demonstrated that Malawi has strong comparative advantage in the production of tobacco, paprika, macadamia nuts, cotton, tea, phaseolous beans, groundnuts and hybrid maize. Notably, Malawi has weak comparative advantage in the production of open pollinated maize and soybeans, both produced using low input technology. Of interest though, is the fact that low input producers are more efficient users of domestic resources in the production of some major cash crops such as tobacco and paprika. The study also revealed a large disparity between net private and net social profitability. This wide gap is mainly attributed to suppressed market prices over the long years of controlled commodity pricing in Malawian agriculture. Input market prices in Malawi were found to be higher than their equivalent social prices, thus forming an indirect tax on farmers. High transportation costs due to poor road infrastructure and the sales tax imposed on inputs such as chemicals are major factors behind the high input market prices. Elimination of such bottlenecks and policy distortions, improved access to credit and modern technology research investments should contribute to improved competitiveness in agricultural production, especially among small holders given their existing potential.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper gives a profile of a sample of a small and large sugar cane farms in the North coast region of the KwaZulu-Natal sugar cane belt. The survey was conducted during May 1995. Farms studied varied between one and 600 hectares. Values for small farms were significantly lower than large farms for human capital resources, farm resource utilisation, rate of search and utilisation of farm information, and adoption of appropriate and improved cultural farm practices. Such differences may account for the differences in farm productivity between small and large farms that exist in the South African sugar industry. A linear discriminant function model shows that small and large farms studied differ significantly on lines of human resources and cost of borrowed capital (market related). The findings of the study show that large cane farms face lower market related interest rates, are relatively better equipped in human resource capital, and are in a position to implement appropriate and recommendable farm practices (soil analysis and use of certified seedcane) compared to small farmers. Hierdie studie bied 'n profiel van 'n monster van klein en groot suikerrietplase in doe Noordkusstreek van die KwaZulu-Natal suikerrietstrook. Die opname is gedurende Mei 1995 gedoen. Bestudeerde plase het tussen een en 600 hektaar gewissel. Waardes vir klein plase was aansienlik laer as vir groot plase wat betref menslikekapitaalhulpbronne, plaashulpbronbenutting, bekom en benut van plaasinligting, en aanvaarding van toepaslike en verbeterde kweekpraktyke op die plaas. Sulke verskille mag die verskil in plaasproduktiwiteit tussen klein en groot plase verklaar wat in die Siud-Afrikaanse suikerbedryfbestaan. 'n Linêre diskrimineringsmodel toon dat bestudeerde klein en groot plase aansienlik verskil wat menslikehulpbronkapitaal en die koste van geleende kapitaal (markverwante) betref. Die bevindings van die navorsing toon dat groot suikerrietplase laer markverwante rentekoerse ondervind, relatiefbeter toegerus is met menslikehulpbronkapitaal en in 'n beter posisie is om toepaslike en aanbevole landboupraktyke (grondontleding en gebriuk van gersertifiseerde saadriet) toe te pas in vergelyking met klein plasies.",

The market emergence is attributed to the scarcity of water in this region and the demonstrated demand by farmers for a change in the allocation of these rights. Transfers were facilitated by authorisation of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry permitting transfers of water rights, and the enabling environment defined by the regional Water Affairs office. Improving water trade could be achieved by the delegation of authority to the regional Department of Water Affairs to approve transfers, extending support to market transfers of canal water, and ensuring that water extraction is closely monitored as river water use increases in future. A discriminant analysis indicated that water rights transferred from farmers with potential to irrigate wine grapes, raisin grapes, and field crops to farmers with potential to irrigate table grapes, representing the highest valued use of the water. Farmers stated that the proposed new Water Law created much uncertainty about their water rights, stifling water market activity, and that it will lead to underinvestment in irrigated agriculture. Overcoming such institutional and legal barriers for market performance will require that water use allocations be specified for reasonable periods, be inherently secure, and water trading be permitted through the relevant legislatures.",

This paper uses a Gini decomposition to analyse the effects of crop, animal and non-farm income on the distribution of total income in the Communal Lands. Results show that non-farm income decreases inequality in Chiweshe, which is near Harare, and increases inequality in the remote region of Gokwe.

Techniques of Gini decomposition are used to determine the impact of income components upon measured income inequality. The marginal welfare effects of changes in different income components are also established. This approach is of interest to policy makers, enabling them to evaluate the likely outcomes of policy options designed to alleviate poor poverty and reduce income inequalities. The method is also valuable in measuring the effect of transfers into the household on welfare, whether this is a result of state provision of welfare payments or intra-family remittances.",

    "abstract": "The world has changed so dramatically in the past few years that it is worth our time to examine both how it has changed and the implications of these changes for our work as economists, our governments and their respective roles, our international institutions, and democracy itself. These changes are so profound that even a decade ago, it would have been impossible to begin a discussion which bears much resemblance to the world we are now in. Of concern is that unless we actively examine the rapidly changing nature of our world, we will be driven by change rather than helping to shape it to the needs of our cultures, societies, economies, and the evolution of our democracies. In this paper, I want to explore broadly a number of the changes in the world around us and the economic and social milieu in which we now find ourselves. For many of us involved in agriculture for some years, it is easy to see the WTO as a significant turning point, leading to increased and increasing trade among nations. What is less easy to see is the integration of the production and marketing systems across countries resulting from trade liberalisation. Similarly, the impacts of information technology may be of increasing importance to our work, but these same technologies are fundamentally reshaping the way in which democratic systems operate in the formation of policy, interest group formation and their roles in society, and the roles of traditional political processes in policy debate and resolution, at national, regional and even international levels. These are only two of the strategically significant changes we face. Following this exploration, I want to explore two broad areas of interest and concern in policy, biotechnology and rural policies, both of which appear to be deeply affected by these changing processes, and conclude with some observations about our roles as economists within our respective societies.",

However, the financial effects on the affected farmers are frequently unclear, and so are the economic effects on society as a whole. The net back method provides a framework for estimating rough values of irrigation water in situations such as those in Namibian agriculture, where farmers face a number of constraints which are difficult to model explicitly due to the dearth of reliable data. We apply the net back method to estimate the value of irrigation water used for different crop alternatives in the Hardap region in southern Namibia. We find that all the crop alternatives, which farmers in the region currently choose between, will remain financially viable after the increases in user charges which are envisaged in the near future. However, substantial shifts in agricultural production will become necessary once the long term cost recovery policies are in place in the water sector. We also extend the net back framework in order to study potential effects of further increases in water user charges, which may become necessary in future as the water demand from other water users increases.",

    "abstract": "In an effort to increase agricultural production, promote regional specialization and stabilize domestic food prices, the Tanzanian government has implemented several market-enhancing policies. The success of these measures depends, among other factors, on the cointegration and degree of price transmission across spatial markets. This study uses the vector autoregressive procedure of the Toda-Yamamoto causality test, dynamic ordinary least squares cointegration tests, and the asymmetric error correction model to examine the performance of Tanzania's domestic wholesale rice markets (lead-lag price relationship and long-run price adjustment process) during the post-agricultural market liberalization period. In response to changes in the marketing-enhancing policies during the investigation period, the presence of multiple structural breaks in the long-run equation is allowed. The results show that the Dar es Salaam market influences prices in all the rice markets examined, thus acting as a price leader. Furthermore, the price adjustment process results demonstrated the absence of asymmetric price adjustment between the central and regional wholesale rice markets, suggesting improved integration and efficiency of inter-regional rice markets. On the other hand, a central market's presence implies that interventions aimed at the central market can buffer regional markets to withstand adverse price shocks caused by food price spikes and volatility.",

We use household survey data from two-panel rounds, and fixed and random effects estimation and quantile regressions to estimate average and heterogeneous effects. While the literature mostly focuses on either income diversification or participation in non-farm activities, we distinguish between income diversification, using the Simpson Index, and off-farm income generation. We use ex-post income and poverty measures as well as an ex-ante vulnerability measure to analyse welfare effects. We find that income diversification and non-farm income generation improve household income, and reduce poverty and vulnerability. We find that it is most beneficial for poorer households with less land assets to diversify their income portfolio, while moving out of agriculture is equally beneficial at all income levels and most beneficial for households with more human capital. We find that income diversification reduces vulnerability most strongly at high levels of diversification and low levels of income while non-farm income generation reduces vulnerability at lower levels of non-farm income and increases vulnerability at higher levels of non-farm income. Our results lead to nuanced findings that bring additional insights in the literature on structural transformation and rural development.",

The study's objectives were to examine forms of market structure and investigate entry barriers into the local, district, and city groundnut markets for intermediary traders in central and northern Malawi. The findings revealed that the three markets were relatively competitive. Other results showed that business experience and sole ownership of business increased the traders’ likelihood to enter the district and local markets, respectively. Market transaction costs and storage infrastructure negatively and positively influenced the probability of traders’ entry into the local and city markets, respectively. The quantity of produce transacted increased and decreased the likelihood of entry into the local and city markets. Access to credit and informal credit sources increased and decreased the likelihood of entering the city market, respectively. Membership to informal trader associations increased the probability of entering the city market. Thus, institutions, markets and road infrastructure are critical to enhancing intermediary traders’ participation in the local and city groundnut markets.",

    "abstract": "The Meat Board has administered an auction system with a minimum guarantee price (floor price) for beef carcasses since 1956. The floor price functions as a mechanism to purchase carcasses when beef producer prices decline to predetermined low levels. The Meat Board debones and freezes this meat, which is later sold to the trade. The net effect of these purchasing and selling actions on the annual beef producer price was empirically analysed. The net floor price effect, 1970 to 1993. can be described as negative since the magnitude of price-lowering effects due to Meat Board sales of frozen beef was twice that of price-raising effects resulting from floor price purchases and supply control, taking into account the absolute extent of price lowering and raising effects. Relatively large quantities of beef had to be purchased at floor price before significant price increases resulted, but the selling of relatively small quantities of frozen beef was responsible for significant producer price decreases. Supply control measures played an important contributory role in bringing producer price increases into effect, The original aim of the floor price system was to remove beef by means of exports, an aim which was frustrated by economic sanctions and subsidised world beef prices. The fact that floor price beef was sold into the domestic market neutralised the effectiveness of the beef floor price system.",

The price discrimination scheme employed in the fresh milk industry is analysed using a demand and supply model. Prices are shown to have set well above the free market price, inducing an estimated cutback in consumption of 8 to 10 per cent and an increase in production of 2 to 4,5 per cent, resulting in an average surplus of 13,5 per cent of fresh milk sales. The transfer from consumers to producers is estimated at between 12,7 and 17,1 per cent of the value of fresh milk production. Approximately half of this transfer is absorbed by the Dairy Board as levies and occurs at a social cost. Price discrimination may be to the detriment of producers in the long term as artificially high prices may encourage the possible irreversible consumption of substitutes.",

The importance of marketing in rural development cannot be overemphasised. It is the profit incentive which encourages farmers to produce commercially. An overview of the present production and marketing activities of small scale farmers was obtained and the marketing constraints experienced by small scale farmers were identified. Constraints include a lack of transport services, a lack of road infrastructure, communication infrastructure and storage facilities. Farmers also need training and a regular source of market information. Provincial Departments of Agriculture can play a role in providing this information and training. Infrastructure, however, is a function of other government departments and in some cases private companies. The establishment of rural processing facilities should be encouraged. Farmers can also seize some marketing opportunities by working together in their production and marketing activities.",

The latter has undergone a significant deregulation and liberalisation process of its own. Coupled with global trends towards even further deregulation, especially during the 1999 round of multilateral trade negotiations, agricultural industries and economists will be required to focus their attention in this direction. While the former need to devise strategies that will enhance their international competitiveness within a deregulated environment, the latter will have to become involved in the policy debate surrounding this issue. This necessitates, however, on both sides, an improvement of theoretical knowledge of international trade, as well as an understanding of global issues.",

In view of the high level of state intervention, these changes thus point to possible policy evaluation, which in turn gives rise to a broader question, namely what the effects of organising the market in a different manner would be. Usually such proposed changes are based on ideological bias instead of economic analyses of the advantages of costs involved. In South Africa there are two basic schools of thought on the appropriate level of official involvement in the beef and cattle market. These two viewpoints are contradictory which make it necessary to evaluate the performance of the existing marketing system in the first place. Market performance should then be judged by the criterion of what the community expects of a market. In this evaluation of the performance of a market a diagnostic framework should be developed within which a set of performance objectives and indicators, representing selected objectives, together with quantifiable measures are specified. The specified objectives and indicators are then shown as replacements for the method proposed for the empirical evaluation of the marketing system for cattle and beef.",

The results in this paper and other research results give a different picture. It shows that intercropping has a higher total productivity per unit land area and greater stability of yields and revenues than its monocropping counterparts. It could therefore be seen as a system which could be used to fill the gap created by the problem of scarcity of land as well as using it to improve household food insecurity.

Die resultate in hierdie referaat en 'n klompie ander navorsingsresultate gee 'n ander prentjie. Dit toon dat tussenverbouing 'n hoër stabiliteit in opbrengste en winste het as sy enkeloes mededingers. Dit kun dus beskou word as 'n sisteem wat gebruik kan word om die gaping geskep deur die probleem van grondskaarste te oorbrug, en ook gebruik kan word om huishoudelike voedselsekuriteit te verbeter.",

The impact of cut-backs in banana production where entry is free (any farmer can produce bananas) is to increase prices in marketing areas, but depress prices in production areas.

Export supply was positively related to lagged net export realisation price relative to domestic orange price, the SA fresh orange price in the UK relative to the SA fresh orange price in France, lagged exports (export orientation), and supply shocks. The relative price elasticity of export demand was inelastic in both the short- and long-run, indicating that Capespan International and other future exporters may need to diversify fresh orange exports to alternative export markets to increase real revenue. Long-run export supply was inelastic with respect to relative price, implying that if SA fresh orange exports are included in a Free Trade Agreement with the EU, they are unlikely to have a marked adverse affect on EU fresh orange producers.",

The same is true with respect to fruit and ready-made foods. Both quality and price are important considerations for consumers' food purchases, particularly rural consumers. Price appears to be less important to the higher income (> R2000 per month) consumers in purchases of bread and meat, but rather important in vegetable purchases. Almost 60 per cent never consume food at away from home food establishments.",

The effects ofliberalized beef trade in the SACU is quantified in this paper. The focus is on regional supply and demand and the effect of world prices and tariffs on beef trade in the SACU is estimated. This is deemed essential due to the changing marketing environment domestically and abroad. In the absence of a tariff on beef imports, a decline of approximately 14 per cent in the domestic price is necessary to clear the market. Efficiency in the beef industry will have to increase significantly if beef producers are to compete with nonSACU members. The decen~al~tion of the beef industry ~ol~s v~ous advantages, especially if the desperate need to create employment opportunities in rural areas, the skew distribution of income and the poverty level in rural areas is considered.

    "abstract": "Abstract Northern Province is predominantly a rural region where agriculture is the dominant sector and plays an important role in the provincial economy. Women are the majority of the poor living in these rural areas and depend heavily on farming. But their agricultural productivity is below potential as they don't have access to productive assets such as land and credit. This study based on a farm survey undertaken in the seven districts in the former Lebowa homeland in the Northern Province, attempts to identify factors which determine women farmers's access to more farming land and credit facilities. The results show that most of the women are not satisfied with the size of the land which they own and they have never used farming credit. The probit analysis results show that productivity of the staple crop (maize), more off-farm income and access to credit are the strong determinants of the desire to increase, the size of the farming land. Access to credit is influenced by the first two variables above and farmers membership to agricultural development projects. Better access to and security for farm land, targeted credit and agricultural support services are crucial in improving the quality of women farmers in the province. Noordelike Provinsie is 'n oorwegend plattelandse gebied waarin landbou 'n dominante sektor is en 'n belangrike rol in die provinsiale ekonomie speel. Vroue vorm die meerderheid van arm mense wat in hierdie landelike gebiede woon en hul is baie van boerdery afhanklik. Maar hul landbouproduktiwiteit is onder die potensiaal omdat hul nie toegang tot bates soos grond en krediet het nie. Hierdie studie wat gebaseer is op 'n boerdery-opname in die sewe distrikte in die voormalige Lebowatuisland in Noordelike Provinsie, poog om faktore wat vrouens se toegang tot meer plaasgrond en krediet bepaal, te identifiseer. Die resultate toon dat die meeste vrouens nie met die grootte van die grond wat hulle beheer tevrede is nie en dat hulle nooit landboukrediet gebruik het nie. Die probitanalise toon dat produktiwiteit van die stapelgewas (mielies), groter nie-plaas inkomste en toegang tot krediet kragtige determinante is van die begeerte om die grootte van plaasgrond te verhoog. Toegang tot krediet word deur die eerste twee veranderlikes beïnvloed sowel as deur die boere se lidmaatskap van landbou-ontwikkelingsprojekte. Beter toegang tot en sekuriteit aan plaasgrond, doelwitgeoriënteerde krediet en landbou-ondersteuningsdienste is essensieel vir die verbetering in die gehalte van vroulike boere in die provinsie.",

Policy makers showed a high degree of interest in information and data concerning imports and exports, yields, volume of production, producers' prices, stocks and areas planted annually to field crops. In terms of horticultural crops, volume of production, quantities and value of trade and areas of annual crops are required by most. These statistics are mostly desired quarterly. The livestock statistics desired by most policy makers involve quantities and value of imports and exports, abattoir slaughter volumes and producer prices, mostly monthly. Policy makers also express interest in forecasts of the important crops and livestock. In terms of basic statistics, policy makers showed interest in information on marketing methods and income from farm activities. Scant interest was shown for data regarding employment. A disappointing response rate of 28% was obtained from researchers. Among those who responded, there was a high level of interest in statistics concerning planted areas, imports and exports, producer prices, volume of production, consumer prices, yields and areas harvested of field crops. Researchers showed a lower level of interest in horticultural crops. In the case of livestock, interest centred mainly on livestock numbers, imports and exports, producer prices and costs of production, mostly on an annual basis. The only basic statistics for which over 60% of the researchers showed much interest, was the income from farming activities.",

Cochrane’s concern was the agricultural sector of the United States, but the treadmill argument has global applicability, and has arguably influenced the international agricultural research effort. For world agriculture, the CGIAR system has the task of promoting technical change and, if it is succeeding in diffusing better technologies to the poorest countries, there should be some evidence of convergence. Thus, the less agriculturally successful countries within Africa should be closing the gap between them and the leaders, and the gaps between Africa and Asia, and the developed and developing countries should be decreasing.",

A study was conducted on two groups of small scale black farmers in the Venda region: one group, agribusiness directed and generally more progressive towards technology, produces mangos and other subtropical fruits (cash crop farmers); the other group concentrates on locally consumed and sold vegetables (food crop farmers). Their food status was quantitatively determined by means of household energy, protein and fat balances and food security determinants were identified. More than 80% of the households had a negative balance for energy, protein or fat. Business orientation and farming type in this particular case study does not influence the energy, protein and fat coverage significantly. The marginal nature of farming by these small holders could explain this finding. Significant predictors of food security status were rather factors such as the household size and the availability of outside sources of income and cash to spend on food.",

It looks at the cost and benefits of land transfer in three selected case studies in Mpumalanga. The results indicate that it is socially beneficial to transfer land in all the case studies. The net present values were all significant but sensitive to changes in product price, input prices and the discount rate. Although the analysis shows negative net present values for the state, the positive net present value for the potential beneficiaries and the rest of society far outweighs the cost to the state. The paper concludes that transfer of land to potential beneficiaries in the three case studies will significantly reduce the level of poverty among the potential beneficiaries and improve their livelihoods. If it is in the interest of the state to alleviate poverty, particularly in rural areas, then land reform should be taken seriously.",

Loan applicants with more stable incomes, who are contactable via telephone or post, who are employed in less risky business sectors, who have more disposable income relative to debt, and who have had a good credit history with other lenders, are more likely to be accepted. None of the factors with a significant effect on the loan screening decision could explain subsequent loan default by accepted applicants. The micro-lender may have screened out very risky clients and accepted a riskier, profitable pool of loan applicants with risk being controlled through effective monitoring. This is important where tangible collateral is unavailable and where the risk must be acceptable to commercial lenders wanting to link up with profitable micro-lenders.",

The driving force behind economic change is technology and information, and information and knowledge will replace land, labour and capital as the sources of wealth in agriculture. The resultant cognitive-technical complex in farm production will lead to the true industrialisation of farming and thus placing the traditional family farmer at a distinct disadvantage. Technology developments combined with inverse population growth and ageing population, will not only negate Malthusian visions, but also lead to downward pressure on farm commodity prices, and thus increase the adoption rates of new technology. However, in reaction to the increasingly complex nature of modern society a demand is developing for terroir-based products. This range of products may not only significantly change some characteristics of agriculture, but also provide a new set of opportunities for farmers. Agricultural policy and development strategies should also be reconsidered in the light of this new environment.",

An IED has been considered in the past in South Africa but rejected largely due to tax implications. Conditions have now changed as various countries (Australia, Canada and USA) strongly promote such a scheme as a risk management strategy while the South African crop insurance program has failed to attract farmers. A main criticism of an IED in the past was that if it is used in conjunction with the In/Out farmer' tax provision, that farmers can obtain tax benefits if they destabilise their incomes. This can be avoided by adopting a tax rule that farmers may only invest the positive difference between their current taxable income and their moving average taxable income in an IED. It is further recommended that the Land Bank deposit scheme (Income Tax Paragraph 13A) be abolished and be replaced by an IED that covers both livestock, crops and horticulture.",

The study employed the Tobit model to estimate the determinants of the maximum willingness to pay and a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model to estimate the mean willingness to pay for foliar fertiliser. The results of the Tobit regression model showed that the education level of the farm household, total annual income, access to credit service, access to agricultural extension service, perception about fertiliser, and cost of the existing fertiliser have a positive and significant effect on farm households' willingness to pay. On the other hand, the age of farm households, availability of labour, and initial bid price have negative and significant effect on farm households' willingness to pay for ZM-GrowTM foliar fertiliser. The mean willingness to pay for ZM-GrowTM foliar fertiliser, estimated using the seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model, was 121.16 birr/litre (2.75 USD/litre). The corresponding mean willingness to pay amount estimated from an open-ended format was 161.105 Birr/litre (3.65 USD/litre). The results suggest that foliar fertilisers could be good alternatives to the existing fertilisers and its adoption can be further facilitated through improved access to knowledge and finance/credit.",

    "abstract": "A discrete choice experiment in Kinshasa (DRC) investigated urban consumers' preferences between imports and local options for five staple foods – cassava, rice, maize, sugar and cooking oil – under a random utility model. We also examined how distance, packaging and price influenced consumer choice. To assess whether preferences could be manipulated, we introduced two treatment groups – local, import – and a control group. We did not find support for a preference for imports. Instead, there is a statistically significant preference for local products, with the exception of sugar. Respondents are willing to pay 28% more for local food, a premium quantified at 1540 CF (.93 USD) per kg for maize and 1091CF (.66 USD) per litre for oil. Packaging is an attribute of influence as the willingness to pay (WTP) in full remains positive when products interact with packaging and with price. There is demand for local products for which consumers are willing to pay a premium. Yet, DRC imports 1.5 billion dollars of food yearly with only 10% of its arable land exploited. The increased urban consumption of imports does not signify a bias against local products, but rather points to structural issues undermining local supply. DRC needs to develop local value chains linking rural farmers to urban markets through the transformation of local foods to meet urban needs and to convert the WTP into a producer surplus benefiting rural livelihoods.",

Public regulation and public enterprise brought in their wake gross inefficiency and inequity. Public enterprise could not maintain production efficiency. This, together with increasing regulation, created an ever-increasing burden of social services, monopolies, increased taxation, deficit budgeting and inflation. Governments and the public became increasingly unable to carry these burdens, This led to policies of deregulation and privatisation with improved effectiveness, efficiency and public finance as motives. Competition is vital to efficiency. Privatisation takes on different forms, depending on what is privatised and to what extent: provision or production. Persistence or formation of monopolies, changed objectives, staff and management problems and accountability present distinct pitfalls with deregulation and privatisation. These pitfalls must be overcome and avoided. Diversity and dualism in South African food needs and agricultural production imply too much needed diversity in products and market structures for a regulated environment. Deregulation and privatisation are needed.",

    "abstract": "The marked inequality in distribution of wealth and resources in South Africa, notably farm land, support services, and consequently opportunities to compete in agricultural markets, necessitates carrying out of a comprehensive rural restructuring aimed at eradicating the persistent poverty among the almost 16 million residing in rural areas. In the long term, development of these areas should yield a fast-growing and sustainable rural economy characterised by maximum participation of society through entrepreneurship, employment and income generation. Various interest groups which participate in and influence debate and analyses of issues on agricultural and rural development, offer different viewpoints on this aspect. The ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) has been drafted based largely on the common strategic notions emanating from these debates. This paper highlights and discusses some issues raised within the RDP with respect to agricultural policy. The surprisingly limited reference to agriculture within the RDP, exposes an urban bias in the various programmes proposed. This paper includes comments which should be seen against the background of the need to lobby for a more significant positioning of agriculture within the government of National Unity's programme of reconstruction and development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This is the first local study of the linkage between export demand for deciduous fruit and South African deciduous fruit farm incomes and land prices. Export demand is expected to affect land prices through the derived demand relationship and capitalization formula. By analyzing the relative role of export demand, the study extends past research by van Wyk (1967), Behrmann and Collett (1970), Nieuwoudt (1980), Janse van Rensburg (1983) and Kassier (1985) which showed a close relationship between land prices and expected returns to farming. Ordinary Least Squares analysis of real annual farm income and land price data for the major apple producing area of Elgin in the Cape Province during 1972—1992 supported a priori expectations of the linkage between export demand, farm income, and land prices. Lagged net revenue (total revenue less marketing costs) per hectare and lagged farmland prices per hectare had positive effects on land prices, while land prices were negatively related to lagged interest rates. When lagged net revenue per hectare was s lit into net export realisation revenue, net domestic realisation revenue and processing revenue, all three variables impacted positively on land prices, but only the export coefficient was statistically significant. These results imply that investor expectations about future net export revenue and interest rates, seem to drive farm land prices. Export enhancing policies to establish stable long-term export markets must account for the impact of macroeconomic linkages and global market forces on farm incomes and farm assets. Persistently high future local inflation rates could maintain downward pressure on the Rand exchange rate. Coupled with real income growth (increased demand) in developed countries, this will increase export revenues and land prices over time. New entrants will thus find it increasingly difficult to acquire farm land to produce for export markets.",

Jon Franklin This viewpoint argues against ‘the high priest role’ of economic analysis and economists ‘playing God’. When there are conflicting interests, as is the casebetween races in South Africa, economics does not provide tools for solving or abolishing this conflict. In the end the economist is still left with the need to choose between conflicting interests. The best that economists can do is to try to understand this conflict and to provide information which can be the background for policy-makers and people when choosing preferences and institutions. This includes both value and value-free knowledge when predicting the substantive consequences of change and alternative rights for the different races in South Africa. However, even only providing information does not free the economist from taking sides in the face of conflict; the plea is therefore to explicitly account for hislher own value judgements or that of the institution being served.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It was found from data in the Agricultural Census reports of 1976, 1981 and 1988 that the distribution of the amount of farm workers per hectare differs between statistical regions as defined by the Sentral Statistical Service. Cross-sectional functions were fitted to explain the differences. The following factors yielded the highest contributions: gross income, debt burden per hectare, compensation of workers, quality of resources and the amount of tractors in the region. The goverment's policy regarding interest rates, marketing and general aid has a significant influence on the mobility (demand and supply) of farm workers. Changes in Goverment aid to farmers may thus activate shifts of workers within and out of ariculture. The supply of farm workers is inelastic. This may be ascribed to the former act on influx control, low interest rates which caused labour substitution and the accompanying low compensation of farm workers. Labour is utilised sub-optimally while unemployment is on the order of the day. Minimum wages are advocated by various circles as means to rectify the situation. Minimum wages may however lead to more capital/labour substitution and associated unemployment. Subsidisation of farm labour over a medium term should have a positive influence on employment. The subsidy should be phased out as employment approaches optimality.",

Theoretical arguments are used to show that the futures and cash prices should be very close, if not equal, at expiration and that the current futures price should be a good forecast of the cash price at expiration. Speculators play an important role by providing liquidity to the futures market, but it is possible that they can distort prices. For a futures market to be a success in South Africa there needs to be a free cash market, adequate liquidity and well informed traders. A computer-based trading system is an improvement on the traditional floor trading system mainly because prices are more likely to reflect the underlying supply and demand conditions.",

A wide variety of local and international feed sources were considered for inclusion in the rations. Prices, the availability and quality of each feed, the inclusion of specific feed sources in a ration and the consumption of each ration could be allowed to vary independently. Price elasticities of demand for yellow maize were estimated after the price of maize was increased parametrically. Substantial differences in maize demand price elasticities for the different livestock enterprises were found. A relaxation of feed importation restrictions showed a significant increase in the price sensitivity of yellow maize and resulted in a decline in the market share of South African yellow maize in the livestock feed market. Policy implications are highlighted. Suggestions for further analyses that are possible via the model are also presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Community based co-operatives do not have a good record. The fact that so many co-operatives fail, constitutes a real danger that the co-operative model could fall into such disrepute that it will become widely rejected. Consequently a potentially valuable mechanism for economic development and reconstruction will be lost. One of the reasons for co-operative failure stems from the past perception of co-operatives as anti-capitalist forms of association. Co-operatives were a way of releasing the poor from the yoke of oppression and giving them access to power and employment. This \"socialist\" view of co-operatives excluded the one important ingredient of a successful business venture: entrepreneurship. The paper investigates the \"co-operative entrepreneurship\" dilemma, and indicates that entrepreneurship and co-operativism are reconcilable concepts. The circumstances for a successful entrepreneur: co-operative relationship are discussed, and other critical factors associated with success in community based co-operatives are discussed. Uittreksel Gemeenskapsgebaseerdekoöperasies het nie 'n goeie rekord nie. Die feit dat soveel koöperasies faal, dreig om die koöperasiemodel in sy geheel te diskrediteer. Dit kan beteken dat 'n waardevolle ekonomiese en herkonstruksie meganisme verlore sal gaan. Koöperasies is, in die verlede, as 'n bevrydingsmeganisme vir die ames en onderdruktes voorgehou. Die sosialistiese siening van koöperasies het nie voorsiening gemaak vir die vernaamste beatandeel van 'n suksesvolle besigheid, n1. entrepreneurskap nie.

The model is estimated by three-stage least squares and used to simulate the dynamic impacts of an expansionary monetary policy (15 percent increase in money supply) from 1975 to 1987. In the short run, this causes real interest rates to fall, real income to rise, exchange rate to depreciate and prices to rise. Rising real incomes cause beef demand to increase and human maize consumption to fall. Depreciation of the exchange rate and higher domestic inflation raise real input prices. This impacts negatively on maize and beef supply. Higher beef prices encourage beef production, which causes animal maize demand to increase. Lower real interest rates impact positively on maize supply, negatively on beef supply, and stimulate real agricultural investment. The net effect is a decline in real gross farm income in the maize and beef sectors of South Africa.",

A regression analysis revealed the following factors to be important in influencing the use of consultants: The farmers' perceived value of own farm records in production decisions; self-rating of management skills in overall farm management; computer use; degree of farm diversification; off-farm investment, and farmer's age. Of the respondents, 73.percent used computers in their farm business. Computers were rated as 'providing better information' and 'saved time' compared to 'hand' records. Preparing financial statements and farm planning were the most highly rated applications of the computer.

Changes needed are proposed. It basically entails changing the mind-set of the institutions. In the targeting of services, the role of public sector institutions will also include a high priority servicing of the previously ignored farmers in the sector. In considering the whole agricultural sector, unco-ordinated an inequitable approaches of the past will be excluded. The challenge however is to redress the inequities of the past, while at the same time pursuing the goal of an equitable, efficient and sustainable agricultural sector.",

The period selected was one of generally declining exchange rate of the Rand. Serial correlation problems were overcome by a combination of the Hildreth-Lu procedure and weighted first differences. Tractor prices reacted within the same quarter, as well as the following two quarters. Prices of other input groups reacted between the first and third quarter following depreciation, with elasticities varying between -0,090 and -0,698. Some effects were of an indirect nature. Statutory administrated prices do not seem to react differently to exchange rate depreciation than prices formed by pure business decisions.",

A correlation analysis between annual investment and the annual competitiveness rating in the agro-food industry indicted a correlation coefficient of 78%. Various factors, common to most sectors, were identified by the industry as constraints on future investment. A concerted effort through innovative measures and policies will now be required to promote sustainable agricultural activity in South Africa to stimulate further investment.",

Crop rotation present a possible alternative to wheat monoculture production, of which profitability decreased since 1996. The advantage of crop rotation is mainly increasing yields and savings on inputs like fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. Information was obtained by making use of the Delphi technique and group discussions whereby a multi dissiplinary team of experts were involved. The internal rate of return (IRR) was used as financial criterium in calculating the expected profitability of each of the eight crop rotation systems being researched. Of the eight systems the most profitable one is expected to be one consisting of wheat being rotated with medic and clover mixtures as grazing for livestock. The profitability analysis of the alternative crop rotation systems as well as the financial implications of the implementation thereof in the practical farming situation was performed with the aid of typical farming models of the region.",

    "abstract": "Considerable literature has linked the increasing concentration of agricultural production to severe ecological problems. There is an argument that large-scale farmers are less concerned about the environment and, therefore, less likely than small-scale farmers to employ environmentally sound methods and practices. However, this paper advances an alternative hypothesis predicting that small-scale farmers are less able to preserve the environment than large-scale farmers because of environmental and institutional constraints such as farming on highly erodable and marginal soils. To test this hypothesis, the relationship between farm size and estimated soil loss using data obtained from a random sample of farmers in a KwaZulu-Natal midlands community was examined. Large farms were found to have lower estimated soil loss than small farms, mainly because the land farmed had less potential for erosion. The implications of these findings for developing an effective soil conservation policy are discussed The differential productivity of farmland must be represented in any analysis of the changing structure of agriculture and the efficiency of large and small farms. The most productive farmland in this country has a relatively low soil-erosion potential and lends itself to capital-intensive agricultural production. Capital-intensive agriculture is not attracted to the marginal land that has higher erosion potential. Marginal lands are, however, the most accessible and affordable for smaller farmers. Soil erosion, then, is a problem of small-farm agriculture, not capital-intensive agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A classification system developed to evaluate the environmental care orientation of companies and, more specifically, their strategies to deal with the environmental care requirements presrcibed by the market was applied to the deciduous fruit sector in the Western Cape. A survey was done to determine the attitude towards and status of, environmental care activities amongst deciduous fruit producers who have already obtained Eurepgap certification or who are busy preparing for the certification audit. A questionnaire was used and the responses were judged in terms of the guidelines of the classification system. The nature of the typical South African—European deciduous fruit export supply chain is that South African producers desire to supply the retail market at higher prices than that of the wholesale market. The producers are then confronted with the stringent environmental care requirements of the retail chains, who use the environmental care product image aggressively as a selling point in the retail market, acting like typical Class III market oriented institutions. The classification shows that the majority of producers try to comply with these requirements with minimum effort (Class I). The more progressive producers accept them as good agricultural practices to increase their production efficienc. (Class II). Some farmers participate in a comprehensive Integrated Crop Management (ICM) system to establish a culture of environmental care at farm level in a more efficient way. ICM implementation also helps to prepare proactively for possible changes in the environmental care requirements of individual retail chains. This seems to be the more effective strategy for the primary producer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Different types of crops are planted in winter grain regions. These crops can be planted in even more combinations. Crops that are planted on the same land in successive years do influence one another. In this situation the problem of which sequence of crops to plant arises. If appropriate assumptions are made, this problem can be solved with linear programming (LP). The complexity of this problem, however, increases dramatically with an increase in the number of crops as well as the number of years considered. Another problem with this formulation is how to choose the boundary conditions. Furthermore the solution to this problem is degenerate. In practice it is found that farmers prefer a cycle of crops in a rotary crop system, because it simplifies the management of the system. If the assumption is made that a farmer uses a cycle of at most three years, the problem of the boundary conditions is solved. If the dual formulation of this problem is considered it is evident that the problem has a specific structure. The structure of the problem as well as the fact that the solution to the problem is highly degenerate can be exploited to simplify the solution of the problem substantially. If the correct selection of solutions from this degenerate dual problem is chosen this selection can be used to formulate a simplified model in terms of strategies for the farmer. If the problem is formulated in terms of these strategies, the problem is further reduced to an LP with one constraint (the knapsack problem), which makes it possible to solve this problem by hand for a relative large number of crops in the rotary crop system. These strategies can also be used to solve a more generalised problem. Consider nature to be a player in Game Theory. The strategies of nature can be defined in many ways. The amount of rain per annum, for example, could be strategies used by nature to play a game against the farmer. The farmer in return can then use his strategies and the knowledge of Game Theory to maximise his profit. The problem can be generalised further if it is formulated in terms of Game Theory. In this generalisation the Game Theory model is expanded to incorporate a number of different situations with the use of extra constraints. The first of these situations is to incorporate other enterprises with the rotary crop system. The farmer could, for instance want the solution to contain at least a certain amount of feed for his cattle. The second situation is when the farmer has knowledge of the weather patterns, which implies for the Game Theory model that the farmer has knowledge of his opponent's strategies. Both these situations are incorporated in the model. Finally, a case study is presented in which the use of the model is demonstrated. Relevant data from the Swartland region are used. A dry year, an average year and a wet year were used as strategies for nature. The solutions drawn from these data were confirmed with a farmer from the region, who agreed that the solutions appear to be reasonable if it is compared to what is found in practice. The most frequently chosen strategies were the ones that contain wheat and clover. The solutions indicate that a farmer should plant less clover and more grain if it is a dry year, whilst it is better to increase the amount of clover planted if the rainfall is higher.",

This study used single bound dichotomous choice contingent valuation to examine factors determining smallholder farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for a metal silo, a new and improved storage technology in Zimbabwe. Data were collected using structured questionnaires from 249 randomly selected households in Makoni and Shamva Districts. Logit results showed that storage loss, quantity of non-food crops, equipment value, vegetable income, participation in informal activities, and household head's age and marital status significantly influenced WTP for metal silos. The amount of grain lost in storage positively influenced farmers' WTP, suggesting that current storage practices are not effective against storage losses. Income variables, except the value of equipment, showed a positive influence on WTP for a metal silo implying that increasing the household's income eases financial constraints that could impede investments in the silo technology. The study recommends the adoption of metal silos to curb storage losses and improve household food security. Diversification of agriculture and provision of credit are recommended to increase WTP for metal silos. Development agents promoting the technology should target married and young households for sustainability, without marginalising their counterparts.",

Which is only viable assuming adequate liquidity, that is currently lacking in these futures contracts. The soybean oil contract used for hedging local price exposure should also reflect local import parity and/or be correlated to local price movements. Therefore, with most soybean oil usually being imported from Argentina, one would expect SAFEX soybean oil futures contracts to reflect the cost of imported soybean oil from Argentina. Hence, the research study used the Engle–Granger (1987) cointegration approach, alongside a range of diagnostic tests to determine whether SAFEX soybean oil futures contracts, that is dual-listed and cash-settled of CBOT settlement values is a misspecification and whether or not SAFEX soybean oil futures contracts should rather be based on the Argentina free-on-board soybean oil prices which is a much better representation of South Africa's import parity and local industry prices.",

We interpret our findings as economic costs of xenophobic attacks emanating from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

In developing countries like Mozambique, it seems to be a major issue at the upstream end of supply chains, which is also regarded as postharvest losses (PHL). In this study, PHL is analysed in the context of maize in Mozambique, which is the most important crop in that country. The analysis focuses on empirically testing a simulation modelling approach for determining the short and mid-run economic impacts of PHL. A system dynamics model is applied. This model acknowledges climate, management, and domestic and regional marketing related factors as major drivers of PHL. A novel result from this study suggests climate related factors as the cause of a systematic amount of PHL at about 70,000 tons per year. However, marketing forces also play an important role to explain the overall PHL, particularly in periods domestic production increases sharply. The impact of potential interventions in the value chain are also tested.",

    "abstract": "Over 2003–2021, the pasture harvested on South African pasture-based dairy farms increased markedly. This increased production and consumption of pasture has helped to reduce the cost of producing milk in South Africa relative to dairying in other countries and delivered comparatively high levels of profit. National milk production has grown steadily. Over this same time, pasture as a proportion of the total diet of dairy herds has decreased significantly: supplements make up the major share of the diet. This change to dairy herd diets puts upward pressure on the average cost of feeding the herd and on the cost of production. The focus of this paper is on whether dairy farmers would be better off if they significantly increased the proportion of pasture in the total diet of their herds and relied less on supplementary feed. It is shown that progressively increasing the pasture component and proportion in the diet of dairy herds, from an industry average of 41% to 57%, could increase profit. Results were a 26% increase in profit (return on capital), a 59% increase in profit margin per litre, and a 7% decrease in cost of production per litre. If this change in production system to increased use of pasture and less use of supplementary feeds was replicated across the entire South African pasture-based dairy industry, farmers in the industry would be significantly more profitable and their businesses would be more resilient than under the current feeding regimes that are used.",

Cross-sectional data collected from 215 randomly sampled irrigation beneficiaries were used for analysis. The mean WTP from double bounded dichotomous elicitation method ranges from 164.027 Birr (4.17 USD) to 221.059 Birr (5.62 USD) per year per hectare of irrigable land. The result from the seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model estimation revealed that the sex of the household head, total annual farm income, size of irrigable landholdings of the household, frequency of extension contacts, amount of credit, and dissatisfaction with the existing irrigation service positively and significantly influenced farmers' WTP decisions. In contrast, off-farm income and bid values were negatively related to WTP decisions. Therefore, the aforementioned factors affecting farmers' decisions to pay should be taken into consideration when constructing irrigation schemes in the study area and areas with similar economic and socio-cultural settings.",

    "abstract": "We aim to analyse factors affecting global trade in pork and poultry markets by examining trade flow determinants through gravity models. Our gravity model analysis focuses on non-tariff measures (i.e., sanitary and phytosanitary, technical barriers to trade, and other non-tariff measures) and climate change (i.e., temperature abnormalities, precipitation abnormalities, and climatological catastrophes). Our results confirm the theoretical ambiguity of the standards-trade effects. For pork trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures are more trade-restrictive than tariffs. For poultry trade, technical barriers to trade operate as a trade catalyst, while other non-tariff measures function as a trade barrier. Policymakers should aim for a balance between protecting public health and facilitating trade. Temperature abnormalities in importing countries harm pork and poultry imports, while precipitation abnormalities in exporting countries negatively influence poultry exports. Climatological catastrophes slightly decrease pork imports (poultry exports). Encouraging climate adaptation measures within the agricultural and food processing sectors can help mitigate production and trade disruptions for exporters and supply disruptions for importers.",

Implementation of the polluter pays principle and governmental enforcement of pollution clean-up have led to astronomical environmental liabilities and clean-up costs, which may threaten the survival of many productive ventures, unless producers can spread pollution risk through insurance. An emission constrained target MOTAD LP (TMLP) model showed that pollution insurance for irrigation farmers can be a feasible and efficient solution to agricultural salinization problems in the Loskop Valley, and fairly low salinity standards with pollution insurance will still be reconcilable with profitable farming. Pollution insurance appears to hold promise for applying the polluter pays principles also to non-point pollution. Site specific studies are needed for pollution policy, and more research is needed on pollution standards.",

    "abstract": "Hake is the most valuable fisheries species in South Africa, with an estimated landed value of R658 million in 1997. The fishery is presently managed under an individual quota system, where total allowable catch (TAC) is set annually and divided up amongst quota holders according to past performance, without quota holders having to pay for it. Fundamental restructuring of the South African hake quota market is however due to take place in the near future as recommended by the White Paper on Marine Fisheries Policy (1997). Factor analysis of data collected from a postal survey of existing South African hake quota holders and rejected hake quota applicants suggests that distinct differences in attitudes towards restructuring exist amongst respondents. Four factors, representing groups of respondents defined as (1) applicants, (2) quota holders, (3) small scale respondents (comprising of both applicants and quota holders), and (4) larger, longer established quota holders, sharing similar attitudes towards restructuring were extracted. It was also calculated that a substantial annual rent of approximately R279 million is generated by the South African hake industry, which is presently harvested free of charge by those issued with quota. It is stated policy of the White Paper to capture these rents, however methods of accomplishing this have not been well accepted by the industry. This study aims at providing some solutions to these problems of restructuring.",

    "abstract": "In Namibia historically high levels of support to the commercial farm sector have been reduced in recent years in line with general market liberalisation trends. However some support remains. At the same time more attention has been paid to supporting the previously neglected communal sector. The avowed aim of politicians is to ensure that grain producers in Namibia operate \"on a level playing field\". This paper examines to what extent the policy support playing field has been levelled for all major types of grain producer in Namibia. A methodology is introduced for developing a common measure of the effects of price support across grain producers with subsistence and commercial objectives and across scales of operation ranging from 1 hectare to 300 hectares under grain crops. The finding show that the bulk of grain producers in Namibia, who farm most of the grain area, remain seriously disadvantaged compared to the fewer, larger farms. Ongoing discussions on outsourcing government support services to small farmers is likely to result in the playing field becoming more uneven and other compensating measures will need to be taken if politicians and decision makers are serious about \"evening the playing field for all\".",

The model highlights important policy issues and explains 61% of the variation in chemical treatment costs. Environmental contaminants have a marked impact on treatment costs. Treatment costs increase when levels of alkalinity, sodium and turbidity fall. Conversely, costs rise with higher levels of dissolved oxygen and water stability. Paradoxically, clean water—typical of Midmar Dam—is expensive to treat. Treatment costs also rise when concentrations of the algae, Chlorella, decline. Apparently the level of Chlorella varies inversely with the level of other, more harmful, contaminants.",

Discharge of gypsum-rich waters from mining operations in an environmentally acceptable manner is of importance to the country as a whole to allow the utilisation of mineral resources. Controlled irrigation with gypsiferous water is an option to deal with the pollution problem. Different cropping practices, however, have different implications for water utilisation, capital outlay, salt precipitation, and economic impacts. Mine management is therefore faced with multiple, noncommensurate, and conflicting criteria in the decision process. The objective of this study is to use Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques to advise Kleinkopje Collieries management on the economically and environmentally sustainable cropping system for irrigation with gypsiferous mine water.

It is estimated that approximately 16849 farmers benefited from access to finance provided by the Scheme. Over time the Scheme moved to smaller loans pr farmer which may imply experience in interacting with smaller scale farmers. Four distinct institutional groups took part in the Scheme, namely Developing Co-operatives, Parastatal Financiers, Private Sector institutions and a Commercial Farmers Co-operative.

This paper reports on a different issue related to the FSP: An analysis of the farm and household characteristics that may be used to predict the likely participation of small-scale farmers in the FSP. Probit analysis was used to analyse data obtained from 100 participants and non-participants in the Keiskammahoek FSP in the Eastern Cape Province. The analysis yielded a correct prediction in 78.6% of cases.",

The two samples are reasonably representative of the range of conditions found in the communal areas in Zimbabwe. Programming techniques are used to determine the efficiency levels of the farms in each region. The results show that efficiency is positively related to the numbers of both cows and oxen, with only a few farms in Gokwe possibly having too many animals. Farms in Gokwe are on average about two thirds as efficient as those in Chiweshe, which is a measure of the effects of the poorer climate and soils. Non-farm income is also lower, due to lesser opportunities in the more remote region. In both regions, the majority of farms are too small and the estimates suggest that increasing farm size could almost double productivity.",

He played an important role in supporting socio-political change in South Africa, and I have no doubt that, but for his untimely death, he would have assumed an even more important role in the new South Africa post-1994. One of the fields in which he had become increasingly interested was that of economic cooperation across the Southern African region. As Simon Brand was an agricultural economist by training, I hope he would have approved of the topic which I have chosen to consider in this lecture.",

A study was carried out to evaluate the long-term economic viability of investments in dairy goats, in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Results of the study show that commercial production of dairy goats, together with a milk processing plant in the region, would be profitable and would have benefits from both economic and social points of view as well as for the environment. With a discount rate of 15%, the Net Present Worth (NPW), Benefit/Cost ratio (B/C) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) were found to be R4.3 million, 1.44 and 54% respectively. Further, a sensitivity analysis to changes in benefits and costs of inputs was conducted. This found the above proposal to be viable, even when benefits are reduced by 25%. The project proposal was still viable when cost of inputs was inflated by 25%. In both cases, the Benefit/Cost ratio is greater than 1 and IRR is greater than the current market rate of interest. However, the combined effect of reducing the benefit by 25% and inflating costs by 25%, would result in negative NPW. Results from a survey carried out further show the possibility and viability of producing satisfactory levels of milk from dairy goats in the Eastern Cape.",

Conditional cross-price Slutsky elasticity estimates show that for a given 1% change in each meat price under an FTA, the beef price change would have the largest impact on consumption of the other meats. The net effect of the FTA would depend on the extent to which different meat prices fall if meat imports increase. Import competition may be felt particularly from poultry imports as most of SA beef imports are of a low quality. Die Rotterdam model is gebruik om 'n vraagsisteem vir Suid-Afrikaanse (SA) bees-, hoender-, skaap- en varkvleis vir die 1971–1995 periode te skat en die potensiële impakte van 'n vryehandelsooreenkoms (VHO) tussen SA en die Europese Unie op die vraag na hierdie vleissoorte te identifiseer. Voorwaardelike beramings van kruiselingse pryselastisiteite toon dat vir 'n gegewe 1% verandering in elke vleisprys onder 'n VHO, die beesvleisverandering die grootste impak op die verbruik van die ander vleissoorte sal hê. Die netto-effek van die VHO sal afhang van die mate waartoe verskillende vleispryse sal val indien vleisinvoer toeneem. Invoermededinging mag ervaar word, veral van pluimvee-invoere aangesien meeste SA beesvleisinvoere van 'n lae gehalte is.",

Most of these models have attempted to incorporate risk, with varying degrees of success. Quadratic programming (QP) is restricted by limited availability of suitable algorithms. MOTAD is computationally efficient and provides acceptable solutions compared with those derived using QP. Utility-efficient programming appears to have considerable potential. Of the safety-first models, Target MOTAD seems to be the most useful. Game theory models may lead to farm plans which are conservative. Risk-efficient Monte Carlo programming may be useful when the distribution of risk is non-normal or utility is not quadratic and when a farmer's risk aversion is not known. Models accounting for stochastic input-output coefficients and constrained resources have also been attempted but required relatively large matrices. Goal programming attempts to include fanners' multiple objectives in the objective function. Development of appropriate software for personal computers should be a high priority.",

The factors that farmers do take into account when they consider tractor replacement are analysed and compared with factors that determine optimality of tractor replacement. Although farmers have become reluctant to replace tractors, when they do consider replacement, the most relevant factors are considered. Various models are available for replacement decisions of which two are especially suitable for the development of decision support systems namely multiperiod integer programming and uniform cost models. An interactive representation of the uniform cost model is given. Although this user-specific model is developed for advice to individual farmers an average tractor replacement age of 10 years was obtained in a nonnative study. This replacement age is higher than the age normally obtained with traditional accounting procedures and can be ascribed to the inclusion of the so called “challenger” in the uniform cost model.",

During 1983/84 rents on grazing land in the Maize Triangle averaged at R6,85 per ha, maize land R31,28 while wheat land in the Eastern Free State rented at R24,14. Data show that the expected profitability of maize was substantially higher than livestock during the period studied. Using the concepts of economic rent and transfer earnings, data indicate that the comparative advantage of maize versus livestock production in the three principal maize producing areas is the same. As rents are determined by market forces they could provide insight into the dynamic and anticipated changes in farming profitability.",

The focus is on regional supply and demand and the effect of world prices and tariffs on beef trade in the SACU is estimated. This is deemed essential due to the changing marketing environment domestically and abroad. In the absence of a tariff on beef imports, a decline of approximately 14 per cent in the domestic price is necessary to clear the market. Efficiency in the beef industry will have to increase significantly if beef producers are to compete with non-SACU members. The decentralization of the beef industry holds various advantages, especially if the desperate need to create employment opportunities in rural areas, the skew distribution of income and the poverty level in rural areas is considered. Existing infrastructure's sustainability should be market driven.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Availability of resources, including water, is a major consideration in the choice of irrigated crops. This problem is compounded by variations in water supplies. For maximum profit, the marginal revenue to water applications must at the last usable unit be the same for all crops or uses. With abundant water, profit is maximized with expansion of high water requirement crops relative to water-economising crops. Empirical evidence shows that profit maximization is achieved if returns to the scarcest, most limiting resources available are at a maximum. Thus, in certain situations, land or water resources may have to be left idle to maximize profit. Imperfect knowledge arising from unpredictable variability leads to risk in agricultural production. Rational decision-making under risk is choice consistent with the decision maker's beliefs about the uncertainty he faces and with his preferences for possible consequences. With uncertain water supplies, the manager could adopt more conservative estimates. An optimal risky decision is one that maximizes the decision-maker's subjective expected utility. This can be determined by using stochastic efficiency analysis, mean variance analysis or simulation.",

This is done by using the duality that exists between the production function and the cost function along the expansion path. The basic dual input definition of elasticity of substitution renders a number of alternative concepts possible. The Allen, Morishima and Shadow measures are particularly useful. Although specific production functions frequently embody assumptions that may have important disadvantages with respect to the substitutability of inputs, the translog specification represents relaxations of these maintained hypotheses. The translog functional specification is thus the production function of choice for empirical estimation of elasticities of substitution between input pairs when little information about the production process other than cost data, is available.",

The evolution of FM in the USA, the UK and Australia has been used as the norm to evaluate the progress of FM teaching and research in South Africa. In order to review the development of FM in South Africa over the past 60 years, the period has been divided into three phases. The outstanding feature of FM in Phase I (1925—1950) was its multidisciplinary nature in contrast with the dominating role of production economics in FM in Phase II (1950—1970). The last 15 years (Phase III) in the evolution of FM is typified by the greater role played by management science in FM. As in the USA, the UK and Australia, it can be said that FM is regarded basically as FM economics (narrower approach) in South Africa today, but attempts are being made to integrate the various disciplines. As far as FM teaching is concerned, the integration is accomplished in two alternative ways. In contrast to the case in the USA, FM research was given the highest priority than other fields of agricultural economics during Phase III. The progress made in FM in SA over the past 15 years was satisfactory on the whole. However, the progress was far from ideal, because there were no strong international leaders in FM during this period. FM will remain a key field of agricultural economics in future, but it can be expected that the relative importance of FM will decline as it did in the USA.",

    "abstract": "Direct marketing of farm produce through farm stalls is a highly discussed subject among urban and agricultural geographers in Europe and North America. This practice results from the farmer's evaluation of marketing opportunities presented by urban sprawl within the rural-urban fringe. In South Africa, however, this spatial interaction phenomenon between the agricultural sector and the urban structure has not received much research attention. The purpose of this study is to determine the structure of the management system and entrepreneurship with respect to farm stalls in the South Western Cape, to determine the spatio-temporal diffusion as well as the influencing factors on the location of farm stalls, to identify certain characteristic product features as well as the behavioral patterns of the customers, and to assess the role of farm shops against an economic, tourism and aesthetic backdrop. Data has been analysed cartographically and correlation techniques were performed to reveal spatial trends and relationships between the relevant variables.",

The concept of generalised stochastic dominance (stochastic dominance with respect to a function) is used in the interval approach developed by King to elicit the risk attitudes of farmers at five different after tax net income levels. The risk attitude of 52 farmers in the Western and Southern Cape were elicited at two different points in time. Risk averse, risk seeking and risk indifferent attitudes were observed. The degree of intertemporal stability in risk attitudes varied between the specified income levels. There seems to be a negative relationship between the accuracy of the risk interval on the one hand and the consistency of choice on the other hand. The response to two control questions indicated a varying degree of consistency at each income level.",

Factor analysis (FA) (model) is applied on eleven income generating activities in the rural areas of the Northern Province. The principal component extraction method was used to extract five factors which reflected three patterns of farm-nonfarm relationships. The first pattern showed a complete inclination to farming activities. The two factors in this pattern involved traditional farming activities (maize and livestock sales) and diversified arable activities (sales of vegetables and other field crops). The second pattern reflected linkages to achieve the income objective (salaries and fruit sales) as well as food security (income from pensions and exchange for finished product). The last pattern pertained to nonfarm options; either business and services or wages. Programmes for rural development should aim to enhance the contribution of both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors to poverty alleviation by strengthening linkages between the sectors.",

Effective disposal of large quantities of manure from large scale feedlots is a concern. Yield data from Cedara experiment station were used to estimate a quadratic production function where maize grain yield is a function of manure and commercial fertiliser N application rates. Four rates of commercial N (0, 50, 100 and 200 kg ha−1) and five rates of composted feedlot manure (0, 5, 10, 20 and 30t ha−1, as is basis) in a factorial arrangement were applied to dryland maize. The production function estimate was used to determine the combination of composted manure and commercial N, which maximized net returns. The results suggest that a compost application rate of 15t ha−1 with 20 kg ha−1 of commercial N would be economically feasible when the price of commercial N, including application charges, is R4.50 kg−1 and the price of compost R77.20 t−1. Once the price of compost reaches R95.00 t−1 compost use is no longer economically feasible.",

On the other hand, the bias against marginal production environments and women continued under the T&V system, though at lower rates than before. Efficacy of the T&V system was also confirmed through promotion of higher adoption of improved technologies. This was mainly attributed to the effective mechanisms and better quality of information delivered through the indirect contact methods of T&V.",

The use an optimal intertemporal investment theory provides an insight into aspects of firm behaviour, including quasi-fixity of inputs, rates of adjustment of quasi-fixed inputs and short-run elasticities of factor demand for labour, capital and land. The principal empirical finding is that quasi-fixity of inputs of labour, capital and land is characteristic of agricultural production. Empirical results indicate that it takes about two years for labour, four years for capital and six years for land to adjust to their long-run optimal levels. Results indicate that investment decisions about labour, capital and land are made independently of each other. Short-run factor demand responses are inelastic with respect to own-price and cross-price of inputs used in agricultural production. The results demonstrate that changes in input and output prices are likely to have a less than proportionate impact on the demand for inputs in South African agriculture.",

In this article representative and mean farms are compared on the basis of the number of farmers that can identify with the respective farms as well as the production risk associated with each. Risk was quantified by means of a whole farm simulation model and presented by means of cumulative distribution functions. Results confirm that a significantly larger number of farmers can identify with representative farms than with a mean farm for their area. Most results obtained with the mean farm procedure reflect more risk than those obtained with the representative farms procedure when compared by means of cash flow, farm profitability and own capital ratio variability, and the probability of realizing a negative value. Significant differences therefore occur despite representative and mean farms being formulated from the same data.",

The possible impact of abolishing the Lomé Convention is also investigated. In a “Without HIV/AIDS” population growth scenario demand for beef, sheep meat and pork will increase by 12.01 per cent, 12.22 per cent, and 11.92 per cent, respectively. In a “With HIV/AIDS” population growth scenario demand will only increase by 7.19 per cent, 7.31 per cent and 7.28 per cent for beef, sheep meat and pork, respectively. Most of the increase in demand is met by overseas imports. When per capita income increases the increase in pork consumption is lower than the increases in demand for beef and sheep meat. This can be attributed mainly to the fact that the aggregated income elasticity is considerably lower for pork than it is for the other two red meats. The weifare analysis shows, firstly that HIV/AIDS will have a considerable impact on the general welfare of the country, and secondly the important role government has to play in setting the table for improved economic conditions that will result in increases in the per capita income of people. Finally, the study shows that the abolishment of the Lomé Convention will not have any severe repercussions for the beef sub-sector in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "The pace of change and development of new technology in the new millennium necessitates fast and efficient data accumulation, processing, interpretation and dissemination to maintain a competitive advantage in any information orientated field. With regards to primary data accumulation, if academic institutions stick to rigid traditional tools and not embrace changes in the information/communications revolution they will face the criticism of further irrelevancy. Traditional academic surveys are also one of the most expensive components of any research project budget. Communication technology advancements, such as electronic mail (e-mail), the Internet and Cellular phone technology such as SMS (Short Messaging Service) and WAP (Wireless Application Protocol), create an opportunity to drastically reduce survey costs and time. The use of e-mail as a potential electronic medium for conducting a survey is discussed in this paper. E-mail was chosen because of the minimal costs involved and the specific market that can be targeted. It does, however, have its own problems and limitations. The key question asked in the e-survey was: “What do South African farmers need to do to survive, and better yet: prosper, in the new millennium?” The focus of this paper is not the answers to this question, but on the methodology, shortfalls, profile of respondents, reply statistics and some netiquette tips used in the e-survey.",

    "abstract": "The average area under tea in the smallholder sub-sector is approximately 0.27 ha. The population pressure in the tea growing districts is quite high compared to the neighbouring districts without the enterprise. The robust population growth in tea graving zones translates into continued subdivision of tea firms to school leavers who cannot get alternative employment in other sectors of the economy. This scenario is a potential threat to the future of the smallholder tea production in Kenya. The problem of continued subdivision of ten farms has degenerated into what has been termed as “uneconomic tea firm sizes”. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal economic number of bushes a tea farm should have below which it would be referred to as “uneconomic tea farm size.” A profit function model was fitted on 259 smallholder farms. It is concluded that all ten farms in these subsets are more successful in responding to the set of prices they face (Price efficiency) and/or because they haw higher quantities of fixed factors of production, including entrepreneurship (technical efficiency).",

Thus, procurement for processing companies becomes more complex and the competition for local producers is increased. Local processors need to find adequate supplies at the lowest price whereas producers need to deliver at the best price. In order for processing companies to ensure sufficient quality and quantity, a good procurement strategy such as contract marketing is required. However, the characteristics of producers willing to adopt contract marketing must be identified. In order to do so, characteristics of contract producers in the Eastern Free State who used two different governance structures (contract and spot-market) were interviewed. A questionnaire was used and data were analysed with a Principal Component Regression combined with a Logit model. Out of 26 possible characteristics, nine were identified as significant (P < 0.1 or P < 0.5). The characteristics included less marketing cost, market information, only channel, less quality penalties, transport, price certainty, negotiation period, number of contacts, and less risk. Processing companies wanting to establish marketing strategies, target producers, and improve current contracts can use the nine characteristics. The characteristics can also be used to negotiate long-term contracts with producers.",

In particular, the promotional expenditure elasticity of demand and the own price elasticity of demand will be determined, the latter being important because promotional expenditure has been found to be more effective, ceteris paribus, as demand becomes less elastic. The econometric study is limited to the Australian and New Zealand markets and shows that an increase in promotional expenditure led to a slight increase in demand of 0.097%.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines seasonality in returns and volatilities in the South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX) wheat futures contract in order to seek market inefficiencies that can be exploited for financial gain. Non-parametric and parametric-based techniques are used to study sample regimes before and after the peak in wheat prices that occurred during the global economic crisis in 2008. Findings of the study indicate that wheat returns on Mondays and Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT) holidays are significant and positive while Tuesday returns are negative and significant. These seasonal patterns occur largely in the second sample of the wheat dataset. Furthermore, it is observed that volatility diminished after the global financial crisis. Finally, based on the return seasonality detected and by applying Monte Carlo simulation in an out-of-sample period, some trading rules are developed that yield higher returns than any trading approach based on chance.",

Research centred on the white maize industry. Results show that regional differences within the market for maize are of cardinal importance, making country-wide generalisations dangerous and a regional marketing strategy imperative. One of the most significant results for the strategic marketing of maize meal is that a single population estimate for income elasticity is inadequate, especially when 94% of maize meal is consumed by a single consumer group—the Black population. Indications are that for Blacks in South Africa, maize is a normal good if seen in a national context. Consequently, as incomes fall or as relative prices rise, less maize is consumed. This is supported by urban price elasticities. It is proposed that this could have had a substantial effect on maize consumption in the past and have important implications for the marketing of staple food in a new South Africa.",

Amongst others for this reason, agriculture is only reflected as a single production activity in the South African input-output tables. This may understate the possibility that a large number of production activities depend on agriculture. For this purpose the term agribusiness is introduced. A special input-output table is presented with particular emphasis on agribusiness in South Africa. This input-output table is used to highlight the relative importance of agribusiness by means of simple linkage analysis. The results show that agribusiness is relatively more important in terms of backward linkages and employment multipliers. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of a possible agriculture-demand-led industrialisation strategy. The relevance of such a strategy for South Africa remains to be seen, although certain elements are supported by the results of the simple linkage analysis.",

This floor price should be set according to a set formula based on historical trends in real price fluctuations, adjusted by the standard deviation.

By means of a qualitative study it was established that information systems approaches were available that could be applied by management of agricultural development institutions to improve their managerial functions. In recent years, variations of the information systems approach have been developed. Each level of management has distinctive managerial requirements which should be met by these systems as the situation dictates. The critical success factor approach is highly recommended. Several caveats are identified and these should not be disregarded in the implementation of information systems. The study confirms that the innovative application of existing information system techniques, will enhance managerial decision making in developing agriculture.

It was found that price unstable regions are not necessarily also risky regions as regions with higher output/Input price ratios can handle higher price variations better. The average value of the price index for the top ten regions is over 3 times larger than the average for the ten lowest regions. The higher the prices of inputs relative to output prices (the lower the price ratio), the smaller their application to each hectare of land, and the lower the land productivity. The regional prices appears to be a function of the interaction between differential natural and economic factors in different regions. Regionale uitset/inset prysverskille en variasies is bereken om prys risiko in Suid-Afrika te evalueer. Daar is gevind dat prys onstabiele streke nie noodwendig ook hoë risiko streke is nie, want streke met hoër uitset/inset prys verhoudings kan hoër prys variasies beter verwerk. Die gamiddelde waarde van die prys indeks vir die tien top streke is meer as 3 Keer groter as die gemiddeld vir die tien laagste streke. Hoe hoër die pryse van insette relatief tot uiset pryse (be Lacr die prys verhoding), hoe minder is hulle aanwading per hektaar, en hoe her die ground produktiwitcit.

Several criteria were identified and applied in the evaluation of three valuation methods for agricultural land. Special consideration was given to the possible implementation of an agricultural land tax on a regional level. Specific circumstances in each political region, for example the homogeneity of land, could result in valuation methods performing differently with respect to certain criteria. It could also be possible that in certain regions various valuation methods could be applied in a supplementary manner, provided that secondary data was available. Ultimately, whatever criteria are chosen, the impoltant premise should still be that the valuation method must reflect satisfactorily the heterogeneity between and within regions.",

    "abstract": "The financial position of farmers in the summer grain areas deteriorated drastically over the past decade. The Soil Conversion Scheme was introduced to help farmers to withdraw low potential crop land by establishing perennial pastures. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the conversion of low potential crop land from cash crop production to perennial pastures in terms of a number of objectives. Dynamic linear programming was used as analyzing technique. Typical characteristics for Western Transvaal namely budgets and other coefficients, were used as inputs to assemble a model over an eight year planning horizon. The optimal enterprise combination was determined by taking into account constraints such as quarterly cash flow, fodder flow, and tractor and labour requirements in the maximization of net operating surplus. The Target MOTAD approach was used so that the effect of risk could be considered. The results show that given the assumptions and constraints of the model and when risk is taken into account, the net operating surplus is more stable with the conversion to pastures than that with maize production. Risk thus declines, but then the farmers' ability to meet his fixed obligations deteriorates to such an extent that he cannot survive. The above shows that the Soil Conversion Scheme decreases risk but, given the assumptions and constraints of the model, it is not necessarily at present a general economically viable alternative for maize production on low potential soils.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether this aid can make a sufficient contribution to the financial recovery of this farmers. As basis for the approach in this study a typical farm was constructed for each relief scheme with data collected through a postal questionnare survey and group discussions. The North-western Free State were used as study area. A simulation model was used to determine the influence this assistance will have on the typical farm over a ten year period, with three different inflation situations. The results show that interest subsidy aid for the Ten year scheme is at present not enough to ensure the long term solvability of this farmers. If the present value of the state's expences on interest subsidies are given as a single amount for carryover debt reduction. With no further subsidies, a better solvency ratio could be achieved. With this form of aid the liquidity advantage for the farmer is larger and the state's funds are more efficiently spent. Better farming efficiency and management skills is essential to survive during a period of input cost inflation. Assistance given to improve the management quality of farmers will be the best form of aid to ensure their financial recovery.",

The model is estimated by three-stage least squares and used to simulate the dynamic impacts of an expansionary monetary policy (15 percent increase in money supply) from 1975 to 1987. In the short run, this causes real interest rates to fall, real income to rise, exchange rate to depreciate and prices to rise. Rising real incomes cause beef demand to increase and human maize consumption to fall. Depreciation of the exchange rate and higher domestic inflation raise real input prices. This impacts negatively on maize and beef supply. Higher beef prices encourage beef production, which causes animal maize demand to increase. Lower real interest rates impact positively on maize supply, negatively on beef supply, and stimulate real agricultural investment. The net effect is a decline in real gross farm income in the maize and beef sectors of South Africa.",

If there is consensus on a new GATT agreement on the basis of the current discussion document, the so-called Dunkel proposals, it will have several implications for South Africa's agricultural marketing system. This paper intends to summarise the development of negotiations in the Round and refers to the proposals for the liberalisation of world agricultural trade as detailed in the Dunkel paper. This paper shows that if these proposals were to be accepted and implemented it will amongst other things implicate that Article 87 of the Marketing Act should be abolished and that all quantitative import controls on agricultural products should be replaced by tariffs. This will have the effect that the Marketing Boards will lose their statutory powers on imported agricultural products. Apart from the effects on South African agriculture, the whole of Southern Africa would benefit from a successful completion of the Round as a failure will put the whole sub-continent in competition with strong trade-blocs in a situation where there is no organisation like the GATT guarding against unfair trading practices.",

Furthermore, the decisionmakers who completed the questionnaire at the higher levels of bank balances were significantly more consistent than those who completed the questionnaire at the lower levels. If the width over which the distributions extend, increases, the preferences of a few farmers tends to change from risk-neutral to risk-averse. By propagating the concept of probability distributions for the evaluation of risky alternatives, a beter understanding of risk and risk management can be brought about, which will result in easier obtaining of riskmeasuring results.",

It should be based on a holistic approach rather than selective deregulation that may enhance the protection of some groups and the concentrated market structure. Central considerations are motives for, and methods of, market reform. This paper evaluates privatisation and deregulation in the red meat industry and proposes alternatives. The current concentrated and vertically integrated market structure should be considered during the deregulation and the privatisation of ABACOR. A privatised ABACOR should be decoupled from regulatory protection, while appropriate regulation should secure consumer protection and fair business practices. A future role of the Meat Board in a deregulated red meat industry implies the absence of regulatory powers or group representation. Grading and hygiene standards should be decoupled from regulatory restrictions, should not be used to restrict entry into any marketing stage, be voluntary and based on free choice. Forward contracting and a futures market are possibilities in a reformed market, while market information services should be a function of the state. Successful market reform implies the absence of restrictive regulations, the promotion of competition, and performance judgement on the basis of consumer satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "This is the first local study of the linkage between export demand for deciduous fruit and South African deciduous fruit farm incomes and land prices. Export demand is expected to affect land prices through the derived demand relationship and capitalization formula. By analyzing the relative role of export demand, the study extends past research by van Wyk (1967), Behrmann and Collett (1970), Nieuwoudt (1980), Janse van Rensburg (1983) and Kassier (1985) which showed a close relationship between land prices and expected returns to farming. Ordinary Least Squares analysis of real annual farm income and land price data for the major apple producing area of Elgin in the Cape Province during 1972- 1992 supported a priori expectations of the linkage between export demand, farm income, and land prices. Lagged net revenue (total revenue less marketing costs) per hectare and lagged farmland prices per hectare had positive effects on land prices, while land prices were negatively related to lagged interest rates. When lagged net revenue per hectare was split into net export realisation revenue, net domestic realisation revenue and processing revenue, all three variables impacted positively on land prices, but only the export coefficient was statistically significant. These results imply that investor expectations about future net export revenue and interest rates, seem to drive farm land prices. Export enhancing policies to establish stable long-term export markets must account for the impact of macroeconomic linkages and global market forces on farm incomes and farm assets. Persistently high future local inflation rates could maintain downward pressure on the Rand exchange rate. Coupled with real income growth (increased demand) in developed countries, this will increase export revenues and land prices over time. New entrants will thus find it increasingly difficult to acquire farm land to produce for export markets.",

Nine PMAs were conducted with 239 farm workers in the Transvaal, Natal and the Orange Free State over the past five years.

The models are estimated using logistic regression analysis, and represent fanners' awareness of erosion occurring, perceptions that it is a problem worth resolving, and technical and financial abilities to implement appropriate soil conservation measures. Data were collected from five different commercial farming regions in KwaZulu - Natal. Results show visible erosion impacts, formal agricultural education, and perceptions reflecting the seriousness of erosion's impacts on the environment, positively influence awareness. Fanners investing their own capital when implementing soil conservation measures, and those doing this with no outside technical assistance are more likely to perceive erosion as worth resolving. Knowledge of erosion's adverse implications for agricultural productivity and the importance of extension officers for providing information on erosion and conservation decisions also influence this stage positively. Those with the technical ability to implement and maintain conservation measures regularly attend soil conservation courses, and help others implement conservation practices. Inadequate technical skills to implement soil conservation measures appears to be a major constraining factor within the adoption process. Financial ability is positively influenced by farmers' willingness to invest their own capital in conservation measures, larger proportions of fann area under crops, and perceptions reflecting on-farm financial and managerial benefits from soil conservation. Government expenditure should perhaps be targeted at extension programs to improve farmers' technical abilities to implement conservation practices, and at education and research that emphasises individual benefits of soil conservation.",

    "abstract": "In a recent report to government, an Income Equalisation Deposit (IED) Scheme for commercial farmers and crop insurance for small scale farmers have been recommended as risk management strategies. An IED has been considered in the past in South Africa but rejected largely due to tax implications. Conditions have now changed as various countries (Australia, Canada and USA) strongly promote such a scheme as a risk management strategy while the South African crop insurance program has failed to attract farmers. A main criticism of an IED in the past was that if it is used in conjunction with the In/Out farmerâ€™ tax provision, that farmers can obtain tax benefits if they destabilise their incomes. This can be avoided by adopting a tax rule that farmers may only invest the positive difference between their current taxable income and their moving average taxable income in an IED. It is further recommended that the Land Bank deposit scheme (Income Tax Paragraph 13A) be abolished and be replaced by an IED that covers both livestock, crops and horticulture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Na die deregulering van die Suid-Afrikaanse landboubemarking, is produsente self verantwoordelik vir die bemarking van hulle produkte. Verskeie bemarkingsopsies is beskikbaar vir die graanprodusent, wat daartoe lei dat die produsent toegegooi word met 'n verskeidenheid van inligting wat hy moet verwerk om die regte bemarkingsbesluit te kan neem. Heelwat literatuur bestaan oor die voordele wat bemarkingsplanne vir die produsent inhou, soos onder andere om prys- en inkomsterisiko te verlaag m.b.v bemarkingstrategieë. Produksiekoste vorm 'n integrale deel van 'n bemarkingsplan en help die produsent om pryse vas te maak sodat 'n winsgewende boerdery bedryfkan word. Die model wat hier voorgehou word, bied aan die produsent die geleentheid om 'n optimale gewaskeuse en bemarkingstrategie vir sy eie unieke situasie te ontwikkel, gegewe sy eie inherente eienskappe asook dié van sy onderneming. Die model neem onder andere produksiekoste, beskikbare bemarkingsfondse en wisselboubeperkinge in ag ten einde 'n strategie te ontwikkel wat die hoogste wins per hektaar kan voorsien. After the deregulation of the South-African agricultural marketing boards, producers are responsible for their own marketing. Various marketing options emerged due to the new marketing environment and the producer needs to take a lot of information into account in order to make the correct marketing decisions. Ample literature exists on the advantages that marketing plans can provide for the producer such as the reduction of price and income risks. Productions cost forms an integrated part of a marketing plan and helps the producer to fix prices in order to run a profitable business. The model that has been developed enhances the producer to develop an optimal crop choice and marketing strategy, given his own unique situation as well as the characteristics of his farm business. The model, for example, takes into account production costs, available marketing funds and cultivation restrictions to develop a strategy that can ensure a reasonable profit per hectare.",

    "abstract": "This article is a first attempt to understand the importance of the different export destinations and export commodities for South African agriculture. This knowledge of agricultural trade movements will now make it possible to reprioritize efforts in an agricultural export promotion strategy. The article uses a technique called the ‘growth-share’ matrix which maps countries according to their significance in South Africa's current agricultural export picture (share) and the rate at which they are becoming increasingly more or less significant (growth) in South Africa's agricultural trade. Analysis on agricultural export share and growth shows that traditional export products and countries are still important, though steadily declining. Major ships have taken place over the last decade, but especially after 1993. High growth export destinations has grown from a 31/2 % share to almost 30% share (1992 to 1996). High growth export products has grown from 31/2 % share to 33% share (1988 to 1996). The EU has systematically declined in importance as export destination. Africa has increased dramatically during the sanction years, but flattened after 1993, but it maintained a high base. South Africa's greatest opportunities for export growth are Asia and the Americas.",

If land is to be bought by the beneficiaries and they do not have any other form of capital, they will find it difficult to survive. It is recommended that the selection criteria to select beneficiaries of land reform programmes be developed very well. The sizes of the parcels on which the beneficiaries are to be settled should be big enough to be financially feasible. Another ingredient necessary for successful land reform programmes is managerial aptitude. The correct training and extension to the beneficiaries is therefore very important.",

    "abstract": "In the Botswana Labour Force Survey, agriculture was identified as the fastest growing employing industry with growth mainly driven by the entrance of women into the industry. As such, the purpose of the study was thus to investigate how the demographic profile of farm holders have changed in Botswana over time. Using Agricultural Survey Reports, the paper descriptively analyses changes in the gender and age composition of farm holders in Botswana. The study found that the industry has in fact employed a larger share of women, but that the movement of women into the industry was still largely dependent on those of men. This is evident in the fact that the share of married male and female farmers move in opposite directions. It also found that during times of distress women's share as farmers increased. The movement of men and women in the industry indicates that policies which have historically been geared towards the needs and characteristics of male farmers and their households may require gender mainstreaming to accommodate female farmers and their households. This paper opens up a debate around gendered social assistance which accommodates women not just as ordinary household members, but more specifically farmers.",

This risk can be mitigated through adherence to trade control measures such as the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, compliance with SPS measures usually results in additional production and trade costs. This paper applied cost–benefit analysis, using stochastic scenario analysis, to estimate the financial burden of SPS measures on exporting horses from South Africa to the European Union (EU). These measures were instituted following a ban on the direct export of horses from South Africa to the EU, triggered by outbreaks of African Horse Sickness (AHS) in the AHS Controlled Area in the Western Cape Province. Analysis revealed that compliance to existing SPS measures by exporting a horse via a third country is 1.67 times more costly than exporting directly to the EU. A strengthened public-private sector partnership is recommended to jointly identify the most efficient and effective ways to develop capacity for collaborative judicious investment in order to build a resilient horse industry thereby enabling employment creation and economic growth.",

However, relatively little is known about the drivers of adoption of these practices, especially for joint use. Moreover, it has been suggested that African farmers will respond to an increase in the maize price they expect to receive at the next harvest by increasing investment in their soils or altering use of SFM practices in response to input price changes. Yet previous studies largely ignore the role of prices. Using nationwide household panel survey data from Kenya, we estimate the effects of changes in crop and input prices on household use of individual SFM practices and combinations thereof. We find that Kenyan smallholders' SFM adoption decisions are largely insensitive to changes in expected maize prices. However, when inorganic fertiliser prices rise, farmers are more likely to use organic fertiliser and use less inorganic fertiliser per acre. These results suggest that price policies alone are unlikely to be effective ways to promote SI of maize production in Kenya.",

The South African Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP) model, which models a major share of agricultural output in South Africa, has also up to now not integrated input expenditure into the modelling framework. In most models, input costs are treated as exogenous and the recursive link between the input and output sides of the sector is overlooked in the models that attempt to incorporate input expenditures. This article addresses both issues by integrating agricultural input expenditures into the South African sectoral partial equilibrium model by endogenising input costs and recursively linking both the input and output sides of the agricultural sector. Thus, the impact of increasing the input cost may not only signal a fall in the gross value added and net farming income, but also a growth in subsequent years when the recursive effect of the impact is fully accounted for.",

Therefore, this paper incorporates the latter in a microeconomic model.

    "abstract": "Hierdie ondersoek fokus op die produksiepraktyk van verminderde bewerking wat gemik is op die verlaging van insetkostes. Verminderde bewerking bring 'n verandering in die meganisasiekomponent mee wat hoer vaste koste en laer veranderlike koste tot gevolg het. Die hipotese is gestel dat 'n winsverhoging wel haalbaar is en dat die praktyk van verminderde bewerking uit 'n kostebesparende oogpunt aanbevelenswaardig is vir kleingraan boerderye. 'n Gevallestudiebenadering is gevolg deur twee boerderye in elk van vier substreke in die Suid-Kaap se konvensionele en verminderde bewerkingspraktyke te ontleed en deur 'n ekspertgroep te evalueer. Ten einde die winsgewendheid van die stelsels te kan vergelyk, is 'n annuiteit van die totale huidige waarde van die bruto marge per hektaar van elke wisselboustelsel bereken. Hierdie jaarlikse winsmarges (annuiteit) per hektaar het as kriterium vir die winsgewendheidsvergelyking van elke gewaswisselboustelsel gedien. Die ontledings het getoon dat die gevallestudies se gewasrotasiestelsels aansienlik verskil vanwee grond- en klimaatverskille tussen die verskillende substreke en selfs ook binne substreke. Daar is dus geen uniforme rotasiestelsel gevind wat as 'n algemene resep toegepas word nie. Tog het die ontledings beginsels aangetoon vir die verbetering van die bewerkingspraktyke en sekere ander aksies van die gevallestudies om hul winsmarges te verhoog. Die grootste besparings het geblyk moontlik te wees ten opsigte van bewerking en die saaidigtheid van saad. Die ontledings het getoon dat 'n winsverhoging met oorskakeling na verminderde bewerking en presisie-boerdery wel haalbaar is.\nThis research focuses on the production practice of limited tillage, which is used to reduce input costs. The implementation of limited tillage causes mechanization changes, which in turn, results in higher fixed cost and lower variable cost.

No uniform crop rotation system was found that could serve as a general recipe for the region. In spite of this, some principles could be deduced from the analyses that could be followed in order to improve the cultivation and other practices so as to increase profits.

Crop rotation present a possible alternative to wheat monoculture production, of which profitability decreased since 1996. The advantage of crop rotation is mainly increasing yields and savings on inputs like fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. Information was obtained by making use of the Delphi technique and group discussions whereby a multi dissiplinary team of experts were involved. The internal rate of return (IRR) was used as financial criterium in calculating the expected profitability of each of the eight crop rotation systems being researched. Of the eight systems the most profitable one is expected to be one consisting of wheat being rotated with medic and clover mixtures as grazing for livestock. The profitability analysis of the alternative crop rotation systems as well as the financial implications of the implementation thereof in the practical farming situation was performed with the aid of typical farming models of the region.",

Based on this argument, a framework is proposed whereby intuitive logic scenario thinking is applied in conjunction with stochastic econometric modelling in order to mitigate this weakness. A case study is presented whereby the proposed framework is applied, to show the success of applying the framework given the current turmoil experienced in the general economy as well as in agricultural commodity markets. The case study results indicate that the application of the proposed framework should lead to improved decisions with respect to policy and business strategy pertaining to agricultural commodity markets, despite increased uncertainty.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this paper the nature of diversity that exists with regard to food consumption in the Free State Province is investigated. Furthermore, this paper also investigates the factors (quality attributes and household characteristics) differentiating these market segments from one another. Four separate steps were followed in an integrated manner in the investigation. Firstly, a representative sample was drawn for the Free State Province food consumers. Households are then segmented into smaller submarkets. The second step involved the use of principal component analysis to correct for the strong and prevalent underlying structure with respect to household preferences. In the final step, a binary logit model was applied to analyse the determinants of the market segments’ food consumption. Five market segments are prevalent in the Free State Province, namely: Cluster 1 (34.7%) – inferior-product consumers; Cluster 2 (23.6%) – at-home (basics) consumers; Cluster 3 (26.6%) – balanced consumers; Cluster 4 (12.3%) – value-added-oriented consumers, and Cluster 5 (2.6%) – high-frequency consumers (broad product range). The final logit model that was applied consisted broadly of economic and non-economic variables. The results show that significant differences prevail amongst the five market segments, for both economic and non-economic variables included in the model. Producers, marketers and other participants in the food value chain can use this as a basis from which appropriate marketing strategies could be developed, formalised and implemented.

    "abstract": "Abstract Lending and financial institutions have looked for a variety of ways to expand their portfolios into agriculture, but because of the risks associated with lending to farmers who lack traditional forms of collateral, they face price and yield risks, causing these inroads to be limited. Market-based instruments are readily available for price risk. Organised exchanges offering the most basic of these instruments, futures and options, have operated for a long time, providing transparency to the market and low-cost risk transfer tools for those able to access them. While the use of price risk management instruments is an incomplete solution, it has sufficient merits on its own and will make the overall burden of risk more bearable. The use of these instruments and multi-peril crop insurance products is expensive and does not provide full protection for financial lending institutions to limit their credit risk exposure. This article determines whether geographic diversification would be sufficient as a risk management tool for lending institutions to limit their credit risk.",

Data from 244 questionnaires from 36 family farms were collected and analysed. Three factors with eigen-values greater than one were extracted, explaining 63.56% of the variance, describing the theoretical dimensions of the dependent variable family harmony and the independent variables existence of family forums and conflict management. The impact of the existence of family forums and conflict management on family harmony was examined by means of multiple linear regression analysis. The results indicate that a significant proportion of the variation in family harmony among family members in family farms is explained by the existence of family forums and the management of conflict among family members. The findings thus indicate that family harmony among family members in the participating family farms is related to the existence of family forums and conflict management. Practical recommendations are made to improve family relationships in family farming businesses.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper considers epistemology in economics, looking at the ways in which theory, observation and measurement are combined. Agricultural economics is a policy science and so scientific research programmes operate simultaneously with political action programmes. Taking policy positions and advising government makes scientific detachment impossible. With this as background progress in production economics is considered, especially regarding technology, productivity and the returns to R&D. The position taken is that progress has been considerable and we can by now measure technological progress and show how it is generated by agricultural R&D. Almost all the studies show that this is an investment with a high rate of return. The main point of the study is that almost all the agricultural economics research that has made this possible was conducted in the USA, where the theory and data were in place when needed to convince the politicians that public funding should be maintained at adequate levels. The payoff is that agricultural productivity has grown monotonically in the USA. The UK case shows the costs of our profession failing to mount an effective political action programme in the area at time of Mrs Thatcher's cuts in the early 1980s. The result was about sixteen years of negative productivity growth. This should act as a warning for South Africa, which is pretty clearly cutting R&D and following the UK productivity path. These failures are so costly, it is odd that only USA seems to have the knowledge and funding required for steady productivity growth.",

    "abstract": "This paper contributes to the discussion on the economics and factors determining widespread soyabean production by smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. Agronomic research carried out in several tropical countries has concluded that here is potential for increasing small farm soyabean production through adoption of improved varieties, and management practices such as appropriate nitrogen and phosphorus fertitiser placing and application rates, appropriate planting time and seed inoculation. However, it has been argued that if soyabean was consumed in various forms at the household level, leading to improvement in family nutrition and income, this would provide the incentive for widespread adoption. Introduction of appropriate processing technologies and information would be critical factors for adoption. As a result effort been invested in research on-farm processing to encourage home use. This paper looks at factors determining increased soyabean production by smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe. It is based on a longitudinal study of a progrmme for promoting smallholder soyabean production through transfer and adoption of improved production technologies and promotion of home processing and use of soyabean products. The findings of the study suggest that there is limited scope for expansion of soyabean as an immediate food crop at the household level. Home use and load demand for processed soyabean products are not a sufficient stimulus for widespread adoption. If the farmers can fit soyabeans into their farming system, the potential for increased production is a cash crop.",

Multiple regression is used to estimate models representing intra-panel soil conservation adoption and soil conservation effort. Results show that farmers have greater conservation adoption and effort on their relatively steeper panels and implement soil conservation plans on these panels first. Amongst other factors, education and use of extension information sources are positively related to both conservation adoption and effort, and soil conservation decisions are constrained by financial resources, management time and farmers' technical abilities.",

Governments have traditionally preferred controlling floods by physical structures. However, flood damage increases over time, partially induced indirectly by these structures, and institutional problems are quite common. Communities have historically not been involved, and inadequate attention has been bestowed on ecological aspects of floods and flood management. Future policy should aim at sustainable flood management, with an institutional system that facilitates sustainability. The paper outlines a framework within which such policy can be developed.",

The relative price elasticity of export demand was inelastic in both the short- and long-run, indicating that Capespan International and other future exporters may need to diversify fresh orange exports to alternative export markets to increase real revenue.

A sectoral mathematical model was developed to analyse the economic impact of changes in the market for stockfeed proteins on the South African animal feed market. The model was used to simulate the effects of arbitrarily chosen scenarios on key parameters. Results indicate that models, such as these, are indispensable planning tools in situations of uncertainty. Relatively small changes in important things like production costs, yields and international prices often have profound influences on local production patterns and profitability. It clearly illustrates that in an environment of free domestic trade and increased international trade liberalisation, factors outside of agricultural policy have much larger impacts than agricultural policy.",

If food security involves food availability, accessibility, stability and the utilization of food in a nutritious manner by households, it is important to examine food production stability and consumption diversification as important determinants of food security. This paper examines these relationships in the UEMOA countries. The results indicate relatively stable food productions and weak consumption diversification. As a result the food security levels in the union are overall moderate or low. Thus agricultural policies should focus on existing and potential opportunities that enhance food production and consumption diversification and competitiveness in the Union.",

The opening of markets between states within a selected region through regional integration has led to a feel flow of factors and greater economic efficiency, although such regional integration regime is likely to lead to lower economic efficiency than world-wide integration. It is often further argued that regional economy created through integration should be more open for intra-regional trade than for inter-regional trade. The analysis based on a \"distance indicator\" developed by Chevassus-Lozza & Gallezot (1995) and using time-series agricultural trade data for 1983–1993 indicates that the agricultural exports structure of the ECOWAS is complementary, whereas its imports structure is competitive. Moreover, the agricultural exports structure between the ECOWAS and the EEC is complementary due to its specialisation within the two unions. Its imports structure is not conclusive. These results provide strong evidence for future regional co-operation in Africa.",

A study was commissioned to determine the strategic success factors, approaches and options of the major beef and sheep meat exporting industries of the world for extrapolation on Namibia. The most common business strategy involves cost orientation, although a differentiated focus strategy with innovative and branded products targeted into niche markets is clearly needed for Namibian businesses.

Two years after completion of the last plan a research project was conducted to determinc the extent of plan implementation, reasons for deviations from planned proposals, and guidelines for future planning endeavours. In another research project, farmers' performance, based on their management practices, was measured. A scale that measured mangement aptitude was adapted and used to measure farmers' management performance. The latter was expressed in terms of the farmers' performance index (PI), and it was found that large differences occurred in the PI among farmers (between 27,6 and 99,5). To accommodate all cases, the farmers were divided into three groups according to PI. Statistically significant differences (but not in all cases) were found between farmers with different biographies, as well as between farmers with certain management practices. These differences are related to the implementation of new farming systems and the relevance for future use is discussed.",

An analysis using a Cobb-Douglas form of production function was performed for the major inputs farmers used on their dairy animals. Results revealed that concentrates were being used inefficiently. This implied that there were potential gains which could accrue from reallocation of this resource. However, it was noted that there was efficiency in the use of operating capital, hired and family labour and farm by-products. This implies that, for those inputs used efficiently, further development in agriculture can be achieved only through the introduction of more modern technologies than those currently used. These could include new inputs, apicultural education, special skills and techniques, and competent guidance in farm planning.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The ex post and ex ante approaches are commonly used to estimate flood damage. During the most recent phase of flood damage research carried out by researchers of the Department of Agricultural Economics (UOFS), the ex post and ex ante approaches were integrated to estimate flood damage in the Mfolozi floodplain. Flood damage determined with the ex post approach were used firstly to calibrate loss functions and secondly to validate n flood damage simulation model that is used in the ex ante determination of flood damage. It was found that the integration of the two approaches served to overcome some of the shortcomings of focusing on either approach separately. The aim of this paper is to discuss the methodological framework of the integration of the two approaches, to present the reined and to share the conclusions reached regarding the benefits of the integration of the ex post and ex ante approaches. Die ex post en ex ante benaderings word algemeen toegepas om vloedskade te bepaal. Gedurende die mees onlangse fase van vloedskadenavorsing deur navorsers van die Departement Landbou-ekonomie (UOVS), is die ex post en ex ante benaderings geintegreer om vloedskade in die Mfolozi vloedulakte te bepaal. Vloeskade wat met die ex post benadering bepaal is, is gebruik om verliesfunksies te kalibreer, asook ont die vloedskndesimulasiemodel, wat aangewend word ont vloedskade volgens die ex ante benadering te bepaal, te valideer. Met die integrering van die twee benaderings was dit moontlik om sommige van die tekortkominge van die afsonderlike toepassing van die benaderings, te bowe te kom. Die doe1 van die artikel is om die metodologiese raamwerk van die integrering van die twee benaderings uiteen te sit, om resultate wat behaal is weer te gee en om die gevolgtrekkings met betrekking tot die integrering van die ex post en ex ante benaderings, te bespreek.",

    "abstract": "Dairy goats appear to be the most suitable milk producing animal species for the arid parts of the Eastern Cape Province. Dairy goats fetch high net returns to a small-scale farmer. A study was carried out to evaluate the long-term economic viability of investments in dairy goats, in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Results of the study show that commercial production of dairy goats, together with a milk processing plant in the region, would be profitable and would have benefits from both economic and social points of view as well as for the environment. With a discount rate of 15%, the Net Present Worth (NPW), Benefit/Cost ratio (B/C) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) were found to be R4.3 million, 1.44 and 54% respectively. Further, a sensitivity analysis to changes in benefits and costs of inputs was conducted. This found the above proposal to be viable, even when benefits are reduced by 25%. The project proposal was still viable when cost of inputs was inflated by 25%. In both cases, the Benefit/Cost ratio is greater than 1 and IRR is greater than the current market rate of interest. However, the combined effect of reducing the benefit by 25% and inflating costs by 25%, would result in negative NPW. Results from a survey carried out further show the possibility and viability of producing satisfactory levels of milk from dairy goats in the Eastern Cape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Market-based environmental policies have been forwarded as alternatives to current pollution control policies. Implementation of the “polluter pays” principle and governmental enforcement of pollution clean-up have led to astronomical environmental liabilities and clean-up costs, which may threaten the survival of many productive ventures, unless producers can spread pollution risk through insurance. An emission constrained target MOTAD LP (TMLP) model showed that pollution insurance for irrigation farmers can be a feasible and efficient solution to agricultural salinization problems in the Loskop Valley, and fairly low salinity standards with pollution insurance will still be reconcilable with profitable farming. Pollution insurance appears to hold promise for applying the “polluter pays” principles also to non-point pollution. Site specific studies are needed for pollution policy, and more research is needed on pollution standards. Markgebaseerde omgewingsbeleidsopsies was voorgehou as alternatief vir huidige besoedelingsbeheerbeleid. Toepassing van die “besoedelaar betaal” beginsel en owerheids-afdwinging van besoedelingsopruiming het gelei tot astronomiese omgewingsaanspreeklikheid en opruimingskoste en dit kan die oorlewing van baie produksie-eenhede bedreig tensy produsente hul besoedelingsrisiko deur versekering kan versprei. 'n Emissie beperkende doelwit MOTAD LP model het getoon dat besoedelingsversekering vir besproeiingsboere 'n haalbare en doeltreffende oplossing vir landboukundige versoutingsprobleme in die Loskopvallei kan wees en dat redelik lae versoutingstandaarde tesame met besoedelingsversekering steeds met winsgewende boerdery versoenbaar sal wees. Dit lyk of besoedelingsversekering belofte toon vir die toepassing van “besoedelaar betaal” beginsels, ook by nie-punt besoedeling. Plek-spesifieke studies word vir besoedelingsbeleid benodig en meer navorsing oor besoedelingstandaarde is nodig.",

Institutions were quickly established to facilitate the required adjustments to a market economy. Privatisation of most firms (farms), which was an intricate and costly procedure, was accomplished within five years and resulted in a completely new farm structure in the new federal states. By 1996 over 80 percent of agricultural enterprises comprised private (individual) operations (cultivating 22 percent of land), 9,1 percent partnerships (22 percent of land), while about 3000 legal entities managed 56 percent of farm land. About 90 percent of farmland in the new states is being rented compared to 47percent in the old states. Significantly, leasing and not selling became the most important method to privatise land in the new federal states. In 1996 the number of farming operations in Germany totalled about 540000. While worker employment in German agriculture is steadily decreasing, worker productivity is increasing—from 17 hectares of farm land per full-time equivalent worker (FTE) in 1991 to 43 hectares per FTE in the new states in 1996.",

The market access (and their interactions) involved cash market, exchange for finished product, and value adding at household level, while the nonfarm income responses emanated from local sources, commuting, and migration. The results reflect that nonfarm incomes are trot crucial when fanners have access to all market options, since they can generate both income and ensure food security from farming. However, when markets are not fully accessible, nonfarm incomes (from migrants and local sources) tend to play a supplementary role. By the nature of its entrance requirements, income from commuting is not a result of conditions in the markets. Nonetheless, there is enough evidence of the existence of linkages between conditions in agricultural markets and engagement in nonfarm income. To enhance such linkages would require provision of infrastructure, communications, information and transport networks.",

Generating agricultural resource information on a regional level provides the challenge of integrating vast amounts of information from the various countries, implying storing, retrieving and manipulating it to determine areas best suited to grow a particular crop; or various crops that can be grown in a particular area. A Geographical Information System (GIS) has been developed as part of a broader project to assess the agricultural potential of SADC countries from a physical-biological-climatological point of view. Crop suitability maps obtained from the GIS containing information on resource quality, combined with transport modelling to add information on transport cost, can be used by private sector institutions for location decisions and the public sector for planning the provision of physical and social infrastructure. Incorporating resource data of the whole region implies that the available data on the climate, topography and soils of most of the SADC countries is coarse which only allows analyses on a national and regional level.",

The conclusions drawn are: • that the opportunity cost of the Coega IDZ and Port Project is high, especially in terms of sustainable employment, • that government should consider more carefully what the most efficient ways are of exploiting the natural capital of the area (the alluvial soils, the coastline and the supplies of fresh water), • that if conflicts of interest between private sector interests are likely, there are dangers in development initiatives based on private-public partnerships, and • that the heavy industry currently proposed for the Coega IDZ may limit the scope for future industrial developments in the area, by using up much of the ‘safe’ waste assimilating capacity of the air",

In Lesotho the impact of deregulation on producers, consumers and government revenues was substantially lower than it should have been, and as a result Lesotho was not able to reap the full benefits of these changes. This is partly because information on the changes to the maize marketing system did not reach the potential beneficiaries of the new system. Free and easily accessible information is an essential element of a free market system. SACU countries must ensure the availability of information if they want to compete internationally.

In Lesotho was die impak van deregulering op produsente, verbruikers en regerinsinkomste aansienlik kleiner as wat dit moes wees en Lesotho was daarom nie in staat om die volle voordeel uit hierdie veranderings te behaal nie.

Deficit irrigation was modelled through scaling functions in the CCLP model, and potential return flow was calculated from optimal water application efficiencies. Results showed that increasing water application efficiency may be economically beneficial; however, the illusion might be created that water was conserved, while potential return flow was reduced. Deficit irrigation conserves water because water consumption decreases more than potential return flow. Deficit irrigation was economically advantageous only if larger areas are irrigated with the conserved water. Both strategies had substantial economic advantages if larger areas were irrigated with conserved water, but they did exert more pressure on streamflow levels. Before policies can be formulated that are of social importance, more information is required with regard to the mutual interaction among water legislation, water policy administration, technology, hydrology and human value systems.",

Hail occurrence in low and high risk areas was considered as the production risk, with Short-term Crop Hail Insurance (SCHI) and a Contingency Policy (Self-insurance) in the Alternative Risk Transfer (ART) market as insurance options. A financial simulation model was built to simulate the cash flow of a maize enterprise and to calculate the producer’s annual margin after interest and tax. Stochastic Efficiency with Respect to a Function (SERF) was used to rank Net Present Value (NPV) of the margin after interest and tax for different scenarios of Certainty Equivalents (CE’s) and to calculate the Utility Weighted Risk Premium (UWRP) of each scenario. The model could evaluate the effectiveness of crop insurance products. The SCHI was the preferred option in Mpumalanga (high hail risk area) and ART in North West (low hail risk area) based on the cost effectiveness of the options. The ART, however, was not able to provide constant cover at all times and the long term efficiency thereof should be carefully considered before it is applied as the sole hail risk mitigation strategy.",

A bivariate probit model is applied to account for the simultaneity of participation decisions of both male and female members of farm households. The results of the analysis show that human capital variables such as health and training on non-farm activities have a positive effect on the off-farm participation decisions of male members of farm households. The education status of the head has no significant impact on the participation decisions of the members of the family as most of the off-farm activities do not require formal education. The availability of credit and transfer income is the other factors that have a positive impact on the decisions of male members to participate in off-farm activities. The effects of family and farm characteristics are also analysed. Finally, policies that aim to increase the off-farm work participation decisions of family members should take into consideration the difference in responses to the various factors that affect the off-farm work decisions of male and female members of farm households.",

The trader margin for milled rice is found to be 10.20% on average. Using an econometric system of four equations, the null hypothesis of competitive behaviour holds at different price elasticities of farm supply, ranging from inelastic to elastic supply. This implies that there is no evidence that rice traders apply oligopsony power when procuring milled rice from farmers. However, since the study does not examine the existence of trader bargaining power, we cannot completely rule out the existence of market power at this node of the value chain. Therefore, future studies should examine trader bargaining power to be able to ultimately determine if there is need to intervene at this segment of rice value chains to ensure competitive behaviour.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTWine is a highly-valued-added end product of an important agricultural value chain. In this product category, the single-serve wine by-the-glass (WBG) option in restaurants presents a largely underutilized business opportunity. Academic research examining consumer behavioural psychology-based constructs in the situational consumption context of restaurants, has also not kept pace with this market reality. Hence, this study establishes how product involvement, risk perception, and information processing, affect consumption of WBG by consumers in the situational milieu of restaurants. Following scale validation by conducting confirmatory factor analysis and thereafter fitting a structural equation model, the relationships between constructs are examined by utilising a sample of 1,038 South African consumers representative of dining across all restaurant categories. The findings contribute to the literature by showing that distinct motivational relationships exist between the involvement and perception of risk constructs and information-related behaviour of consumers engaging with the WBG option in restaurants. The stable nature of consumers' enduring involvement with wine products evokes motivational processing by triggering situational involvement upon purchasing WBG and perception of risk arousal of both the cognitively-evaluated (psychological, social and functional) and non-cognitively-evaluated (financial, physical and time) risk types.KEYWORDS: Product involvementrisk perceptionmotivational processinformation-related behaviourrestaurantsWine by-the-glassWBGSouth Africa Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationFundingThis work was supported by National Research Foundation: [Grant Number 109156].",

The purpose of the survey was to: 1) assess the current local market demand, 2) obtain baseline information on purchases of these products, 3) test a methcdology for doing rural market surveys. The survey area was selected because it was a potential site for new milk or poultry production. Villagers were systematically selected (every 5th) from a list of names provided by the village chief, and interviewed by enumerators. villagers were informed as to the purpose of the survey and were forthcoming as to current and potential future purchases. Responses concerning current purchases seemed reasonable and reliable, however, responses concerning future purchases seemed to be over stated. Most of the milk purchased was long life, followed by fresh unpasteurized, sour milk and other types of milk. In contrast fresh milk was preferred to long life by a ratio of 5 to 1. Most of the poultry purchased was live chickens, followed by whole frozen and frozen chicken parts, preferences were also in this order. Purchases of milk was inelastic relative to household cash income, household surplus income and household size. Purchase of milk did not increase with increasing per capita income (household income divided by household size). As income rose, purchase of poultry also rose. The elasticity of poultry purchases was evident with increasing household income. Salary income or surplus income were poorer predictors of poultry purchases than total income. This suggests that income from non-salaried sources (sale of beer, crafts, and business) was preferentially spent on poultry.",

The degree of the development of such an adaptation depends on the value of the information passed on to the clients. The provision of appropriate and relevant information is, besides the conceptual framework on which it is developed, also influenced by the underlying institutional and operational frameworks. There are two distinct paradigms in the agricultural extension sphere of the RSA e.g. the technical-educational and economic, each with their own separate institutions. As a result of the total dominance of the technical-educational paradigm, the economic paradigm has not come into its own with the resultant poor development of both formal information systems and the managerial resource in agriculture. The ineffectiveness of the agricultural extension framework in the RSA in terms of the generation of information is further enhanced by the existence of separate departments of agriculture for each paradigm, with the result that extension is not being presented in a holistic (systems based) manner. The proposed holistic and therefore multi-disciplinary approach to agricultural extension in the RSA should be viable within the to be instituted regional agricultural development centres under a single department of agriculture.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Futures trading serves a useful economic purpose because, in an uncertain world, someone must assume a speculative role for there to be production and distribution. An economy based on private property gins people leeway in what they choose to awn. One's choice is dictated by many considerations including alternative opportunities to produce and to invest. A key point is that a producer's capital commitments (ownership) for production can be lessened by renting durable assets or by contracting with others to provide needed services. Whoever owns the durable or single-use goods assumes the responsibility for any gains or losses arising out of the changing market value of these goods. In agriculture, forward contracts are a major way to shift ownership responsibility for commodities on to different people or firms. A futures contract is nothing more than a particular type of forward contract, namely one that is traded under special rules and regulations of an organiscd commodity exchange and the Government, and each contract for a particular commodity and market place is identical. There is little or nothing that can be accomplished through organised futures trading in a commodity that cannot be accomplished without it. However, the costs and inconvenience are often much less through futures trading if the market is functioning properly. The protection of their own interests by farmers may prohibit the proper development of futures markets in the Republic of South Africa.",

These decreases represent the normal interaction between an increase in supply and a disproportionate increase in demand. Farmers' decisions three years ago to produce more beef and mutton because of increasing prices and improved fanning conditions, caused initial high prices because less animals were slaughtered. Producers increased herd sizes by decreasing the number of animals slaughtered, especially the number of female cattle. At present the industry is experiencing a typical post-herd building phase with significant cyclical lows in prices. Decreasing producer prices are stimulated by an inability of consumers to effectively react on decreasing prices because of harsh economic conditions, putting their spending ability under pressure. At the same time mutton producer prices are declining and more momentum is to the decrease in producer prices by the decrease in wool prices. Given the normal cyclical behaviour of the beef and mutton industries it can be expected that the current cyclical low in prices are to continue for at least a couple of years.",

Concentration of imports to and exports from the SACU have increased over time. Changes in intra-regional trade are dominated by the EU. The high level of concentration and intra-regional trade is mainly a result of trade agreements such as Lomé. This has led to greater inequality with respect to beef trade. Beef producers in the SACU are vulnerable to changes in EU trade policy. Trade relations between South Africa and Namibia are intense, but not between South Africa and Botswana. Botswana prefers to trade with the rest of the world and specifically the EU. Beef trade with the rest of the world is becoming more important for South Africa, and this must be disturbing to Namibian beef producers. Producers from Botswana and Namibia are very dependent on their market in the EU, which they obtained through the Lomé Convention. This situation is however not sustainable and clearly shows the impact of EU policies on the region.",

However, for particular reasons this form of business is subject to certain limitations when compared with the company form of business. Inherent business problems may arise as a result of these limitations which can not be resolved with-in the co-operative structure. One such problem is the relative inability of agricultural cooperatives to form sufficient own capital. A further problem arises when members tend to look upon their co-operative as an investment institution. In an endeavour to find a solution to these problems, conversion to another form of enterprise is often considered. Such action however, holds both advantages as well as disadvantages for the several interest parties i.e. the members and management of the co-operative, the co-operative as business undertaking, the State and the newly formed enterprise. This action may also prejudice the original aims of the members which they had in mind when forming the co-operative.",

Wheat yields for five irrigation scheduling strategies, differing in respect of sophistication, were simulated for eleven years by means of the PUTU9-87 model on soils with profile available water capacities of 45,100 and 160 mm. The annual fixed and variable irrigation costs of a 60-hectare centre pivot with a gross application capacity of 12 mm per day and a static pumping height of 10 metres on sandy and clay soils were estimated by means of a computer programme. Generalised stochastic dominance was used as criterion to select risk-efficient imgation scheduling strategies for wheat. Robinson's computer programme was used for the analyses. On an enterprise level it was found that decision-makers who fall into different categories of risk sensitivity differ in respect of the choice of irrigation scheduling strategy which maximises their particular preferences. In general, a risk-aversive farmer prefers a scheduling strategy that applies more water more quickly, in contrast to a risk-seeking farmer.",

The paper investigates whether the farmers' behaviour complies with economic theory—if they respond in an economically rational manner—when they produce a crop both as a staple and cash crop. A Nerlovian partial adjustment lagged model was used to estimate the maize supply response of farmers in the Middledrift district of the Eastern Cape to changes in product prices. The results indicate that producers are responsive to price incentives and their response is elastic in both the short (1,23) and long run (1,41). The coefficient of adjustment which measures the speed of adjustment is 0,87. The prices of maize and the competing crop (sorghum) and the areas under maize in the preceding season are found to be important factors to the producers in their land allocation decision making process. The model therefore shows that farmers to changes in product prices to product price changes to changes in product prices.",

Ordinary and generalized stochastic dominance criteria are used as decision-making criteria. Eighteen typical centre pivot systems were identified on the basis of differences in capacity, size, pumping height and soil type. The estimated net present values for a wheat/maize/cotton rotation crop system were calculated for each investment by taking production and price risks into consideration. Stochastic dominance criteria facilitate the selection of the risk-efficient strategies that will be preferred by different decision-makers, on the basis of the total probability distributions of Outcomes. In most cases stochastic dominance of the first degree gives a single strategy which is dominant. Only by using the generalized stochastic dominance criterion can investment strategies be placed in order of preference. However, in this case decision-makers with varying degrees of risk-sensitivity do not differ in respect of centre pivot investment strategies that would satisfy their spesific preferences.",

Based on consensus estimates of changes in world prices of agricultural commodities resulting from the Uruguay Round, the effects of the Round on Africa's trade are quantified using a simple economic model under alternative assumptions regarding the adjustment of real exchange rates, adoption of economic policy reforms to reduce the bias against agriculture in Africa, and compliance of countries in the region with the Uruguay Round requirement for the tariffication of administered restrictions on imports of agricultural goods.",

The paper analyses the South African problem within the context of the needs and constraints facing smallholder farmers and rural dwellers in developing areas to secure access to markets. Development strategies are briefly proposed arguing the need for comprehensive farmer support programmes. Farming Systems Research and Extension (FSR/E) is identified as an important element of any Farmer Support Programme (FSP). The role of FSR/E in the proposed development strategy is analysed and it is concluded that FSR/E should have as its ultimate goal, the promotion of economic, social and structural change induced by technological transformation at all levels in the rural community. Lessons from five FSR/E studies in South Africa are highlighted emphasizing: a) identification for research into farmer support systems, community support systems, farmer settlement systems, and commercial fanning systems; b) differences in respect of decision-making responsibilities of individuals, groups and households, vis-a-vis implementation responsibilities; c) support specifically structured toward women; d) position and role of livestock and multiple cropping systems and risk avoidance; and e) the need for development goals to be clearly defined and principles and criteria to be followed when considering FSR/E projects. It is further argued that the present South African initiatives in developing a new research policy offers an unique opportunity to restructure research linking institutions in a network where appropriate technological innovation and delivery is attended to.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wheat is the second most important field crop grown in South Africa in terms of gross value. Most of the wheat produced is consumed in the form of bread which is one of the main staple foods in South Africa. Wheat is currently marketed under a one channel fixed price system. However in recent years there has been a trend to a more free market approach to the marketing of agricultural produce. Therefore the consequences of alternative marketing policies for wheat warrant investigation. For this purpose a regional mathematical programming model was developed with the objective of simulating the wheat industry. The model includes negative-sloping demand functions for various crops, substitution in demand between wheat and maize and risk in terms of variance-covariance matrices. It was found that average yield data could be misrepresentative when used in risk analysis. Therefore, where possible, a pled data set was used. The results show that the model successfully simulates production in the main wheat growing regions of South Africa. This is shown by the estimated shadow price of land being similar to actual rents and by percentage absolute deviations of 12,2 per cent and 6,3 per cent between actual and predicted land use and production respectively. It is concluded that the model would be useful for policy research.",

Lagged wool and mohair prices and rainfall are important variables that influence farmers' decisions to produce wool. The previous years' wool production is less important because of the biological lag associated with production. Other variables such as the marketing arrangements of wool and domestic policies might influence farmers' decisions to produce wool but were not considered in detail.",

Characteristics of an ideal marketing system are discussed followed by a discussion of the marketing possibilities of dry beans given the realities of demand and supply and market concentration. The market realities of demand and supply show that the dry bean market does not have the characteristics suitable for control and that a single channel marketing system will therefore not be appropriate. Only measures which would assist the market in achieving higher efficiency should be considered.",

Six such systems in general use were identified and with the aid of crop growth simulation models and weather input data long-term yield data were generated. The economic results of the various systems were evaluated for a period of 24 years (1960 to 1983) for a hypothetical farming unit of 600 ha. The various systems were evaluated in respect of gross farm production value, margin above variable costs, net farm income and farm profit, based on the average yields for the period at 1983 prices. The annual farm profit figures, purchasing power and financial risk were also evaluated. It appears that the protracted wheat fallow system is the most economic of the six. It is also clear that the financing risk can be reduced for both the farmer and the financial institution by coupling the granting of loans to the physio-biological aspects of a fanning unit. Furthermore, recommendations of crop choices based mainly on gross margins are laden with potential dangers.",

The case study method was used to collect the data from 33 workers and the manager by means of the staff management audit technique. With the guidance of an instructor, the workers used a block and peg apparatus to register their perceptions in respect of 37 staff management factors. The staff management audit technique is a practical and reliable instrument for registering unskilled workers' perceptions of staff management. • The workers generally experience a benevolent authoritative staff management system. A situational management approach should be applied to change the job attitudes of the workers effectively as their perceptions of the eight basic staff management characteristics differ to a reasonable extent. The staff management system can be improved by correcting the identified counter-productive forces. The application of the staff management audit in this particular way, where the workers as well as the manager are audited, gives reliable and meaningful results.",

Bean breeders should thus not use grain color or size as important indicators of consumer preferences unless strong tradition indicates otherwise.

The case study method was used to collect the staff management audit data from a farmer and 47 farm workers. The staff management audit form contains 19 questions which measure the staff's experiences and expectations in respect of staff management. The staffs job experiences differ to a considerable extent from their job preferences in respect of the leadership, motivation, communication, human relations and performance system in the firm, and consequently their productivity and job satisfaction could improve appreciably. Factors such as the hierarchical post level of the worker or type of work, age, ethnicity, period of service and degree of westernisation as measured by years of experience on farms in the Republic of South Africa, can explain the differences between the staffs job experiences and expectations to a limited extent only.",

More rigorous economic analyses are required on the present and emerging problems of society. The challenges facing agricultural economists in South Africa are daunting and more scholarly papers are required on these issues. The rigour of economic discipline, coupled with the refereeing process in scholarly journals, will promote research ethics based on objectivity and the search for truth. These are especially relevant where policy issues are politicized. The availability of sophisticated computer programmes has led to the repetitive application of research technology. The MOTAD technique, for example, now appears to be going out of fashion. More theoretical insight and better research tools are required.",

The aim of the paper is to identify the individual environmental constraints that could effect the farming enterprise and agricultural development. A stratified randomized sample of 30 black commercial farmers in Lebowa was included in a questionaire survey. The following important constraints were identified: farmers age and low educational level; lack of managerial abilities in certain functional areas; the traditional land occupation system; small size of land holdings; shortage of irrigation water and labour; and insufficient credit and marketing facilities.",

    "abstract": "Political change has engendered a new regional dispensation which poses development problems and also challenges. Survival and sustainability are key requirements for human security. Modern approaches to regional development favour a bottom-up approach, with local and regional authorities shouldering the main responsibility. The South African government has only recently started to emphasise the need for economic growth as prerequisite for achieving basic needs and human development. The RDP alludes to the importance of a balance between growth and equity. It will have to cope with structural regidities in the South African economy. International competitiveness must be improved by industrial and trade reforms, employment growth must be accelerated, education needs improvement, South Africa must achieve monetary and fiscal stability, reduced inflation, increased savings and an attack on poverty. A new approach to regional development is needed. Although recent agricultural policy statements emphasise a balance efficiency and equity, the accent is already on improved access to previously excluded groups, particularly in terms of marketing development, research, finance, extension and human resource development. Regional development will be profoundly influenced by the type of power given to regional governments, fiscal relationships between regional and national governments, regional disparities, institutional factors and relationships with NGO's and civics. It is within this framework that agricultural economists must shape their contributions to the RDP.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Schumpeter claims that the entrepreneur—who occasionally succeeds with a new bundle of innovations to set a process of Creative Destruction in motion—is in effect responsible for the dynamic character of capitalism. He was, nonetheless, of the opinion that entrepreneurial capitalism cannot survive its own success because it produced by virtue of its very success social and cultural by-products which will create circumstances that in the long run will not be conducive to providing that kind of protection, support and acknowledgement the entrepreneur needs. Because of the rise of large-scale corporative enterprises, the agricultural sector is today one of the few sectors in which the business form of owner-entrepreneur is still commonly in use. South Africa is at present experiencing a powershift toward a new dispensation. In the next 10 or 20 years a pluralistic network of power blocks must be brought about with the capacity to have a countervailing effect on one another. If this can be accomplished it will not only give structure and stability to the situation, but can also create CIRCUMSTANCES that will be conducive to the deployment of Schumpeterian entrepreneurship in the a agricultural sector. Even if such favourable conditions could be created for agriculture, it will still demand high standards of resourcefulness, adaptability and farsightedness of the entrepreneur if he really wants to succeed. Uittreksel Schumpeter beweer dat die entrepreneur—wat telkens met 'n bondel innovasies slaag wat 'n proses van Skeppende Vernietiging tot gevolg het—vir die dinamiese karakter van kapitalisme veranhvoordelk is. Hy was nogtans van mening dat entrepreneurskapitalisme nie sy eie sukses sal kan oorleef nie omdat kapitalisme in sy segetog sosiale en kulturele newe-effekte sal hê wat mettertyd omstandighede sal \"skep\" wat nie meer aan die entrepreneurs die nodige beskerming, ondersteuning en erkenning sal kan verleen nie. Vanweë die opkoms van prootskaalse semi-monopolistiese ondernemings is die landbousektor een van die min sektore waar die besigheidsvorm van eienaar-entrepreneurnog vry algemeen voorkom. 'n Mens sou dus landbou-entrepreneurskapin Schumpeteriaanseterme kon interpreteer. Suid-Afrika verkeer op die oomblik in 'n Powershift na 'n nuwe bedeling. In die volgende 10 tot 20 jaar sal 'n pluralistiese netwerk van magsblokke tot stand moet kom wat hopelik 'n balanseerende effek op mekaar sal uitoefen. Indien dit gebeur sal dit nie alleen struktuur en stabiliteit aan die situasie verleen nie, maar kan dit ook OMSTANDIGHEDE skep wat gunstig vir die ontplooiing van Schumpeteriaanse entrepreneurskap in die landbousektor kan wees. Selfs al word sodanige gunstige omstandighede vir die landbou geskep, sal dit nogtans hoë eise van vindingrykheid, aanpasbaarheid en versiendheid aan die entrepreneur stel indien hy werklik wil slaag.",

World prices, exchange rates and import tariffs will, together with local market conditions, determine local prices.

The consumer decisionmaking model by Engel-Kollat-Blackwell was used as a basis for the theoretical research, and principal factor analysis was the statistical technique employed to analyse the data. Ten factors (explaining an extremely high cumulative variance of 96.8 per cent) were identified from the rotated factor matrix, and ranked in order of importance. The first five factors, which is considered to be the most important factors (explaining a cumulative variance of 71.1 per cent) were labelled as “Financial planning”, “Managerial aspects”, “Environmental concerns”, “Design aspects” and “Production potential”. The five factors which is regarded as not so important were labeled “Return on investment”, “Operational qualities”, “Dealer orientation”, “Service qualities” and “Past experience”. Three major groups could benefit greatly from understanding buying behaviour within the advanced mechanized irrigation industry. Firstly, agricultural economists, financial institutions and other-advice rendering institutions would be able to inerease the quality of their services to potential buyers (farmers), Secondly, farmers would be able to identify the pitfalls within their own reasoning when they consider the acquisition of an advanced mechanized irrigation system, while thirdly, the marketers of these systems would be able to increase the productivity of their sales personnel if they concentrate their sales activities on the more important criteria identified within this article.",

It is due to this change in policy direction, as well as South Africa's commitments in terms of the GATT Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations, that a study of the impact of tariffication on local agricultural marketing arrangements and policy is necessary. It is essential that, given the complexity of the tariffication process, the Department of Agriculture officially adopts a tariff policy and formulates a tariff policy framework which is transparent, administratively easy to manage and can serve as a basis for which agricultural tariffs are calculated.

In order to determine the total financial consequences of the water restrictions on all sectors within the Vaal River water supply area, the input-output technique was applied during a further study. With this technique, which takes into account the interdependency between sectors, the impact of water restrictions on the total region was determined. The regional input-output model is discussed in the paper. The composition of the total impact per sector and for the area as a whole is also analysed, and the value of water for the various sectors during water shortage situations is indicated.

A regression analysis revealed the following factors to be important in influencing the use of consultants: The farmers' perceived value of own farm records in production decisions; self-rating of management skills in overall farm management; computer use; degree of farm diversification; off-farm investment, and farmer's age. Of the respondents, 73.percent used computers in their farm business. Computers were rated as ‘providing better information’ and ‘saved time’ compared to ‘hand’ records. Preparing financial statements and farm planning were the most highly rated applications of the computer.

CDFs do not only indicate all the outcomes but also the probability to realize a specific value of the performance measure. If the systems are financed over a period of 5 years, there is a probability of 70% for a cash flow deficit; this probability decreases to 35% with financing over ten years. The application of financial methods, bridging financing or adjusted production practises can be considered to ensure the financial feasibility of an investment. However reliable results can only be obtained if risks are taken into account as realisticly as possible in the analyses.",

Characteristics of an ideal marketing system are discussed followed by a discussion of the marketing possibilities of dry beans given the realities of demand and supply and market concentration. The market realities of demand and supply show that the dry bean market does not have the characteristics suitable for control and that a single channel marketing system will therefore not be appropriate. Only measures which would assist the market in achieving higher efficiency should be considered.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT A principal component analysis of financial ratios showing farm solvency, liquidity, profitability, efficiency and debt servicing ability is studied for 1836 summer crop producers. More highly leveraged farmers had high overdraft to net worth and low discretionary income to own capital ratios. They seemed to rely on short-term debt, in particular, to fund operations. Alternatives to short-term debt for managing liquidity—such as cost savings, diversification and asset and debt restructuring—could therefore be investigated by farmers and policy-makers. Lenders and co-operative advisers should emphasise to clients that fixed charges associated with higher leverage increase the potential for lower returns to own capital when events such as drought reduce cash inflow or rising interest rates increase cash outflow. Farmers with high operating ratios also had high debt ratios. Improved operational efficiencies through cost savings may therefore reduce reliance on debt financing. Less solvent producers had asset structures with relatively higher proportions of medium-term assets. Accelerated depreciation allowances could have encouraged debt financing of medium-term assets or over-investment in medium-term assets, which reduces liquidity and increases debt use. The impact on asset investment decisions and farm liquidity of recently announced changes to these depreciation allowances needs investigation by policy-makers.",

The study evaluates the extent to which the current maize crisis in the country could be attributed to drought. The analysis shows that the price policy regimes in Zimbabwe during the 1980s distorted maize producer incentives and embedded subsidies that were questionable on an equitable ground. The policy myopia discouraged the large-scale commercial farmers from maize production and committed the task of supplying the country's staple food in the hands of drought-prone, limited-resource communal area farmers, thereby risking the country's potential for food security. Thus, the government prepared the stage for the current food crisis, so the drought merely aggravated the effect of short-sighted policies. Given a carefully drawn policy structure, Zimbabwe has the capacity to feed its people and minimise the effect of drought on the food distribution system.",

The main actors in the industry are the producers themselves, feed, equipment and other suppliers with retail outlets forming an integral part of the marketing of the products. Since the dissolution of the Egg Control Board, the industry is totally deregulated with supply and demand regulating the industry. When put together, the gross value of eggs and poultry meat was, during 1993/94, the highest of any agricultural product. The industry is also the single biggest consumer of yellow maize. It is a highly competitive and capital intensive industry that makes it rather difficult for new entrants. Apart from expansion by existing producers, opportunities for new entrants will include contract growing for existing producers and/or producing for a niche market. New small scale entrants will, apart from financial assistance, also need training, after care and help with procurement of livestock, goods and services.",

Private economic costs are used as reported by each country and reflect natural endowments and technology levels as well as specific government policies.

Resulting legislation reflects the relative political weight of these interest groups within the existing institutional structure.

In this investigation using a simulated central Swartland farm, the profitability was increased by eliminating under-utilised power-driven machinery, resulting in a reduction in mechanisation expenses. The change arising from this in the mechanised system has a further effect on the existing farming system in that wheat production, the most important branch, undergoes a structural change. Cost savings (working capital and interest) and the increased income from the expansion of the stock factor compensate for the loss of income caused by sowing less. The determining factor influencing profitability is, however, the saving in mechanisation expenses, which represent a fixed cost component.",

Manufacturers are the most politically effective group, having the ability to inflict external effects on other interest groups. They can spread the costs of the ‘milk is milk’ system among interest groups in the Industry. Their political power is mainly due to the dominant position they attained under protection of the Board before deregulation. Extensions of the public choice theory were found to be beneficial in explaining certain actions within the Industry. A gradual phasing out of regulation is recommended. Policymakers can still play an important role in providing traditional public goods and services such as information, restricting monopoly control and marketing promotions.

Gross interference in economic and political life has engendered discrimination, inequity, misallocation of resources and sluggish growth. World megatrends and characteristics of winner nations suggest large changes in marketing and trade policies. Market failures render government involvement attractive when viewed on isolation, but government and bureaucratic failures are often even more serious. Future policy must be directed at the interrelated goals of individual freedom, economic efficiency, equitibility and adjustment to economic change. Centrally directed systems have been unable to achieve this. A market-related approach is needed with an outwardlooking emphasis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is a well known that not all trade in southern Africa is recorded. Recorded trade therefore gives a skew picture and this paper specifically attempts to estimate and investigate unrecorded trade in the region, using the grain market and the “grain trade ratio”. Unrecorded trade occurred in most southem Africa countries and no recorded trade is observed for South Africa during the period 1986–1991. This corresponds to the time when South Africa was politically excluded from formal trading in southern Africa. The grain trade ratio (grain trade as percentage of grain production) is decreasing. The paper examines why the trade ratio decreased when national policies emphasized local food production programmes, market liberalization and more open trade in the region. Dit is welbekend dat nie alle handelstransaksies in suidelike Afrika aangeteken word nie. Aangetekende handel gee dus 'n skewe beeld en hierdie artikel poog om informele handel in die streek te bepaal deur van die graanmark en van 'n graan handelsverhouding gebruik. Onaangetekende handel het in suider Afrika lande voorkgekom en dat geen handel is vir suid-Afrika gedurende 1986–1991 aangeteken nie. Dit stem ooreen met die tydperk toe suid-Afrika polities van formele handel in Suidelike Afrika uitgesluit was. Die graan handelsverhouding (graanhandel as persentasie van graanproduksie) neem af. Hierdie artikel ontleed hoekom hierdie verhouding afgeneem het terwyl nasionale beleid plaaslike voedselproduksieprogramme, markliberalisering en vlyehandel in die streek beklemtoon het.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Industrial labour practices in southern Africa are new to all those involved with agriculture. The impact of a strike on an on-going biological production process has far more serious long term implications than does a similar stoppage in a factory production line producing with inert (non-living) materials. On a large irrigated scheme in the Eastern Cape, which includes a pasture based dairy enterprise, a number of work stoppages have taken place over the past 18 months. The paper quantifies the immediate and longer term financial impacts of work stoppages. The immediate consequences of the stoppages are loss of milk sales and market share, and the longer term consequences include the cost of premature drying off, lost production due to lower lactation over the recovery period as well as the cost of missed heats and inseminations on extended inter-calving periods. The various work stoppages were undermining the scheme which led to the resultant involvement of a recognised trade union in the area, believed to be one of the first trade unions recognised in agriculture. The conditions of the trade union agreement are highlighted. In conclusion, the implications of strike action for agricultural managers, development planners, investors and trade unions are discussed.",

It should be based on a holistic approach rather than selective deregulation that may enhance the protection of some groups and the concentrated market structure. Central considerations are motives for, and methods of, market reform. This paper evaluates privatisation and deregulation in the red meat industry and proposes alternatives. The current concentrated and vertically integrated market structure should be considered during the deregulation and the privatisation of ABACOR. A privatised ABACOR should be decoupled from regulatory protection, while appropriate regulation should secure consumer protection and fair business practices. A future role of the Meat Board in a deregulated red meat industry implies the absence of regulatory powers or group representation. Grading and hygiene standards should be decoupled from regulatory restrictions, should not be used to restrict entry into any marketing stage, be voluntary and based on free choice. Forward contracting and a futures market are possibilities in a reformed market, while market information services should be a function of the state. Successful market reform implies the absence of restrictive regulations, the promotion of competition, and performance judgement on the basis of consumer satisfaction.",

Key determinants of these values were annual household income, respondent education and age, household size and membership of other environmental organizations.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to illustrate the possible effect of a deregulated yellow maize marketing system on the livestock industry (via the stockfeed industry). The stockfeed industry, with its different market segments, and the most important raw materials are described .. A sectoral linear programming model was used to simulate the one channel maize policy in thirteen regions. The social cost of the single channel maize marketing system (which distorted market signals) was calculated. The livestock industry (via yellow maize in stockfeed) was the major looser under the single channel maize marketing system. Moving to a freer market situation for yellow maize should result in a more balanced agricultural sector and an increase in the total economic welfare of the country, and particularly that of the livestock industry.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture in South Africa plays a minor role in terms of contribution to gross domestic product. Amongst others for this reason, agriculture is only reflected as a single production activity in the South African input-output tables. This may understate'the possibility that a large number of production activities depend on agriculture. For this purpose the term agribusiness is introduced. A special inputoutput table is presented with particular emphasis on agribusiness in South Africa. This input-output table is used to highlight the relative importance of agribusiness by means of simple linkage analysis. The results show that agribusiness is relatively more important in terms of backward linkages and employment multipliers. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of a possible agriculture-demand-led industrialisation strategy. The relevance of such a strategy for South Africa remains to be seen, although certain elements are supported by the results of the simple linkage analysis.",

Price and income elasticities of demand estimated by the traditional single equation approach and a systems method do not differ markedly. However, because of the interdependence between carbohydrate consumption, the systems method seems to be more appropriate than the traditional single equation approach. Relative prices of carbohydrates and income per capita play a major role in influencing the consumption of different carbohydrates.",

    "abstract": "In South Africa a start was made, during research into the effects of floods during the seventies to developing a set of flood damage functions based on actual floods. Required follow-up research was not continued during the eighties. For various reasons flood damage, based on actual floods, is underestimated and/or overestimated; a second method for estimating potential flood damages, namely the g ante approach, was followed to compile loss functions based on patential floods. With relationships between the money value of direct flood damage to a damaged item (damage when an item was in physical contact with flood waters) and one or more characteristics of the flood, eg. depth of flood waters, duration of flooding, and the momentum flux of the flood waters, the money value of the direct damage that will be caused by floods of different sizes can be estimated before floods actually occur. This fonns an integral part of flood damage simulation models. A geographic infomiation system (GJS) approach was followed to develop a flood damage simulation model consisting of several interconnected data bases. The GJS model remders ot possible to estimate flood damage from three viewpoints (local, regional and national). Visual representations of the area, two- or three-dimensional, can be obtained on screen or 011 maps. In addition, the advantages of different combinations of flood control and flood damage control measures can be estimated by the GIS model, for example land use management, flood protection, dam management and flood insurance.",

The higher the prices of inputs relative to output prices (the lower the price ratio), the smaller their application to each hectare of land, and the lower the land productivity.

The Soil Conversion Scheme was introduced to help farmers to withdraw low potential crop land by establishing perennial pastures. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the conversion of low potential crop land from cash crop production to perennial pastures in terms of a number of objectives. Dynamic linear programming was used as analyzing technique. Typical characteristics for Western Transvaal namely budgets and other coefficients, were used as inputs to assemble a model over an eight year planning horizon. The optimal enterprise combination was determined by taking into account constraints such as quarterly cash now, fodder flow, and tractor and labour requirements in the maximization of net operating surplus. The “Target MOTAD” approach was used so that the effect of risk could be considered. The results show that given the assumptions and constraints or the model and when risk is taken into account, the net operating surplus is more stable with the conversion to pastures than that with maize production. Risk thus declines, but then the farmers' ability to meet his fixed obligations deteriorates to such an extent that he cannot survive. The above shows that the Soil Conversion Scheme decreases risk but, given the assumptions and constraints of the model, it is not necessarily at present a general economically viable alternative for maize production on low potential soils.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether this aid can make a sufficient contribution to the financial recovery of this fam1ers. As basis for the approach in this study a typical farm was constructed for each relief scheme with data collected through a postal questionnare survey and group discussions. 111e North-western free State were used as study area. A simulation model was used to determine the influence this assistance will have on the typical farm over a ten year period, with three different inflat!~n situat(ons. The results show that interest subsidy aid for the Ten year scheme is at present not enough to ensure the long term solvah1hty of this farm ers. If the present value of the state's expences on interest subsidies are given as a single amount for carryover debt reduction, with no further subsidie~, a better solvency ratio could be achieved. With this form of aid the liquidity advantage for the fam1cr is larger and the state's funds are more efficiently spent. Better farmrng efficiency and management skills is essential to survive during a period of input cost inflation. Assistance given to improve the management quality of farmers will be the best form of aid to ensure their financial recovery.",

    "abstract": "The deregulation of agricultural markets in South Africa led to the establishment of a futures market for agricultural products, which was opened in January 1995. Commodity futures markets should be efficient to play most effective role in price risk management. This paper tests for weak-form efficiency in the South African Future markets for wheat and sunflower seeds by examining the predictability of daily futures price changes. The results suggest that futures price changes for both wheat and sunflower seeds are partially predictable from past price information. The implication is that past price information does contain additional information that could be used to forecast the future price once the current future price is known. But when taking into account the brokerage costs and the time value of money, out-of-sample predictive performance of the model indicates that trading decisions based on the direction of predicted futures price changes do not lead to profitable trades for either crop. Hence, the evidence suggests that there is no strong support for weak-form inefficiency in South African futures markets for wheat and sunflower seeds. The results further suggest that there is no trend in market efficiency over time for wheat and sunflower seeds, except for the wheat December contract.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper assesses the likely impact on the agricultural sector of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries of the Harbinson modalities, along with the EU and US proposals as alternative scenarios in the context of the ongoing negotiations of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. Impacts are assessed on a number of indicators, notably government revenue, producer, consumer and total welfare measures and trade flow. Reflecting country- and commodity-specific factors, the three modalities have different impacts on the indicators. The SADC as a whole is found to lose in terms of total welfare under all three proposals. But while this loss under the Harbinson and EU proposals is due to declines in consumer surpluses and government revenues, reduced producer surplus and government revenue explain the loss in total welfare under the US proposal. Thus, the ranking of the modalities differs according to the impact indicator used, revealing important trade-offs in the choice of the modalities. An issue raised is the value of consumer gains relative to producer gains for low-income economies highly dependent on agriculture because for them effective demand for consumption itself depends on incomes generated from increased agricultural activities, which in turn requires sustained gains in producer surpluses. The paper presents a range of results and discusses the trade-offs, with the hope that SADC trade negotiators and policy makers find these to be useful as they negotiate for the final form of the modalities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article a spatial partial equilibrium (SPE) model is used to quantify the effects of a reduction in tariffs on the red meat industry. This model is used to determine spatial equilibrium prices, consumption, production and geographical flows from a multi-commodity point of view, provided that linear functions are acceptable approximations of regional demand and supply functions. The results show that prices of livestock and meat will drop substantially, whilst increased demand will be met largely by imports from overseas. In total welfare gains by consumers due to a total reduction of tariffs will amount to R2 829 million. This translates into a 0.49 per cent increase in the real gross national income. In respect of real disposable income, a total reduction of tariffs would add 0.75 per cent. The total loss in producer welfare would amount to R868 million. The loss in producer welfare amounts to 2.71 per cent of real gross farm income and 10.72 percent of real net farm income, which is substantial.",

Households act as an integral part of supply chains by supplying resources to supply chains and acting as the final consumer for the products produced by these chains. This article seeks to develop a conceptual framework to measure the impact of several possible supply chain interventions on household utility in the food sector. The effect of supply chain interventions is analysed by applying mathematical programming to the household utility model anti estimating the utility effects of the interventions on the households. The analysis shows that transportation costs are the biggest constraint to production and processing expansion by the households. Maize supply chain interventions are beneficial to households, but other products will have to be considered that are not as susceptible to transportation costs.",

    "abstract": "Recent research suggests that an Income Equalisation Deposit (IED) scheme could be a feasible new risk management tool for commercial farmers in South Africa. This prompted a study of practicing consultants' (tax experts) views on the viability of an IED scheme, how it would relate to existing tax provisions for farmers, and what types of farmers would be likely to use the scheme. The results would show whether or not the consultants' views correspond with research recommendations. Twenty-four tax experts surveyed mainly in KwaZulu-Natal, and in the Maize Triangle and surrounding areas, in 2000 perceived that the scheme could be feasible, help farmers to avoid over-capitalising during years of good cash flow, and provide liquidity in “lean” times. Most of them would support recommendations that the Land Bank drought relief scheme for livestock farmers be replaced with an IED scheme that all farmers could access. They also felt that the capital expenditure and accumulated depreciation allowance provisions available to farmers should remain in place. In their view, farmers with higher net farm incomes, lower debt/asset ratios, more variable net farm incomes, and less off farm income would more likely use an IED scheme, and high risk maize farmers are more likely to use an IED than are low risk livestock farmers. Since maize farmers have been the main beneficiaries of past government drought aid, this could mean reduced demands on government drought relief funds in future if an IED scheme is introduced.",

The study developed a framework for structuring an effectiveness and efficiency analysis on public expenditure as related to agricultural technology research and development. A Logical Framework Analysis was applied to facilitate the assessment of the programme's effectiveness and a cost-benefit approach to facilitate the assessment of the programme's efficiency. Primary data were collected from the Britstown-De Aar study area (Northern Cape Province) by means of a questionnaire as well as a pod survey to collect data on the success of the biological control agents. It was found that since 1986, the biological control programme has had a positive impact by reducing the rate of Prosopis invasion. The analysis revealed that the biological control programme only has to be 2.5% effective, in terms of area not invaded, but with the potential to be invaded, in order to be a financially profitable investment and only 1.3% effective for it to be an economically beneficial investment to society.",

As conducting trial experiments under controlled and easily quantifiable conditions at farm level is almost impossible, the true value of trial data lies in the realistic extrapolation to farm level. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology used in deriving the financial effects at representative farm level in the Viljoenskroon region from a 9-year crop rotation trial incorporating soya beans, conducted by the ARC-GCI at Potchefstroom. The bio-physical trial results indicated a definite improvement in maize crops fallowing soya beans and groundnuts. The application of the resultant production functions to realistic farm-level rotation systems and the incorporation of costs and returns in a multi-year spreadsheet simulation model show definite financial benefits at the farm level as well.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many South African (SA) apple producers are currently considering whether or not to invest in the Pink Lady apple cultivar in response to the changing tastes of international fresh apple consumers. Given uncertainty about Pink Lady apple yields, costs and prices, and that orchard investment costs are irreversible (cannot be fully recovered in the short term), an ex ante version of the Dixit-Pindyck investment model is used to assess the viability of such an investment under uncertainty and irreversibility. This model accounts for uncertainty and irreversibility by raising the orthodox hurdle rate that must be met to justify the orchard investment by an amount that reflects the value of the option to postpone the investment. The results suggest that SA apple producers should only invest in a Pink Lady apple orchard with a 35-year lifespan if the expected annual real rate-of-return is above 10.75%, which is more than double the orthodox real rate of five per cent that is commonly used in capital budgeting analyses. Differences of this level between orthodox and modified hurdle rates have also been reported in recent studies of the adoption of dairy housing technology, and investment in grapefruit orchards, in the United States.",

The results reveal that participation in a project and the use of technology are always associated. Only land tenure model resulted in a significant saturated model, where a three way association with both technology and project participation had significant effects. Access to input on time was only associated with technology use, but not with participation in a project.

Furthermore, the survey assessed the perceptions of management and members/shareholders of the co-operatives/agribusinesses on the innouatioeness, quality of R&D and the R&D capacity of their organisations and of the government and other private sector R&D institutions. The survey also covered the degree of satisfaction expressed by members/shareholders concerning their influence in determining the research agenda, as well as their opinion regarding the private sector's responsibility to finance R&D. The results show that current expenditure on agricultural R&D as a percentage of annual turnover by the majority of co-operatives and agribusinesses in the Western Cape and Kuiazulu-Naial is far below the international norm for companies trying to be internationally competitive. According to the perceptions of producers as members/shareholders of agricultural co-operatives/agribusinesses, as well as the management of these organisations the amount and the quality of R&D support by the South African Government to the commercial agricultural sector decreased. They have a negative view of the innovative capacity of the government R&D institutions in comparison with the capacities of their own organisations' or private sector organisations in general. They accept private sector's responsibility to finance R&D on a larger scale and intend to increase their own spending over the next five years. The reported perceptions suggest that agricultural co-operatives/agribusinesses have not compensated sufficiently for the decreasing government supported R&D and should develop a strong strategic R&D orientation to investigate potentially new production, processing and marketing activities continuously.",

Cointegration and Granger-causality tests were performed to determine the causal relationship between agricultural research and agricultural output.

The results also showed that it takes seven to eight years for public agricultural research expenditures to have a significant impact on agricultural output in Lesotho.",

A case study approach is followed at the hand of new institutional economics to explain strategic choices by PTK management. The results from organisational theory and transaction cost theory, as applied to the same problem, yields complimentary and robust results.",

Now, with an open marketing system and increased volatility in the commodity markets, producers will have the right and the responsibility to determine their own financial security. One of the most difficult questions for producers to answer, is how much of his/her crop must be pre-harvest marketed. Knowing his/her production costs (both variable and fixed) and range of acceptable production, price, and financial risks are the key to determining his/her price objective. Producers can determine their degree of marketing flexibility by using the cash flow risk ratio. This ratio predicts what percentage of the projected crop must be marketed at the expected season average price to meet cash obligations. In this uncertain and risky future, failing to plan may be the same as planning to fail.",

    "abstract": "Since 2000, Zimbabwe’s agricultural output has fluctuated despite the transfer of agricultural technology by various organisations and international partners. The low output response to technology transfer is attributed to the twin problems of lack of access and adoption of technology, which are largely explained by weak institutions, financial constraints, skill and knowledge deficiency, and poor rural infrastructure. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the effect of agricultural technology transfer on economic development using a dynamic Global Trade Analysis Project model for the reference year 2011. The study results indicated that economic performance improves when quality fertilisers, certified seeds, and machinery from other countries are used more intensively. Thus, policy interventions are required that enhance credit extension, roads, capital equipment, and good institutions such as property rights that incentivise farmers to adopt and invest in technology.",

This disease occurred in South Africa for the first time during the 2000/01 wheat production season on a farm near Douglas in the Northern Cape. The economic impact of various control measures and regulations with regard to Karnal bunt can be assessed by means of an efficiency analysis using a cost-benefit approach. It was found to be economically acceptable to implement quarantine on the Douglas area in only a “worse case” scenario. In all other scenarios it did not made any economic sense to impose a quarantine on the Douglas area.",

    "abstract": "This research focuses on the production practice of limited tillage, which is used to reduce input costs. The implementation of limited tillage causes mechanization changes, which in turn, results in higher fixed cost and lower variable cost. The hypothesis claimed that profit could be increased, thus motivating for the promotion of limited tillage for smallgrain production. Two farms in each of four subregions in the Southern Cape served as case studies. The conventional and limited tillage practices of each farm were analysed and evaluated by an expert group. In order to compare the profitability of the various crop rotation systems, an annuity of the total present value of the annual gross margin per hectare of each crop rotation system was calculated. The analyses showed that the crop rotation systems of the various case studies differed significantly, due to soil and climate differences between and even within the subregions. No uniform crop rotation system was found that could serve as a general recipe for the region. In spite of this, some principles could be deduced from the analyses that could be followed in order to improve the cultivation and other practices so as to increase profits. The most significant savings can be obtained with regard to cultivation and sowing density. The results show that switching to limited tillage combined with precision farming can increase profits.",

Wisselbou bied 'n moontlike alternatief vir die monokultuurverbouing van koring waarvan winsmarges sedert 1996 afgeneem het. Die voordeel wat wisselbou vir die produsent inhou is hoofsaaklik verhoogde opbrengste en insetbesparings ten opsigte van bemesting, insek-, plaag- en onkruidbeheer. Inligting is bekom deur gebruik te maak van die Delphi tegniek en groepbesprekings waarby 'n multi-dissiplinere span van kundiges betrek is. Die interne opbrengskoers van kapitaal (IOK) is gebruik as finansiele maatstaf vir die meet van die winsgewendheid van die agt wisselboustelsels wat ondersoek is. Uit die agt verskillende stelsels wat ondersoek is, behoort 'n stelsel waar koring saam met medics en klawer weidings geproduseer word na verwagting die mees winsgewende te wees. Die winsgewendheid ondersoek van alternatiewe wisselboustelsels, asook die finansiele implikasies van die implementering daarvan in die praktiese boerdery situasie, is met behulp van tipiese plaasmodelle deurgevoer.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the conception, design, implementation and monitoring of The Gambian rangeland and water development project based in Niamina Dankunku and Niamina West districts of the country. It attempts to make a management evaluation of the project, gaining an insight into the nature of the development problem and the approach adopted by the project for its solution. It then seeks to examine the lessons that southern African countries could learn from this experience in the light of similarities in socio-economic circumstances. The conception of the project was sound in so far as it attempted to tackle the problem of environmental degradation by a system of controlled management of scarce range resources. However, the question of increasing cattle off-take which could have also reduced grazing pressure on range resources was not addressed. The project's initial focus on the relatively well off category of cattle owners was corrected by incorporating a food-aid component to address project's concern for the poorer segment of the society. While it was a good idea, the use of food-aid took away the expected financial contribution of the local community to project management and financed a significant part of project activities. The paper welcomes the conception of the income generation components but finds their introduction rather arbitrary. The project's flexibility and its approach of participatory management are recognised as its main strength, which could assure sustainability of project achievements. In addition, the project is a good example of strong co-operative involvement of a number of development agencies in jointly solving the development problem and co-ordinating development assistance.",

Issues evolving from these international deliberations, eg the divide between developed and developing countries are highlighted. An overview is given of the present FAO effort to reconcile the two within the context of Farmersâ€™ Rights, Scope and Access to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. Attention is paid to real and potential clashes between Farmersâ€™ Rights and farmersâ€™ privileges with Plant Breeders Rights and Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights under UPOV and the WTO. An overview is given of Agenda-21â€™s multidimensional, conservationistic, developmental and research goals, linked with The International Undertaking and the CBD. This was done to indicate that agricultural economics is well equipped and has the responsibility to research the effects of these Conventions on rural communities and the economy in South Africa in general.",

Results showed that the Stewart-Hagan programming model underestimated the economic cost and overestimated potential return flows. Water policies based on this model will lead to the implementation of socially unacceptable water allocation policies that may even apply more pressure on stream flows. Meaningful water policies could only be advanced by a thorough understanding of the economic and hydrological consequences of alternative water allocation policies through the integration of economic and hydrological models at catchment level.",

    "abstract": "Following unification of East and West Germany in 1990, the principal objective of the government was to restore previous property rights in the new federal states and to encourage competitive production structures. Institutions were quickly established to facilitate the required adjustments to a market economy. Privatisation of most firms (farms), which was an intricate and costly procedure, was accomplished within five years and resulted in a completely new farm structure in the new federal states. By 1996 over 80 percent of agricultural enterprises comprised private (individual) operations (cultivating 22 percent of land), 9,1 percent partnerships (22 percent of land), while about 3000 legal entities managed 56 percent of farm land. About 90 percent of farmland in the new states is being rented compared to 47 percent in the old states. Significantly, leasing and not selling became the most important method to privatise land in the new federal states. In 1996 the number of farming operations in Germany totalled about 540000. While worker employment in German agriculture is steadily decreasing, worker productivity is increasing - from 17 hectares of farm land per full-time equivalent worker (FTE) in 1991 to 43 hectares per FTE in the new states in 1996.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe increasing recognition by policy-makers in Botswana regarding the role of small ruminants as an alternative source to provide an opportunity to augment farm incomes of smallholder farmers has encouraged many farmers who emphasised mainly cattle rearing to considerably increase the numbers of small ruminants on their farms. However, small ruminants have not approached the importance of cattle among smallholder farmers. This paper, therefore, undertakes a comparative economic analysis of cattle and goat enterprises of an average smallholder farm household in the country, to shed light on the use of smallholder farmers' limited resources. The results show that both cattle and goat enterprises of the smallholder farmers in the study area are profitable. However, net profit obtained, either measured per enterprise or per animal, is much higher for cattle enterprises. It is Seven and six times, respectively of that of goat in terms per animal and per enterprise. As regards return on capital, the best measure of efficiency of production factors, cattle enterprise could be considered slightly more efficient than goat enterprise. This finding should stimulate farmers to attach equal importance to the rearing of small ruminants just as they do for cattle production.",

The models have been based on an empirical study and illustrate the relationship between the production output of a number perennial crops and certain physical and socio-economic variables. The results indicate that a significant relationship exists between output and certain constraints. In many cases, expected relationships do not exist and this is explained in the study by the unique dynamics of the small farmer situation.",

The ministerial meeting of developed countries (OECD), has revealed that their future development of agricultural policy has changed little as a result of policy changes in the 1990s. In the next Round the EU is expected to be mainly on the defensive to try and maintain subsidy provisions. The main players that are expected to fuel the upcoming negotiations are the Cairns Group of agricultural export countries as well as the United States. The main task of reformers would be related to substantial further reduction ofdistortive trade measures, the covering of matters left unresolved in the Uruguay Round and to close the loopholes of the previous agreement. In general, reformers would like to push for a fairer system with more equal benefits to all.",

In decrensing order of restrictiveness, the techniques are simple radial measures, radial measures adjusted for slacks and non-radial measures. The estimates consistently show that all the capital asset variables were used well beyond the point of maximum efficiency and could have been reduced by as much as a quarter or a third without reduring output. Labour overuse is also considerable, while there was the least waste for the variable inputs. Over the priod there was an increase in efficiency levels.",

    "abstract": "Since 1995, global food security has become a high profile issue as a result of concerns stemming from global market liberalization that has reflected changes in policies of the major food exporting countries. Responding to these concerns at the declaration of the World Food Summit in November 1996, participants pledged “to reduce the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015” from the estimated 800 million people. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the future food security situation of 9 Southern African counties: Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Madagascar, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Baseline food consumption is projected through 2015 and the food gaps to meet minimum nutritional requirements are estimated by country. To examine the options of cutting the nutritional gap of a country by half, a consumption-income relationship was used to estimate food consumption in different income groups. The baseline projections of food consumption by different income groups were then used as a basis to estimate “distribution” food gaps under two different scenarios: targeted and county-wide policies. The paper then proceeds to evaluate the feasibility of closing the gaps by examining the performance of the factors affecting food consumption.",

First, even when we have a fairly good understanding as to the relationship between crop output and factors of production, that understanding does not extend very well to situations of extreme distress. That is, our ability to predict crop outcomes appears to remain limited. To some extent, this appears to be because harsh weather events come in different shapes and sizes, which matter critically to the actual effects of those events. Second, farmers do not appear to be in a position to make valuable use of such information as mines their way. The analysis of farmers' hot-terra ‘anticipatory adjustments’ to expected weather events, suggests that, at times, weather predictions are reacted to in a manner that hurts farmers rather than helps them. This proposition, however, requires further research.",

Seven experts in the field of grain trade were involved in eliciting current product price distributions for wheat arid yellow maize. A whole farm simulation model was used to generate cumulative price distributions for each of three elicitation methods. A typical farm, consisting of 300 hectares cropland, was selected to determine the effect that the price distributions have on whole farm economic performance. Deviations among price distributions, caused by individuals' varying opinions, are more significant than the effect of the three elicitation methods. The economic results at whole farm level confirm the importance of price variability arid the magnitude of price risk. All in all, the results prompt more attention to be devoted to the elicitation process itself to assure that the subjective distribution function reflects the decision-markers' perceptions accurately.",

    "abstract": "After the Department of Agricultural Economics at the University of the Orange Free State had completed the development of a flood damage simulation model, various problems were identified. The cost-effectiveness to implement the flood damage simulation model (FLODSIM) in other flood prone areas, was the main problem. Therefore it was decided to investigate alternative cost-effective methods of compiling data bases for FLODSIM. Remote sensing was used as a starting point and investigated as a possible method of collecting data. Because of the expensiveness of satellite and radar images, limited funds and the cost-effectiveness of video remote sensing and because video remote sensing has already been proved to be an effective research mechanism in various fields of application (Vleck, 1983, Nixon et al., 1985 and Everitt et al., 1986 & 1989, as quoted by Marsh et al., 1990) it was decided only to evaluate video remote sensing. The main aim of this paper therefore is to evaluate video remote sensing as a cost-effective, operational method for determining the land-use pattern in irrigation areas to calculate flood damages. After discussing video remote sensing, the total mean annual flood damage for the research area will be calculated by using the land-use data base compiled by video remote sensing techniques and compared with the results of an in situ survey. Video remote sensing will also be evaluated as an operational technique.",

    "abstract": "This paper weighs up the income and jobs generated by the heavy industry proposed in the Coega Industrial Development Zone (IDZ) project against those that would be generated by agriculture and aquaculture projects in the Coega River basin. It shows that a â€˜conservative scenarioâ€™ heavy industry Coega IDZ option generates within South Africa almost three times as much income but less than half the number of jobs as a combined agro-aquaculture one (and about two times as much income if negative income effects are added in), and requires about 45 times as much capital. In addition heavy industry may crowd other industries in the area. The conclusions drawn are: â€¢ that the opportunity cost of the Coega IDZ and Port Project is high, especially in terms of sustainable employment, â€¢ that government should consider more carefully what the most efficient ways are of exploiting the natural capital of the area (the alluvial soils, the coastline and the supplies of fresh water), â€¢ that if conflicts of interest between private sector interests are likely, there are dangers in development initiatives based on private-public partnerships, and â€¢ that the heavy industry currently proposed for the Coega IDZ may limit the scope for future industrial developments in the area, by using up much of the â€˜safeâ€™ waste assimilating capacity of the air",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the conception, design, implementation and monitoring of The Gambian rangeland and water development project based in Niamina Dankunku and Niamina West districts of the country. It attempts to make a management evaluation of the project, gaining an insight into the nature of the development problem and the approach adopted by the project for its solution. It then seeks to examine the lessons that southern African countries could learn from this experience in the light of similarities in socio-economic circumstances. The conception of the project was sound in so far as it attempted to tackle the problem of environmental degradation by a system of controlled management of scarce range resources. However, the question of increasing cattle off-take which could have also reduced grazing pressure on range resources was not addressed. The project's initial focus on the relatively well off category of cattle owners was corrected by incorporating a food-aid component to address project's concern for the poorer segment of the society. While it was a good idea, the use of food-aid took away the expected financial contribution of the local community to project management and financed a significant part of project activities. The paper welcomes the conception of the income generation components but finds their introduction rather arbitrary. The project's flexibility and its approach of participatory management are recognised as its main strength, which could assure sustainability of project achievements. In addition, the project is a good example of strong co-operative involvement of a number of development agencies in jointly solving the development problem and co-ordinating development assistance. Hierdie artikel ondersoek die konsepsie, ontwerp, implementering en monitering van die Gambiese weiland- en waterontwikkelingsprojek in die Niamina Dankunku en Niamina-Wes distrikte van die land. Daar word gepoog om 'n bestuursevaluering van die projek te doen en sodoende insig te bekom in die aard van die ontwikkelingsprobleem en die benadering deur die projek aanvaar vir die oplos daarvan. Dit poog dan om die lesse wat Suider-Afrikaanse lande uit die ervaring kan leer te ondersoek in die lig van soortgelykhede in sosio-ekonomiese toestande. Die konsepsie van die projek was gesond in die sin dat dit gepoog het om die probleem van omgewingsageruitgang deur 'n sisteem van beheerde bestuur van skaars weibronne aan te pak. Die moontlikheid vir toenemende beesomset wat ook kon help om weidingsdruk op weidingsbronne te verlig, is egter nie aangespreek nie. Die inisiële fokus op die relatief welaf kategorie beeseienaars is reggestel deur die inkorporasie van 'n voedselhulpkomponent om die projek se betrokkenheid by die armer deel van die bevolking aan te spreek. Hoewel dit 'n goeie idee was het die gebruik van voedselhulp die verwagte finansiële bydrae van die plaaslike gemeenskap tot die projekbestuur laat wegval. Die artikel verwelkom die konsepsie van die inkomste-genererende komponente, maar bevind dat hul invoering taamlik arbitrêr was. Die plooibaarheid en benadering van deelnemende bestuur in die projek was die sterkste punt wat die volhoubaarheid van projekprestasie kon verseker. Hierbenewens is die projek 'n goeie voorbeeld van 'n sterk samewerkende betrokkenheid van 'n aantal ontwikkelingsagentskappe om die ontwikkelingsproblematiek gesamentlik op te los en ontwikkelingshulp te koördineer.",

    "abstract": "This paper gives a profile of a sample of a small and large sugar cane farms in the North coast region of the KwaZulu-Natal sugar cane belt. The survey was conducted during May 1995. Farms studied varied between one and 600 hectares. Values for small farms were significantly lower than large farms for human capital resources, farm resource utilisation, rate of search and utilisation of farm information, and adoption of appropriate and improved cultural farm practices. Such differences may account for the differences in farm productivity between small and large farms that exist in the South African sugar industry. A linear discriminant function model shows that small and large farms studied differ significantly on lines of human resources and cost of borrowed capital (market related). The findings of the study show that large cane farms face lower market related interest rates, are relatively better equipped in human resource capital, and are in a position to implement appropriate and recommendable farm practices (soil analysis and use of certified seedcane) compared to small farmers.",

This note registers that improvement of local democracy is not a variable in the report. The note suggests that the Panel is stuck in old ways, in effect a centralised planning tradition and a heavily top down governing model. It suggests that developing local municipal and amakhosi democracy might seem a detour in land politics but might actually lead to a different and more effective land reform. Such land reform will favour more dignity, creativity and trust among people and a more fair modernisation of the South African economy.",

    "abstract": "Northern Province is predominantly a rural region where agriculture is the dominant sector and plays an important role in the provincial economy. Women are the majority of the poor living in these rural areas and depend heavily on farming. But their agricultural productivity is below potential as they donâ€™t have access to productive assets such as land and credit. This study based on a farm survey undertaken in the seven districts in the former Lebowa homeland in the Northern Province, attempts to identify factors which determine women farmersâ€™s access to more farming land and credit facilities. The results show that most of the women are not satisfied with the size of the land which they own and they have never used farming credit. The probit analysis results show that productivity of the staple crop (maize), more off-farm income and access to credit are the strong determinants of the desire to increase, the size of the farming land. Access to credit is influenced by the first two variables above and farmers membership to agricultural development projects. Better access to and security for farm land, targeted credit and agricultural support services are crucial in improving the quality of women farmers in the province.",

The different land use alternatives were compared with one another with the purpose of determining the best possible land use. Communal households and the Seville scheme households perform poorly in support of household welfare. This holds disastrous implications for future generations if nothing is done. The Uthla scheme households perform better and generate larger incomes, but at the expense of communal households. Both schemes are highly subsidised by government. Manyeleti Game Reserve is mismanaged and the worst land use alternative in the area, providing no benefit to people living at its perimeter and needs government support for its continued survival. Using multi criteria analysis a combination of communal and conservation land use alternatives is found to be the best alternative, maximising the communities' welfare and conserving the environment.",

The Farmer Support Programme (“FSP”) was implemented in selected target areas in the developing areas (“homelands”) of South Africa since 1987, with the specific aim to address the constraints faced by farmers in these areas. A three year evaluation programme of the FSP in one area Lebowa, show that the farmer support programme has improved the food security situation in these areas and contributed to a better livelihood for thousands of households in rural Lebowa. The results also confirms that the elements of the support programme can, at least partly, be related to the increase in maize production and the improved household food security situation in Lebowa.",

History of South African agriculture as viewed by the agricultural economist. 3. South African agriculture as foundation for training in agricultural economics. 4. Training in agricultural economics and the demands made on the agricultural economist of today. These aspects are now discussed individually",

DIE UITWERKING VAN EKONOMIESE INSENTIEWE OP DIE BEHEER VAN BESOEDELING IN DIE SUID-AFRIKAANSE LEERBEDRYF Omgewingsbesoedeling word 'n toenemend ernstige probleem.

Twee metodes waardeur die besoedeling deur nywerhede gegenereer kan word is die sogenaamde beveel en beheer tegnieke en ekonomiese insentiewe. In teorie beloof ekonomiese insentiewe om ekonomies meer doeltreffend en ewewigtige metodes van besoedelingsbeheer te wees.

The limited capacity of microcomputers has restricted the development of user-friendly optimizing models and as a result this handy planning method was not commonly used in the South African agricultural sector. The computer revolution has now made it possible to develop a DLP model for microcomputers. The planning horizon of the Optima model on microcomputer is six years and is most suitable for the comprehensive planning of livestock-pasture-grain farms. Assumptions, activities and constraints of such an optimizing model are discussed and the results of different scenarios analysed. The results show that the realistic scenario differs more from the pessimistic scenario and less from the optimistic scenario. The conclusion is that exceptional management is needed during times of lower product prices and yields. During favourable conditions more wheat is planted. This probably indicates wheat to be one of the most profitable crops, but that it is very risky during times of climatic instability.",

For purposes of comparison the farmers (n=219) were requested to compare the personnel management systems on a Likert scale of high-production businesses on the one hand and low-production businesses, on the other. High-production businesses are characterized by consultative personnel management systems, whilst benevolent authoritative personnel management systems are characteristic of low-production businesses. Worker productivity, job satisfaction and farm profitability can be enhanced in a variety of farm business types if consultative instead of benevolent authoritative personnel management systems are implemented with respect to leadership, motivation, communication, human relations, decision-making, staff control, goal-formation and work performance. Significant differences in perception exist regarding the typification of personnel management systems of high-production businesses between farmers who regard themselves favourable and the less favourable group of farmers as regards worker productivity, job satisfaction of workers and farm profitability. The probability of a formal remuneration system being in use depends on the business features of the farm business. Die doel met hierdie studie was om boere se persepsies oor doeltreffende en ondoeltreffende personeelbestuurstelsels op Suid-Afrikaanse plase te tipeer. Vir vergelykingsdoeleindes is die boere (n=219) gevra om die personeelbestuurstelsels van hoëproduksie-ondememings enersyds en laeproduksie-ondememings andersyds op 'n Likert-skaal te vergelyk Hoëproduksie-ondememings word deur konsulterende personeelbestuurstelsels gekarakteriseer terwyl laeproduksie-ondememings deur welmenend outoritëre personeelbestuurstelsels gekenmerk word. Werkerproduktiwiteit, werknemertevredenheid en boerderywinsgewendheid in 'n verskeidenheid boerderytipes kan dus verhoog word indien konsulterende in plaas van welmenend outoritêre personeelbestuurstelsels ten opsigte van leierskap, motivering, kommunikasie, menseverhoudqs, besluitneming, doelwitfmulering, beheer en werkpmtasie geïmplementeer word. Beduidende persepsievde oor die tipering van hoëproduiksie-ondememings se personeelbestuurstelsels bestaan tussen boere wat hulself gunstig aanslaan met bekekkmg tot werkerproduktiwiteit, werknemertemdenheid en boerderywinsgewendheid en die minder gunstige groep boere. Die waarskynklikheid dat 'n fomele vergoedingstelsel in gebruik is, hang af van die besigheidskenmerke van die ondeerneming.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A survey of communal clubs serviced by the Africa Co-operative Action Trust (ACAT) in KwaZulu during 1989 is used to identify attributes and savings behaviour of club members. Discriminant analysis shows that garden club members tend to have higher on-farm income per household member and receive more KwaZulu Department of Agriculture (KDA) extension input than savings club members. Members who belong solely to a savings club receive more ACAT training and tend to be further from infrastructural amenities. Garden clubs can assist rural development by encouraging surplus production for sale and focusing KDA extension efforts. Savings clubs improve access of rural people to training and farm inputs. Club savings increase during the pre-planting season (August to November) when input purchases are made. Post-planting savings are much lower, indicating allocation of funds to alternative uses (reduced incentive to save until next pre-planting season). These patterns suggest that members use savings clubs to obtain inputs rather than as typical savings institutions. Total real annual savings and withdrawals in savings clubs fell between 1985 and 1987, due to a fall in average club membership. This was associated with declining real annual ACAT-KwaZulu operating budgets which reduced ACAT staff visits to clubs and assistance with input deliveries.",

BST remains a controversial product and uncertainty surrounding its appropriateness as technology is increased by the fact that no local study in connection with its profitability has been conducted previously. On-farm response trials at three representative case study sites and a personal telephonic survey conducted amongst existing users of BST provided a valuable basis to develop and apply a management simulation model. The model and procedures of analysis are flexible and could be applied to other problems of dairy farm management. Results indicated that, given the conditions of research, utilisation of BST proved to be profitable. BST has the capability to improve profitability of certain dairy businesses. The critical factors in determining profitability of BST utilisation, apart from management, are the milk price, response to BST as well as BST and feed cost. Milk production quotas may have a negative effect on profitability of BST.",

These stages were a pre-planting period. followed by a sequence of non-overlapping physiological growth phases from sowing to maturity. The equation was a mixed quadratic (N) and square-root (P) polynomial containing linear Ri, Ri*N and Ri*P terms. The function was used to determine the response of maize grain yields to N and P, the fertilizer requirements for maximum profits and least cost N and P combinations. The effects of Low. Median, and High levels of rainfall were also investigated. It was found that yield response and profitability were adversely affected by increased levels of precipitation. The results indicate the importance of considering rainfall in fertilizer recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study involved an investigation into the variability and seasonality in prices and quantities of five fresh vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, onions, cabbage and carrots) sold on the four largest national fresh produce markets (Pretoria, Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban). A variability index based on the coefficient of variation was used throughout the study. The results were based on monthly data for the period 1980 through 1993, Prices were generally found to be more variable than quantities. The five vegetables investigated were subject to a similar degree of variation in quantity. Potatoes and tomatoes were subject to substantially less price variation than onions, carrots and cabbage. The data were seasonally adjusted by means of the Census X-II method and the variability in seasonal adjustment factors was subsequently calculated. The prices of the five vegetables were subject to substantially more seasonal variation than the quantities. However despite significant seasonal variations in the quantity and particularly the price of fresh vegetables, “non-seasonal” (random) variation still dominates the overall variability in the data. In hierdie studie is die variabiliteit en seisoenaliteit in die pryse en hoeveelhede van vyf groentes (aartappels, tamaties, uie, kopkool en wortels) wat op die vier grootste nasionale varsproduktemarkte (Pretoria, Johannesburg, Kaapstad en Durban) verkoop word, ondersoek. 'n Variabiliteitsindeks gebaseer op die koëffisiënt van variasie is deurgaans in die studie gebruik. Die resultate is gebaseer op maanddata en strek oor die tydperk 1980 tot 1993. Pryse was oor die algemeen meer variabel as hoeveelhede. Die vyf groentes wat ondersoek is was aan min of meer dieselfde mate van variasie in hoeveelhede onderhewig. Aartappels en tamaties is aan beduidend minder prysvariasie as uie, wortels en kopkool onderworpe. Die data is deur middel van die Census X-II metode aangepas vir seisoenaliteit, waama die variabiliteit in seisoensindekse bereken is. Die pryse van die vyf groentes het heelwat meer seisoenale skommelinge getoon as die ooreenstemmende hoeveelhede. Nieteenstaande groot seisoenale skommelinge in die hoeveelhede en veral die pryse van groente, moet die grootste deel van die variabiliteit in die data toegesktyf word aan “nie-seisoenale” (stogastiese) faktore.",

    "abstract": "In South Africa a start was made, during research into the effects of floods during the seventies to developing a set of flood damage functions based on actual floods. Repired follow-up research was not continued during the eighties. For various reasons flood damage, based on actual floods, is underestimated and/or overestimated; a second method for estimating potential flood damages, namely the ex ante approach, was followed to compile loss functions based on potential floods. With relationships between the money value of direct flood damage to a damaged item (damage when an item was in physical contact with flood waters) and one or more characteristics of the flood, eg. depth of flood waters, duration of flooding, and the momentum flux of the flood waters, the money value of the direct damage that will be caused by floods of different sizes can be estimated before floods actually occur. This forms an integral part of flood damage simulation models. A geographic information system (GIS) approach was followed to develop a flood damage simulation model consisting of several interconnected data bases. The GIS model remders ot possible to estimate flood damage from three viawpoints (local, regional and national). Visual representations of the area, two- or three-dimensional, can be obtained on screen or on maps. In addition, the advantages of different combinations of flood control and flood damage control measures can be estimated by the GIS model, for examule land use manazement, flood protection, dam mananement and flood insurance.",

These factors contributed to the structural problems experienced by farmers in the Petrusburg district. From the evaluation of results, it appears that if several structural adjustments are made in combination, it could be economically viable. Individual structural adjustments that are economically viable, are not financially feasible if capital replacement of movable assets are taken into consideration. With a combination of the proposed structural adjustments, it seems that almost all adjustments will be financially feasible.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cumulative probability distributions (CPDs) of a few financial criteria were generated with the aid of the FARMS model and used to evaluate diversification as a method of risk management by Winterton farmers. Given the management abilities of the farmer, the efficiency of risk management is influenced by the composition of farming enterprises, the interaction between the enterprises and the debt-burden situation. The use of CPDs serves to portray the uncertainty and nature of the outcome as well as the financial implications of the inclusion of alternative enterprises clearly. Since the decision maker is familiar with the total width of outcome of the financial criteria, the probability of a specific required outcome level being realised can be determined. In addition the model can be used to evaluate cash and credit flow interactively in the decision-making process. With the assistence of the model and the use of the method of approach different management strategies can be evaluated at farming level. Kumulatiewe waarskynlikheidsverdelings (KWV's) van enkele finansiële maatstawwe is met behulp van die FARMS-model gegenereer en gebruik om diversifikasie as risikobestuurswyse deur die Winterton boere te evalueer. Gegewe die bestuursvermoë van die boer word die doeltreffendheid van risikobestuur deur die boerderyvertakkingsamestelling, die interaksie tussen die vertakkings en die skuldlasposisie beïnvloed. Met KWV's word die wisselvalligheid en aard van die uitkomste sowel as die finansiële implikasies van die inskakeling van alternatiewe vertakkings duidelik uitgebeeld. Aangesien die totale uitkomswydte van die finansiële maatstawwe vir die besluitnemer bekend is, kan die waarskynlikheid om 'n sekere vereiste uitkomsvlak te realiseer, bepaal word. Verder kan die model gebruik word om stogastiese kredieten kontantvloei in die besluitnemingsproses interaktief met mekaar te evalueer. Met behulp van die model en die benaderingswyse kan verskillende bestuurstrategieë op boerderyondernemingsvlak werklikheidsgetrou geëvalueer word.",

It is also doubtful whether the same degree of protection and aid will be supplied to farmers by our new democratic government. Surviving this changed situation will require a greater degree of entrepreneurship on the part of the farmer. As a result of past circumstances, there is some concern about the potential for entrepreneurship among farmers, as control measures bureaucracy and interfrence in the market forces tend to limit entrepreneurship. This study firstly attempts to establish what makes an entrepreneur, and secondly to investigate the existence of a model for determining or estimating the entrepreneurial potential within a certain agricultural sector. An empirical study which attempts to estimate or determine the entrepreneurial potential for farmers in the various branches of the agicultural sector in South Africa is envisaged.",

Land markets, natural resources and administrative infrastructure appear to be adequate to facilitate market assisted land reform. However, agro-ecological diversity agro-ecological and pressures on local TLC's to provide services, strongly suggest that environmental aspects and town and regional planning must be important considerations in the land reform process.

Cross-sectional time-series data of 1974 to 1990 were used to examine the factors that determine total agricultural and food production growth in the region. The results show that agricultural workers, cropped land, fertilizer and use of tractors had significant effects on the regional total agricultural and food production growth. These factors together accounted for between 37 and 41% of the total variation in food and agricultural production growth. This suggests that other variables, not included in the models due to data problems do play a very crucial role. These findings have important implications for improving food and agricultural performance in the region. In promoting food and agricultural growth, SADC governments should not only concentrate on improvements in the productivity of the four conventional factors of production, also on other parameters. Other policy-related variables such as producer prices, weather factors, and irrigation and land degradation indices should be given due consideration.",

This made farmers more aware of the need to improve their marketing skills, consider product diversification and improve fiuit quality. Respondents rated their willingness to take marketing risk as low relative to other fanners. Discriminant analysis identified growers who were more likely to be affected by the abolition of the Banana Board as those who (1) previously marketed most of their quality fiuit through the Board, (2) were less willing to take production risks, (3) were not sole owners of their fann business, (4) perceived the marketing potential on the LSC to be poor, and (5) had relatively high debt-asset ratios. After the Board was abolished, most fanners still chose not to market the fiuit themselves (due to relatively high opportunity cost of their time and low rating in product marketing skills relative to other fanners), but rather used marketing agents. Faced with increased price risk, farmers improved their market bargaining power with the agents by voluntarily fanning a private CO-Operative, which also provided them with more market information and",

This is the case because the US. is the undisputed world leader in agriculture. The most important goals the U.S. Farm Bill will address this time are: the farm economy, the budget restrictions, government interference, stocks, US. competitiveness and environmental and food safety issues. Each of these goals will also probably affect world agriculture and South Africa to some degree. Furthermore, owing to the very important influence that the U.S. Farm Bill and the GAlT negotiations have on each other and the importance of the GATT to South African agriculture South Africa has to analyse its own position. The U.S Farm Bill will affect South African agriculture whether the changes concern general matters or specific industries.",

Part-time farming in Canada, the USA and New Zealand is investigated briefly and compared to South Africa. A person qualifies as a farmer for taxation purposes if he has a genuine intention to carry on farming as a trade. The intention is established objectively. A part-time farmer can save taxation & purchasing livestock before he commences farming, eradicating noxious plants, preventing soil erosion, purchasing farming machinery and equipment, incurring expenditure to establish and maintain plantations and chosing levelling. A part-time farmer saves taxation when a deduction is not limited to farming income or an assessed farming loss arises which is claimed against his other taxable income. A part-time farmer is obstructed in saving taxation by the limitation of livestock purchasing costs and capital expenditure to farming income. The general provision against taxation avoidance should be considered particularly with regard to farming schemes. A person can be taxed as a farmer if he is a limited partner in a farming partnership.",

It has been used in research to assist the cattle-farmer with strategic planning. The unfamiliarity of climatic variables for planning purposes, made the study of historical rainfall from 1952 to 1991, imperative. On the grounds of Tyson's many years of research, a presupposition of 18 year cycles in the summer rainfall regions, were made. Rainfall until 2031 has been predicted for the Villiers District. Thirty rainfall simulations have been made and the data has been converted to kilograms natural pasture (dry material/DM) by the PUTU 11 simulation model, developed at the Glen Agricultural Development Institute. The pasture available for the specific period will determine the size of the herd. The current cash surplus after 36 years, normal distribution, is between R -I 500 000 and R I 500 000. Three scenarios have been made on one below average simulation outcome. In the first scenario twenty 9/10 month old calves were kept and the rest were sold. In the second scenario twenty 9/10-year-old calves were kept and the rest were sold and the older cows were sold during hard times and in the third scenario more than twenty heifers were kept until after the second calf; 5 year-old cows in calf were sold at a premium and during hard times fewer of the old cows were sold. The result doubles the current cash surplus, emphasizes the advantage of the model, is time-saving, stimulates creative thinking and creates effective management.",

The models are estimated using logistic regression analysis, and represent farmers' awareness of erosion occurring, perceptions that it is a problem worth resolving, and technical and financial abilities to implement appropriate soil conservation measures. Data were collected from five different commercial farming regions in KwaZulu—Natal. Results show visible erosion impacts, formal agricultural education, and perceptions reflecting the seriousness of erosion's impacts on the environment, positively influence awareness. Farmers investing their own capital when implementing soil conservation measures, and those doing this with no outside technical assistance are more likely to perceive erosion as worth resolving. Knowledge of erosion's adverse implications for agricultural productivity and the importance of extension officers for providing information on erosion and conservation decisions also influence this stage positively. Those with the technical ability to implement and maintain conservation measures regularly attend soil conservation courses, and help others implement conservation practices. Inadequate technical skills to implement soil conservation measures appears to be a major constraining factor within the adoption process. Financial ability is positively influenced by farmers' willingness to invest their own capital in conservation measures, larger proportions of farm area under crops, and perceptions reflecting on-farm financial and managerial benefits from soil conservation. Government expenditure should perhaps be targeted at extension programs to improve farmers' technical abilities to implement conservation practices, and at education and research that emphasises individual benefits of soil conservation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Freshwater aquaculture is stimulated by a decline in the natural marine resources. Advanced progress has already been achieved in the technical research area, contrary to research in the economic and marketing areas which were neglected. It is an industry characterized by high risks, lack of structural organization and the absence of an effective marketing system. This research is aimed at addressing the institutional organization and marketing system problems of the industry. The objective is the provision of guidelines for the development of a efficient and effective marketing system. The analysis was based on surveys amongst freshwater aquaculture producers and distributors and surveys of the urban black and white consumers. An analysis of the sea fisheries industry was also done. Trout and barbell (catfish) are the most important commercial freshwater fish species. Producer's risks are increased by relative large capital investments needed and the unavailability of inputs. Most of the marketing functions are still performed by the producers themselves and direct consumer marketing is apparently the most popular distribution channel. Trout is marketed at a high price as a “luxury” consumer product whereas barbell is mostly marketed to local low income black consumers. There are only a few distributors of aquaculture products. They indicated that there is no real market for these products, but at the same time stress the unavailability of these products. They have no market development or product promotion strategies and exclude the preferences, needs and product education of the consumer from their business strategies. Differences and similarities of preferences, tastes, buying behaviour and consumption patterns towards fish were found amongst the urban black and white consumers. It can be used towards the development of an effective and efficient marketing system as well as feasible marketing strategies.",

An increasing number of limitations hampers the effectiveness of the profession and this may signal a need for curriculum revision. Departments of Agricultural Economics should recognise the importance of producing economically literate graduates who can function and perform in external environments. Curricular change must incorporate the inclusion of imaginative ideas development that will be able to connect economic rationality with changing perceptions. Services of academic institutions should involve inter alia, focusing their traditional efforts also on non-traditional markets; this provides some challenges of its own.",

The limited capacity of microcomputers has restricted the development of user-friendly optimizing models and as a result this handy planning method was not commonly used in the South African agricultural sector. The computer revolution has now made it possible to develop a DLP model for microcomputers. The planning horizon of the Optima model on microcomputer is six years and is most suitable for the comprehensive planning of livestock-pasture-grain farms. Assumptions, activities and constraints of such an optimizing model are discussed and the results of different scenarios analysed. The results show that the realistic scenario differs more from the pessimistic scenario and less from the optimistic scenario. The conclusion is that exceptional management is needed during times of lower product prices and yields. During favourable conditions more wheat is planted. This probably indicates wheat to be one of the most profitable crops, but that it is very risky during times of climatic instability.",

The main actors in the industry are the producers themselves, feed, equipment and other suppliers with retail outlets forming an integral part of the marketing of the products. Since the dissolution of the Egg Control Board, the industry is totally deregulated with supply and demand regulating the industry. When put together, the gross value of eggs and poultry meat was, during 1993/94, the highest of any agricultural product. The industry is also the single biggest consumer of yellow maize. It is a highly competitive and capital intensive industry that makes it rather difficult for new entrants. Apart from expansion by existing producers, opportunities for new entrants will include contract growing for existing producers and/or producing for a niche market. New small scale entrants will, apart from financial assistance, also need training, after care and help with procurement of livestock, goods and services.",

It has been used in research to assist the cattle-farmer with strategic planning. The unfamiliarity of climatic variables/or planning purposes, made the study of historical rainfall from 1952 to 1991, imperative. On the grounds of Tyson's many years of research, a presupposition of 18 year cycles in the summer rainfall regions, were made. Rainfall until 2031 has been predicted for the Villiers District. Thirty rainfall simulations have been made and the data has been converted to kilograms natural pasture (dry material/DM) by the PUTU 11 simulation model, developed at the Glen Agricultural Development Institute. The pasture available for the specific period will determine the size of the herd. The current cash surplus after 36 years, normal distribution, is between R -1 500 000 and R 1 500 000. Three scenarios have been made on one below average simulation outcome. In the first scenario twenty 9110 month old calves were kept and the rest were sold. In the second scenario twenty 9/10-year-old calves were kept and the rest were sold and the older cows were sold during hard times and in the third scenario more than twenty heifers were kept until after the second calf. 5 year-old cows in calf were sold at a premium and during hard times /ewer of the old cows were sold. The result doubles the current cash surplus, emphasizes the advantage of the model, is time-saving, stimulates creative thinking and creates effective management.",

The results show tlmt agricultural workers, cropped land, fertilizer and use of tractors had significant effects on the regional total agricultural and food production growth.

A Nerlovian partial adjustment Jagged model was used to estimate the maize supply response of fanners in the Middledrifi district of the Eastern Cape to changes in product prices. The results indicate that producers are responsive to price incentives and their response is elastic in both the short (1,23) and long run (1,41). The coefficient of adjustment which measures the speed of adjustment is 0,87. The prices of maize and the competing crop (sorghum) and the areas under maize in the preceding season are found to be important factors to the producers in their land allocation decision making process. The model therefore shows that fanners to cl1anges in product prices to product price changes to changes in product prices.",

The use of CPDs serves to portray the uncertainty and nature of the outcome as well as the financial implications of the inclusion of altemative enterprises clearly. Since the decision maker is familiar with the total width of outcome of the financial criteria, the probability of a specific required outcome level being realised can be detem,ined. ln addition the model can be used to evaluate cash and credit flow interactively in the decision-making process.

    "abstract": "Risk-efficient centre pivot investment strategies can be selected by taking into account both cumulative probability distributions of the estimated after-tax income from alternative centre pivot investments and the producer's preferences. Ordinary and generalized stochastic dominance criteria are used as decision-making criteria. Eighteen typical centre pivot systems were identified on the basis of differences in capacity, size, pumping height and soil type. The estimated net present values for a wheat/maize/cotton rotation crop system were calculated for each investment by taking production and price risks into consideration. Stochastic dominance criteria facilitate the selection of the risk-efficient strategies that will be preferred by different decision-makers, on the basis of the total probability distributions of outcomes. In most cases stochastic dominance of the first degree gives a single strategy which is dominant. Only by using the generalized stochastic dominance criterion can investment strategies be placed in order of preference. However, in this case decision-makers with varying degrees of risk-sensitivity do not differ in respect of centre pivot investment strategics that would satisfy their spesific preferences.",

A variability index based on the coefficient of variation was used throughout the study. The results were based on monthly data for the period 1980 through 1993. Prices were generally found to be more variable than quantities. The five vegetables investigated were subject to a similar degree of variation in quantity. Potatoes and tomatoes were subject to substantially less price variation than onions, carrots and cabbage. The data were seasonally adjusted by means of the Census X-11 method and the variability in seasonal adjustment factors was subsequently calculated. The prices of the five vegetables were subject to substantially more seasonal variation than the quantities. However despite significant seasonal variations in the quantity and particularly the price of fresh vegetables, nonseasonal (random) variation still dominates the overall variability in the data.",

A simulation model that calculates total inventory costs at given stock levels for both white and yellow maize, is described. The model takes both holding costs and out of stock costs, as well as the variability of maize production and uncertain demand for maize, into account. Structural adjustments and maize prices are explicitly accommodated to accentuate structural changes and the role of prices. Results show that the present total maize carry-over stocks of 900 kt per annum are near the optimum. The relative importance of white maize to yellow maize should however increase. UITTREKSEL Hierdie artikel handel oor die ekonomies optimale oordragvoorrade van mielies. 'n Simulasiemodel wat totale voorraadkoste by gegewe voorraadvlakke vir beide wit- en geelmielies bereken, word beskryf. Die model neem beide houkoste en uitvoorraadkoste, sowel as die variabiliteit van mielieproduksie en onseker vraag na mielies in ag. Struktuuraanpassings en mieliepryse word eksplisiet geakkomodeer ten einde die struktuurveranderings en rol van pryse te aksentueer. Resultate toon dat die huidige totale mielie-oordragvoorrade van 900 kt per jaar naby aan die kol is. Die relatiewe belangrikheid van witmielie-oordragte tot die van geelmielies behoort egter vergroot te word.",

    "abstract": "Futures trading serves a useful economic purpose because, in an uncertain world, someone must assume a speculative role for there to be production and distribution. An economy based on private property gives people leeway in what they choose to own. One's choice is dictated by many considerations including alternative opportunities to produce and to invest. A key point is that a producer's capital commitments (ownership) for production can be lessened by renting durable assets or by contracting with others to provide needed services. Whoever owns the durable or single-use goods assumes the responsibility for any gains or losses arising out of the changing market value of these goods. In agriculture, forward contracts are a major way to shift ownership responsibility for commodities on to different people or firms. A futures contract is nothing more than a particular type of forward contract, namely one that is traded under special rules and regulations of an organised commodity exchange and the Government, and each contract for a particular commodity and market place is identical. There is little or nothing that can be accomplished through organised futures trading in a commodity that cannot be accomplished without it. However, the costs and inconvenience are often much less through futures trading if the market is functioning properly. The protection of their own interests by farmers may prohibit the proper development of futures markets in the Republic of South Africa.",

The most important constraint facing emerging fanners is assumed to be start-up capital. An expert panel of scientists and commercial apple farmers were drawn into an interactive, computer assisted dialogue to design alternative apple production systems requiring significantly scaled-down investment. Within imposed capital constraints, production technologies were designed using horticultural integrity and feasibility as criteria. Each model was then subjected to economic analysis. Net present values for 10 and 20 year orchard lives, internal rates of return and other criteria are applied. The analysis explores feasibility within the particular constraints of small-scale farming such as available household labour and risk averseness. One model passes most feasibility tests under a wide range of conditions. Assumptions within that model should form important considerations for small farmer establishment programs. Lastly, a portrait of a possible two hectare apple farm is presented.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater aquaculture is stimulated by a decline in the natural marine resourte1. Advanced progress has already been achieved in the technical research area, contrary lo research in the economic and marketing areas which were neglected. It is an industry characterized by high risks, lack of structural organization and the absence of an effective marketing system.This research is aimed at addressing the institutional organization and marketing system problems of the industry. The objective is the provision of guidelines for the development of a efficient and effective marketing system. The analysis was based on surveys amongst freshwater aquaculture producers and distributors and surveys of the urban black and white consumers. An analysis of the sea fisheries industry was also done. Trout and barbell (catfish) are the most important commercial freshwater fish species. Producer's risks arc increased by relative large capital investments needed and the unavailability of inputs. Most of the marketing function& arc still performed by the producers themselves and direct consumer marketing is apparently the mosl popular distribution channel. Trout is marketed at a high price as a luxury consumer product whereas barbell is mostly marketed to local low income black consumers. There are only a few distributors of aquaculture products. They indicated that there is no real market for these products, but at the same time stress the unavailability of these products. They have no market development or product promotion strategics and exclude the preferences, needs and product education of the consumer from their business strategics. Differences and similarities of preferences, tastes, buying behaviour and consumption patterns towards fish were found amongst the urban black and white consumers. It can be used towards the development of an effective and efficient marketing system as well as feasible marketing strategics.",

Grassroots legal issues have received scant attention. The evolutionary process of organising can be assisted by utilising and adapting conventional legal principles and frameworks. These frameworks can increase the community's capacity to access, and coiitrol, the resources it requires for development.

Discriminant analysis identified growers who were more likely to be affected by the abolition of the Banana Board as those who (1) previously marketed most of their quality fruit through the Board, (2) were less willing to take production risks, (3) were not sole owners of their farm business, (4) perceived the marketing potential on the LSC to be poor, and (5) had relatively high debt-asset ratios. After the Board was abolished, most farmers still chose not to market the fruit themselves (due to relatively high opportunity cost of their time and low rating in product marketing skills relative to other fanners), but rather used marketing agents.

In addition opportunity costs, interest and risk of market access materially affect both profitability and risk of a beef production system. Beef producers should adapt their production and marketing strategies to economic realities in order to achieve optimum results.",

Two typical farming units and five irrigation systems were used as basis. Data was processed by means of a deterministic micro-computer model. Specific factors which were considered arc the system type, initial debt and irrigation water availability. The economic and financial viability of each combination arc discussed. Stochastic dominance is used to cal culate the risk-efficiency of the various systems. Results show that income is the most critical factor in such an evaluation. Water restrictions increase the relative profitability of capital intensive systems with a higher irrigation efficiency.",

A conceptual framework of sustainable agriculture was developed in order to address the problem. This framework can successfully be applied for the evaluation and planning of agricultural systems. The framework was used to evaluate the alternative agricultural schools of thought. Further an attemp was made to uncover the disparities that were evident among the alternative schools. It was found that the application of environmentally friendly practises in their own right, did not conclusively address the matter of agricultural sustainability. Agriculture can only be sustainable over the long run if economical, political, aesthetical, ethical and scientific variables are simultaneously addressed. Uittreksel Die doel van die artikel is om die verwarring wat bestaan oor die betekenis van volhoubare landbou (\"sustainable agriculture\") op te klaar. Ten einde die vraagstuk aan te spreek is 'n konseptuele raamwerk daargestel waarvolgens die evaluering en beplanning van landboustelsels kan plaasvind. Hierdie konseptuele raamwerk is gebruik om alternatiewe denkskole te evalueer. Daar is verder gepoog om die verskille wat bestaan tussen alternatiewe denkskole bloot te lê. Daar is bevind dat die toepassing van omgewingsvriendelike praktyke assulks nie die kwessie van landbou volhoubaarheid bevredigend genoeg aanspreek nie. Landbou kan egter oor die langtermyn slegs volgehou word as die voortdurend veranderende ekonomiese, politieke, estetiese, etiese en kennis of wetenskapsvraagstukke gelyktydig aangespreek word",

Many ranching areas are characterised by large climatological variation, which in its turn leads to variable availabilites of edible plants. Beef prices are subject to cyclical and seasonal variation. Market access is limited by the permit/quota system. Market planning and adaptability that will enable farmers to adjust stock numbers to both marketing strategy and ecological conditions is a key to financial success. Farmers should limit capital expenditure; this includes limitations in number of camps and number of herds. Larger camps, fewer herds and multisire mating appear to be associated with financial success.",

The results show that some 65.4% of financial stress, for sample farms, is due to an income problem, 25.6% to leverage and 9.0% to an interest rate problem.

Various degrees of double cropping were considered. A procedure was followed to generate distributions of prices for the relevant crops. The crop yield distributions were generated by the PUTU-simulation model. The annual after-tax cash now was calculated for the different crop rotation systems for each year of the ten year period for two static pumping heights and three different equity ratios. The results indicate that all crop rotation systems are infeasible for a 30/70 equity ratio for positive pumping heights. For a 80/20 equity ratio 14 crop rotation systems are feasible.",

The regional economy is dominated by Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage and East London which account for most of the population and three-fourths of the Gross Geographic Product (GGP). Agriculture accounts for only 10% of GGP, but is one of the most labour intensive sectors in a region with 24% of its population unemployed. The agricultural economy of the region is very diversified, but livestock farming plays the most important part in all areas contributing 72% of gross income. The chief changes which have occured in East Cape farming, as elsewhere, have been the decline in the number of farms and increase in farm size, greater capital investment, increased specialisation and declining employment. There are also indications, though based on limited information, of an apparent decline in the real returns to capital investment from livestock farming in the Smaldeel area. The causes are, inter alia, rising interest rates, inflation and a decade of below average rainfall. The implications for prospective commercial farmers is that the industry will continue to be difficult to enter because of the relatively large capital requirements and low short-term returns Several possibilities, especially in direct sales and alternative labour arrangements may nevertheless enable successful competition.",

As consumers become hard pressed to make ends meet they will become more sensitive of their rights and critical of the free market system. Agriculture can help consumers by making surplusses available to the poor, assisting educational and counselling programmes and promoting the free market system by selling directly to the informal sector. The challenge for agriculture lies in redressing marketing problems of the past in order to ensure that current and future business practices are beyond reproach.",

The impact of advertising as a means of promoting agricultural commodities, have to be evaluated in terms of consumer response and the effectiveness of advertising agricultural products, by assuming that advertising can increase the level of sales at any given price by Shifting the demand curve for a specific product to the right, or increase the price or both. Although South Africa is a part of Africa, it has a highly developed and sophisticated marketing structure which necessitates the analysis and decomposition of foreign advertising research done in Europe and America for possible application in South Africa, due to the virtually non-existence of research on generic or brand advertising of agricultural products in South Africa. Empirical research on the effects of advertising generally indicates a positive effect on sales that continues beyond the time of initial advertising. Most analyses considering the effect of advertising on consumer demand for agricultural commodities have pragmatically focused on single-equation demand relations using aggregate data. However, limitations of the single equation approach exists. In general, empirical evidence shows that brand advertising is more efficient than generic advertising.",

Generally results indicated that the intensity of purchased requisites use was negatively related to plot size, crop sales tended to come from larger plots and households with crop sales tended to make more use of improved technology such as tractor hire and fertilizers. These results compared favourably with those of studies making use of alternative methods.",

Complete measurement requires the use of both physical and financial data in analysis and the possibility to reconcile back to the financial statements of the organisation. At farm production level partial measurements are normally used to measure the productivity of certain aspects in the production process. The danger exists that interpretation from partial measures may be biased and consequently lead to sub-optimum decisions. This may be the case were labour is substituted with machinery were the gain in labour productivity is not off set against the productivity loss in capital. The relevant importance of the available measurement techniques at the different hierarchical levels in the organisation, is indicated. From the discussion it will be evident that complete productivity analysis enhance a holistic approach towards business decision making. It is also important to follow a longer term orientation towards productivity measurement and improvement. Uncontrollable factors may have a negative effect on productivity in the short term. A trend line over time will indicate the success or failure of the organisation to reach productivity improvement.",

The best method of acquiring the information to specify a typical farming unit is probably to use a combination of the group discussion technique and a postal survey. The typical value of every feature is best described by the median value of the distribution of the data for that feature. The simulation technique was used to determine the effect of inflation, interest rates, debt burden ratio and farm size on the financial results of the typical farm. The analyses indicate that every variable singly, and inflation, interest rates and debt burden ratios in combination, have a significant effect on the cash flow situation of farming in the Bechuanaland subregion.

An econometric model shows that expected real net realisation revenue/hectare and real interest rates drive real quota land values. Quotas will be worthlesson abolition, but some quota rents will be transferred into higher land rents at the new blend price, raising subsequent non-quota land values. This would offset to some extent an expected fall in current A-pool land values which reflect the combined value of land and quota. B-pooll and values will rise as the expected new blend price will be above the net export realisation price which currently determines the profitability of B-pool production. The prospect of asset value losses explains why quotas will only be phased out over four years, growers lobbied for a greater proceeds split to support the blend price and the tariff was retained.",

Hoewel daar nie 'n direkre verwantskap tussen naskoolse opleiding en vergoeding bestaan nie, kan die afleiding gemaak word dat naskooise opleiding 'n goeie belegging vir plaasbestuurders is, aangesien die poste met die grootste verantwoordelikhede (groot salarisse) deur betekenisvol meer persone met 'n graad of diploma as die daarsonder gevul word.",

The adoption of Eskom's proposed Ruraflex load management programme will be affected by the risk preference of the irrigation fanner, the application capacity of the irrigation system, the plant extractable soil water (PESW) of the soil and the efficiency with which irrigation management can adapt to load management. Load management programmes can potentially increase the economic efficiency of some irrigation farms because the amount of incentive required by irrigation farmers varies between R6/ha and R282/ha. An increase in the application capacity of an irrigation system dramatically diminishes the risk of income losses when insufficient irrigation water is applied due to reduced pumping capacity caused by load management. Further research should be focused on the tradeoffs between the reduced risk of income losses and the capital outlay needed for increasing the application capacity of irrigation systems.",

The Government gives a clear indication with their present subsidy policy of a withdrawal out of agriculture and wants supply and demand to play a bigger role in the determining of prices. Maize and wheat are examples of the implementing of this policy. GATT members are currently liberalising world agriculture to get it on more common ground. SA will in future be more exposed to international trade and big price fluctuations. The suspension of sanctions will also contribute to this. The uncertainty of the SA climate imply a bigger dependence on international trade through either imports or exports. Against this background the need for for a decrease in price risk originates. With this risk there is also a dependence on exchange rate fluctuations. Institutions like the Maize Board are using hedging methods on the Chicago Board of Trade to reduce the risk of international price fluctuations. Exchange rate covering is also used to reduce risk of exchange rate fluctuations. This action could be taken on both imports and exports. This paper explains how industries, organisations and individuals can use hedging as a method of reducing the risk of price and exchange rate fluctuations.",

The SAAU appears to favour retention of existing marketing and policy structures in agriculture and does not regard present international developments to warrant much change in domestic agricultural policy. It favours preferential treatment of farmers with respect to interest rates and subsidies, exemption of agriculture from labour laws and cooperatives from monopoly legislation. The government aims at deregulation. a bigger share for private initiative, economic growth, and less inflation. It favours reduction of preferential treatment of all favoured groups. including commercial agriculture. It wants to move to freer, more open markets and to removal of discriminatory laws. Both groups favour private property rights; the government wants to expand these. In the light of its wider range of interest and responsibilities and also external developments, the government approach appears to the more realistic than that of the SAAU. Future negotiations should involve more parties.",

The purchase is thus a substantial capital investment in equipment that results in a thorough pre-purchase examination of the various alternatives and the choice of a manufacturer. Since the average age of agricultural tractors is constantly increasing, the probability of replacement purchases of tractors is also increasing. This scenario demanded a study in buying behaviour that examined what factors are deemed to be important by the buyers of tractors for agricultural use. Eight factors were identified by means of principle various factor analysis. These factors are: Product and service qualities, Operational qualities, Pre-purchase planning, After-sales service, Ergonomics, Ease of operation, Cost of credit and Potential savings. These factors declare a cumulative variance of 55, 65 per cent. Three major groups could benefit from the results. First, the buyers of agricultural tractors since it could increase their level of understanding of the important considerations that are connected to the replacement of old tractors. Secondly, agricultural economists and advisors should be able to increase the quality of their advice if they have a better understanding of tractor buying behaviour. Thirdly, financial institutions ay benefit by a more indepth knowledge why a farmer applies for a loan to buy a new tractor.",

The Meat Board most likely only contributed to the momentum and maintenance of the concentration process. Secondly, concentration cannot be regarded simplistically as being the result of government interference. Such view is a denial of the problematic nature of economic power concentration and effective competition. The truth probably contains many more nuances. Thirdly, as far as policy is concerned, the narrow and one-sided identification of a simple (alleged) cause should not serve as a basis for an equally simple policy proposal. Contrary to certain arguments the concentration levels in the red meat industry would probably remain unchanged in an unregulated environment.

The two major components of the Scheme, the voorskot, or initial payment, and reserve prices were analysed separately. In the first part of the analysis only rainfall and the market price were found to be important determinants of mohair production. Although the voorskot price was found to be an unimportant determinant it may nevertheless have played an important part in making the Scheme as a whole acceptable to producers. In the second part of the analysis it was established that the reserve price had both stabilized the price of mohair and enabled producers to enjoy welfare gains. It was therefore concluded that the Mohair Scheme had played a major part in the re-emergence of South Africa as the world's leading mohair producer. Nevertheless, in view of the massive stock-piling in recent seasons, due to the reserve price being set too high, it was recommended that the Mohair Scheme be discontinued” or at least that the reserve price should support only the finer mohair lines and be set at a much lower long-run, market clearing level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract US imports of cut roses have increased steadily over the last two decades, from less than 1 million stems in 1970 to a record 314 million stems in 1988. The three commercially most important types are the sweethearts or miniatures, the intermediates and the hybrid tea roses. Almost all import are of the hybrid tea type. In 1988, more than 87 percent of US imports of cut roses entered through Miami followed by Houston and New York. In 1990, 74 percent of all imported roses orginated in Colombia. Prices of cut roses vary according to their physical characteristics e.g. length, freshness and colour, as well as supply and demand. SA can only export cut flowers via SAA to New York for likely sale on the New York Flower Wholesale Market. The single strongest point in selling roses is quality. Even in the worse case scenario where SA roses will still fetch prices equivalent to that of Columbian roses, the lowest on the market. The profit margin appears to be sufficient.",

The purpose is to identify conditions required to build a consensus on land reform among major players in the country. The paper finds no fundamental non-negotiable issues between the two. It advances three conditions to build consensus. First, the Government should involve the ANC in land reform. Second, this land reform should be of an interim nature. Lastly, Black people should be the main beneficiaries of land reform. The paper ends by drawing conclusions that are relevant to all actors involved in the debate on land reform.",

Unemployment in South Africa is a large and growing problem which cannot be solved by merely intensifying existing measures of employment creation. The promotion of entrepreneurship is therefore suggested as a supplementary approach to solving the unemployment problem. The lack of success with the promotion of entrepreneurship in the past indicates the need for an alternative paradigm. The concept of development, as understood by the social systems approach, is suggested as such an alternative paradigm of entrepreneurship. A framework of aspirations, abilities and context is derived from this paradigm to put existing measures for promoting entrepreneurship into perspective. Together with the findings of an empirical investigation into entrepreneurship in the Coloured community in the Southern and Western Cape, this classification is used as a basis for recommendations and suggestions for more effective promotion of entrepreneurship.",

This is partly due to the benefits of wetland preservation (non-use) being unpriced, as they are not traded in markets. These benefits are reflected by option, existence and bequest demands for wetland preservation. The Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) was used to estimate peoples' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for wetland preservation, using the Wakkerstroom wetland as a case study. Median WTP for option, existence and bequest values ranged from R15.01 -R20.00 per month. Key determinants of these values were annual household income, respondent education and age, household size and membership of other environmental organizations. Well designed CVM studies can help to make the public, policy-makers and individual fanners more aware of the value of wetland preservation, leading to more informed decisions being made about wetland use.",

Varietals, e.g. Chardonnay, have shown the most growth in recent years. US wine imports have declined substantially since 1985 but certain categories/varietals/brands still show growth. Wine should be pricecompetive within the quality category it is perceived to be. There are distinct price boundaries or price points for any given varietal. The relative medium priced wines, $5-10 per bottle, show the most growth. SA wines can be exported profitably within most categories.

The adoption of Eskom's proposed Ruraflex load management programme will be affected by the risk preference of the irrigation fanner, the application capacity of the irrigation system, the plant extractable soil water (PESW) of the soil and the efficiency with which irrigation management can adapt to load management. Load management programmes can potentially increase the economic efficiency of some irrigation farms because the amount of incentive required by irrigation farmers varies between R6/ha and R282/ha. An increase in the application capacity of an irrigation system dramatically diminishes the risk of income losses when insufficient irrigation water is applied due to reduced pumping capacity caused by load management. Further research should be focused on the tradeoffs between the reduced risk of income losses and the capital outlay needed for increasing the application capacity of irrigation systems.",

In a new dispensation optimal, rather than minimum farm sizes should be pursued. The optimal farm size is theoretically not the same for any two farmers. The better manager will have the larger farm over the long run. The above principle was empirically tested in the Vaalharts Irrigation area by means of cross sectional regression equations with gross income as dependent variable. The result confirms the following: i) If management is ignored, constant returns to size is encountered; and ii) when managerial quality is however included in the model as independent variable, increasing returns to scale is found. This result thus supports the theory and a general conclusion is that optimal farm size is a function of management.",

Domestic consumers may not benefit from lower world prices because they have to buy A-pool sugar. Projections of sugar consumption over the long term suggest that aggregate consumption will increase roughly with population growth. Changes in domestic and international sugar policies could have a major impact on production and consumption trends. Timber prices are now declining after five years of shortages and rising prices. Domestic demand for timber is expected to increase by 2,7 per cent per year over the next 20 years. Average annual planting rates ranging from 20 000 ha to 35 000 ha have been recommended by forestry officials. Farmers (and companies) decide on a particular enterprise mix according to the expected relative profitability of enterprises and perceptions of risk.",

Unemployment in South Africa is a large and growing problem which cannot be solved by merely intensifying existing measures of employment creation. The promotion of entrepreneurship is therefore suggested as a supplementary approach to solving the unemployment problem. The lack of success with the promotion of entrepreneurship in the past indicates the need for an alternative paradigm. The concept of development, as understood by the social systems approach, is suggested as such an alternative paradigm of entrepreneurship. A framework of aspirations, abilities and context is derived from this paradigm to put existing measures for promoting entrepreneurship into perspective. Together with the findings of an empirical investigation into entrepreneurship in the Coloured community in the Southern and Western Cape, this classification is used as a basis for recommendations and suggestions for more effective promotion of entrepreneurship.",

The application of financial methods, bridging fmancing or adjusted production practises can be considered to ensure the fmancial feasibility of an investment.

The model formulates specific quantities of 14 different poultry-, pig-, cattle-, and sheep rations on a minimum cost basis. A wide variety of local and international feed sources were considered for inclusion in the rations. Prices, the availability and quality of each feed, the inclusion of specific feed sources in a ration and the consumption of each ration could be allowed to vary independently. Price elasticities of demand for yellow maize were estimated after the price of maize was increased parametrically. Substantial differences in maize demand price elasticities for the different livestock enterprises were found. A relaxation of feed importation restrictions showed a significant increase in the price sensitivity of yellow maize and resulted in a decline in the market share of South African yellow maize in the livestock feed market. Policy implications are highlighted. Suggestions for further analyses that are possible via the model are also presented.",

    "abstract": "In a dynamic world of change, promotion of agricultural commodities will inevitably become more important, particularly with respect to intensification in the nature of competition, the complexity in distribution and differences between consumer and producer prices. The impact of advertising as a means of promoting agricultural commodities, have to be evaluated in terms of consumer response and the effectiveness of advertising agricultural products, by assuming that advertising can increase the level of sales at any given price by shifting the demand curve for a specific product to the right, or increase the price or both. Although South Africa is a part of Africa, it has a highly developed and sophisticated marketing structure which necessitates the analysis and decomposition of foreign advertising research done in Europe and America for possible application in South Africa, due to the virtually non-existence of research on generic or brand advertising of agricultural products in South Africa. Empirical research on the effects of advertising generally indicates a positive effect on sales that continues beyond the time of initial advertising. Most analyses considering the effect of advertising on consumer demand for agricultural commodities have pragmatically focused on single-equation demand relations using aggregate data. However, limitations of the single equation approach exists. In general, empirical evidence shows that brand advertising is more efficient than generic advertising.",

The aim of this article is to illustrate how factors which are important in this matter can be combined to make sensible calculations. Two typical farming units and five irrigation systems were used as basis. Data was processed by means of a deterministic micro-computer model. Specific factors which were considered are the system type, initial debt and irrigation water availability. The economic and financial viability of each combination are discussed. Stochastic dominance is used to calculate the risk-efficiency of the various systems. Results show that income is the most critical factor in such an evaluation. Water restrictions increase the relative profitability of capital intensive systems with a higher irrigation efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The US is the fourth largest importer of wine in the world. Wine consumers do not freely substitute one type of wine for another therefore each segment of the industry could represent a niche market for a certain type of wine. Wine is almost exclusively sold through labelling and brand recognition. Brand strength can be measured. Well known brands are consistantly out selling others. Varietals, e.g. Chardonnay, have shown the most growth in recent years. US wine imports have declined substantially since 1985 but certain categories/varietals/brands still show growth. Wine should be price-competive within the quality category it is perceived to be. There are distinct price boundaries or price points for any given varietal. The relative medium priced wines, $5-10 per bottle, show the most growth. SA wines can be exported profitably within most categories. However, selecting the target market and price category to match the product and brand is important.",
