    "abstract": "True populism in America is found not in anti-immigrant demagoguery or red-hatted rallies, but amid the pot smoke, pig shit, and people found at pipeline protests. In Pipeline Populism, geographer and political ecologist Kai Bosworth locates the title concept's reemergence in a 2014 Willie Nelson and Neil Young concert where \"cowboys, ranchers, hippies, activists, elders, T-shirt hawkers, nonprofit leaders, hemp growers, party members, corn and soybean farmers, and children\" came together in opposition to the Keystone XL and, later, the Dakota Access Pipelines (51). Bosworth argues those activists reveal how we ought to reconceive \"populism\" as the \"left-populism\" of the progressive struggles of the Farmers' Alliance of the late 1800s, beginning in the Upper Midwest (6). To understand populism's power in rural America and particularly pipeline protest, he asserts the importance of \"affective infrastructures,\" spatially and situationally defined emotions that create a sense of \"the people\": \"territorial resentment, resigned pragmatism, heartland melodrama, and jaded confidence\" galvanized a left-populist political response to environmental exploitation (4, 202).Place-based resentment in the rural Midwest factored into that populism. As corn prices plummeted in the mid-2010s and TransCanada land agents fanned out to secure concessions from local landowners, one farmer whose land was surveyed forced Bosworth to prove he had a South Dakotan 605 area code, had family in the Rapid City area, was not connected to TransCanada, and was not related to a Republican running for US Senate (56). Subsequent \"contradictions for which 'people' and 'land' were at stake\" required confronting South Dakota's settler-colonial heritage (47). \"They're treating us like Indians\" was a common refrain among those who resented \"being trod upon by state and capital alike,\" though Bosworth asserts that \"populist strategies centered on property rights did not overshadow the resurgence in anticolonial resistance led by Native Nations that takes the protection of water to be incompatible with the dominant property regimes\" (76–77, 87). Bosworth argues instead that left-populists fell victim to a reductive, affected \"heartland melodrama.\" Competing with racialized images of the Chinese and capitalist settler colonies like Canada stunted class-based anticapitalist identities in favor of region-based ones, Bosworth notes, that defended agrarian democracy at the expense of other identities (129, 147). Many pipeline protesters even acknowledged Canadian tar sands' threat to First Nations while downplaying pipelines' harm to Indigenous communities of North Dakota and South Dakota (153–54).Those white and Native activists alike who sought to engage the political process were united by feelings of resigned pessimism and jaded confidence. Those citizens felt ignored by the regulatory process of the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission, in which corporate witnesses and politically motivated officials marginalized legitimate concerns. Navigating these meetings, Bosworth narrates how \"'Untrained' laypeople\" were \"churned up by a regulatory apparatus that appears to already have all the answers\" (108). Little surprise, then, that rural Americans would become antigovernment! But the distinction Bosworth makes between faux-populists on the right and true left-populists stems from distrust of expertise: the Right rejects science because their \"common sense\" dictates otherwise, but left-populists rejected the \"'depoliticized' technocratic expertise of mainstream political science and economics, punditry and pollsters, and consolidated or jargony academic knowledges\" (173–74). Instead, groups like Dakota Rural Action and the Indigenous Environmental Network developed counterexpertise through watchdog monitoring of the Dakota Access Pipeline, requiring them to marry understandings of environmental regulation with \"cultivated 'observation skills'\" (190).This is a personal cause for Bosworth, who joined but did not collect research at the October 2016 Standing Rock protests and acknowledges that \"the politics of the blockade deeply condition what, why, and how I think\" (44). He wonders, \"Despite the rise in a populist genre of political rhetoric and mobilization, is it possible that we are no closer to producing radical, transformative climate action in 2021 than we were ten or fifteen years prior?\" (200). Here, his analysis misses one of the key outcomes of the agrarian populism of earlier years: those movements won state and local elections. There is a counterargument that modern gerrymandering and voter suppression in states like North Dakota have rendered such outcomes moot. But, Bosworth notes, \"the technocratic game of 1990s-style environmentalism\" is also to blame: groups like 350.org and the Sierra Club, one activist alleged, just wanted to list antipipeline protests on fundraising materials without \"doing shit\" (185–86).For its strengths, Pipeline Populism is better suited for experts or graduate students. There is an irony in noting left-populists' distrust of \"jargony academic knowledges\" while framing research in Gramscist and Spinozist terms (174). While Bosworth notes that \"the genre's openness and flexibility sometimes presaged internal contradictions, such as grappling with the limitations of democracy in the context of ongoing settler colonialism,\" the opaqueness of the jargon required to catalog populist environmentalism may explain its struggles to take hold (6).But Bosworth's research represents an important addition to research on not only the promise of populism or the pitfalls of settler colonialism but also on the infrastructures that bridge those divides. \"Drawing on the afterlives of the U.S. agrarian populist tradition,\" he argues, \"the easy-to-access rhetoric of U.S. American democracy, the language of the global justice movements, and a multiracial populism,\" should help scholars of agriculture, rural America, and political populism refocus our attention on \"'the people'\" (199–200). Pipeline Populism neither shies away from the hairy question of who \"the people\" are nor fails to confront the roadblocks to a fuller appreciation of that populace.",

    "abstract": "This edited volume assembles contributions from a suite of Native scholar-activists to explore how the concept of food sovereignty applies to various Indigenous communities throughout the United States, and perhaps in distinct ways to US Indigeneity as a whole. Chapters range from descriptions of historical Native foodways and their undermining through processes associated with settler colonialism to examples of contemporary initiatives and activities that are working to reform food systems among Native communities in the United States. The content speaks to the diversity of US Native groups and the environmental contexts in which they were historically (or are currently) situated. Thus, the volume also highlights the diverse traditional subsistence systems that characterize(d) US Native peoples, including both historically agricultural and nonagricultural societies, and the unique challenges faced by various communities to maintain or regenerate traditional foodways. Ultimately, the chapters work together to assert that efforts to promote food sovereignty in US Indigenous communities are critical to individual and community health, cultural revitalization and continuity, intimate and sustainable human-environmental (or nonhuman) relationships, and political and economic autonomy.Notably, all the contributors have deeply personal connections with their focal topics. The authors largely identify with an Indigenous community, and most chapters begin with personal narratives that position the author within the community or food initiative being discussed. Additionally, an introductory chapter presents a collection of short biographical sketches about various activists, some of whom also contributed chapters, highlighting their experience and direct involvement in the Indigenous food movement and providing the reader with an overview of food-system issues and initiatives occurring throughout the United States.Although some chapters lean toward an academic audience, most are less concerned with the theoretical aspects of food sovereignty than providing an account of a group's history or current food autonomy-related project in ways that are accessible to a variety of readers, including those generally interested in the cultural dimensions of sustainable agriculture. The focus on US Indigenous groups limits engagement with (and forgoes explicitly making some potentially key contributions to) broader understandings of food sovereignty, which is noted by contributors as an evolving, complicated, and even problematic concept. For example, the book fails to directly address questions about how the phenomena described differ from issues in non-Indigenous communities in the US or from the experiences of communities in other parts of the world, particularly where the concept of food sovereignty originates (i.e., peasant communities in the Global South). Although elements of this may be clear to some readers, the cultural and sociopolitical aspects of US Indigeneity are in certain ways distinct from other groups working toward more sovereign food systems, including the displacement of some communities from their Native lands, the degradation of key traditional resources, and the focus on the documentation and restoration of traditional foodways as both a means of building food sovereignty and for revitalization of identity. Thus, while the conclusion highlights that the book is in part an attempt to grapple with what is unique about US Indigenous food sovereignty, to do so in relative isolation proves challenging.Ultimately, Indigenous Food Sovereignty in the United States achieves its central goal: to recount activities and ideas that support the rebuilding of more autonomous and culturally significant Native food systems in the United States. The book provides a suite of specific examples and case studies that can help readers begin to understand the heterogeneity of traditional and contemporary food systems that characterize Indigenous communities throughout the US, as well as qualities, attributes, and challenges shared by these groups. In conversation with other texts and media, Indigenous Food Sovereignty in the United States can help to expose readers to the unique position of US Indigenous groups' efforts. Thus, this book, which includes a study question list for each chapter in an addendum, is well positioned to serve as a key text for courses covering environmental justice and sustainable food systems.",

    "abstract": "In Wild by Design, Laura J. Martin offers a history of ecological restoration in the United States that is both critical of its past and hopeful about its future. Ecological restoration refers to efforts to restore past biotic relationships among species. We tend to think of it as saving species from extinction, restoring their habitats, and helping them to thrive again. But since the nineteenth century, it has entailed a range of interventions, including selective killing, reintroduction, filling and draining wetlands, burning fields, and saturating the landscape with herbicides. Because ecological restoration compels us \"to make decisions about where and how to heal,\" it is deeply embedded in social values and political priorities (10).In sobering and candid prose, Martin shows us how ecological restoration is tied to the complex history of racism and complicity in the displacement of Indigenous people. She interweaves the history of the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and the Dawes Act of 1887, which the federal government used to open Indian lands to white settlement, with the establishment of game reserves and bird sanctuaries on those lands. Organizations such as the American Bison Society and the Audubon Society pitched their species restoration goals primarily to white settler tourists and hunters. Scientists saw opportunities on those lands as well: the Ecological Society of America initially argued that grasslands—formerly part of the Great Sioux Reservation—could be sites of ecological study in order to provide tools for environmental recovery in the future. Martin tells us also that the National Wildlife Refuge system as established by legislation in 1966 \"depended on the ideology and the administrative apparatus of settler colonialism\" (41).Defining \"natural\" is the bugbear of ecological restoration, as it relies on contested concepts of belonging and ecological stability. What does it mean to restore a place to its natural state? Eloise Butler, who created the United States' first public wildflower garden in Minnesota in 1907, collected and identified varieties that she viewed as native to the region. Similarly, Vassar College professor Edith Roberts created a garden-laboratory on campus in the 1920s to restore native plants that had been overrun by grasses and poison ivy. She and others tried to establish conditions in which native plants might thrive. But what plants earned the \"native\" designation? Often restorationists highlight the year 1492 as the obvious representation of natural conditions in the Americas. Martin views that precolonial baseline as problematic, not least because it imagines Indigenous people having no ecological impact. Moreover, blaming the first white settlers for stimulating harmful change is politically much easier than criticizing later projects such as industrialization and suburban sprawl.Much of the book focuses on debates about the degree of federal intervention in ecological restoration. Aldo Leopold emerges from the narrative not as a hero of ethical land use but as a skeptic of federal management in an era of New Deal spending. The federal government drove a great deal of ecological restoration for most of the twentieth century, and it became an official goal of the National Park Service. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 altered the priorities of the Fish and Wildlife Service and drove it to commit to programs in captive breeding and reintroduction.Martin draws fascinating links between ecological restoration and atomic energy. With ample funding from the Atomic Energy Commission, scientists explored the resiliency of ecosystems in bomb tests. Doomsday planning, Martin suggests, gave ecologists the idea of a threshold of damage beyond which an ecosystem cannot recover. Ecologists began to differentiate an ecosystem's structure from the functions of its parts, calculating whether some species could act as substitutes for ones lost. \"Today the goal of many restoration projects is to restore ecosystem functioning,\" she notes, \"but the origin of this goal in Doomsday planning remains obscured\" (131).Although Martin pulls no punches in her account, Wild by Design is not a takedown of ecological restoration. Consider her discussion of the Disney Wilderness Preserve in the Florida Everglades. Its very existence is the result of Disney's negotiation with government authorities as it sought permission to drain wetlands to make way for Walt Disney World. Martin believes that projects like this distract us from sites of harm, allowing corporations to compensate for them elsewhere. She sees a different path forward, one that is focused on justice and remediation of harm. Martin cares deeply about the goals of restoring habitat and mitigating damage, and she has used her formidable research skills to write a conscientious and compelling history.",

    "abstract": "In Phosphorus, Jim Elser (limnologist) and Phil Haygarth (soil scientist) provide an in-depth look at phosphorus-related barriers to sustainable agriculture. The main question they address is: How can societies continue to feed the planet's human inhabitants without increasing the quantity of phosphorus flowing into aquatic ecosystems or compromising the availability of the raw material from which the bulk of this nutrient is obtained? Elser and Haygarth, writing as scientists to a broad audience, seek to provide the context, technical and otherwise, needed to productively engage in phosphorus-related policy discussions.After an introductory overview (titled “Phosphorus Knowing”), the authors provide a solid discussion of the chemical, biological, and dietary aspects of phosphorus (in chapters titled “Phosphorus Becoming,” “Phosphorus Living,” and “Phosphorus Feeding”). They then examine the changes in global and regional flows of phosphorus that occurred in the transition to industrial agriculture (“Phosphorus Growing”). Next, Elser and Haygarth turn their attention to how nonpoint sources of phosphorus from agriculture threaten the health of aquatic systems (“Phosphorus Polluting”). Finally, they examine the availability of phosphorus rock as a raw material and what a sustainable system for delivering phosphorus to agricultural systems might look like (“Phosphorus Awakening,” “Phosphorus Reducing,” “Phosphorus Recycling,” and “Phosphorus Sustaining”).The strength of Phosphorus lies in the ability of the authors to examine various aspects of the problem in a way that avoids oversimplification. In preindustrial agriculture, soils generally maintained an adequate supply of phosphorus through the gradual weathering of phosphorus compounds from rocks or from the annual deposit of phosphorus-rich silt in river valleys. However, with the mid-twentieth-century dissemination of industrial agriculture, inputs of market-based fertilizers became crucial to achieving the high crop yields people now take for granted. The main raw material for the phosphorus component of these fertilizers is phosphate rock, which is likely to become more expensive in the future as easily accessible deposits of this resource decrease. Furthermore, as the quantity of phosphorus compounds added to soils has increased, so has the amount flowing into adjacent bodies of water, often resulting in problematic algal blooms.Elser and Haygarth tell this story from the perspective of scientists who have worked on phosphorus-related pollution problems over the course of several decades. Indeed, the book takes on something of a memoir style when the authors discuss their involvement in research projects associated with phosphorus-related pollution concerns and, more broadly, advancing the sustainability of practices for delivering phosphorus to agricultural systems. For example, they describe a shift from a general conception that “phosphorus does not leach from the soil,” which the authors were taught as undergraduates, to an understanding that heavy rainstorms can result in the erosion of enough soil (along with the attached phosphorus) to cause problems in adjacent waterways (89). They also discuss their involvement in a research network in which participants have made it their mission to focus on sustainability-related issues involving phosphorus.The use of a first-person point of view allows Elser and Haygarth to communicate the excitement they felt as they and their colleagues began to study phosphorus-related problems from a holistic earth systems perspective. In the chapter “Awakening,” they describe how confusion over the difference between reserves of phosphorus rock (i.e., material able to be profitably extracted at current prices) and deposits of the resource (i.e., material available to be extracted if prices rise) initially led to discussions among scientists about “peak phosphorus” and the possibility of running out of this resource in a few decades (114). However, as the difference between reserves and deposits of this resource became clear, the scientists reframed their interest, focusing less on the narrow issue of supply and more on the question of long-term sustainability.The chapters on actions needed to develop a sustainable system for delivering phosphorus to agricultural systems are uneven. On one hand, they insightfully describe what a sustainable phosphorus system for agriculture might look like in terms of the efficient use of material. On the other hand, ideas about how to construct the political economy needed to encourage movement in the desired direction is lacking. In this area, one can see opportunities for Elser and Haygarth to collaborate with social scientists who are examining efforts to address complex sociotechnical problems through approaches such as participatory and transdisciplinary research.",

    "abstract": "At the heart of Seeing Red is the massive land transfer from the Anishinaabeg to the United States as the newly independent country sought to transform Indigenous homelands into American homesteads. Focusing on the sixty years after US independence in 1783, Michael Witgen—himself an Anishinaabe scholar—examines the legal and diplomatic mechanisms that US officials used to dispossess Indigenous peoples living in today's states of Michigan and Wisconsin from their homelands. Whereas the United States expelled by force most Indigenous peoples living between the Appalachians and the Mississippi River through its infamous Indian Removal policy, Witgen asserts that US officials dealing with the Anishinaabeg implemented a different approach, which he calls a “political economy of plunder.” With this new concept, Witgen makes an important contribution to our understanding of Indigenous dispossession in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, demonstrating that, in the Upper Great Lakes, the US empire acted less as the settler empire it sought to be than as a traditional exogenous colonizer exploiting Native peoples and their resources.The opening chapter, “A Nation of Settlers,” explores the legal mechanisms that the United States devised to colonize the Northwest Territory (today's states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin) following the American Revolution. The 1787 Northwest Ordinance was the key piece of legislation organizing the territory's transition into states and regulating the sale of land from the public domain to US settlers. As Witgen explains, the provisions of the Northwest Ordinance were grounded in a political fantasy of the Northwest as empty land devoid of Indigenous presence. Even though US officials and settlers knew that Indigenous peoples still lived on these unceded lands, they nonetheless believed that Indigenous peoples could claim title to the land but did not properly own it because, unlike Euro-Americans, they lived in an alleged state of nature without private property and farms. For the US settler state, the idea of Indigenous self-determination on Indigenous land was simply unthinkable. Instead, US westward expansion demanded the elimination of Indigenous peoples from the land, through either removal or assimilation.Moving chronologically, the four other chapters illuminate how, time and again, the United States failed to implement its settler vision in the Michigan Territory, resorting, instead, to the political economy of plunder. Unlike the southern part of the Northwest Territory (Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois) that saw a rapid settler invasion of Indigenous homelands after 1783, the Michigan Territory long remained dominated by the fur trade, which required the ongoing presence of Anishinaabe families hunting and processing the furs. Into the 1830s, the Anishinaabeg dominated the demography in most areas of the Michigan Territory. Individual stories, such as the experience of anglophone Protestant missionary William Boutwell, who felt like an outsider in an Anishinaabe-speaking world dominated by kinship ties rather than private property, convincingly illustrate how elusive US ambitions to settler sovereignty over the region were. In this context, US officials relied on traders and Indian agents with kinship ties to the Anishinaabeg to bring the latter to the treaty table and fraudulently negotiate land cessions, starting with the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw. Understanding that the fur trade was in decline, traders intended to profit from the treaties by claiming much of the cash that the United States paid the Anishinaabeg for their lands as debt and by providing the trade goods promised in various treaties. Contrary to the familiar focus on removal, Witgen illuminates how plundering annuities paid to the Anishinaabeg for decades was what benefited traders the most in the absence of a large white settler population. While impoverished and reduced to a fraction of their former territory, the Anishinaabeg evaded removal, forcing the United States “to see itself as a nation of settlers living on stolen land” (337).A short review cannot do justice to Witgen's fine analysis or the multiple subarguments he develops. Witgen is to be commended for emphasizing the ongoing legacy of the economy of plunder into the twenty-first century and calling for a reckoning with the United States' original sin of Indigenous land theft, not just the sin of enslavement. In fact, Witgen masterfully illustrates the intricacy of settler colonialism and anti-Black racism in the early nineteenth century by analyzing how the states carved from the Northwest Territory were premised not only on Natives' dispossession and elimination but also on the exclusion of free Black people through a series of black codes. Seeing Red significantly contributes to our understanding of the white supremacist history of the United States and its legacy.",

    "abstract": "Iroquois maize farmers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries produced three to five times more grain per acre than wheat farmers in Europe. The higher productivity of Iroquois agriculture can be attributed to two factors. First, the absence of plows in the western hemisphere allowed Iroquois farmers to maintain high levels of soil organic matter, critical for grain yields. Second, maize has a higher yield potential than wheat because of its C4 photosynthetic pathway and lower protein content. However, tillage alone accounted for a significant portion of the yield advantage of the Iroquois farmers. When the Iroquois were removed from their territories at the end of the eighteenth century, US farmers occupied and plowed these lands. Within fifty years, maize yields in five counties of western New York dropped to less than thirty bushels per acre. They rebounded when US farmers adopted practices that countered the harmful effects of plowing.",

    "abstract": "In Dividing Paradise, sociologist Jennifer Sherman explores the economic and social transformation of the anonymized “Paradise Valley,” a cluster of small, rural towns in Washington State. Once known for ranching, logging, and orchard crops, the valley faced economic decline until in-migrants from urban areas sought the area's natural beauty, relatively affordable housing, and opportunities for outdoor recreation. Looking beyond the standard narratives of success and decline in rural America, Sherman problematizes newcomers' efforts toward gentrification by considering the “human costs of the commodification of the rural ideal” (3).Initially drawn to Paradise Valley in 2009 by opportunities to rock climb, ski, and hike, Sherman was intrigued by small communities that thrived in the aftermath of the Great Recession. By the end of the twentieth century, deindustrialization, restrictions on public land use, and environmental factors destabilized the local economy dependent on agriculture and extractive industries. Over the course of several visits, however, she observed once-nondescript small towns rapidly adding amenities catering to middle- and high-income consumers: coffee shops, restaurants, yoga studios, art galleries, boutiques, and high-end hotels. These developments presented a striking contrast to Sherman's experiences in a northern California logging town that served as the basis for her first book, Those Who Work, Those Who Don't: Poverty, Morality, and Family in Rural America (2009). Her curiosity led her to conduct this ethnographic study beginning in September 2014. In keeping with disciplinary conventions, the names of places and people have all been changed.Paradise Valley is premised on the division of residents into two opposing groups: rural working-class old-timers and mostly urban in-migrant newcomers. While acknowledging the complexities within those designations, Sherman selected the terms because they were commonly used by locals and they sufficiently represented tensions “without openly disparaging either group” (32). Newcomers, who typically lived in the area for less than fifteen years, tended to have greater social and cultural capital, higher incomes, and more educational attainment than old-timers. They tended to hold liberal political views, whereas old-timers were more likely to hold conservative or ambiguous political views. Old-timers were also more likely to have experienced trauma and substance abuse. Interestingly, because most of the residents identified as white, Sherman noted that “race was not an issue that either group acknowledged openly” (34). Nevertheless, newcomers and old-timers “lived separate lives with divergent goals and struggles, not knowing each other well enough to even understand one another's worldviews and motivations” (192).Sherman allows the words spoken by residents of Paradise Valley to drive the narrative, emphasizing how lived experiences shape perspectives. For example, she finds that old-timers' political views have an actual basis in their daily realities. With diminished social and cultural capital and little generational wealth, old-timers face an unstable labor market, limited access to affordable housing, and few opportunities to fully engage in the community. In their experience, government entities create more problems than they solve. This is where Sherman identifies the nexus of the problem. She takes issue with the newcomers' propensity for community improvement through their faith in government, private donations, and nonprofit organizations. Newcomers described their intense engagement as volunteers and board members for more than seventy nonprofits found in the valley. Though overwhelmed by these commitments, they share firm convictions that the community benefits from their work on sports and recreation, education, conservation, the arts, politics, poverty alleviation, and social services. Unable to see past their good intentions, newcomers fail to see one critical shortcoming: viewing old-timers as clients rather than active participants.Real growth in Paradise Valley requires newcomers to recognize their role in furthering structural inequalities. The first step is forming meaningful relationships with old-timers and “come to deeper and more respectful understandings of those individuals who have been less fortunate in finding ways to navigate the current economic and social conditions” (205). Reshaping rural America requires large-scale efforts as well as grassroots activism that transcends the barriers of social class.With its proximity to larger cities, Paradise Valley has successfully shifted its economy toward tourism while attracting permanent residents with sufficient wealth and resources to retire or simply enjoy small-town life. While this type of transformation is not possible in most rural communities, and the narrative focuses on recent developments (taking readers up through the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic), Sherman presents an incredibly useful case study for historians of American agriculture. As we grapple with the often paradoxical notions of social class in rural spaces, Sherman's compassionate approach and accessible narrative provide a compelling framework for understanding perceptions of social dynamics in the countryside.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the twentieth century, massive development projects promised to improve living standards in communities all over the globe through scientific knowledge and modern technology. Most scholars who study such projects focus on their many failures and unintended consequences. Historian Laura Ann Twagira offers a novel twist by showing how the labor and agency of West African women sustained one struggling French colonial agriculture scheme, the Office du Niger, for decades in ways that were unplanned for and mostly unnoticed by the colonial authorities and engineers who oversaw it.The Office du Niger was, Twagira writes, “arguably the most important development intervention by the French in West Africa” (8). Seeking to use large-scale irrigation and new farming technology to boost food production in an arid, sparsely inhabited corner of Mali (then French Soudan), project planners made little effort to understand the West African colonial subjects whose lives and society they hoped to transform. They paid particularly scant attention to the women among the subjects whom they relocated, often forcibly, to grow crops in the project zone. Assuming that women lacked the capacity and knowledge to use technology, from the project's conception in the 1920s onward planners concentrated their efforts on men by making new farming equipment, crop varieties, and irrigation infrastructure available to them. Yet despite considerable funds invested, the Office du Niger never realized its anticipated potential for cotton and rice production, and at times the project actually created food insecurity in the zone where it operated. The office managed to survive through independence in the 1960s, however. Nearly a century after its creation, in fact, it continues to be a significant part of the Malian government's food security strategy. Twagira attributes the office's survival in no small measure to the embodied labor and skills of Malian women, whose resourcefulness as change agents and “rural food engineers” enabled not only their households but the project as a whole to withstand years of chronic food shortage (6).To build this case, Twagira assembles a wide range of historical evidence, including her own ethnographic observations and interviews, regional folk stories and song lyrics, colonial travel narratives, and documents from official archives. Her book's five substantive chapters examine gendered farming systems in rural Mali, the Office du Niger's establishment and its early recruitment of settlers for the project, women's reorganization of food production to make life in the project zone sustainable, the interplay between large-scale and small-scale technological innovations in farming at the local level, and the project's role in government efforts to ensure food security, particularly in independent Mali during the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s. The fourth chapter, focusing on the changes wrought not only by new dams and irrigation canals but also by the introduction of new domestic wares, amply demonstrates the value of Twagira's inventive approach. Her oral and archival sources show how starting in the late 1940s, metal cooking pots purchased from private vendors unconnected to the Office du Niger enabled meals to be cooked in less time and using less firewood than traditional clay pots. The labor savings generated by this change freed women up for other tasks (such as gardening) that helped their households meet basic nutritional and other material needs that the project persistently failed to satisfy. In some cases, project administrators modified their policies to accommodate such developments, while in others they remained blind to the micro-level labor and adaptations of women that kept their entire enterprise afloat.Fixated on costly high technology and mechanized agricultural infrastructure, French colonial planners generally overlooked the small-scale remedies, both extraordinary and mundane, that women applied to make the project zone's emerging farming systems viable. As the increasingly cash-strapped Office du Niger reneged on its promises to enrich the colonial state and feed its own laborers, women stepped up to alleviate the deficiencies the project had brought to local diets, and they thereby prevented its collapse. Twagira's insistence on Malian women's role as drivers of technological change at the domestic and community levels adds a fresh, welcome perspective to the study of farming, development projects, and colonial rule in the twentieth century.",

    "abstract": "Today California is by far the nation's leading agricultural state, accounting for roughly 10 percent of the total value of the agricultural output produced in the United States. No other region can boast its superb combination of climate, soils, institutions, and highly educated farmers. In the nineteenth century this advantageous mixture of agricultural inputs transformed California from a frontier society in 1860 into a virtual cornucopia by 1900. A hallmark of California agriculture has been its highly mechanized farms. Nineteenth-century observers watched in awe as cumbersome steam tractors and giant combines worked their way across vast fields. In the twentieth century California farmers led the nation in the adoption of gasoline tractors, mechanical cotton pickers, tomato harvesters, and dozens of less well-known machines. This paper will analyze the evolution of mechanization on California farms emphasizing developments in power sources and in the mechanization of small grain production. We argue that California's distinctive role as an innovator and early user of new technologies represented a rational response by the state's farmers and mechanics to the area's peculiar economic and geographical conditions. In addition, we argue that there was a dynamic process whereby early innovations paved the way for subsequent developments. First, we will show that many innovations were complementary in that the extra horsepower acquired to power one device was avail-",

    "abstract": "Few crop plants get as much ink as the African oil palm. As the “most widely consumed fat on the planet,” its palm oil is probably also the most contentious (1). Despite its ubiquity in both our markets and our debates, Oil Palm by Jonathan E. Robins shows us just how much our discussions were missing. With insight and nuance, the book provides a sweeping global, environmental, economic, and political history of Elaeis guineensis Jacq.—from its ancient emergence in West Africa to its vast and destructive agro-industrial plantations across the twenty-first-century tropics. The tome immediately stands as the standard historical reference on the African oil palm, and yet it does so much more.Using the African oil palm as its anchor, the book lays out the complex global assemblages linking slavery, colonialism, and international commerce across vast expanses of time and space. It charts the historical development and historiography of the post- and neocolonial plantation in West Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia as both a major feature and fundamental driver of global capitalism. And it is a methodological marvel of extraordinary reach, combining an immense range of primary sources on the oil palm with travelogues, correspondence, and corporate records, along with a vast library of oral histories, ethnographies, and other accounts. Seen through this geographer's eyes, I can only compare this book with Sydney Mintz's landmark treatment of sugar, Sweetness and Power. Like Mintz's work, Oil Palm is remarkable for its systematic treatment of global political and economic transformations mediated by a colonial plantation system that continues to order and subjugate peoples, plants, and places. This book uses the global history of a single crop to show us, in stunning detail, who we are.Oil Palm is as careful as it is complex. The book obviates false dichotomies that too often distort modern thinking. Binaries such as “natural” versus “human-made,” economic versus cultural, and hegemony versus resistance are dissolved to reveal fluid relationships. This honesty extends to the general tenor of its treatments of palm oil politics. The book is neither a one-sided treatise against a versatile plant nor an optimistic framing of human-environmental innovation. The analysis centers colonialism and violence but also reveals resistance, community, and the ingenuity of smallholders. Along the way, Robins is adept at discrediting historical myths related to the oil palm. Earlier claims that ancient Egyptians used palm oil in beautification or embalming rituals, or that the production techniques imposed by European colonizers proved more efficient or productive than customary African methods, are invalidated as patently false.Arranged thematically, but also roughly chronological, the well-paced narrative unfolds over eleven brisk chapters grouped into three parts. In accessible and engaging prose, Robins surveys a range of complex themes (such as the interplay of race, gender, and environments) and technical processes (such as food and biofuel chemistry) with clarity and dexterity. Encompassing the first four chapters, part 1 grounds the early histories of the oil palm in their African homelands before following their diffusion through the (post)colonial Atlantic World. The rendering of African landscapes and communities reveals a very human history of cultural-ecological collaboration and synergy. The story then introduces Europeans who quickly found value in the African plant and sought to appropriate it. Here Robins excels at unraveling the complex tangles of European and African knowledge and agency in the early development of a global palm oil market, as well as the Eurocentric historiography that subsequently clouded our view of those processes until now.Part 2 details the horrors of empire as they relate to global palm oil production. Beginning with the late nineteenth-century “Scramble for Africa,” Robins recounts the brutalities and ultimate failures of palm oil development within European imperial projects. Clear and succinct discussions of “legitimate” commerce, agro-industrialization, and food chemistry carry the narrative. Here nuanced treatments of exchanges between colonial powers and smallholder producers in both Africa and Southeast Asia stand out. In terms of labor, land, and production, the analysis shows how colonial control was always just an illusion. Revealing the continuity of colonial agricultural systems well beyond abolition, emancipation, and nominal decolonization, the book melds with recent work historicizing the plantation and the Plantationocene. This theme builds through parts 1 and 2 before culminating in the discussions of contemporary production systems and markets in part 3.The final part narrates the development of palm oil landscapes and economies from decolonization through the Cold War and into the globalizing neoliberalism of the twenty-first century. These chapters demonstrate how palm oil's rise to ubiquity was far from inevitable, but rather was the result of relentless lobbying and political decisions connecting Global North and South. Robins balances the incredible versatility of the palm and its oils with the unacceptable and deadly costs their monocultures extort from forests, peoples, and the communities they together create. Here, as throughout, Robins is careful to lay the blame for these transgressions not on the palm itself, but rather on the political and economic structures and decisions that seek to wield the species and its extraordinary efficiency and versatility.While any global history sacrifices some depth for breadth, Oil Palm treats each of the key issues, allowing readers a secure foothold from which to explore further. Succinct and action-packed, this meticulously documented book will appeal to nonspecialists and lay readers. Seminars in global, environmental, and economic history will find much to unpack in these pages. Scholars from a variety of other disciplines—including geography, sociology, and anthropology, to name just a few—will find much value in its clear discussions, inclusive documentation, and global connections. All future studies of the African oil palm and its politics will begin here. It is already exciting to imagine the works, historical and otherwise, that will stand on its shoulders.",

    "abstract": "At a moment when India and China are clashing over their borders once again, this book is a timely examination of the “scientific” practices deployed by the British colonial state in India through the course of the long nineteenth century to bring those borders into existence. In particular, it details the mapping of the region of the northwestern Himalayas, with Ladakh at its center, that led to its transformation from a crossroads of economic, political, and cultural exchange to an imperial frontier to be policed and enforced. The book argues that imperial attempts at mapping the region and demarcating borderlines within it were only partially successful, leaving behind a colonial legacy that the postcolonial states inherited and continue to wrestle with. Not only has this legacy embittered relations between the two neighbors, but perhaps most poignantly, it has rendered the once-prosperous entrepôt of Ladakh into “a fractured and disputed borderland” (3).The most interesting aspect of this book is its discussion of the emergence of the sciences of governance and geopolitics in the context of border-making practices. The colonial state's utilization of the tools provided by the emergent discipline of geography to transform indigenous notions of space into territory that could be physically rendered on a map was preceded and accompanied by numerous attempts to survey and collect information about these spaces. This, in turn, generated a slew of manuals, such as gazetteers, which presented this information about the newly mapped territories in great detail and served as tools to more effectively govern and control them. As intelligence-gathering on the frontiers intensified and more resources were expended on it, so did the desire to regulate the border itself, through road-building and other such activities. These interrelated projects gave rise to geopolitics, a new way of thinking that combined geographical information with territory and security. Knowledge of rivers, mountains, watersheds, and other such natural resources was rendered critical to the formation and maintenance of states, particularly on their frontiers.The irony of this geopolitical project, the book demonstrates, was that it failed in the very laboratory that was crucial to its birth—the northwestern Himalayas—where it was unable to draw a single line through the Aksai Chin that would demarcate a clear border between India and China. This was not from lack of trying, and the story of the repeated attempts to do so forms a large part of the book. The individuals involved in this project—besides the British surveyors, cartographers, adventurers, and spies—were the “trans-frontier men,” as the book refers to them. These men regularly traversed the emergent frontier and included highly skilled Indian pundits who drew on indigenous knowledge to assist in surveying and mapping, as well as Yarkandi and Ladakhi officials, traders, and pony drivers, among others. It is here that the book misses an opportunity to give readers a more textured sense of these individuals themselves, their life histories, and how they navigated the new political landscape while shaping the emergent science of geopolitics.The most significant victim of this project of imperial boundary-making and its postcolonial legacies, the book illustrates well, has been Ladakh, which was a part of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir during the colonial period, then became a part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir in independent India, and since 2019 has been a union territory ruled directly by the Indian central government. While on the one hand it has been caught up in two geostrategic conflicts—the struggle between China and India on their borders as well as the dispute between India and Pakistan over the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir—on the other, it has come to occupy an increasingly ambiguous and marginalized position within the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and India as a whole. As the book demonstrates, ever since Ladakh was territorialized and its territory became central to the imperial frontier and later the border of the nation state, its inhabitants have been rendered into not much more than peripheral actors to be surveilled and controlled in the name of imperial and national security.The Frontier Complex is an engaging account of the confluence of geographical knowledge, definitions of territory, and ideas of security in the creation and maintenance of imperial borders in the nineteenth century, which have had profound implications for the relationships among states into the twenty-first century. It is thus a must-read for anyone seeking to understand the antecedents of these relationships and what continues to drive them at the contemporary moment.",

    "abstract": "To imagine seeing without an eye and smelling without a nose brings us to Michael J. Hathaway's ethnography of the world-making of fungi—the matsutake mushroom, specifically. The central theme reveals that fungi are as agentive as humans or animals, a line of thinking that itself grows from the fertile soil of two anthropological engagements. One is biosemiotics, which theorizes that organisms interpret, instead of react to, their surroundings. The other is a world-making approach where curiosities reside in “qualities, properties, and lifeways of specific living beings,” in making multiple and idiosyncratic worlds that intersect and overlap (19). Such perspective is distinct to the mainstream attention toward nonhuman agency that has arisen since the 1980s.Chapters 1–3 channel the experience of fungi from an inner perspective. Over deep time, fungi have fostered terrestrial life by converting rock into minerals, forming symbiosis with plant roots, and exchanging messages in the surrounding ecosystem. Today, fungi continue to shape the planet in ways we have only begun to recognize. Hathaway writes of the scientific experiments on fungi's power to clean up anthropogenic pollution, such as cigarette butt–eating fungi, plastic-eating fungi, and fungi that turn radiation into food (chapter 7). Still, decomposition may take tens of millions of years to complete. By then humans may have vanished from the earth.Chapters 4–6 situate readers in China's Southwest Yunnan Province, the contextual home of the matsutake mushroom. It remains unknown when matsutake arrived in Yunnan, but they settled down well and have become one main livelihood of the Yi and the Tibetans. In response to the Japanese market's insatiable appetite for matsutake, ethnic Yi pickers entered a global economy where they are a primary labor force, but the smallest shareholders in profits in the commodity chain. Nonetheless, due to the meager options for local subsistence, matsutake has been a blessing for Yi villagers, allowing them to imagine a better life. Tibetan matsutake hunters, in slight contrast, are less desperate participants in the emerging matsutake economy, as their livelihood has long been entangled with yaks and barley, and most recently tourists.Perhaps due to the lack of scientific information on matsutake, the implicit promise of matsutake-insect encounters built on in the first half of the book is not satisfactorily delivered in the second half. Careful readers would sense a bit of gap between the earlier emphasis on fungal world-making without human presence and the matsutake economy centering humans. And yet the delineation of the entanglements between matsutake and humans is informative and bears witness to the most ethnographically strong representations of matsutake in the Anthropocene. Indeed, the methodological challenge of such research is one that displays the limitations anthropologists face in accessing the nonhuman realms of world-making, should they exist.Situated in an anthropology beyond humans, the book contributes to the long-running Matsutake Worlds project (see this book's foreword and Hathaway's personal website, https://www.michaeljhathaway.net). Meanwhile, with Hathaway's enumeration of scientific research and hypotheses on fungi, the book demonstrates an approach to doing an anthropology of biology—a subject glittering in a scientific symbolism, once seemingly beyond the reach of anthropologists. Moreover, the book invites further curiosities beyond disciplinary boundaries. What are “plant bioacoustics” (79), “infochemicals” (94), and “sporinators” (97)? These new terms evoke anthropological imagination (What questions can anthropology ask today that haven't been asked before?) and reflect on scientific evaluation (What can be qualified as a scientific subject, instead of an object?).The final note is on the two theoretical approaches Hathaway takes to interweave a world of matsutake beyond humans. The world-making approach proves a stronger argument. Readers would benefit from an elaboration on the mutuality between world-making and biosemiotics. Hathaway insightfully points out that what a mushroom lives for is different from how mushrooms think, the latter being “a semiotic-only approach” (96). But how can humans know how other organisms think without observing and interpreting what they live for? From biosemiotics to a world-making philosophy, what is the tension between how nonhumans think and how they live? With that, I highly recommend this book to academics who share an interest in the prospering domain of environmental humanities, as well as anyone who cares to consider the diverse possibilities of how these magical mushrooms exist, in all of their mystery, beyond the human world.",

    "abstract": "Hung in my grandparent's house was a black-and-white photo of my great-grandmother, Esther Melamed, wearing dirty working clothes and a bright white headscarf, maternally hugging a young calf. During the 1920s, the time the photo was taken, Esther raised milking cows in her small Zionist settlement in northern Mandatory Palestine. I grew up staring at the picture, hearing stories about Esther and her deep love for cows and people. My grandparents never mentioned the calf, which was most likely a female. It was left unidentified, with no name or history. Tamar Novik's new book Milk and Honey: Technologies of Plenty in the Making of a Holy Land is an excellent example of how people like Esther and bovines like her calf could (or, rather, should) be leading characters in the history of agricultural settlement in the region.Novik describes how biblical dreams of a land flowing with milk and honey drew Christian missionaries and Zionist activists to settle in Ottoman Palestine in the late nineteenth century. Soon, however, European settlers discovered a desert where they hoped to find a cornucopia. Novik shows how British colonial officials, Christian missionaries, and Zionist settlers promoted biblical visions of plenty using various technologies, legal decrees, and environmental policies. More than anything else, they reoriented the production and reproduction cycles of (primarily female) animals such as bees, goats, sheep, and cows and aspired to monitor and control reproduction among female settlers. Novik thus argues that plenty was not a description of the local ecologies that settlers found but a prescription for a technological shakeup that followed the colonial encounter. Colonialism in the holy land was thus more than a political project; instead, it was a \"biotic settler colonial project\" that sought to redeem culture and nature in tandem by creating plenty (144).The book opens with a short interlude telling the history of water buffalo and the people who grew, taxed, and eventually eliminated them from the fifteenth to the early twentieth century: a reminder of the region's long history of manipulating ecosystems, appropriating local knowledge, and utilizing bodies. The first three chapters focus on movement regulations as a biocolonial tool. The first chapter centers on local apiculture (honey production) and the introduction of movable frame hives during the late nineteenth century by the Baldensperger family, who were German French missionaries. The new mobile hives allowed year-round honey production and were used to demonstrate the superiority of colonial production over the local fixed hives. The second chapter focuses on British and Zionist efforts to regulate the movement of local goats and their Arab owners, both seen as environmentally harmful. Regulation attempts included measuring, counting, and categorizing and culminated with the Plant Protection Law (better known as the Black Goat Law) in 1950, which offered Arab owners replacements for their local goats with sheep or cows and advocated that Jewish owners adopt the house (white) goat over the local (black) one. The third chapter uncovers how some Jewish immigrants viewed local Arab shepherds as the historical link to biblical times and began imitating their shepherding methods. With time, however, Arabs were depicted as backward, and local practices were replaced by \"scientific shepherding\" that favored monitored pens over open meadows (84). The remaining two chapters demonstrate how \"producing plenty depended on the bodies of females\" (120). Chapter 4 focuses on the Zionist dairy industry, tracing experiments with cross-breeding and artificial insemination techniques to increase milk production despite local climatic predicaments. Finally, the last chapter tells the story of Bernhard Zondek, a German gynecologist who sought to solve the (overexaggerated) infertility problem among Jewish women and farm animals.Drawing on an impressive pool of sources, including agricultural manuals, memoirs, official colonial and state reports, and local media, Novik masterfully recreates the world of colonial technology and biopower. Arguing against the dichotomy between religious traditions and scientific practicality, Novik demonstrates that both shaped everyday practices of regimentation, extraction, and regulation of bodies and ecologies. Furthermore, her narrative also includes stories of \"everyday resistance\" (65) to the colonial project, highlighting the Arab petitioning campaign against the Black Goat Law and how local goats, sheep, and cattle frustrated the colonial project by refusing to stop grazing, staying in pens, and producing more milk, respectively. The various voices result in a vivid account of the complexities of the colonial encounter and illustrate how its shock waves continue to reverberate through local communities and ecological systems. Overall, Novik's work is a tour de force of historical analysis that would enrich historians of science and technology, environmental historians, scholars of Mandatory Palestine, and nonacademic readers alike.",

    "abstract": "Angus Winchester's engaging and wide-ranging study of common land is of real interest both to rural historians and those in a wider society who since 1850 have sought to reconfigure the ancient right that allowed village communities to share what was usually marginal land on parish fringes and transform it into a universal right to freely access agriculturally unproductive areas of the countryside. The first two-thirds of the book take several perspectives, discussing the scale and definition, legal position, management, economic exploitation, communal use, and settlement patterns on common land, predominantly in the medieval and early modern periods, before analyzing the process of change through the enclosure movement and the conceptual shift after 1850 to preserve and extend open spaces for everyone's recreational use in a majority urban society. The final third provides eight case studies of how specific commons evolved and survived in England, Scotland, and Wales, with a refreshing concentration on the North and West of Britain, where the greatest acreage of common waste and pasture lies.The great strength of the book is how it brings together a wealth of material on a disparate topic whose very nature is local and particular, to categorize and generalize across the whole isle of Britain using many well-chosen illustrations. It sets out the basic notions underlying common land and the legal differences between England, Wales, and Scotland. These are not easy concepts to modern minds fed misguided notions of absolute freehold possession. Access to common land rests on limited use rights, based on custom but enshrined in the common law. It existed over much greater areas than the common waste of rugged upland areas, forest, and fenland that form the focus of this book. In lowland Britain it was less often the village green than land on the edges of manors and between villages and hamlets. Winchester rightly ignores the common rights of open field arable systems and water meadows before the nineteenth century, since they would complicate already complex issues. This leaves the ways in which common waste was integrated with other agricultural resources tantalizingly outside his remit.In general, the book is stronger on the medieval and modern periods. The period in between is less fully discussed, partly reflecting that common land and rights rarely entered the written records of courts and government unless they were the subject of conflict. Much of the best archival evidence comes from court cases where predominantly local matters were resolved between a finite and often well-defined group of local people. Therein lies a paradox. The modern idea of common land for recreational use is about land set aside for everyone to use, not just local people with common rights. It is part of a wider set of personal rights under common law—the right to access private land provided you do not do damage (trespass), the rights of using defined footpaths and bridleways across private land (frequently circumscribed and covertly contested by landowners), and in some places the right to pitch a tent overnight (recently upheld by the English courts against the landowner's attempt to suppress on Dartmoor). The collision between local common rights (the NIMBY factor) and wider access (in this case to Birmingham day-trippers and off-road bikers) is evoked in the case study of Bringsty Common and Bromyard Downs in Herefordshire.The original concepts of common land survive today under pressure from environmental initiatives to reduce overstocking. These are making traditional hill farming economically unviable on what was always marginal, low-value land. Those who uphold common rights today are a mixture of farmers wanting to extract value from extensive grazing and rural dwellers set on maintaining (and even reviving) older notions of shared land use that stand outside the market. The elephant in the room throughout this book is that common rights were bought and sold over the centuries, frequently undermining the viability of the whole cooperative system. The eight intriguing case studies in the final third of the book illustrate the different ways that surviving commons have developed over long periods. Conserving the \"half-wild\" world of commons further alters landscapes that are constantly in flux. Those who protect surviving common land today cannot revive a long-lost rural landscape; they merely try to conserve sensitively elements reflecting continuities in the terrain.",

    "abstract": "It seems clear, in short, that men with real estate interests were those who prodded, marshalled and finally led the anti-cattle movement in Dickinson County. Their final thrust was the circular to drovers early in 1872, with the simultaneous passage of new herd law provisions a coincidental but welcome finisher. Local anti-cattle sentiment, whether resultant from propaganda, individual experience, or just predisposition, was in any event sufficiently aroused to ratify the speculators' coup. Whether a crusade not blessed with these leaders could have succeeded with such spectacular dispatch is doubtful. A similar movement in nearby Ellsworth County, for example, dragged on for five traumatic years, testimony to its failure to attract sustained, dynamic leadership.112 In any case, Dickinson's anti-cattle crusade was more than simply a spontaneous grass-roots upsurge against entrenched social or economic evil. The cattle trade, to the bitter end, had its partisans as well as its enemies. The last days of Texan Abilene, therefore, are less to be understood in terms of corporate community action than in the complex politics of community conflict.",

    "abstract": "Brian Lander defines his project as “the first English-language monograph on the environmental history of early China” (11). Lander tells the story of people in early China transforming the environment through the combination of technology and social organization, culminating in a centralized bureaucratic empire. Natural ecosystems were replaced with artificial ones, which were amenable to the extraction of energy by humans in general and state rulers in particular.The book's dual focus is on agriculture and the state. The opening chapter provides a theoretical introduction to the nature of political power. According to Lander, it is embedded in the production and extraction of surplus, intensified through violent competition among the states. The rest of the book traces the interplay between agricultural expansion and political power from the origins of agricultural food production in China circa 6000 BCE to the foundation of the empire in 221 BCE. Lander shows how domestication of animals and plants, especially grain crops, generated taxable surpluses available for appropriation by the states that, in turn, encouraged people to replace the surviving natural ecosystems with agricultural ones. Interstate competition incentivized states “to increase productivity for increased military power” and consequently scaled up the environmental imprint of human societies (203). This is why the aptly named Warring States period (453–221 BCE) was a time of extraordinary technological (e.g., iron metallurgy) and organizational innovation (e.g., bureaucratic government), contributing to the expansion of agricultural ecosystems.Lander's narrative is organized both chronologically and thematically. As a result, some historical periods are addressed in more than one chapter in varying contexts. Chapter 2 primarily focuses on the formation of complex societies during the Neolithic and early Bronze Age (ca. 8000–1000 BCE). This is the most “environmental” chapter of all. The author summarizes archaeological data on vegetation and wild fauna of northern China, the domestication process, human diet, health conditions, and impact on ecosystems.The following chapters are more focused on the state. Chapter 3 deals with the rise of political organization in China from the late third to the mid-first millennium BCE and shows how the increasingly powerful states expanded “the productivity, and thus the environmental impact, of human societies” (75). Chapter 4 focuses on the state of Qin, which, between the eighth and the third century BCE, grew from a humble regional polity in northwestern China to the unifier of the known world. Chapter 5 discusses the political economy and ecological impact of the Qin Empire in the third century BCE. Chapter 6 addresses the Qin Empire's legacy for the human-environment relationships in imperial China and argues that empires contributed to expanding agricultural ecosystems by establishing peace and providing physical and institutional infrastructures.The book is an outstanding contribution to our understanding of the human impact on the environment in ancient East Asia. Its excellent readability and Lander's readiness to venture beyond early China studies to engage a broad range of topics makes it interesting to a broad audience. These topics include the ecological foundations of political power and the detrimental effects of interstate competition on the environment.Ambitious projects such as The King's Harvest often expose themselves to criticism by specialists in the relevant research fields. Students of Chinese history may wonder if one can write an “environmental history of early China” based on the evidence from a relatively small region of Guanzhong (in the present-day Shaanxi Province of China). Lander's occasional overreliance on normative texts such as legal statutes would probably unsettle some archaeologists and environmental historians. Parts of the book—for example, chapter 5—are about institutions and state economy rather than environment and subsistence. Economic historians can be excused for frowning upon Lander's superficial treatment of markets as a driver of economic and environmental change. It has been ten years since Robert Marks's China: Its Environment and History (2012) identified markets as one of the three social structures, along with centralized states and farming households, by which the Chinese transformed their environment.Yet this criticism highlights rather than belittles the book's strengths. By focusing on the best-documented and historically significant region, paying attention to the actors’ ideologies and motivations, and highlighting the states as a central force in environmental history, Lander drives home the book's key message. Humans have successfully created political structures that destroy natural ecosystems, and they may also be able to create ones that restore and preserve them.",

    "abstract": "Maize, or simply corn—as it is known in North America—is the most abundant grain in the world with over one billion tons grown every year. Yet, an overwhelming majority of the millions of hectares planted with corn, globally, are strikingly alike. This simple fact, for over a century, has had scientists, breeders, and conservationists in a frenzy to conserve the genetic diversity of corn. Helen Anne Curry's latest work documents this conservation effort and the narratives of endangerment and extinction that have been created to bolster it since the nineteenth century. In the process, Curry reveals how the process of “salvaging” local and indigenous varieties of corn before their “inevitable” conquest by modern breeders' strains—with all the overt and implicit imperialism entailed therein—has occurred at the expense of efforts to support the farmers and communities still growing those particular “primitive,” yet genetically valuable, types of corn. Implicated in this story of missed opportunities and unexamined assumptions are not only scientists and conservationists but also the very idea of the inexorable triumph of industrial agriculture. Endangered Maize is more a history of an idea than a history of a plant. Yet it is essential reading for anyone interested in crop biodiversity and its supposed erasure.The chapters are organized to reflect the very process of seed conservation: collection, classification, storage, replication, international negotiation, evaluation, and cultivation. The first two chapters trace the fieldwork of a variety of seed collectors, including United States Department of Agriculture researcher Howard Biggar, seed merchant George Will, and academics such as Hugh Cutler, collecting seeds among Indigenous farmers across the Americas in the first half of the twentieth century. Chapters 3 and 4 document the collaborations of well-known breeder-botanists Paul Mangelsdorf, Edwin Wellhausen, and Edgar Anderson. These men served as the architects of crop conservation in the Western Hemisphere. Working alongside nongovernmental organizations and research institutes such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, with key positions on transnational committees such as the Maize Committee, they created and managed a network of seed storage facilities from Brazil to the United States in the context of the Cold War.The heart of the argument and the most compelling section of the book, however, begins with chapter 5. Curry uncovers how the rise of agribusiness and the corn blight epidemic in the United States led to the launching of the “seed wars” at the 1981 Food and Agriculture Organization Conference. There, Mexico's delegates introduced a resolution demanding equal access to intellectual property in plant varieties, on behalf of the Global South—where most of the genetic diversity in crop seeds came from but also where farmers remained largely dependent on Western multinational firms for their seeds. Mexico's efforts were thwarted by private seed companies and their proponents at international organizations such as the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. Instead of seed banks being managed by the United Nations, as per the Mexican resolution, they remained at research institutions such as the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center founded by the Rockefeller Foundation (functioning in this case as an extension of the US government and Western interests). In chapter 7, Curry emphasizes how from the very beginnings of the concern for crop diversity, farmers everywhere have resisted the so-called inevitable displacement of local “unimproved” varieties. Since the 1990s small pockets of conservators have practiced “in situ” conservation, where farmers have been encouraged to grow indigenous varieties instead of relegating them to cold storage facilities. It is the clear intention of the author to encourage such in situ efforts by expounding on the failures of the mainstream methods described in the rest of the book.A book that weaves together so many themes—conservation science, industrial agriculture, international treaties, Indigenous farmers, colonial policies, and multinational corporations—must have some gaps and weaknesses. The most significant of these is that even though Curry includes Indigenous actors in her research, mainly in the first chapter, her engagement with Indigenous perspectives is limited, especially considering her promise in the introduction “to document many displacements and effacements of indigenous knowledges and cultures” and to align with “the project of decoloniality . . . [and] indigenous food sovereignty” (11). Readers are not shown exactly how narratives of endangerment impacted farmers, Indigenous or otherwise, at the level of the individual. Finally, while the author strongly challenges the veracity of the narrative of extinction, hybrid and genetically modified seeds controlled by large corporations have—resistance notwithstanding—spread around the world, undoubtedly displacing local varieties. By the end, this central paradox of persistent resistance amid the stark reality of homogenous monocropping and widespread industrial agriculture is not quite resolved. With that said, Endangered Maize remains deeply researched and authoritative in its conclusions. It is a must-read for scholars of corn from any field as well as an important addition to histories of agricultural biodiversity and conservation.",

So dismal were the pros? pects of an expanded market for raw cotton that southerners agreed in 1787 to a constitutional compromise that prohibited the importation of slaves into the U.S. after 1808.1 Only 1.5 million pounds of cotton were produced in 1790. With a simple brushing and combing motion, the gin made it easier to separate the cotton fiber from the cotton seed. With the aid of a hand-operated gin, one person could clean 50 pounds of cotton in a single day, instead of the one pound that was possible without it.2 Within ten years after the invention of the gin in 1800, 35 million pounds of cotton was produced. By 1830 the figure had grown to 331 million pounds and just prior to the civil war in 1860, the amount had reached an astounding 2,275 million pounds! Much attention has been focused on the inhumane enslavement of African peoples to work as slaves and the impact of the slave trade and slavery in the South. Considerable attention has also been devoted to the history of industrialization, especially in cotton textiles, both in Great Brit? ain and the United States. But in recent years, insufficient attention has been paid to exploring the links between these two sets of events. In short, too many people treat the history of cotton textile industrialization as if the source of cotton was the moon, and not mainly (though not",

    "abstract": "Despite their success in boosting cereals production overall, the Green Revolution programs of the 1950s and 1960s were often criticized for failing to achieve their declared aim of alleviating world hunger. Most critics argued that the programs had produced a technology unsuited to the needs of small peasant farmers. This paper explores why such inappropriate technology might have been developed, focusing on the early years of the Rockefeller Foundation's Mexican Agricultural Program (MAP). It shows that some foundation officers as well as agricultural advisors had prior experience of the problems faced by small farmers in the United States and elsewhere. Moreover, the foundation's expressed concern for rural poverty does not appear to have been mere posturing by an organization anxious to be seen as an agent of philanthropy. Furthermore, the program's early work in maize-breeding was well tailored to the conditions of Mexican agriculture. Once the MAP was up and running, however, it became apparent that the task of getting new varieties and cultivation practices to small farmers was going to be difficult. Needing to make some kind of impact quickly, MAP staff chose to concentrate upon projects that were likely to find a rapid uptake. This meant setting aside the needs of peasant farmers to develop high-yielding varieties suited to large commercial farms.",

    "abstract": "In this engaging book, Kristin L. Hoganson attempts to overturn the myth of the Midwest as drowsy and disconnected from the rest of the world. An émigré from the East Coast, the author centers her story around Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, where she teaches at the University of Illinois. She bristles at descriptions of her adopted region as isolated, provincial, or “flyover country.” She draws a page from Thomas Bender's edited volume, Rethinking American History and a Global Age (2002), following her subjects wherever they go. She portrays border-crossings, commodity production, and the environment with equal enthusiasm. In other words, while she starts with a small city, she seeks to do global history.The author views Champaign as a good starting point to figure out if the rural and small-town communities at the center of the heartland myth “have always been as insular as the myth suggests” (xxv). She understands that Champaign had its own particular development and that there is no one typical place to use as a proxy for a region as enormous as the Midwest. She does not want to do local history, which she associates with antiquarianism. And while no one would call her an antiquarian, since she focuses on her adopted hometown, she runs the risk of sounding like a town booster or local critic.At the very least, the history of the Midwest is about two heartlands, the urban and the rural. William Cronon, in Nature's Metropolis (1991), showed one way of studying both by portraying Chicago as the center of a dynamic regional economy. Another way of getting at the diversity of the Midwest would be through studying people whose lived experience exemplifies the porous boundary between rural and urban. For example, the baseball star and evangelist Billy Sunday grew up on the Iowa prairie but moved to Chicago, found God, and then returned to Iowa. Jane Addams grew up in western Illinois and made her career working with immigrants in Chicago.It is hard to interrogate the categories of the Midwest and the heartland without at least a respectful nod toward cities. The region is home to a major metropolis in almost every state and includes Cleveland, Detroit, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and numerous smaller industrial cities. These places traded and manufactured goods. They were also centers of Black culture, and therefore our national culture.The author is not obliged to write about African Americans, and she chooses other good topics to explore. However, it would be helpful to explain their absence, or for that matter the near exclusion of the working class, from the story. The traditional story of the industrial heartland and its working-class movements may seem passé. But the tale of the heartland includes them, and has whiteness at its very core. Nikole Hannah-Jones, the founder of the New York Times's 1619 Project, has sought, with some success, to recast American history around race. That she grew up in a heartland industrial town, Waterloo, Iowa, cannot be a coincidence.This is a fun book to read. The author teaches and lives in a county dominated by the University of Illinois, which makes for the kind of quirky excitement that only a college town can provide. Her story includes interesting discussions of the highly mobile Kickapoo Indians, whose travels are occasionally by choice and more often involuntary. It also discusses the intersection of ecology and botany, Chinese hogs, wet-prairie drainage, British emigrants, exploration of the North Pole, isolationists, balloonists, weather forecasters, bird-hunting, and the borders with Mexico and Canada.The book includes a distinctive and welcome feature: so-called archival traces made up of short quotations from research notes. These additional primary sources, always interesting and often surprising, suggest new avenues of study for students and professional historians alike. The Heartland, with its varied slices of Midwestern life, combines abundant research with graceful writing. She illuminates how Champaign became part of a broader national culture with a stake in the global economy. It is a tale worth telling.",

    "abstract": "At the end of the Mexican-American War in 1948, the United States annexed what had been the Mexican Department of New Mexico, and as it did, it absorbed millions of acres of agro-pastoral land whose parcels had been under a communal system of ownership by Mexican citizen-villagers. From the heirs' point of view, the subsequent American system of adjudicating ownership of these traditional properties proved inadequate, leading to the loss of two-thirds of their commons to American land speculators and the US National Forest. Like the Native Americans, the heirs of these grants have long seethed in resentment over the steady erosion of their hold on their traditional land and culture. This article outlines the processes of despoliation of the land grants from their original owners, and, more centrally, sugests the historical cycles of collective struggle that the heirs have mounted since the 1840s in order to retain and wrest back their commons, as well as organize the grants that they have been able to secure. A stubborn land-grant movement has gone through various forms of collective action including clandestine violence, protest confrontation, legal strategies, and political lobbying. In the most recent phase, activists have hopeful signs that the US Congress is ready to respond to their demand for return of commons now under federal jurisdiction",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive literature both supporting and critiquing the Green Revolution, surprisingly little attention has been paid to synthetic fertilizers' health and environmental effects or indigenous farmers' perspectives. The introduction of agrochemicals in the mid-twentieth century was a watershed event for many Mayan farmers in Guatemala. While some Maya hailed synthetic fertilizers' immediate effectiveness as a relief from famines and migrant labor, other lamented the long-term deterioration of their public health, soil quality, and economic autonomy. Since the rising cost of agrochemicals compelled Maya to return to plantation labor in the 1970s, synthetic fertilizers simply shifted, rather than alleviated, Mayan dependency on the cash economy. By highlighting Mayan farmers' historical narratives and delineating the relationship between agricultural science and postwar geopolitics, the constraints on agriculturists' agency become clear. In the end, politics, more than technology or agricultural performance, influenced guatemala's shift toward the Green Revolution.",

During the last two decades of the nineteenth century, such leading clergymen as Josiah Strong and Roland Hyde Hartt looked at the country churches from their New England pulpits, and saw them as dying institutions, consisting of prophetless ministers who mouthed an obsolete theology as they indulged in bitter sectarian rivalries, and a laity which was degenerate and declining in numbers. The Report of the Committee of Twelve on Rural Schools, prepared for the National Education Association in 1897 by leading school administrators headed by the farm-born Henry Sabin, was merciless in its evaluation of the cherished one-room country schools. Literary men like Hamlin Garland in Main-Travelled Roads (1891) created a farm picture showing weary men and women struggling in vain against cultural barrenness, mounting mortgages, and steaming manure piles. One writer in the Atlantic Monthly walked off the deep end by recommending that the first step that should be taken in the direction of intellectual development and rational social enjoyment was the abandonment in the open country of prairie farm homes and the establishment of farm villages.1",

    "abstract": "The last decade has seen a growing interest in the intersection of genocide and ecocide, with calls from scholars and activists to include forms of environmental destruction as crimes against humanity. Scorched Earth enters this discussion with a historically informed analysis of how wars have targeted the environmental basis for human life. Through ten case studies ranging from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries, Emmanuel Kreike contributes to current debates by introducing “environcide” as a concept bridging genocide (a crime against humanity) and ecocide (a crime against nature). At the heart of Kreike's argument is an analysis of how belligerents target and weaponize the environment as a widespread and long-standing strategy of war.Kreike defines environcide as intentionally or unintentionally damaging, destroying, or making inaccessible the “environmental infrastructure” on which life depends: the burning or flooding of fields; the destruction of irrigation, food storage systems, and hunting grounds; the requisitioning of food and livestock; and the extirpation of prey animals. For Kreike, environcide is “total war” in that it constitutes the destruction of both society and environment. Wars are not fought over abstract territory but “about, with, and in what animates, fills, and enriches space: the environmental infrastructure that sustains populations, states, and armies” (3). Scorched Earth challenges the separation of social war and environmental war into distinct “fields of inquiry” (197). Indeed, Kreike traces this flawed distinction to the pervasive nature-culture dichotomy, arguing that so long as “nature” and “culture” are ontologically segregated, wars against society will be considered “humanitarian concerns, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide,” while wartime environmental destruction will be relegated to a separate legal domain (395). Kreike goes on to challenge other overlapping binaries, including the Western (modern)/non-Western (premodern) dichotomy that frames European societies as outside or beyond nature, and non-European societies as living within nature (and vulnerable to its caprices).To support its claims, Scorched Earth carries the reader through a sweeping sequence of case studies: the sixteenth-century Dutch Revolt, the Spanish conquest of America, the Thirty Years' War, seventeenth-century Indigenous warfare in eastern North America, the wars of the Spanish Succession and Austrian Succession, settler colonial genocide in North America, genocide in West Africa, environcide in the Dutch East Indies, and colonial conquests in Southwest Africa. These cases reflect an extraordinary body of research, detailed analysis, and clear storytelling. Kreike demonstrates impressive skill as a historian and narrator, mixing familiar and lesser-known cases together in informative ways. Some parts of the narrative are heavy with forensic detail, but the book is at its best when connecting strategies of environcide between distant times and places.Scorched Earth makes a solid attempt to translate this history into theory, but its contributions here are questionable. Despite the intent to transcend the nature-culture binary, much of the historical narrative reinforces this dichotomy by describing a deterministic nature with limited agency and complexity—a mostly passive vessel through which violence is transmitted from one human to another. Rarely are environcidal consequences traced beyond the immediate social effects that benefit perpetrators or destabilize victims. Rather than a socio-environmental history, this is a history of war with an emphasis on the environment.Scorched Earth makes little engagement with political economy or structural factors over the longue durée. Whereas the immediate impacts of warfare on rural agriculture are prominently featured, Kreike generally ignores the underlying imperial, colonial, and capitalist logics of expropriation that animate and justify environcidal violence, along with the political and cultural ecology of the impacted infrastructural systems. To be sure, Kreike limits his subject in time and space to the battlefield. But in so doing, Scorched Earth misses the opportunity to make a compelling theoretical contribution to the structural origins of environcide, in wartime or otherwise.Finally, this structural weakness admits an awkward attempt to merge victims and perpetrators. Kreike details numerous environcidal tactics deployed by non-Westerners; for example, Indigenous Americans against European settlers, or Acehnese rebels against Dutch colonial soldiers. These instances of “native” environcide are intended to destabilize the Western/non-Western dichotomy and buttress Kreike's argument that environcidal warfare was not a purely European invention. But this narrow focus on the symmetry of events and tactics ignores the stark asymmetry of the structures shaping the broader conflict. Colonial invaders and Indigenous peoples burned each other's fields and food supplies under vastly different circumstances. To imply a conceptual equivalence is to overlook each side's profoundly different relationships to land and realities of survival.Scorched Earth contributes to a vigorous and timely conversation on the linkages between genocide, ecocide, and environmental violence with detailed analyses of the impact of war on environmental infrastructure. The book misses opportunities to engage existing theory; indeed, the promise to connect historical analysis with genocidal/ecocidal criminality is never fully realized. But the strength of Kreike's case studies should offer considerable inspiration for others to pick up where Scorched Earth leaves off.",

    "abstract": "Beginning in chapter 1 of Growing Gardens, Building Power, sociologist Justin Sean Myers makes clear that \"gardens in East New York are not just about growing food: they are about growing dreams. . . . They are for growing community\" (4–5). These words offer a key sound bite for Myers's well-researched, in-depth analysis of how gardens in the working-class Black, Latinx, and Caribbean neighborhood of East New York in Brooklyn clarify the social history and contemporary work of the urban food justice movement. Methodologically, Myers blends ethnography, interviews, and secondary sources to explore how the efforts of East New York Farms!, a food justice organization, reconfigures its local food system as a way to address racial, ethnic, and class inequities. This story transports the reader across time, space, and place, showing how historical and contemporary social, political, economic, and environmental forces collide in garden spaces. This collision brings into focus the power relations that activists in the food justice movement and the broader food movement navigate to get food from the garden to the homes that line the streets of urban neighborhoods across the nation.Reading the inequitable food realities and food justice activism of East New Yorkers through multiple histories, the five core chapters (2–6) of Growing Gardens, Building Power illuminate how the urban food justice movement struggles to achieve its vision. Chapter 2 examines the social history of East New York and how it shapes contemporary food realities. Chapter 3 shows how the long history of urban agriculture and gardening in New York City underscores the agency of East New Yorkers as they transform gardens into sites of social justice at the nexus of food, housing, and land. Chapter 4 weaves together histories of farmers' markets and food assistance programs—at the federal and state levels—to amplify how East New York Farms! makes sense of the interaction between the state and everyday food access in East New York. Chapter 5 examines the long history of social movement funding and how it provides the necessary context for understanding food justice struggles to secure and sustain financial support. Chapter 6 uses the history of Walmart's financial maneuverings as a critical context to understand how East New Yorkers successfully kept the multibillion-dollar company from building in their community and perpetuating inequities in grocery retailing that would challenge food justice work in East New York. The conclusion illustrates how the historical backdrops of each core chapter in Growing Gardens, Building Power are carefully connected to offer us a pathway forward in the context of six issues gleaned from the food justice stories of East New Yorkers.Through these stories of East New York Farms! and their agricultural comrades, Myers explores how urban food justice activists engage in the process of \"countering a history of racism . . . redlining, urban renewal, planned shrinkage, and racialized systems of public and private divestment\" (146). The food justice stories also provide a lens to examine how urban agricultural history shapes the future of urban food justice activism. This focus on urban agricultural history is important, given that scholarship on agricultural history tends to examine historical snapshots of issues in rural communities and the countryside. In thinking about how the history of urban agriculture interacts with multiple contemporary crises in East New York, Myers emphasizes how the multidimensionality of the food justice movement offers a way for scholars who work with agricultural history to think about how urban and rural agricultural histories converge and diverge.Together, the chapters that make up Growing Gardens, Building Power reveal how several histories shape the urban food justice movement in East New York. Each chapter is an example of how activists and their communities directly or indirectly navigate such histories. The chapters also reinvigorate scholarly and public conversations about interactions between the broader food movement and the food justice movement. How such conversations conceptualize these interactions is a site of contention, especially in the context of how they shape food futures. But what is clear is that both movements are context dependent and rooted in histories that emerge from within and beyond the food system. Growing Gardens, Building Power shows us how the food justice movement contextually transforms garden spaces into a place to imagine what a socially just food system could look like. Indeed, as Myers concludes, gardens offer possibilities that \"can go a long way toward building a more just food system and with it a more just world\" (156).",

    "abstract": "In The Tropical Turn, Sureshkumar Muthukumaran marshals a staggering range of textual and archaeological sources to investigate the spread of Indian plant species to the Mediterranean and Middle East beginning around 3000 BCE. Muthukumaran's command of the material, which ranges from Sanskrit poetry to Roman archeobotany, allows him to track plants across the linguistic and temporal borders that usually demarcate subdisciplines of ancient history. This panoptic view is balanced by a judicious focus on seven examples—cotton, rice, citrus, cucurbits, lotus, taro, and sissoo—all of which were taken into cultivation, if only for a time. This means that Muthukumaran excludes commodities like cinnamon and black pepper, as well as the many plants that travelers from the Mediterranean and Middle East brought to India. These and other products are discussed in the first chapter, \"The Historical Context,\" which documents the emergence of \"systemic connectivity\" in the region (52). A number of maps depict places mentioned in the text; it would have been helpful to have trade routes illustrated as well. Demand for lapis lazuli, for example, structured how other items left India.Though each of the next seven chapters follows a different plant species or grouping, several common themes emerge. One of these is the relationship between environmental and cultural factors in driving (or deterring) agricultural change. Sissoo (Indian rosewood), for example, became a popular material in ninth-century to seventh-century BCE Mesopotamia, where it was used to build and furnish palaces and temples. Sissoo succeeded in Mesopotamia because elites lacked the native timber to pursue large building programs and because it adapted to its new environment better than other nonnative tree species like cedar.In other instances, cultural factors seem more important than environmental ones. Both rice and cotton are resource-intensive crops, but cotton fared much better outside of India. Prized for its brilliant white color and dyeability, cotton became a \"fiber of prestige\" used to adorn kings and gods (92). Rice, on the other hand, though grown for subsistence in the Middle East, never displaced barley or other grains. Muthukumaran notes that foodways are often conservative: \"South Asian food-processing techniques and culinary traditions did not migrate\" (120) along with rice itself. Instead, magico-medical uses were more common.But even the most direct transferals were not always successful in the long run. Lotus, common in Egypt from around 600 BCE as food, medicine, adornment, and craft material, disappears from the record in the medieval period. Environmental adaptation and cultural uptake did not ensure lotus a place in modern Egypt's diet, art, or economy.The Tropical Turn highlights these natural-cultural forces rather than the heroic innovations of political actors, whom Muthukumaran argues have been overemphasized in previous studies. Nevertheless, several individuals make repeat appearances, from the Assyrian king Sennacherib, whose palace inscriptions describe an extensive botanical program, to Greek and Roman authors including Herodotus and Pliny the Elder. Like many scholars before him, Muthukumaran both relies on these authors for information and excoriates them for \"plagiarism\" and \"outlandish\" remarks. In a book otherwise so attuned to the complexity of ancient evidence, these comments were a disappointment.Focusing on processes rather than people is a huge boon to the project, allowing Muthukumaran to revise the dating of botanical transfers, locate multiple sites where they were introduced, and extrapolate the four stages of \"turning tropical\": familiarization, experimentation, routinization, and indigenization (elaborated in the final chapter). The book succeeds as both synthesis of past scholarship, intervention into ongoing debates, and model for future research in this region or any other part of the ancient world.However, by writing his history without political actors Muthukumaran has also deprived the reader of characters to follow and thus sometimes made it difficult to care about the story he is trying to tell. This book will appeal to those already invested in, say, whether lemons can be distinguished from citrons (with archaeology, they can!) or if the Neo-Assyrian kurângu should be identified with Oryza sativa (Muthukumaran thinks so), but not as much to readers with a broader interest in ancient culture. Muthukumaran has organized the book for specialists, with sections in each chapter devoted to linguistic terminology, types of evidence, and geographic variation, with a brief discussion of \"uses\" usually saved for the end. A more readable version of the book might have had culinary, magical, medicinal, and other cultural traces of Indian plant species structure the book's chapters rather than conclude them.",

    "abstract": "Roots and tubers are not welle documented in Indonesian historiography. Colonial civil servants regarded root crops as famine food, and they were rarely included in indigenous chronicles. This article presents data for the period 1500 to 1950 on the most important indigenous Indonesian roots and tubers-taro and yams. It looks as the geographical spread of these crops and their social and economic importance-dealing also briefly with adjacent areas like the Malay Peninsula and the Philippines. This is followed by the story of the introduction of the New World roots and tubers: sweet potato, bengkuang, (Irish) potato, and cassava. The article analyzes the differences between the various crops as regards their spread in time and space and the reasons that the indigenous roots and tubers were pushed aside by the alien crops. In conclusion, the findings are related to various economic, social, cultural, and political developments and to the rizification hypothesis",

    "abstract": "Philipp Lehmann's Desert Edens explores how European scientists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries understood the effects of climate and the role of human design in ecological change. By the late nineteenth century, European scientists had a long tradition of what we would today call “climate science.” Lehmann, however, situates his work in a distinct moment of departure when European climate engineers sought to bring the full force of industrial design to bear on issues of climate and ecology. Moving from an early-century focus on individual regions or microclimates, European scientists developed a global vision of climate and ecology by the 1880s. Combining this broader vision with an ascendant “declensionist narrative” that sought to explain the perceived decline of North African ecological and “civilizational” landscapes, these scientists devised large-scale environmental projects intended to interrupt what they saw as negative climate developments as well as the supposedly backward cultural and social processes that drove this decline. The quintessential symbol in these contemporary debates was the desert, and more specifically the desert in colonial or militarily occupied space.While these projects were almost never realized, the surrounding intellectual and political debates offer a window into European modes of thinking at a time when European scientists were “moving from a telluric, or earth-bound, understanding of climate, based on observation and description, toward a physics-based conception of climate” (26). Desert Edens provides a clear view of this complicated period of change that preceded the twentieth-century focus on atmospheric phenomena as the prime indicator of climate activity.The book is divided into eight chapters that focus largely on the careers and intellectual contexts of three French and German scientists: François Roudaire, who, beginning in the 1870s, sought to halt the spread of North African desertification by creating vast bodies of water in the Sahara desert; Herman Sörgel, who planned to dam the Mediterranean Sea at Gibraltar as a way to stimulate European settlement and cultural expansion in North Africa in the 1920s; and Heinrich Wiepking-Jürgensmann, who envisioned creating a “Germanized” environmental landscape in occupied eastern Europe during World War II. While the book is best understood as an intellectual history, it offers important insights into “environmental imaginaries,” following the work of Diana Davis, Alan Mikhail, and others. By embedding the careers of scientists in a wider social and intellectual context, Lehmann takes seriously the ways in which Europeans imagined overseas and eastern European ecologies and the alleged links among climate, culture, and “civilization.” He demonstrates convincingly the ways in which European scientists struggled to balance a deep environmental and cultural fin de siècle pessimism with an otherwise wildly optimistic faith in industrial technology and its ability to remap the cultural and environmental landscape of colonized lands.The desert played multiple roles in the contemporary imagination, as it was considered both “a powerful threat to be contained and as an inviting playground for the modern engineer's ambition” (4). The desert's protean, malleable image allowed early climate scientists and engineers to participate in wide-ranging debates over the feasibility (and desirability) of human interventions into global climate regimes and the possible social, economic, and cultural consequences of such change on both colonized and colonizing societies. These debates clearly bear out the interdependence of climate science and climate engineering, neither of which was ever clearly divorced from colonial politics and discourses of racial fitness, cultural decline, and rebirth.Each chapter in Desert Edens builds on and overlaps with material from previous chapters yet can be read independently. It is beyond the scope of this review to provide a tidy summary of each chapter's contributions; indeed, no short review could encapsulate the motley cast of scientists, politicians, explorers, Orientalists, generals, and philosophers who play supporting roles in this story—roles that Lehmann details with verve and wit. Lehmann admits in the epilogue that “it is difficult to identify an organic conclusion” to these overlapping histories of early climate science and dreams of climate engineering. This reviewer agrees that the book does not present an easily identifiable, general conclusion, but in many ways that is one of the book's strengths. The twists and turns in the development of what we today generally call climate science resulted in a fractured, nonlinear story, one that reflects the interplay of environmental anxiety and industrial triumphalism. This balance is complicated at every turn by unexpected developments in adjacent realms of politics, military expansion, internecine disputes among scientists, and the material realities of empire. In short, the details matter, and Lehmann's monograph stays true to that complexity by avoiding facile conclusions.If the book has one shortcoming, it is the scant attention paid to the circularity of scientific and cultural exchange between the colonies and the respective metropoles. Lehmann acknowledges in the introduction that “the colonial encounter with deserts was never a one-way street,” yet the book does not explore the ways in which colonial encounters shaped metropolitan outlooks in overseas lands (6). The source material is drawn exclusively from European archives while Indigenous actors and their ecological worldviews are largely removed from the European conversation. In Lehmann's telling, “the colonial encounter with deserts” is, in fact, a largely one-way street. That caveat aside, Desert Edens is an important contribution to the growing field of environmental history and its overlapping concerns with intellectual, political, and social change.",

    "abstract": "Historians have portrayed the formative period of agricultural extension work in the United States as a search for the best method of convincing farmers to change their farming practices in order to improve agricultural efficiency, productivity, and profitability. However, one ofthe key leaders in extension's formative period, Cornell University's Liberty Hyde Bailey, articulated a dif? ferent vision of extension's central purpose and promise. Drawing on his writings during the years in which he led the development ofCornelVs exten? sion program (1894-1902), this article argues that Bailey's vision of agricul? tural extension work was centered on the provision of education aimed at awakening farmers to a new point ofview on life. The new point ofview com? bined sympathy with nature, a love of country life, and a scientific attitude, expressed by a habit of careful observation and experimentation. The main purpose of awakening farmers to this point of view was not to develop a more efficient, productive, and profitable agriculture, but to advance the larger cultural ideals of a self-sustaining agriculture and personal happiness. The account of Bailey's vision provided in this article suggests the need to reconsider the story ofthe origins and early development of American agricultural extension work.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite their success in boosting cereals production overall, the Green Revolution programs of the 1950s and 1960s were often criticized for failing to achieve their declared aim of alleviating world hunger. Most critics argued that the programs had produced a technology unsuited to the needs of small peasant farmers. This paper explores why such inappropriate technology might have been developed, focusing on the early years of the Rockefeller Foundation’s Mexican Agricultural Program (MAP). It shows that some foundation officers as well as agricultural advisors had prior experience of the problems faced by small farmers in the United States and elsewhere.Moreover, the foundation’s expressed concern for rural poverty does not appear to have been mere posturing by an organization anxious to be seen as an agent of philanthropy. Furthermore, the program’s early work in maize-breeding was well tailored to the conditions of Mexican agriculture.Once the MAP was up and running, however, it became apparent that the task of getting new varieties and cultivation practices to small farmers was going to be difficult. Needing to make some kind of impact quickly, MAP staff chose to concentrate upon projects that were likely to find a rapid uptake. This meant setting aside the needs of peasant farmers to develop high-yielding varieties suited to large commercial farms.",

No symbol is more indicative of this destruction than Enterprise, Alabama's boll weevil monument. This essay examines not how the cotton pest destroyed the region's staple crop, but how women and men across race and class lines understood the beetle's threat and used it to their advantage. The statue, like the countless blues and folk songs about the pest, was a cultural statement that shaped the understanding of the bug itself and its supposed transformation of southern agriculture. By examining the local conditions that gave rise to dramatic, albeit short-lived, crop diversification, and in turn the monument's erection, this essay uncovers the ways in which the boll weevil myth was as important a force on southern life as the long-snouted beetle itself.",

Nowhere is this more true than in sub-Saharan Africa, where the World Bank states that, 26 countries, with a population exceeding 150 million, are currently reporting food shortages.2 Indeed, Africa appears to have inherited a depressing picture of stagnation in the agricultural sector with only a handful ofsuccessful projects to weigh against the many that have failed. The reasons for this lack of success (and some possible remedies) have been eloquently expounded elsewhere, but within the scope of this paper the malaise of agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa is exemplified, if not explained, by soil degradation and the failure to combat it through programs of soil conservation.3 This paper charts the rise, the implementation, and the continuation of conservation policies in the former British colonial territories of Tanganyika (now Tanzania), Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and Nyasaland (Malawi), and to a lesser extent in Uganda, Kenya, Basutoland (Lesotho), Bechuanaland (Botswana) and Swaziland.4 These nine countries fall into three groups of three in east-",

During the eighteenth century thousands of slaves cleared thousands of acres of swamplands to create the colony's signature rice fields and secure its place within the Atlantic economy. This essay examines the changing perceptions and uses of trees as the key to understanding how planters transformed a perceived wilderness into one of British America's wealthiest and most repressive plantation societies. Colonists used trees to assess and understand the land's capacity for market agriculture. Slaves cleared land of its wood to prepare the terrain for planting, provide Britain's empire with vital commodities, and build the infrastructure of daily material life in the region. As colonists and slaves came into sustained engagement with this landscape they learned to exploit its distinctive natural resources more intensively. This transformation is better understood as a process of agricultural adaptation than as an episode in environmental degradation.",

It demonstrates that the popular belief in African-American inferiority and pragmatic political compromises aimed at creating a bureaucracy serving the nation's agricultural constituency and ensuring its longevity, led to a conscious marginalization of African-American interests within the program. Federal extension officials not only tolerated, but actively supported, discrimination within the southern the southern branches of the service. African-American leadership protested against the adverse effects of racial policies in the Extension Service from the very beginning. While there were some limited positive gains in the number of staff and availability of services for rural African-Americans, these changes did not challenge the suzerainty of whites over the program. In the post-World War II era -- especially after 1950 -- African-Americans confronted white extension leadership. Extension officials hid behind a bureaucratic façade and a flawed interpretation of the federal-state cooperative agreement to delay institutional restructuring. Political appointees pushed the service toward policies of racial justice; however, extension leadership continued to move slowly on fundamental transformation. As a result, the adjustments did not lead to a fundamental re-thinking of race policy in the service and ultimately contributed to the disappearance of the African-American extension force to a significant degree.",

    "abstract": "The New Deal resettlement communities appear in the literature as efforts to ameliorate the wretched condition of southern sharecroppers and tenants. However, those evicted to make way for the new settlers are virtually invisible in the historic record. The resettlement projects were part of larger efforts to modernize rural America. Modernization is a complex process whereby a relatively specific set of assumptions and behaviors make other assumptions and behaviors wrong, both morally and pragmatically. The removal of former tenants and their replacement by FSA clients in the lower Mississippi alluvial plain―the Delta―reveals core elements of New Deal Modernizing policies, exposing key concepts that guided the FSA's tenant removals: the definition of rural poverty as rooted in the problem of tenancy; the belief that economic success entailed particular cultural practices and social forms; and the commitment by those with political power to gain local support. These assumptions undergirded acceptance of racial segregation and the criteria used to select new settlers. Alternatives could only become visible through political or legal action―capacities sharecroppers seldom had. However, in succeeding decades, these modernizing assumptions created conditions for Delta African Americans on resettlement projects to challenge white supremacy.",

    "abstract": "It is easy to understand why regions that produce very fine goods such as port wine tend to conceal technological and scientific inputs and praise the uniqueness of the terroir. This paper suggests that, during the last decades of the nineteenth century, viticulture in the Douro region of Portugal was as much a product of soil, local farming traditions, and individual entrepreneurship as it was of modern state science and national politics for agricultural improvement. the unprecedented public projects of building a railroad and fighting phylloxera permanently changed the land of port wine. Moreover, those engineering practices of rationalization, simplification, and standardization that were inscribed on Douro's landscape proved essential for the Portuguese experience of modernization and nation-building.",

    "abstract": "Though historians have begun to chart the development of intensive agriculture in twentieth-century Great Britain and to seek to understand postwar conceptualizations of the rural, they have paid less attention to the question of public attitudes to and perceptions of intensification. By focusing on the public debate surrounding the publication of Ruth Harrison’s Animal Machines (1964), this article seeks to better understand the impact of the book by exploring the context in which it was published, the extent and nature of reporting in connection with it, and its reception. The article draws on the specialist and farming press from the period, in parallel to the broadsheets and parliamentary debate, and uses battery farming as a case study. It argues that, though materially significant, the rhetorical opposition established in this debate between intensive and traditional systems was representative neither of British agricultural production in the 1960s nor of the established concerns about “factory farming” already being discussed in the countryside at that time.",

    "abstract": "Ernest Freeberg's biography of American animal advocate Henry Bergh is the first scholarly study of this influential figure to appear in several decades. Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in New York in 1866, which was only the first of countless city and state animal advocacy organizations inspired by his activism. Bergh was representative of a movement among middle- and upper-class Americans in the late nineteenth century to assign moral value to the emotional lives of animals and to accept their abilities to experience fear, loneliness, or pain.Through his account of Bergh's life, legislative efforts, and public advocacy campaigns, Freeberg provides an urban history of Gilded Age animal advocacy, regulation, and compliance monitoring in the context of the birth of mass consumerism, growing alienation from wild animals, and equine energy boom. Urbanization made domesticated-animal suffering more visible to more people in those years. Nonetheless, an equal number of Americans did not perceive animal suffering or took it as inevitable, even desirable. Freeberg explains that, as a result, Henry Bergh's challenges to animal abuse and neglect “provoked an uncomfortable debate about the proper balance between animal rights and human interests, and the animal suffering at the core of the American economy” (220).A Traitor to His Species is also a history of the larger networks of advocates and allies that developed around the country and their debate over whether to employ legislation, policing, and punishment to stop abuse and neglect versus longer-term interventions like public education programs aimed at children. Freeberg documents the long-forgotten, miserable trade in live turtles for urban diners (with some species soon fished to extinction) and manly blood sports like dogfights, pigeon shoots, and rat-killing contests. He also explores the more familiar advocacy efforts to protect workhorses in the context of nascent mass transit schemes, Bergh's frequent but ineffective conflicts with P. T. Barnum over animal exhibitions, his role in the passage of the nation's first animal protection laws and larger animal law history, as well as the flourishing boyhood cultures of casual animal teasing and sadism, which public education campaigns sought to stamp out (and did, in time).I suspect that this was probably not an easy book for Freeberg to write. The topic requires one to be immersed in historical sources that recount, in detail, decades of animal abuse, suffering, and neglect with the knowledge that historical abusive practices that were abolished still abound or were, in many cases, simply replaced with different abuses, since denial of cheap animal products to consumers has rarely been an option people would consider. Freeberg's study is especially exemplary in telling these stories with an unusual balance of humor, frankness, and clear empathy for both animal advocates and the animals whom they sought to protect. He documents the nature of animal abuse and suffering in unflinching and necessary detail, yet without hyperbole. Thus he gives animals a critical role in his analysis explaining the urgency and dedication that motivated Bergh's unconventional political thought and action.Freeberg's analysis carries important lessons about long-term patterns in human-animal relationships. Among them is that many of the accusations and disinformation tactics that advocates struggle against today flourished in the nineteenth century, too. Bergh's savvy for publicity reveals the degree to which animal advocacy was from the very beginning about publicly naming animal suffering with political language like abuse and cruelty to persuade a critical mass (often just a dedicated minority) of citizens to support legislation, aid in public education campaigns, or report on their neighbors. Bergh weathered a steady stream of reactionary disgust and ridicule by business owners and male-oriented industries in particular, who smeared him as self-righteous, sentimental, feminized, uninformed, and extreme; animal advocates take such accusations in stride today. Freeberg is equally curious about Bergh's many failures. For instance, he explores why the movement he pioneered was seldom influential in rural areas, where most animals lived. The book exposes how Bergh's lobbying for animal protection laws confronted his growing realization of the limits of incremental legislative reforms, as laws he lobbied for were seldom or never enforced and, in any event, simply sought to make animal exploitation more “humane” by limiting its scale or modestly refining only certain aspects.Although Freeberg's account is readable and compelling, academic readers may become somewhat frustrated since key nineteenth-century terms and context appear throughout the text in unpredictable places rather than being set out early on. Additionally, Freeberg speaks repeatedly and anachronistically of the concern on the part of Bergh and his contemporaries for “animal rights”—indeed, the phrase is in the book title. However, humane advocates of the period sought merely to prevent “cruelty” and encourage human “mercy” toward animals. This was a political philosophy that protected human supremacy while seeking only to minimize suffering that advocates deemed unnecessary, that is, suffering that produced no economic value. Modern “animal rights” politics began materializing only in the 1890s and came to the fore in the 1960s. Freeberg's confusing reference to “rights” without a detailed contextual explanation of Gilded Age anti-cruelty philosophies gives the impression that middling and wealthy Americans who supported his work were more radical than they probably were. Bergh's America was an unquestionably anthropocentric society and the scale of animal misery Americans caused was (and still is) unfathomable. Nonetheless, Freeberg's wonderfully written and comprehensive study of Henry Bergh, his colleagues, and supporters will stand for many years as the definitive work on a crucial figure in American law, politics, and social reform.",

    "abstract": "Lisa Haushofer's book explores the development and marketing of \"wonder foods\" in Britain and the United States between 1840 and 1940. \"Wonder foods\" were products, created by humans, that responded to people's desire for easy solutions to difficult health and food supply problems. The men who developed \"wonder foods\" believed science, technology, and white male experts could transform the food environment by maximizing nutrition and minimizing waste. Concentrated meat biscuits could relieve food transportation pressures for European and American armies while providing nutritious food for soldiers. Fortified bread could eliminate the vitamin deficiencies created by monoculture and industrial food production. \"Predigested\" or \"artificially digested\" foods would make human digestion more efficient by employing animal digestive elements. Corn flakes, produced with scientifically enhanced Native food knowledge, would augment overall human health and lead to race betterment.The idea that scientifically and technologically driven evolution would lead to human progress motivated many of the scientists and food producers Haushofer profiles. Nature, on its own, was flawed and needed to be enhanced. Haushofer's work does a nice job exploring the history of select \"wonder foods\" that promised to \"go beyond, to nourish more efficiently, more naturally, more completely than ordinary foods\" (7). People's conception of food shifted away from naturally occurring comestibles to \"more-than food\" manufactured products (43). Haushofer's concept of \"wonder foods\" is a useful way of tracing changes in ideas about food in the critical period between 1840 and 1940.Haushofer's work would have benefited from broader engagement with literature about late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century health and fitness movements. She explores the connection between \"wonder foods,\" eugenics, and race betterment as well as the thrift movement in Britain. However, the late nineteenth and early twentieth century was a moment of intense debate about humans' relationship to nature and food. Economic modernization produced growing concerns about lack of physical fitness and unhealthy environments, leading to nudist movements, rural and seaside summer camps for children, and growing questions about chemicals being used in industrial food manufacture and even what qualified as real food. French beekeepers fought legal and legislative battles for labeling distinctions between real honey and manufactured \"honey-like\" syrups. Haushofer's work would have benefited from a discussion about how \"wonder foods\" influenced and were influenced by the broader culture of health, fitness, and food.Haushofer makes a case that the developers of \"wonder foods\" both appropriated and devalued female and Indigenous food knowledge. Her effort to link \"wonder foods\" to gender and imperial projects is fascinating. It is very clear that \"wonder foods\" can't be understood outside the context of imperialism, white supremacy, and male expertise. However, the link between \"wonder foods,\" gender, and empire could also be further developed. There were many new global products coming into the West. Europeans debated which global foods were acceptable in a European diet. Likewise, European and American taste for coffee, chocolate, palm oil, bananas, and a range of other products reshaped food systems and landscapes in areas dominated by Western military and economic interests. Certain global foods were, in a sense, westernized by big businesses or imperial managers hoping to profit from convincing westerners to incorporate \"new\" foods like rice into their diets. Haushofer successfully argues that food producers depended on women to incorporate new \"scientific\" products and methods into their cooking. At the same time, they sold products with sexualized white female images. However, figures like Aunt Jemima employed the image of Black women, who had been forced to cook real food for white families, to sell manufactured table syrup as a replacement for maple syrup, a natural product used for centuries by Native peoples. There were very complicated interactions taking place between food, gender, empire, and Native knowledge that Haushofer could have more fully considered.Haushofer's overall argument is that modern food is the consequence of \"a systematic intellectual commitment in Western industrial nations to capitalism, empire, resource extraction, and white supremacy\" (6). Her work makes an important contribution to food history, and it opens the way for further exploration into an area of study that has particular relevance in contemporary society.",

In the early 1950s the evacuation of civilian populations from urban areas and military targets served as the basis for federal and state civil defense programs. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, however, as the dangers of fallout shaped the public discourse, rural areas were no longer considered safe from an attack. Throughout this period, the Federal Civil Defense Administration (FCDA), in conjunction with the USDA and State Cooperative Extension Services, launched campaigns to educate farmers on their roles as providers of food and as budding atomic scientists. The rhetoric of these programs reinforced the notion that rural Americans contributed not only food and raw materials to the American economy, but also served as the moral backbone of a democratic nation. Such language placed farmers and rural residents on the front lines of the Cold War.",

While consumer agency looms large in many works, consumer studies also explore the influence of structural economics, material goods, and institutions that shaped consumer behavior. Moreover, distinct periodization is important in recognizing and understanding the shifting contours of American consumption. This article appraises how recent scholarship in rural consumer culture relates to these broad categories and what this reveals about rural history in general.

Both wealthy landholders and Indigenous agricultural workers experimented with discursive elements as they attempted to draw state authorities to their side. Following their debates also inverts the normal view of power relations. The landholder, General Francisco G6mez de la Torre, presented himself as a victim, while his workers used various combinations of class and ethnic discourse to mobilize their base and gain sympathy from outsiders. The failure of government officials to support G6mez de la Torre exposed significant cracks in the ruling structures, which Indigenous workers learned to exploit. These conflicts reveal that the Ecuadorian government was not as hegemonic as is sometimes assumed; it was an arena of competing projects and interests with political officials often at odds with one another. At the same time, subaltern resistance was also not homogeneous, and divisions between Indigenous workers challenge a simplistic picture of a unified counter-hegemonic discourse. As a result, state power formed a showcase for many different groups to present and contest their social and economic interests.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article is an institutional history of the development of race policy within the federal Cooperative Extension Service. It demonstrates that the popular belief in African-American inferiority and pragmatic political compromises aimed at creating a bureaucracy serving the nation’s agricultural constituency and ensuring its longevity, led to a conscious marginalization of African-American interests within the program. Federal extension officials not only tolerated, but actively supported, discrimination within the southern branches of the service. African-American leadership protested against the adverse effects of racial policies in the Extension Service from the very beginning. While there were some limited positive gains in the number of staff and availability of services for rural African Americans, these changes did not challenge the suzerainty of whites over the program. In the post-World War II era--especially after 1950--African Americans confronted white extension leadership. Extension officials hid behind a bureaucratic façade and a flawed interpretation of the federal-state cooperative agreement to delay institutional restructuring. Political appointees pushed the service toward policies of racial justice; however, extension leadership continued to move slowly on fundamental transformation. As a result, the adjustments did not lead to a fundamental re-thinking of race policy in the service and ultimately contributed to the disappearance of the African-American extension force to a significant degree.",

    "abstract": "In 1942 over 110,000 Japanese Americans were evacuated from the West Coast to ten inland, barbed wire-enclosed relocation centers in the name of national security. Agriculture was a key component of the eight arid to semi-arid centers located in the western United States. Each center's agricultural program included produce for human consumption, feed crops, and livestock. Some centers also grew seed, ornamental, and war crops. Evacuees raised and consumed five types of livestock and sixty-one produce varieties, including many traditional foods. Seasonal surpluses were preserved, shipped to other centers, or sold on the open market. Short growing seasons, poor soils, initially undeveloped lands, pests, equipment shortages, and labor issues hampered operations. However, imprisoned evacuee farmers proved that diverse agricultural programs could succeed in the harsh settings primarily because of labor-intensive farming methods, ingenuity, and the large markets provided by the centers. These agricultural programs played major roles in feeding, providing meaningful employment, and preparing evacuees for life outside the centers, and readied lands for post-war \"homesteaders.\"",

This article focuses on agriculture to explore how executive branch policymakers in the United States implemented nuclear technologies in the budding nuclear age. Part of that tale involves how nuclear technologies, especially radioactive isotope tracers, helped improve agricultural science and knowledge. The other side of the story is that agriculture also proved important to the development of nuclear technologies because it provided a clearly peaceful output for atomic research. Atomic agriculture thus frequently assumed a place of prominence for explaining how splitting the atom was a gift to the world and not the red horse rider of the apocalypse.",

The mission committee comprised delegates from the United States led by Claude B. Hutchison and delegates from China led by Zou Binwen. The delegates developed a comprehensive plan for agricultural development, technology imports, infrastructure construction, and international trade, which soon came under criticism as a vision for the economic and technological colonization of China. Although this plan was not adopted in mainland China, it incubated an organizational structure for the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction and provided a blueprint for agricultural development in Taiwan. This mission, which merits close attention in both academic and diplomatic circles, provided both referential significance and important lessons for later cooperation in technology and trade between the United States and the People's Republic of China.",

The conflict, which pitted agricultural engineers against soil scientists and agronomists, served as a crucible for federal soil conservation. It emerged as these experts built the case that soil erosion could and should be controlled through state action. From the 1910s to the early 1930s, federal agencies and technicians developed reliable, practical erosion-control technologies, and they redefined erosion not as a private or regional matter but as a national concern demanding national attention. The feud also demonstrates how, contrary to popular belief, federalized soil conservation emerged prior to and independent of the Great Plains Dust Bowl. By the time dust storms captured the nation's attention in 1933, the question was no longer whether the federal government would act to control erosion but who would lead the effort.",

With their knowledge of how to care for chickens and their experience keeping track of farm finances, they were important participants in the growth of this new sector of American agribusiness.

    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines how fruit growers in British Columbia and the provincial government got into the business of making wine in the first half of the twentieth century. Growers sought primarily to sell fruit and saw wine as a possible additional source of revenue. Rather than pointing solely to climatic differences or the cultures of potential consumers, this article argues that the interests of growers and provincial liquor policies both made and stifled the wine industry. This case study of small-scale production and growers’ indifference to wine casts light on the importance of the individual initiatives of winemakers in other regions around the world. As the BC wine industry took off in the 1920s, it was made up of a mix of fruit wine, poor grape wine made from table grapes, and experiments with Vitis vinifera. Wines made from loganberries and Vitis labrusca grapes were not just the precursor to the modern wine industry but were also two kinds of fruit that growers balanced alongside hardy apples and other fruits.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this article is to explore the Franco dictatorship's policy of agrarian colonization and its effects on the lives of the Spanish population. It examines not only the measures taken by the Francoist authorities but also individual and collective agencies and the memory of colonization. For this purpose, special attention is paid to the spatial dimension, analyzing, on the one hand, the policies by which the Franco regime sought to control villages and, on the other, the experiences and memories of those who inhabited them. The first section of the article analyzes the impact of Franco's domestic colonization policy on postwar agrarian society as part of the regeneration policies promoted by the dictatorship. The second section explores the mechanisms used by the dictatorship to invade private space, its capacity to control daily life, and the nationalizing potential that these policies had on the inhabitants of new settlements. Finally, the article examines the popular memory of these new settlers and their descendants in two colonization villages in Granada (Andalusia). Based on their testimonies, the article argues that the experiences of the inhabitants of these colonization settlements were markedly different from the official discourse of Franco's dictatorship.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article traces the career of John B. Griffing, an agricultural scientist who engaged in rural development projects in China, Brazil, and the United States during the first half of the twentieth century. His career serves as a microcosm for the evolution of transnational agricultural development as it shifted from smaller, localized projects to the larger, top-down developmental schemes that characterized the postwar era. Trained as an educator and working as an agricultural missionary in China during the 1920s, Griffing viewed extension work as an educational endeavor aimed at helping farmers to help themselves. Skeptical of government intervention, especially by foreign governments, he prioritized the rural church as a key institution for the dissemination of agricultural technologies. As his career progressed, however, rural extension moved in different directions: a high modernist mentality came to value scale over the individual, while the emerging Green Revolution technologies required greater inputs and institutional support. By the end of his career, Griffing had become a reluctant expert who resisted the institutionalized development strategies of the postwar years in favor of smaller-scale approaches where foreign technicians such as himself could work alongside local farmers to improve rural life.",

The Benthall Machine Company sued three other companies for infringing on Benthall's patent rights, although all these companies were using peanut pickers based on the original design by a Black farmer and inventor named Benjamin Hicks, whose 1901 patent preceded Benthall's. Hicks's story reveals how discriminatory race relations in the Jim Crow South and capitalist imperatives led to white-owned businesses profiting from the intellectual work of Black innovators. Hicks's experience illuminates how much invention was an intrinsic part of farming and how Black intellectual labor, especially in the realm of agriculture, has consistently been undermined and downplayed.",

This article presents data for the period 1500 to 1950 on the most important indigenous Indonesian roots and tubers--taro and yams. It looks at the geographical spread of these crops and their social and economic importance--dealing also briefly with adjacent areas like the Malay Peninsula and the Philippines. This is followed by the story of the introduction of the New World roots and tubers: sweet potato, bengkuang, (Irish) potato, and cassava. The article analyzes the differences between the various crops as regards their spread in time and space and the reasons that the indigenous roots and tubers were pushed aside by the alien crops. In conclusion, the findings are related to various economic, social, cultural, and political developments and to the rizification hypothesis.",

Although the new medium was introduced in the 1920s, it was during the Depression decade of the 1930s that most rural families bought their first set. With the coming of radio, formerly isolated rural homes had zccess to world news, current weather and market reports, and a host of USDA-produced agricultural programs. However, it was the national network entertainment programs with their many advertisements that promised Depression-era rural listeners a better tomorrow in the form of a modernized urban consumer lifestyle. This article explores the coming of radio to rural areas during the 1930s and reviews some contemporary industry research findings on rural radio usage and consumer behavior.",

Yet they approached their concerns through a variety of historical lenses. Countering arguments that suggest environmentalism had its deepest roots in outdoor leisure, the countercultural back-to-the-land movement turned to a markedly American practice of pastoral mythmaking that held rural life and labor as counter to the urban-industrial condition. Counterculturalists relied specifically on notions of simple work in rural collective endeavors as the means to producing a healthy body and environment. Yet the individuals who went back-to-the-land often failed to remedy conflicts that arose as they attempted to abandon American consumer practices and take up a \"primitive\" and down-to-early pastoral existence. Contact with rural nature time and again translated to physical maladies, impoverishment, and community clashes in many rural countercultural communes. As the back-to-the-land encounter faded, the greater movement's ethos did not disappear. Counterculturalists used the consumption of nature through rural labor as a fundamental idea in a growing cooperative food movement. The back-to-the-land belief in the connection between healthy bodies, environments, and a collective identity helped to expand a new form of consumer environmentalism.",

It argues that Khrushchev's 1957 boast about the Soviet Union surpassing the United States in key economic areas inspired Mao to launch an industrialization program that would push the People's Republic past Great Britain in some production categories within fifteen years. Beginning in 1958 Mao imposed unrealistic targets on Chinese grain production to extract funds from agriculture for rapid industrial growth. Maoists placed relentless pressure on communist cadres for ruthless implementation of the Great Leap Forward. Contrary to Maoist plans, China's grain output in 1959-1960 declined sharply from 1957 levels and rural per capita grain retention decreased dramatically. Throughout China, party cadres' mismanagement of agricultural production was responsible for the decline in grain output, and the communist state's excessive requisition of grain caused food shortages for the peasants. But the key factor determining the famine's uneven impact on the peasantry in the provinces was the degree to which provincial leaders genuinely and energetically embraced Maoist programs. This is illustrated by a close examination of the Great Leap famine in Anhui Province.",

With shared roots in late nineteenth-century botany, ecologists and agronomists fostered important connections during the Progressive era that have been largely overlooked despite a number of finely nuanced studies of ecology's origins. But if 'applied ecology' once effectively meant agriculture, over the course of the first decades of the twentieth century the relationship between ecology and scientific agriculture grew strained. Agriculturists narrowed their focus to increasing yields, and ecologists sought to establish their discipline as a distant theoretical science and so distanced themselves from its agricultural applications. By the end of World War I, the process of disciplinary specialization was well underway. In time, the two disciplines diverged so completely that the once vital connections between them were obscured and forgotten.",

    "abstract": "In the early twentieth century California became a big exporter of some agricultural products that, until then, had only been grown on a large scale in the mediterranean basin. As a result, exports of those products diminished or stagnated in Mediterranean countries, with important repercussions on their economies. The Spanish orange industry, however, continued to expand, despite the fact that a substantial percentage of Spanish oranges came from farms owned by (often illiterate) small peasants who, in comparison to the California growers, used a great deal of labor, small amounts of capital, and little science. This paper shows that Spanish farmers were in fact capable of growing high-quality oranges at prices that were more competitive than those in California, although interested they often preferred to satisfy the strong demand for middling fruit from Great Britain because it was a more profitable business. This, combined with a deficient use of brand names, gave the Spanish citrus industry serious reputation problems by the 1930s, from which, however, it recovered quickly.",

Spain is a good place to test this idea, given the phenomenal expansion experienced by its livestock sector in the second half of the twentieth century and the strong influence large multinational, particularly American, feed manufacturers had on this growth. Oral histories offer insight into the microeconomic forces at work in the recent development of Spanish livestock farming and highlight the role of local entrepreneurs in the establishment of livestock agribusiness.",

    "abstract": "The official verdict of China's government is that the Cultural Revolution, which lasted from May 1966 to October 1976, “was responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the party, the state, and the people since the founding of the People's Republic” (1). After a decade of upheaval, the Chinese economy had come to the verge of collapse, and its political system was in disarray. State leaders began to redesign development strategies, policies, and plans. However, academic research on this period is rather scarce and lacks systematic studies on county-level factional politics throughout the entire Cultural Revolution. Dong Guoqiang and Andrew G. Walder's A Decade of Upheaval fills the void.This fascinating book is split into nine chapters plus a preface, chronology, glossary of names, bibliography, and index. It is organized chronologically and thematically, with the result being a historical cloud in which the reader is left to discern causality on their own. The book analyzes political struggle and violence during the Cultural Revolution in a rural Chinese county, grounded in evidentiary detail and making a number of novel observations. The authors focus their study on a remote and marginal county of northwest China, Feng County, and on Zhang Lianshen, a major rebel leader and a founder of one of the county's two factional alliances (Paolian and Liansi), who was intimately involved in all of the major political events in the county over the upheaval decade.Through researching Feng County's Cultural Revolutionary history, the authors shed light on four essential themes of political conflicts that have long been obscure. First, the authors point out that the remote location did not insulate the county from national political trends but only delayed their initial impact. County-level political conflicts were deeply affected by national political trends to a remarkable degree, as each twist and turn in Beijing's policies reverberated in the county in ways that altered the balance of power between two deeply opposed and clearly defined political factions.Second, the authors show that once the factions had clearly formed, and after violent encounters between them spread, the driving force of the escalating conflict was the realization that defeat would mean victimization at the hands of one's enemies. They also reveal in remarkable detail the deep involvement of China's armed forces in the definition and perpetuation of county-level factionalism. The struggle in Feng County was pushed forward by the absence of a neutral authority that could credibly enforce a cease-fire and ensure the evenhanded treatment of the two sides. Essentially, it was a struggle for survival.Third, the conflicts in Feng County were connected to broader factional disputes in the surrounding prefecture and province. Finally, the authors show how the prolonged deterioration of political authority and public order, and in many ways a deep fracturing of the social fabric, public trust, and citizen morale, resulted from this decade of conflict and oppression.This book creatively utilizes the methodology of historical anthropology and sociology and combines observations in the field with documentary analysis, drawing on an unusual level of evidentiary detail. Through interviewing key participants in the events, such as sixteen former activists, local officials, leaders of both factions, soldiers, and local collectors of Cultural Revolution memorabilia, the authors gained access to firsthand historical materials. Even more essential than these oral testimonies, the authors accessed the work notebooks and diaries of those involved in the events of the period, which were taken during conferences, study classes, and other meetings. They also extensively collected documents from several levels of government authorities, including the flow of directives and notices from authorities in Beijing, the provincial authorities in Jiangsu, and the prefectural authorities in Xuzhou. They also draw on internal bulletins and documents issued by a range of interim authorities in the county during the long period in which it remained under some form of military control, from March 1967 to September 1969.Additionally, the authors supplement official documents with unofficial materials issued by each of the county's two political factions, such as handbills and wall posters, selected copies of periodicals, chronologies of events, confessions, and self-criticisms written by individuals and by leaders of factions, and several unpublished memoirs and book drafts.This book has made a number of significant contributions to our current knowledge of the history of the Cultural Revolution. By examining rural Feng County, the authors add a new research dimension that should offer a deeper understanding of the Cultural Revolution as a whole, as well as help to explain the structural flaws of the Stalinist-Maoist political model.",

    "abstract": "Growing crops for automobile fuel is a major activity of industrial agriculture in the twenty-first century. Yet the history of biofuels, especially outside the United States, remains surprisingly little known. Jennifer Eaglin's Sweet Fuel does a significant service for agricultural historians by documenting a key era in biofuels history: Brazil's national alcohol fuel program. In 1975, Brazil launched a National Ethanol Program, or Proálcool, to supplement, and later replace, gasoline with alcohol distilled from sugarcane. Sweet Fuel describes the program's origins, its evolution, and its unanticipated consequences for Brazil's environment and agrarian labor relations.Proálcool's roots were planted in the 1930s when Brazil's government propped up the ailing sugar sector just as it had previously done for coffee. President Getúlio Vargas mandated a 5 percent mixture of alcohol in gasoline. The 1960s and 1970s were dominated by a military dictatorship and modernization of Brazil's economy. Large sugar producers like São Paulo's Biagi family took advantage of this era to expand and modernize. Yet this era's focus was on producing sugar for the international export market, rather than domestic ethanol. When the 1973 oil crisis drove up prices, however, Brazil's reliance on imported oil caused an economic crisis. Alcohol fuel offered a way to offset domestic oil consumption while also supporting sugar producers.The Proálcool program developed in two phases. First, in 1975 President Ernesto Geisel mandated a 20 percent ethanol mixture and set a target to produce three billion liters of ethanol by 1980. Eaglin focuses on the Biagi's Santa Elisa mill to demonstrate how large, industrialized sugar barons dominated the Proálcool program. Proálcool's second phase shifted from supplementing gasoline with ethanol to a crash program to fully replace gasoline with alcohol. Key to this phase was the all-ethanol car, a Brazilian engineering triumph that hit the roads in 1977.As ethanol production increased under Proálcool, pollution from vinasse (nutrient-rich wastewater from sugarcane distillation) became a national problem. Old laws on the books were supposed to regulate vinasse pollution, but enforcement was limited and most producers ignored the regulations with impunity. Facing atrocious pollution levels, municipalities tried to crack down on producers who dumped vinasse into rivers beginning in the 1950s. There was some success, but without stronger state or national regulation, producers often evaded local enforcement. Eaglin details the shifting agencies tasked with regulating vinasse pollution, calling them “acronyms of confusion” (105). Finally, in 1978 the national government officially banned dumping. Most vinasse was then stored in large retention ponds, which Eaglin calls “lakes of sacrifice” (120).Proálcool also caused labor strife in the agro-industrial sugarcane regions of São Paulo. Sweet Fuel offers good background on the shift from permanent to temporary labor in Brazil's cane fields during the second half of the twentieth century. Describing the grueling, dangerous work of cutting cane by hand, Eaglin paints a striking contrast between Proálcool's modern goals and its reliance on exhausting hand labor well into the 1980s. When growers tried to intensify production in 1984, workers struck and burned cane fields. Initially, workers won many concessions, though their implementation was erratic.Proálcool sputtered through the late 1980s and 1990s. Bad harvests led to worry that ethanol supplies would not meet demand, while cheap imported oil weakened the program's original justification. Throughout the 1990s, ethanol advocates focused on the fuel's environmental benefits. Despite new green rhetoric, however, problems of air and water pollution remained significant. Proálcool limped to its end in the late 1990s as Brazil was buffeted by high inflation and neoliberal reforms that framed Proálcool's subsidies as unaffordable. Brazilian ethanol rebounded in the early 2000s, however, with the launch of flex-fuel cars that allowed drivers to choose either gasoline or ethanol depending on price and preference. And as global concern over greenhouse gas emissions increased, sugarcane ethanol's value as a fuel with lower emissions than gasoline was celebrated worldwide.A great strength of Sweet Fuel is simply introducing Brazil's ethanol program to English-language readers. It is a story that anyone interested in modern agro-industrial development and the imbrication of agriculture and energy during the twentieth century should know. Eaglin also establishes that Proálcool and the problems of ethanol production had origins before the 1970s energy crisis. It is a helpful reminder of long-term continuities in Brazil's sugarcane sector, although focusing on the decades before the 1970s at times shortchanges what did actually change under the Proálcool program.Sweet Fuel concludes with what Eaglin argues are Proálcool's lessons for energy transitions more broadly. For example, Eaglin emphasizes that turning agriculture into an energy source brings the problem of spatially unequal costs and benefits to farming. City dwellers benefit from cleaner air while maintaining car-dependent lifestyles. But the agro-industrial countryside bears the costs in the form of polluted water and air. I enjoyed these lessons and found them interesting tools of comparison. But agricultural historians who balk at prescriptive history might be less enthusiastic, especially since many of the lessons are aimed at energy systems more than agriculture. Nonetheless, Sweet Fuel has begun a much-needed conversation on biofuels' past, present, and likely future.",

    "abstract": "Aaron Windel's Cooperative Rule is an excellent and timely contribution to current debates in global agrarian history, especially the institutional aspects of such history and questions regarding colonial power. It is timely in three distinctive ways. First, it comes as cooperatives seem to have recaptured popular imagination in the post-2008 decade as part of the so-called new left economics. In academic history writing, this (re)entry of cooperatives has been reflected in a number of recent publications, including the collaborative works of Patrizia Battilani and Harm Schröter and of Mary Hilson, Silke Neunsinger, and Greg Patmore, as well as individual studies by Mo Moulton, Nicole Sackley, and this reviewer. The common denominator between all these studies is a transnational approach that investigates the circulation of ideas, education, institutional building, and commodity exchange through the lens of cooperatives in the twentieth century. Cooperative Rule forcefully centers the question of power within these ongoing debates. Apart from being economic institutions meant to kick-start growth in rural areas in the first half of the twentieth century in the British Empire, cooperatives were also an instrument of colonialism. Windel convincingly shows, for example, that cooperatives in East Africa were not simply meant to legitimize the colonial project through the conventional discourse of benevolent paternalism but were also actual imperial tools for economic and political control. Second, without explicitly referring to these debates, Cooperative Rule also contributes to the growing literature on the creation of a “global countryside” in the second half of the nineteenth century and in the twentieth. Third, and tightly related to the first two points, Cooperative Rule is timely as it provides a much-needed critical approach to the history of cooperatives. Academic works on cooperatives have been historically characterized by a “court history” syndrome and a sanguine tone in general.Cooperative Rule, in contrast, offers a sophisticated and intricate analysis. It is an example par excellence of global and transnational history. It integrates seamlessly the stories of cooperatives, among others, in the Northwest of the British Raj, Uganda, Kenya, Malaya, and postwar Britain. Windel does so neither in a superficial nor in an abstractly removed way, narrating rich stories that bely an astounding degree of research.The book is divided into five chapters. The first chapter follows the formation of cooperatives in British India—and the Punjab in particular—and the transfer of this institution as “political technology” to East Africa. The second chapter looks closely at the intersection of education and community development in East Africa. Christian missions and colonial authorities alike saw cooperatives as a perfect conduit for “practical lessons” in social improvement. Chapters 3 and 4 present the most fascinating historical evidence and set the book apart from the cliché postcolonial truism that colonial institutions were a site of knowledge creation and exercised power. In chapter 3, Windel shows that cooperatives were also a site of resistance—as all colonial institutions—and offered radical spaces. For example, cooperatives channeled political discontent during the Malayan Emergency (1948–60) and in fact became a recruitment ground for the Communist Party. Chapter 4 then zooms in on one example of cooperatives as a site for anti-colonial organization in Uganda. As agricultural producers organized into illicit cooperatives and thereby made colonial paternalism redundant, the legal framework surrounding cooperation became the pivotal point of anti-colonial organization and discontent. Having recently lost its colonial possessions in South Asia, Britain grappled to preserve its African colonies through both violence and compromise. The decolonization of cooperative law in Uganda (including the removal of the of the revered institution of the Registrar) is a clear example of the latter.Chapter 5 turns to the cooperative movement in postwar Britain. Cooperators and generally the political left were keen to embrace the notion of the British cooperative moment as a trailblazer and foundation of an imagined, harmonious commonwealth. Paradoxically, while many British cooperators adopted the anti-colonial recipe of boycotting imports in order to fight against South African apartheid, the London Cooperative Society was itself rocked by a scandal as it became publicly known that it had installed a “color bar” for some of its positions.In lieu of praising the book further, it is necessary to sketch what remains uncharted and will inform further debates on the global history of cooperation. Two general lines of thought seem most promising. First, a more explicit engagement with the political economy of cooperatives in the Global South is much needed. Second, related to the first point and expanding on the main arguments of Cooperative Rule, the question of cooperatives as an instrument of postcolonial governmentality will certainly reveal much of the processes that formed a “global countryside.”",

    "abstract": "Abstract Frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) was invented in 1945 by government researchers. To Florida orange growers beset by surplus production in some years and hard winter freezes in others, FCOJ was a \"miracle\" technology. Easily stored and transported, concentrate made it possible for orange juice processors to provide consumers with a uniform-quality product year-round. By the mid-1950s constantly rising consumer demand for FCOJ had essentially eliminated Florida orange growers’ constant surplus problem. Furthermore, many oranges that suffered from occasional winter frosts could be transformed into concentrate rather than destroyed. Thus, FCOJ appeared to rationalize the Florida orange industry in the 1950s, eliminating seasonal and annual swings in production and stabilizing prices and profits. However, when severe frosts attacked Florida groves in 1957-58 and again in 1962-63, FCOJ processors responded by doubling prices. Unlike other industrial agriculturists in American history, Florida orange growers and processors did not use technology to control nature in order to increase profits. Instead, they used the environmental limits imposed by Florida’s subtropical climate, along with their oligopolistic market position, to squeeze higher profits out of consumers. They respected the role of nature in limiting their production, not because they were enlightened ecologists, but because their control over orange juice production allowed them to make just as much money from a damaged crop of oranges as from a bumper crop. This case study thus calls into question the meaning of \"rationalized\" agriculture, showing that the logic of capitalist agriculture is not always straightforward.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This essay develops an American approach to the rise of the English Atlantic during the seventeenth century. It argues that productivity gains in plantation agriculture fueled an extraordinary expansion of commerce as planters raising tobacco, sugar, and rice improved their efficiency and were able to lower prices. Lower prices made the products of American plantations affordable to an ever-growing number of European consumers. The increased consumption fueled the expansion of the American plantation colonies, transformed the Atlantic into an English inland sea, and led to the creation of the first British Empire; one of the great commercial successes of the Early Modern Era. The essay also interrogates the concept of productivity gains in a slave economy, arguing that what are often interpreted as improvements in productivity were in fact increases in labor inputs as planters squeezed slaves harder. This raises the question, then, of whether productivity gains (or increased labor inputs) signal that planters were forward-looking entrepreneurs or backward seigneurs?",

Antibiotics—once viewed as substances that could rid milk of bacterial hazards—became understood as food adulterants when residues of the drugs were detected in milk. Although consumers' concerns about food purity became critical in the postwar era, only in the late 1950s and early 1960s did public health officials and consumers take interest in the potential human health effects of antibiotic residues. Veterinarians and milk processors, not consumers, led the effort to curb indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the 1940s and 1950s. Paying close attention to the context in which farmers chose to use antibiotics and monitored drug residues, this article seeks to explain why farm people adopted veterinary drugs and how they adapted to new regulatory structures and shifting ideas about milk purity.",

This article explores the ways in which the boundaries between science and politics were more blurred than they seemed at the time or in subsequent historical treatments. The argument begins with a history of the unique composition of agricultural economics research at Iowa State, refocuses the affair from a conflict between the state college and the dairy industry to one among a much larger number of actors, and concludes by demonstrating that one professor, Theodore Schultz, was in the process of transitioning to a new career in prescriptive policy work with private policy associations that ended up being opposed to the practices and policy goals of some of the farm organizations in question.",

    "abstract": "The organic dairy movement started long before a mainstream market for such products existed. As early as the 1960s, conventional dairy farmers in different regions of the United States adopted organic methods although there were no financial rewards for doing so. They made changes to their production practices because of specific problems they encountered with the conventional system. In the 1980s several pioneering farmers turned to on-farm processing and sold their dairy products in alternative retail outlets. They were also instrumental in the development of organic certification standards. By sharing the stories of the organic dairy farmers at the forefront of the movement, this article documents how organic dairy developed from an “invisible” part of the production process to a niche product of food coops in the 1980s.",

The Seattle Commune was one among many enterprises founded by foreign sympathizers in the new Soviet republic. All these communes faced obstacles and most collapsed by the end of the decade. In contrast, Seattle persisted as a commune, lasting from 1939 to 1991 as a collective farm. Scholars have argued that the success of foreign communes hinged on their members’ ideological commitment to the Soviet cause. Using correspondence, archival documents, and journalistic accounts from the United States and Russia, this case study of the Seattle Commune’s early years argues that material factors mattered as much as ideology for the survival of Soviet",

    "abstract": "This essay examines the introduction of the Borden Company’s brand mascot “Elsie the Borden Cow” at the 1939 World’s Fair. Through an extensive visual analysis of Borden’s fair time publicity stills and advertisements, it argues that the creatively conceived “spokes-cow” functioned as a much needed public relations ambassador for an industry in turmoil and as a highly gendered symbol of agrarian nostalgia at a time when new technologies upended traditional methods of dairy farming and revolutionized the consumer marketplace. Most celebrated among these technologies was the Rotolactor, a mechanical milking system that was the Borden Pavilion’s centerpiece at the fair. Elsie’s considerable popularity demonstrates that Borden’s success also depended on the cultivation of nostalgic, pastoral visions of American farming as the nation stood at the threshold of a new era in industrialized agriculture.",

    "abstract": "In Powering American Farms, Richard F. Hirsh argues that private utility companies made significant inroads into rural electrification long before the establishment of the Tennessee Valley Authority and Rural Electrification Administration. With this thesis, Hirsh upends the traditional narrative that rural America, long neglected by utility companies, received electricity as a result of the New Deal. Convincing and intriguing, his revisionist history and his claim that the true story of rural electrification was a victim of New Deal propaganda are both supported by a wealth of evidence. Controverting what historians thought they knew, Hirsh sheds light on the often-ignored relationship between private utility companies and rural America.Part 1 sets the historical and historiographical context for rural electrification. In chapter 1, Hirsh explains why the erroneous history triumphed, partly due to Rural Electrification Administration administrators like Morris Llewellyn Cooke and partly because the story of a heroic federal government rescuing farmers who had been ignored or slighted by power companies is attractive. Cooke used books, movies, and plays to advertise the Rural Electrification Administration and to paint private utility companies as greedy and negligent. In chapters 2 and 3, Hirsh outlines all the reasons rural America was unappealing to power companies from both cultural and economic standpoints: sparse populations, stereotypes of farmers as premodern and preindustrial, and, perhaps most importantly, lower profit margins as compared to urban America. In chapter 4, Hirsh explores how the prospect of an electrified rural America sparked imaginations; in chapter 5, he illustrates how some impatient farmers pursued electricity independently.In part 2, Hirsch explores how, despite these obstacles, private rural electrification began to gain traction. In chapters 6 and 7, Hirsh discusses the interest some power company leaders had in rural electrification. There was some money to be made—electrified farms in California had demonstrated that potential—and aiding farmers meant good public relations. Chapters 8 and 9 trace the formation and evolution of the Committee on the Relation of Electricity to Agriculture, which was created to explore and foster how rural electrification stood to benefit both farmers and power companies. The spread of electrical lines into rural areas and the disparities between rural and urban recipients are the focus of both chapters 10 and 11.Part 3 covers the continued expansion of rural electrification. In chapter 12, Hirsh delves into the successes of both the Tennessee Valley Authority and Rural Electrification Administration. He in no way disparages these New Deal programs but merely emphasizes that they \"took advantage of special conditions that permitted them to pursue a different objective than utilities\" (226). Ironically, their accomplishments proved beyond a shadow of doubt that rural electrification could be profitable. Even so, in chapter 13, Hirsh shows how tensions between private and public utilities remained strained. What little progress power companies achieved in the 1920s and early 1930s was undercut by the massive growth of federal power during the New Deal. Moreover, officeholders such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt successfully painted Samuel Insull and other private utility industry leaders as villains during the Great Depression, a time when many Americans sought scapegoats. Given such negative press coverage, it is little wonder that the Committee on the Relation of Electricity to Agriculture ended with a whimper and not a bang in the fall of 1939.Overall, Hirsh has proved that private utility companies did not neglect farmers and, equally compelling, that electricity, though seen today as essential, was viewed as a convenience in the 1920s and 1930s. During that era, it was one of many new technologies for which farmers had little (if any) desire. This book will be of interest to anyone interested in rural electrification, the New Deal, or the contrasts between public and private utilities. Extraordinarily well researched if somewhat repetitive, the text is strongest when discussing historiography and the pitfalls of presentism. It leaves readers with much to ponder about winners writing the history books, or at least greatly influencing them.",

Nevertheless, in the context ofthe changing scale of work, community, and new ideas about childhood and education, Pro? gressive reformers suggested that some farm work was unhealthy for chil? dren. To separate the agricultural labor that concerned them from the agrarian consensus, they developed a critique centered on education and industrialized agriculture. Restricting children's labor to allow school attendance balanced two positives for farm children?education and work. Restricting child labor in industrialized agriculture simply recognized its divergence from the family farm ideal. Reformers succeeded modestly along this dual track by the 1930s. The boundaries of the agrarian framework limited further child labor regulation in agriculture, however?not until 1974 were age and hour restrictions on children's field work applied across the industry?thirty-five years after similar protections had been provided in other industries, and exemptions continued for children working on family and small farms.",

However, few historical studies of modern occupational change in the countryside are available, especially for continental Europe. The transformation of rural Spain in the twentieth century is a case study in this broader history, reflecting upon the causes and implications of different paths of rural change. The decline of agriculture in the economy of rural Spain occurred mostly during the second half of the twentieth century and was closely related to out-migration and depopulation. Only some rural areas in the country's more dynamic regions witnessed simultaneous occupational change and population growth. Most rural communities, on the contrary, had to face the erosive effect of depopulation on their social fabric.",

Collectivized agricultural production lacked sufficient economic incentives for Vietnamese farmers; they preferred to produce privately for household consumption or the free market. State-initiated reforms to collectivize agriculture failed to improve the performance of the agricultural sector, and eventually the Vietnamese Communist Party was forced to abandon collectivization altogether. Once farmers were freed from collective labor and could pursue private production for the free market, Vietnam’s agricultural output skyrocketed.",

    "abstract": "Beginning in 1878 with the International Phylloxera Convention of Berne, international conventions have sought to relieve national agricultural industries from two specific burdens. First, by defining phytosanitary practices to be enforced by national plant protection services, these conventions attempted to prevent the introduction of plant diseases and pests into national territories from which they were previously absent. Second, by standardizing these practices - especially through the design of a unique certificate of inspection - the conventions attempted to eliminate barriers such as quarantines affection international agricultural trade. The succession of phytopathological conventions seemed to epitomize the coalescence of an international community against agricultural pests. What actually coalesced was bio-geopolitics wherein plant pathologists and economic entomologists from North America and the British Empire questioned the so-called internationality of the environmental and economic specificities of continental European agriculture, embodied in \"international\" conventions. Although an international phenomenon, the dissemination of agricultural pests provided opportunities for cooperation on a strictly regional albeit transnational basis that pitted bio-geopolitical spaces against each other. This article retraces the formation of these spaces by analyzing the deliberations of committees and congresses that gathered to define an international agricultural order based on the means to prevent the spread of plant diseases and pests.",

However, it is clear that at an early period much wasteland was held at a higher level, as a resource to be shared by all the surrounding manors. Although true intercommoning had probably generally died out by the sixteenth century, in NorthWest England it lingered in those upland and lowland wastes where there was neither pressure on grazing nor a topography with natural boundaries. Yet shared resources of this kind conflicted with developing early-modern ideas of private property and with the growing desire on the part of landlords to increase the profitability of their estates, while the court of the Duchy of Lancaster played a positive role in the process by which these late surviving intercommons were partitioned, enclosed, and improved.",

    "abstract": "In The Idea of Development in Africa, Corrie Decker and Elisabeth McMahon examine development theory and practice over time, asserting that development “arose directly out of imperialism, colonialism, and neocolonialism” (275). This text not only situates development in a historical setting but also explains key theories and connects the past to the present. Ultimately, Decker and McMahon conclude, “Despite the rhetoric on saving, helping, and equalizing, the development industry has done more to maintain global and local inequalities than it has to dismantle them” (16). Thus they make a compelling argument for rethinking established development paradigms by centering the futures and visions that Africans have for themselves.This work builds on a body of literature that has focused on how the construction of both development expertise and the objects of development have been political projects. Unlike previous scholarship, Decker and McMahon emphasize the origins of what they call “the development episteme itself,” shifting the standard narrative away from the creation of the Bretton Woods institutions and instead locating those origins in Enlightenment philosophies and the “civilizing mission.” In doing so, the authors argue that the “logic of difference and differentiation is built into the foundations of development,” and they then show how these ideas have shaped policy and practice up to the present (4–5).Relying largely on published scholarly works, published primary sources, online reports, and news media, along with limited oral histories and archival research, The Idea of Development is broken down into three parts. Part 1 examines the origins of the development episteme in the nineteenth-century world, emphasizing its imperialist setting, knowledge production, and racist ideologies, and closing with a chapter calling for decolonizing development. Part 2 explores how these ideas have shaped colonial and postcolonial development practice in Africa, with chapters on the importance of science, African contestations of development, economic development theories, and nongovernmental organizations. Part 3 focuses on some specific development “problems” in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Here Decker and McMahon take residential spaces, education, health care, and manufacturing as their case studies.This work is at its strongest when centering African ideas, explaining difficult concepts, and tying the past to the present. The section on African communities' vernacular notions of progress illustrates, for example, how various societies “have generated their own diverse meanings of development” (5). The authors' explanation of knowledge production—noting that “its collection and construction by individuals was deeply subjective”—will be especially helpful for undergraduate readers (42). Perhaps most important, this work emphasizes that the racist underpinnings of early colonial development have endured in more recent development discourse that distinguishes between the “developed” West and the “developing” countries of Africa.Such contributions will be of interest to students and scholars alike. The focus on the genesis and earlier history of development, as well as the accessibility of the writing, make this an especially appealing book for teaching. Readers of Agricultural History will also find much of relevance in this volume. With sidebars on the Amani Research Institute, the Tanganyikan groundnut scheme, usufruct land tenure, Wangari Maathai's Green Belt Movement, and pastoralism, there is ample space devoted to agricultural development. Various chapters, particularly in part 3, delve into additional questions related to agriculture, such as land resettlement, agricultural commodities, and irrigation schemes.The book not only provides rich insights into an impressive number of development topics, but it also covers the history of development in Africa from the nineteenth century to the present. Writing such a sweeping history is no easy task and necessarily entails making some omissions. This monograph does tend to emphasize the more distant past as well as the present, with the mid- to late twentieth century—particularly, the rise of neoliberalism and the implementation of structural adjustment programs—garnering less attention.Even so, this is an important work and will be essential teaching material for courses on the history of development. The authors strike a delicate balance between writing a history that pushes scholarly understanding forward, while also making this work accessible to students. The epilogue persuasively argues, “Development is not the powerful edifice it claims to be; it is a holdover of colonialism that is quickly losing relevance in our current world” (288). The Idea of Development in Africa is a smart and engaging study, which will be of interest to scholars and students of African history, development history, agricultural history, and labor history.",

    "abstract": "For over a century and a half, academics, public policy experts, and government bureaucrats have examined the causes and consequences of America's rural poverty “problem.” Often, they found the root cause of the issue in the people themselves—those isolated, white mountain folk viewed as shiftless, lazy, criminally inclined, intellectually stunted, and genetically inferior. This perception was mirrored through popular culture in books like Erskine Caldwell's Tobacco Road, TV shows like The Beverly Hillbillies, and movies like Deliverance. In his provocative book Peculiar Places, Ryan Cartwright puts a new spin on this old topic by examining rural white America through the lens of queer and disability studies. A professor of American studies at the University of California, Davis, Cartwright uses a case study approach to investigate not only the individuals who have inhabited what he calls “peculiar places,” but also the people who have scrutinized and studied those mountain folk. He concludes that “the estranged ways of looking” at these peculiar places by outsiders have led to a series of “cultural narratives naming poor rural white communities as sites of perverse sexuality, deformed bodies, [and] deranged minds” (3). While generally succeeding in showing that difference does not necessarily equate to disability, and that the lifestyle choices made by these individuals may be appropriate and acceptable within community norms, his reliance on arcane social science jargon often inhibits his ability to get his points across. Despite this weakness, the book offers an interesting examination of the ways in which both popular culture and academic discourse have worked, often in tandem, to marginalize and stigmatize rural white nonconforming people.After a turgid first chapter Cartwright hits his stride with a compelling chapter on eugenic family studies in the early twentieth century. Examining what he calls “an entire imagined world of rural white deviance,” he discovers a different domain—one of “mutual support, nonnormative kinship arrangements, and part-time work in the informal economy” (26, 29). By using the lens of disability, Cartwright concludes that fieldworkers (often women trained at the Eugenic Record Office on Long Island) “gathered up bits of gossip” and used that information to segregate, institutionalize, and possibly sterilize those individuals they viewed as delinquent, degenerate, or deficient. Building on this stereotype, Cartwright looks at the rural photographs of the 1930s Farm Security Administration (FSA), exemplified by Dorothea Lange's iconic Migrant Mother. He maintains that these pictures “attempted to rehabilitate images of rural whiteness” (84).Since the mid-twentieth century, the genre of slasher / psychotic maniac / horror film has become a staple of American cinema. These films were often based on the true story of Ed Gein, a fifty-one-year-old bachelor from rural Wisconsin arrested in 1957 for a horrific series of murders and dismemberments. Sentenced to life in a Wisconsin mental hospital, Gein's story became fodder for newspaper and magazine articles throughout the country. Cartwright analyzes Gein's life by examining the relationship between “rural white landscapes [and] psychiatric disability, physical disability, poverty, and sexuality” (117). He questions whether Gein's madness was related to his living on the edge of civilization, what Cartwright calls his “metaphorical proximity to the primitive” (111). By discussing these issues, Cartwright brings up the possibility that urban elites find Gein not so different from other residents of these rural areas.Cartwright then moves to examine a very different form of rural detection. In what is perhaps his strongest chapter, he takes a look at the 1960s rediscovery of rural Appalachian poverty, most associated with the 1962 publication of Michael Harrington's The Other America. He ties Harrington's discussion on the culture of poverty in Appalachian America to the work of Oscar Lewis on Puerto Rican urban blight and the infamous Moynihan Report on the pathology of the urban female-headed Black family. While many praise Harrington's work and others like it as the impetus for Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, Cartwright instead claims they simply verified mainstream “anti-idyllic expectations and ways of looking” (119). Cartwright concludes that many of the problems “discovered” by Harrington “need not be understood as inherently pathological” (125). In other words, difference may be simply difference, and need not be labeled as disabling. He also deftly ties in notions of race by examining how these poor white mountain folk did not live up to notions of white superiority. “The problem of white poverty, to many,” he determines, “was that it prevented white people from fully realizing the privileges of being white” (142).Cartwright moves from the academic world of Michael Harrington and the governmental attempts to ameliorate both poverty and assumed pathological ways of living to an examination of the depiction of rural “defectiveness” through movies like Deliverance and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Building on ideas of rural disability, poverty, and perversion connected to Ed Gein, Cartwright writes that these films “cemented the association between a nonhuman animal and a person with intellectual, developmental, or mental disabilities” (157). The films also stereotyped rural Americans as sexual perverts while classifying nonheterosexual relationships as both inherently nonconsensual and morally repugnant. Cartwright condemns that type of analysis, as he announces that “sexual difference and disabilities were understood as elements of the mundane social landscape. . . . They were markers of a heterogeneous community like any other, associated with both difficulty and joy, not reducible to a generic rural horror” (162).Cartwright ends the book where he starts it—with an examination of the Ward brothers, four older, intellectually disabled bachelors living together on a farm in upstate New York. In 1990 one brother died and another was charged with his murder. The story, much like that of Ed Gein, became a national sensation, as media broadcast a “story about a family of murderous, incestuous, and grotesquely ‘deformed’ hillbillies” (2). Cartwright disputes these claims and asserts that while the Ward brothers may have “farmed more slowly and less efficiently than their neighbors,” they still possessed “knowledge, skills, and intimacies . . . in spite of their eccentricities” (181). This is the conclusion Cartwright draws: that people living on the margins of society may be different but need not be labeled as defective. Moving past the academic prose that often clutters his pages, Cartwright tells a valuable story here. The stories of, as he labels them, queer and crip people are more complicated and nuanced and important than we have imagined.",

    "abstract": "Narrating the history of Japanese green tea, once commonly consumed by Americans with “milk and sugar,” Robert Hellyer masterfully describes processes of transnational mercantile exchange spanning the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, where East Asian and Anglo-American capitalistic practices neatly intersected. Green with Milk and Sugar shines with vivid descriptions of individual American and Japanese merchants heavily invested in commerce and buffeted by vicissitudes in US-Japan relations during a volatile century of interactions. Illuminating photographs, descriptive advertisements, and product labels paint a striking picture of the brokers and marketing practices for Japanese green tea. Hellyer found inspiration in his great-great-grandfather Frederick, who profited from Chicago's centrality in the 1880s tea trade. Creating a US market for green tea mobilized transpacific and transatlantic networks of tea dealers, transporters, and producers; the text thus employs a “commodity chain” approach to “illuminate the intertwined domestic and international story of how Japanese green tea became so prevalent in American cups” from the nineteenth century until the 1940s, when World War II interrupted supply chains and rendered Japanese commodities unpatriotic (4).Hellyer's book echoes the global contexts of recent commodity histories, simultaneously showing how the American Midwest became “the center of Japanese green tea consumption” as lower prices helped “democratize” the commodity and how increased agricultural production of exportable green tea influenced Japanese consumer tastes that now associate sencha (a loose-leaf form of green tea) with Japanese national identity.Around 1870, Japanese diplomatic officials noted a puzzling fad—Americans expected color-enhanced tea. A new, US-centric commodity arose in Nagasaki, where Chinese experts prepared Japanese green tea on an industrial scale to suit American tastes by pan-firing leaves and adding Prussian Blue coloring in a Sino-Japanese coproduction catering to American consumer aesthetics. New York tea retailers then marketed the “Japan Tea” brand. Chicago, a commercial hub with rail networks reaching both coasts, fashioned the Midwest into “America's definite ‘green tea country’ . . . a place where green tea became ‘democratized,’ within the reach of all social classes” (92).Hellyer intriguingly claims that “the making of Japan Tea into a successful brand on the US market provides one explanation for how a diffuse political polity . . . emerged to become a more unified Japanese nation” (89). He argues that the “Japan-US commodity chain . . . brought fresh employment opportunities and thus avenues for personal reinvention across Japanese society, helping salve the socioeconomic and political wounds of the war and the dislocations brought by Meiji government reforms” (54). The city of Sunpu, later known as Shizuoka, featured intensive tea cultivation by former samurai elites, who lost status amid the new Meiji regime's reforms but now gained a source of wealth. Local wealthy elites provided capital for local tea farms, preventing the growth of large-scale monopolies in tea production and allowing a strong, regional process of capital accumulation. In 1874, Japan's government extended bureaucratic support to expand tea globally; the Ministry of Home Affairs created an Industrial Promotion Bureau with a Tea Office to diversify tea exports, including black tea.Darker factors emerged to threaten Japanese tea's global expansion as Anglo-American rivalries grew in tea industries. Since the late nineteenth century, US newspaper advertisements had proliferated racist imagery of “dirty” East Asian “coolies,” with British tea plantations in India and Ceylon marketing wares emphasizing white superiority, like the Monsoon brand, produced by “civilized labor and intelligence,” and the Blue Cross brand, “carefully prepared under white supervision—[while] China and Japan teas are not” (126–27). Racialized discourse in advertisements attempted to dissuade white American middle-class consumers from consuming green tea and to switch to “civilized” black tea. By the 1920s, Japanese tea suffered multiple setbacks in the US market, including perceptions of a lower-quality product, while South Asian black teas made inroads with lobbies promoting cheaper India and Ceylon black teas. Its near death knell arrived with imperial Japan's 1941 attack on the United States and its colonies.Deeper analyses of fraught American relationships with East Asian immigrant groups, especially laborers from China and Japan, would have been welcome, along with descriptions emphasizing social class for Japanese immigrants, who initially worked in agricultural professions or gardening and later developed small businesses, including groceries importing tea. However, Green with Milk and Sugar is a well-researched, immensely captivating story of a now commonplace Japanese commodity with deep historical roots enthusiastically rediscovered by Americans. Over a roughly century-long transnational history, Hellyer concludes that the emergence of new sencha tea production and consumption patterns in Japan was “intimately connected to major developments both within Japan and in the American market” (198).",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article studies the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC) in Taiwan. It begins with the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction (JCRR), a US-funded agency championing plant breeding and land reform. Capitalizing on Japanese colonial legacy, a technocratic Chinese nationalism, and Cold War geopolitics, the JCRR boosted the productivity of rice while diversifying the agricultural economy through vegetable cultivation. The AVRDC, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the US government, was created in 1971 to bring this vision to Southeast Asia. The expulsion of Taiwan from the United Nations nonetheless threatened the center's survival. To carve out its sphere of influence, the AVRDC combined vegetable breeding programs with experiments on home gardening and small-scale agriculture, inserting itself into a bourgeoning sustainability discourse in the 1980s. The article argues that the center's ambiguous position within the international agricultural research network prompted it to adopt a “modest narrative” that celebrated not heroic figures but the collaborative endeavor of scientists sympathetic to farmers. However, the marginalization of agriculture and shifting identity politics in Taiwan made the center's achievement increasingly less relevant to its host country, thus complicating the significance of the AVRDC to the agricultural history of Taiwan.",

    "abstract": "Tracy Brynne Voyles has written an environmental and social history of Southern California's Salton Sea and its adjacent agricultural empire that contributes significantly to studies of “settler colonialism.” It is no secret that, throughout the American West, white settlers overwhelmed Indigenous peoples and their cultures, took their lands, introduced unfamiliar land uses, and, in the process, exploited Natives and other nonwhites while degrading the very environment they depended upon. In her recounting of the Salton Sea's origin, development, and past and present uses, Voyles convincingly establishes that social injustices based on racism, sexism, dispossession, and capitalism created momentous environmental degradation, turning on its head a common maxim that poverty and deprivation follow environmental ruin. In Voyles's interesting and well-written treatise, settler colonialism is a web of relationships bolstering white supremacy while simultaneously degrading the environment.The Settler Sea begins with a prehistory of the region and its Indigenous tribes, followed by a recounting of the sea's origin and subsequent development as an irrigation wastewater sink for California's Imperial and Coachella Valleys, the source of much of America's table vegetables. In less than a century, these valleys became home to white settlers and farmers, resort owners, military bombing ranges, defense contractors and others. Throughout the book, Voyles addresses the plight of Indigenous peoples. They were dispossessed of their land and consistently mistreated. Farmers also brought in other nonwhites to work the farms. They were treated no better. Cheap labor was the objective.What makes the Salton Sea unique is both its geologic setting and the sea's origin. The sea occupies a major geological depression, the Salton Sink, which has no external drainage. What flows in either remains or evaporates. The sea was created in 1905 when a canal to bring irrigation water from the Colorado River to dryland farms in the Salton Sink failed, thus allowing the Colorado River to flow uncontrolled into the sink for months. Voyles's chapter on this engineering debacle is riveting. Developers eventually reconstructed the canal, and Colorado River water was subsequently diverted for valley irrigation.Irrigation return flows from Imperial Valley farms have always drained to the Salton Sea. Existing as it does in a desert, high evaporation rates have gradually, inexorably, increased the concentration of salts, pesticides, and other synthetic contaminants found in the water. The lake has become saline. By the 1960s, researchers questioned whether humans should consume Salton Sea fish. And in the 1970s the New River, a tributary to the Salton Sea from the south, was named the “most polluted waterway in the United States” (248). Because of high evaporation rates native to deserts, maintaining the status quo will inevitably increase the concentrations in the sea. Voyles describes in detail the various sources of this pollution. The Salton Sea has become a repository for human, agricultural, and industrial waste; the sea's presence in the Salton Sink means these wastes are stagnant.In recent decades, some Colorado River water has been diverted to the San Diego area, reducing the amount that drains to the sea. Consequently, the sea has begun to shrink, exposing its lake bed to the wind and creating dust storms. These dust storms contain contaminants from the lake and continue to plague local inhabitants with health problems. Voyles details all of these occurrences, drawing upon numerous and wide-ranging sources. Whether focusing on the sea or Indigenous peoples and others affected by the sea's agricultural use, the story is not pretty.If Voyles's assessment has a weakness, it is the inference that all contaminants in the sea are toxic, including bacteria, heavy metals, 2,4-D, PCBs, TCE, and ammonium perchlorate (115, 238). They can, indeed, be toxic. But their presence does not mean certain death for life forms living in or near the sea, the reason being that they are not present in toxic concentrations. Throughout the United States' agricultural heartland, fertilizer byproducts and pesticides can be found in irrigation return flows and in underlying groundwaters. Typically, they are not present in toxic concentrations, and regulatory intervention is not required. While certainly undesirable, contaminants of one type or another are ubiquitous in surface and groundwaters, just not in toxic concentrations. Voyles is a historian, not a water quality specialist, and expecting a detailed description of this interplay of concentrations and toxicity would not be fair. Yet it would not have required a major addition to the text to address this important qualifying point. All the same, having read Voyles's contribution, I have no intention of ever swimming in the Salton Sea.",

    "abstract": "Red Harvests is a relatively thin book, but it is an important one for scholars interested in Cambodian genocide and genocide studies more broadly. It is also a useful resource for scholars interested in the broader historiography of agrarian transformations under revolutionary states and in the geographies of capitalism. Its focus is on the political economy of genocide within the framework of “state capitalism” defined as a “political-economic system of governance whereby a ruling party controls the state apparatus and in turn manages the means of production in order to appropriate surplus value” (x). More specifically, it attends to the agrarian state capitalism of Democratic Kampuchea under the stewardship of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), or the Pol Pot–led Khmer Rouge regime, and how the political economy of rice production for capital accumulation and state-led industrialization interfaced with structural mass violence and famine.Tyner develops his arguments over four chapters to provide reinterpretations of the Khmer Rouge revolution, the postrevolution (agrarian) political economy the CPK adopted, and the place of agriculture in the Cambodian genocide. He closely reads surviving documentary evidence (e.g., the CPK's four-year plan, meeting minutes, and official speeches) against the grain of Marxism and in conversation with the Cambodian genocide literature. The mix of theory and empirics—the reconstruction of Marxist theory using agrarian capitalism in the Global South and the distortion of capitalism in the name of socialism by the CPK—is the critical contribution of the book to our understanding of the Cambodian genocide.Chapter 1 draws on the traditional Marxist understanding of revolution to reconstruct the narrative of the Khmer Rouge revolution. Tyner argues that the Khmer Rouge revolution was an elite movement by an educated class, refuting the CPK's own claims. Chapter 2, based on the documentary evidence, aligns the postrevolution Democratic Kampuchea's agrarian political economy with the Non-Aligned Movement and Third World Developmentalism of postcolonial states and thus challenges a claim found in much of the literature that Democratic Kampuchea was an isolated state. Instead, Tyner argues, the CPK was actively engaged in diplomatic relations, international movements, and the global economy, but it carefully balanced external engagement and internal autonomy.Chapter 3 recasts the agrarian transformations pursued by the CPK as a form of violent dispossession and displacement of the entire population into forced-labor cooperatives. Building on Marx's theories of money and the production of absolute and relative surplus value, chapter 4 analyzes the internal contradiction of CPK's policies of currency abolishment, provision of food rations, and capital accumulation through rice export. Its central argument is that the contradiction of the CPK's public narrative with its material practices proved fatal to its stability amid famine and mass violence.I found Red Harvests to be novel in its critical reading of the empirical materials, its deep engagement with Marxist theories and classical agrarian studies, and, most importantly, its nuanced interpretations of the Cambodian genocide. The book provides the first monograph-length account of the Democratic Kampuchea that questions the CPK's Marxist credentials and reveals its capitalist nature—or, more accurately, the capitalist nature of the CPK's material practices. All four chapters develop different but related arguments to reposition the place of agriculture under the CPK relative to Marxism, capitalism, and genocide. Tyner is largely successful in this endeavor; through Marxist lenses, he convincingly reconstructs the CPK's agrarian transformations and the Democratic Kampuchea's historiography in juxtaposition with the geographies of global capitalism in the Third World.However, Red Harvests falls rather short of its main argument developed in chapter 4. The aggressive capital accumulation through rice production for export, the suspension of currency, and the substitution of money with food rations did lead to famine and violence, but these factors have little explanatory power for the direct brutal violence committed by CPK cadres. Tyner's interpretations of the CPK's four-year plan, for example, do not fully reflect what happened on the ground, which was a complicated mix of capitalism-inspired violence (starvation, disease, malnourishment, family separation) and direct brutality not clearly tied to the CPK's profit motivations, such as random murders, mass extermination, and the like. The more-than-economic accounts of the actual implementations of the CPK's elite-imposed policies, the role of power among local cadres, and the everyday inequalities that led to violence and execution are missing. I find that Alexander Hinton's Why Do They Kill? (2005) remains relevant and vital; accounts of mass violence based on radical ideology and ultranationalism hold true in Khmer Rouge–era Cambodia, including the multiple purges of suspected antirevolutionaries and ethnic minorities, especially the Cham (Muslim Cambodians) and Vietnamese. These caveats aside, Red Harvests adds important and novel explanations for this mass violence that the existing accounts, including Hinton's, have overlooked.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The organization of sweet potato research across global regions began in earnest in the 1980s. Leading international institutions, notably the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, recognized the potential for science-driven development of a “neglected” crop. Sweet potato was second only to potato in root crop cultivation worldwide and the top tuber in Asia yet had not been subject to the internationally coordinated research that its importance merited. This article explores how scientists involved in sweet potato research attempted to respond to the call for new international research and development efforts while avoiding the limitations of predecessor programs associated with the Green Revolution. It highlights the challenges inherent in this work by focusing on ambitions for—and challenges to—providing standardized information about samples of varieties used in research and entered into gene bank collections. As scientists and institutions grappled with critiques of the top-down model of development, many sought to address these through more inclusive research practices. As the article shows, accommodating diversity in crops and among cultivators and cultures entailed costs that ultimately limited the longevity and effectiveness of some enterprises that sought to maximize inclusivity.",

    "abstract": "Postbellum southern agriculture was one of the most studied topics in United States economic history during the 1970s and early 1980s, in part because of an interest in African American life after slavery and because of an interest in sharecropping and other tenancy arrangements. Those in? terests were complementary at first, but as cliometric research on the South after slavery unfolded, they became substitutes for each other.

The answer is implicit in the cliometric literature and explicit in economic history textbooks. As economic historians Jonathan Hughes and Louis P.

The first of these transformations has been a major expansion in the range and scope of the issues that constitute agricultural policy. Farm bills have become far more complex and detailed, and more issues that affect agriculture are now acted upon in legislation or regulations other than farm bills. The second transformation involves the internal rules of Congress, which has become a more open and less hierarchical gov? erning body.

    "abstract": "Federal Reclamation and the American West in the Twentieth Century looks at four phases in the history of the Bureau of Reclamation. The first phase lasted from the adop? tion ofthe Reclamation Act of 1902 into the 1930s. In those years, the bureau attempted to create small family farms by bringing to the desert lands of the West. That effort failed, in part because farming was becoming less attractive in the United States during the early decades of the 20th century, in part because irrigation was too expensive, and in part because the bureau made many mistakes in administering the 30 projects it created. A second phase of the bureau's life began in the 1930s, with the high dam era. From 1930 into the 1950s, the bureau's mission became inconsistent as it strived to serve a new constituency, city dwellers and industries on the Pacific Coast, at the same time it contin? ued to push the family farm. The bureau entered a third phase of life after World War II, when the power it generated became identified with winning the Cold War against the Soviet Union and agribusiness eclipsed the family farm in the West. Finally, once big dams began to look too expensive and like old technology, the bureau recreated itself into an agency which now claims to work in the interest of protecting the environment and serving as the West's water broker. The Bureau of Reclamation, which has done as much as any federal agency to build the modern American West, has shown an amazing ability to pursue inconsistent objectives and to recreate itself.

    "abstract": "This article surveys the ways that discrimination at the local, state, and national levels constrained minority farmers during the twentieth century. It considers the characteristics of small-scale farming that created liabilities for landowners regardless of race, including state and federal programs that favored commercial and agribusiness interests. In addition to economic challenges African American farmers had to negotiate racism in the Jim Crow South. The Texas Agricultural Extension Service, the state branch of the USDA's Extension Service, segregated in 1915. The Negro division gave black farmers access to information about USDA programs, but it emphasized their subordinate position relative to farmers. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not reverse decades of racial discrimination. Instead, USDA officials relied on federalism, a theory as old as the Constitution, to justify their tolerance of civil rights violations in Texas and elsewhere. Then, special legislation passed during the 1970s and 1980s did not realize its potential to serve ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged rural Texans. Discrimination based on race combined with a bias toward commercial production. This crippled most black farmers and led to their near extinction",

    "abstract": "This essay considers the role of slavery in American agricultural history by examining the impact of political decisions during the period when the boundary between free and slave states was not yet settled. This boundary was not dictated by geographic imperatives. In Kentucky, an early beach-head in the bluegrass district allowed slavery to become firmly entrenched, even in a state where the majority of farmers held no slaves. On the other hand, slavery was vigorously debated in all of the Northwest territories-losing a close vote in Illinois as late as 1824. The essay argues that American agricultural history would have been very different had these votes tipped the other way. Evidence from three outlying slave regions-the Kentucky bluegrass, Missouri's Little Dixie, and the wheat belt of Virginia-shows that slavery could adapt readily to crops and regions commony considered ideal for family farms, so ong as land values were sufficiently high. Drawing on census samples collected by James Irwin, the essay argues that the peculiar affinity between slavery and wheat-growing in Virginia can best be explained by property rights. Specifically, control over a captive labor force allowed slaveowners to expand wheat acreage without fear of the harvest peak",

In search of ways for cotton farmers to diversify, Vance noted that whether equitable or not, a system of division oftheproduct by shares between landlord and tenant has been worked out by custom and lawfor cotton. Indeed, there was a credit system in place that facilitated cotton production, a system that dated back to Reconstruction. Lamenting that no generally accepted system ofshare cropping has been worked out for more complex forms of farming, Vance could notforesee that soon furnishing merchants would refashion the crop lien to facilitate poultry production. For some time, politicians, Vance, and a host of rural reformers waged an unsuccessful war against the crop lien, and its close relatives sharecropping and tenancy, which they considered to be the basis of southern problems. The poultry industry?today the model for contract farming and a multi-million-dollar business?grew out of the crop lien system, an institution thought to be the root of southern poverty.1",

    "abstract": "This essay develops an American approach to the rise of the English Atlantic during the seventeenth century. It argues that productivity gains in plantation agriculture fueled an extraordinary expansion of commerce as planters raising tobacco, sugar, and rice improved their efficiency and were able to lower prices. Lower prices made the products of American plantations affordable to an ever-growing number of European consumers. The increased consumption fueled the expansion of the American plantation colonies, transformed the Atlantic into an English inland sea, and led to the creation of the first British Empire; one of the great commercial successes of the Early Modern Era. The essay also interrogates the concept of productivity gains in a slave economy, arguing that what are often interpreted as improvements in productivity were in fact increases in labor inputs as planters squeezed slaves harder. This raises the question, then, of whether productivity gains (or increased labor inputs) signal that planters were forward-looking entrepreneurs or backward seigneurs?",

    "abstract": "The Green Revolution of the 1960s brought about a dramatic rise in global crop yields.But, as most observers acknowledge, this has come at a considerable cost to biodiversity.Plant breeding, synthetic fertilizers, and mechanization steadily narrowed the number of crop varieties commercially available to farmers and promoted fencerow-to-fencerow monocultures.Many historians trace the origins of this style of industrialized agriculture to the last great plow-up of the Great Plains in the 1920s.In the literature, farms in the plains are often described metaphorically as wheat factories, degrading successive landscapes.While in many ways these farms were a departure from earlier forms of husbandry in the American experience, monocultures were quite rare during the early transformation of the plains.Analysis of a large representative sample, based on manuscript agricultural censuses and involving twenty-five townships across the state of Kansas, demonstrates that diverse production reached even the most challenging of plains landscapes.Few modern natural disasters have cemented in the historical imagination the association between human settlement and environmental degradation like the Dust Bowl.Dorothea Lange's iconic photographs of migrants fleeing the plains are now part of the visual lexicon of the twentieth century (Figure 1).The 1930s drought and depression overturned the old story of national progress, replacing it with a narrative of misuse, collapse, and decline in the Great Plains.But that story of environmental degradation has become far too linear and simplistic.It rests, in particular, on a perception of historical farm practice that requires closer scrutiny.The standard narrative describes a wave of economic change in the early twentieth century that rapidly industrialized farm methods.One consequence, recognized by both critics and supporters of free settlement, was that markets and technology drove farmers to till marginal land beyond sustainable limits.Another purported outcome was that massive new farm machinery homogenized landscapes, replacing diverse native grasslands with fencerow-tofencerow monocultures.However, closer to the ground the story remains more complex.Some farming areas in the Great Plains became increasingly monocultural, but a great many did not.An extensive and detailed reconstruction of farm practice shows that diverse cropping was common, persistent, and that it stretched into the heart of the semi-arid Dust Bowl. 1 Monoculture is an important pillar in the story of environmental mismanagement.It is part of a long tradition in historical writing that views soil exhaustion as a basic American condition.With unbroken land available further west, American farmers could avoid the consequences of their own mismanagement by moving to the frontier.Although many historians have questioned the logic of this land ethic-suggesting in detailed local studies that a variety of farm practices aimed at community permanence-they have not overcome the general 8 Geoff Cunfer,",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, agriculture has assumed an elevated role in world diplomacy due to pressing issues like international poverty relief, changing environmental conditions, farm trade imbalances, rising food prices, and the diversion of crops into bio-fuel production. Consequently, agricultural interests and production have become increasingly entwined with the politics of national protectionism and identity, domestic security, and preservation of trading advantage in developed and developing countries alike. This study examines the current impasse in world agricultural negotiations as an outgrowth of US foreign aid and trade policymaking as it evolved during the Cold War. In particular, it chronicles the historic shift in US foreign policy away from \"give-away\" food aid and surplus sales and toward the championing of global agricultural redevelopment under such programs as the Marshall Plan and PL 480, the Food for Peace program. As more a plowshare than a sword, the American Cold War push for worldwide agricultural modernization led many countries to experience new levels of food self-efficiency and export capabilities. Along with production parity, however, has come escalating levels of trade competition and national protectionism, which challenges again the achievement of world agricultural stability and prosperity.",

    "abstract": "Advertisements for internal combustion engines, commonly called gas engines, appeared regularly in farm magazines in the mid-1890s. By the century’s turn, one hundred US companies produced stationary or portable gas engines for farmers. Fifteen years later, the number of gas engines on farms had exploded to one million. The skills gained by hundreds of thousands of farmers with these engines facilitated the rapid adoption of the automobile on farms and the more gradual adoption of the tractor. Yet the use of such engines has received scant attention. This paper examines the farm demand for stationary power and compares alternative power sources in 1895. It traces the development of the market for farm gas engines and its interaction with the markets for automobiles and tractors. It then presents evidence from magazines to show how farmers became engine mechanics and facilitated the adoption of automobiles and tractors across ruralAmerica.",

    "abstract": "Over the past three decades, scholars have delved deeply into the post–Civil War industrialization of Appalachia. Although often they have identified agricultural conditions in the mountains as a major factor shaping the emergence of industry in the region, they have paid less attention to the agricultural history of the area. As a result, much about agricultural choices and rural life in the region remains unexplored, and our understanding remains incomplete. The story of bright tobacco in southern Appalachia serves as a reminder that some Appalachian farmers, rather than merely subsistence-oriented mountain folk, participated in agricultural trends and a network of market connections common to the South and the nation in the late nineteenth century. Tobacco culture bound them to the capital resources, marketing operations, and consumer goods of urban centers, even as the profits reaped from tobacco fueled local, urban-led campaigns for industrial development and resource extraction that accompanied the creation of an Appalachian stereotype mocking rural mountain people.",

In the process, it makes two additional points: grasses are historically important, and agricultural history is a site uniquely disposed to uniting environmental history with the history of science.",

    "abstract": "This book is a testament to the importance of integrating the history of fisheries and marine ecosystems into analyses of food industries and agricultural production. It blurs the lines between terrestrial and marine industries to create a comprehensive account of the development of Peruvian and Chilean fisheries in the context of the expansion of global food production in the second half of the twentieth century. Moreover, Kristin A. Wintersteen stresses the importance of environmental changes in her historical analysis of agricultural products. In so doing, she not only makes the Humboldt Current environment the protagonist of the historical analysis but also explores the challenges posed by El Niño's climatic phenomena and its impact on local and global economic, social, and political systems. This book is therefore crucial for agricultural historians as well as for ocean historians, Latin American scholars, and for the environmental humanities more broadly.The Fishmeal Revolution encompasses six chapters that examine the different environmental and historical processes that have shaped the industrialization of the Southeast Pacific. In chapter 1, Wintersteen describes the Humboldt Current environment and presents a carefully drawn picture of the human history of this ecoregion, delving into deep geological and human time. She highlights the knowledge created by Indigenous societies in the pre-Columbian era and the production of colonial and postcolonial natural histories. Chapter 2 focuses on the commodification of marine ecosystems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It examines the industrialization of products like fishmeal and fish oil in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, which fueled the fertilizer and swine- and poultry-production industries. Notably, this chapter entangles the modernization experiences of fisheries in the United States, Germany, and Japan, making it an interesting case study for global history methodology.Chapter 3 explores the political discourses surrounding fishery development in Peru and Chile in the mid-twentieth century. It focuses on the tensions between national and international actors who drift between welfare goals and profit-seeking initiatives. It also stresses the technological and infrastructural challenges to the industrialization of the Southeast Pacific. Chapter 4 is narrower in scope, examining the economic, scientific, and social processes linked to fishmeal production in the Peruvian locality of Chimbote during the industrial boom from 1957 and 1972. The last two chapters focus on the different responses developed by Peruvian and Chilean industries to the environmental challenges posed by El Niño and its impact on this vulnerable ecoregion. Specifically, chapter 5 examines the Peruvian case from the country's industrial dominance in the 1960s to the fisheries' collapse in 1972, stressing the global repercussions of these events. Finally, chapter 6 examines Chilean responses to the 1972 El Niño crisis, highlighting the adaptations and innovations created by local industry in the ensuing decades. Importantly, this chapter reflects on the ways in which cycles of abundance and decline have shaped human fishing activity, industrial growth, and their relation to the climatic variability of marine ecosystems.Methodologically, this book represents an excellent contribution to historiography by entangling different geographical scales, as it weaves together international and national policies and institutions, regional environments, and local communities. Moreover, Wintersteen devotes significant attention to the concept of translocalism, which she utilizes to underscore the impacts and links of the industrialization of the Humboldt Current environment in different places and societies. In so doing, she broadens the existing historiography of fisheries, developing planetary systemic thinking about human relations with marine environments.This book does fail to fully grasp the inequalities among actors from the Global North and Global South. For example, more could have been done to portray the asymmetries in power relations during the Cold War period. Similarly, Wintersteen could have paid more attention to the political and economic discourses that framed the development of the South American fishmeal industries. In particular, there is little mention of the developmentalist discourses of the mid-twentieth century that created the political framework that enabled the development of national industries and the extractivist agenda that empowered neoliberal reforms in Chile in the 1980s and Peru in the 1990s. By framing the analysis using these discourses, more agency could have been given to national actors in a historical context of increasing awareness of global inequalities between the northern and southern hemispheres and clashes between local and transnational agents.All in all, these shortcomings are minor in comparison with the remarkable contributions of this research to the environmental history of this region and the global food revolution of the twentieth century. Wintersteen makes a compelling intellectual case that assesses the entanglements of the maritime and terrestrial resources in our food chain. Moreover, the historical overview that this study offers reminds us of the vulnerability of global food systems to climatic fluctuations, creating a nuanced analysis of the ways in which people, knowledge, institutions, and national and international policies interact with dynamic environments.",

The case oficeberg lettuce shows that the industrialization of agriculture was largely idiosyncratic, and the level of industrialization possible for any specific crop varied, depending equally on the nature of the commodity and the willingness of consumers to purchase it. The emergence of lettuce cultivation in the Salinas Valley during the inter-war period highlights how early growers harnessed organizational techniques, transportation infrastructures, and technological and scientific knowledge to transcend both the ephemeral nature of lettuce and consumer taste. Yet, these very same factors also limited the success of valley growers after World War II, despite the best efforts of growers and agricultural researchers to improve lettuce quality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the Shelterbelt Project of the 1930s, foresters trained and instilled with Progressive-era values confronted an uncooperative public and nature on the Great Plains. Foresters assumed planting trees in shelterbelts was primarily a scientific and technical task. However, they quickly compromised technical guidelines in the face of bureaucratic pressure and local desire. Foresters assumed compromise undermined technical success, but this was too simple an explanation. In some cases, such as the overuse of cottonwood, public pressure undermined long-term success, but in other cases, such as the narrowing of belt width, public pressure improved long-term prospects. Public unwillingness to engage in drawn-out and uncertain solutions and a bureaucratic refusal to open up the planning process consistently undermined the overall success of the project. Conservation planning in a democratic state is inherently multifaceted: political and social realities demand equal billing with technical ones, and natural and scientific uncertainties require that conservation planning be a process, rather than an immediate solution.",

These, combined with advice in coeval treatises on agricultural management, demonstrate how European agroecosystems linked terrestrial and aquatic operations to pursue a net energy gain in their outputs. Critical reading of three distinct bodies of sources: early modern European agricultural manuals, literature on fish culture compiled in western Latin Christendom, and managerial records of fourteenth-through seventeenth-century fish culture enterprises establishes two new understandings. First, land managers took self-conscious measures to integrate their arable and pond cultures with the aim of conserving and recycling essential nutrients. Second, agricultural handbooks from this period both reflected practices of illiterate peasant farmers (and hence their traditional ecological knowledge) and informed certain managerial decisions.",

    "abstract": "This essay spotlights the development of Ontario, California, in the last decades of the nineteenth century. It demonstrates that many agricultural communities in California, particularly so-called agricultural colonies, represent a unique rural suburban type labeled here as \"agriburbs.\" Agriburbs, such as Ontario, were communities consciously planned, developed, and promoted based on the drive for profit in emerging agricultural markets. Advertised as the perfect mix of rural and urban, they promised a superior middle-class lifestyle. On the one hand, agriburbs evoked the myths of agrarian security and virtue, a life on a farm in an environment that was good for both soil and soul. On the other hand, agriburbs were ideally urbane but not urban because of their many amenities that represented cultural symbols of modernity, refinement, and progress. An understanding of California's agriburbs deepens an appreciation for both the growth and development of California at the turn of the twentieth century and the diversity of suburban types across the American landscape.",

As reconstructed here, Puerto Rico's social and economic structure did change after the American invasion. However, a closer look at the data reveals that, contrary to the generally accepted conclusions, land tenure did not become concentrated in fewer hands. Puerto Rico did experience profound changes with the rapid growth of US agribusiness and the penetration of American capital. In the process of arriving on the island, these two interests found a land tenure system in the firm control of local farmers (small, medium, and large). The American invasion and subsequent incorporation of the island into the American economic/political system as a non-incorporated territory provided the conditions for the numerical increase of farms and farmers in the island during the first three decades of the twentieth century.",

    "abstract": "“Reaping the Judenfrage” integrates the vast body of literature on the nineteenth-century “Jewish question” with the long-forgotten “artificial wine question” of the same period. German and Austrian Jews played pivotal roles in the wine trade, often as merchants connecting winegrowers to distant consumers. As new technologies, modern commercial strategies, and the burgeoning field of enology revolutionized the Central European wine trade, German and Austrian winegrowers struggled to remain competitive. Political parties and other pressure groups portrayed the Jewish wine merchant as the embodiment of this dislocation. In doing so, the “artificial wine question,” the single-most important debate to emerge from the trade’s crisis, was explicitly connected to the by-then mainstreamed “Jewish question.” Consequently, discussions of “natural” and “artificial” as they related to wine—so influential for later discursive developments in the broader food trades—were, from their birth, marked by the overlapping ideologies of anti-Semitism and anti-capitalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract \"African American Farmers and Land Loss in Texas,\" surveys the ways that discrimination at the local, state, and national levels constrained minority farmers during the twentieth century. It considers the characteristics of small-scale farming that created liabilities for landowners regardless of race, including state and federal programs that favored commercial and agribusiness interests. In addition to economic challenges African American farmers had to negotiate racism in the Jim Crow South. The Texas Agricultural Extension Service, the state branch of the USDA’s Extension Service, segregated in 1915. The \"Negro\" division gave black farmers access to information about USDA programs, but it emphasized their subordinate position relative to white farmers. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not reverse decades of racial discrimination. Instead, USDA officials relied on federalism, a theory as old as the Constitution, to justify their tolerance of civil rights violations in Texas and elsewhere. Then, special needs legislation passed during the 1970s and 1980s did not realize its potential to serve ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged rural Texans. Discrimination based on race combined with a bias toward commercial production. This crippled most black farmers and led to their near extinction.",

    "abstract": "Post and rail fences had a relatively minor role in England in the eighteenth century, primarily to protect young hedges. However, they rapidly became the most advanced form of fences in the new Australian colonies founded in 1788 and later. The key feature is that thinned tenons on the ends ofrectangular split rails ftt closely into mortises cut in the rectangular split posts. Post and rail fences were widespread but never common because ofthe high cost, lack of secure land tenure, and ubiquitous use of shepherds to guard against predatory dingoes. With the introduction of cheap iron wire in the mid-1850s, farmers and pastoralists gained many advantages from fencing their bound? aries and paddocks. By 1900 post and rail fences were obsolete technologically, although farmers built decreasing numbers up to the 1960s. More re? cently, many people are relocating old post and rail fences onto peri-urban subdivisions and erecting new ones to create a rustic appearance. Post and rail fence use in advertisements and other media shows that they have achieved a new status as an icon of rural Australia.",

    "abstract": "Accompanying the expansion of modern beef production in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were technologies and methods that proponents assumed were applicable to all ecosystems. successes in Europe, the United States, and Argentina convinced ranchers, investors, and animal scientists that these could be applied in the tropical Americas with ease. This assumption contributed to a wave of foreign ranching investment in semi-tropical Mato Grosso, Brazil, beginning in the early twentieth century. However, such a view failed to consider the specific characteristics of such environments and led to difficulties for several ventures and a re-evaluation of the relationship between ecosystems and the type of ranching appropriate to them. Ultimately, local Brazilian practice and experimentation proved more successful in tropical and semi-tropical Brazil, forcing foreign ranching concerns to adapt their techniques. Following the logic of earlier decades, more recently cattle-raising practices developed in Mato Grosso and similar regions have been applied in the tropical Amazon, resulting in widespread ecological devastation. The uneven experiences of foreign entrepreneurs in Mato Grosso offer valuable lessons for understanding the application of modernization technologies to diverse ecosystems; such knowledge can lead to a more sustainable approach to meat production.",

Drawing on a broad range of archival records, this paper explores the three main factors that encouraged the Canadian government in this course: growing doubts about the wisdom of isolating communist China; mounting anger at Washington, DC's use of subsidized wheat sales to capture traditional Canadian markets; and a surging sense of Canadian nationalism that sought a distinct role for Canada on the world stage. Clearly, as was so often the case in postwar Canadian foreign economic policy, a narrowly defined national interest easily trumped the ideological pressures of western solidarity.",

    "abstract": "This group of essays recognizes the sesquicentennial of the United States Department of Agriculture. The USDA was created in 1862, part of a body of legislation that the Union was able to enact once free from the constraints of the southern states. The legislation—the Morrill Land Grant Act, establishing federally supported higher education; the Homestead Act, allowing citizens to claim federal land in the American West; and the Pacific Railway Act, allotting federal land to private companies to capitalize railroad construction—substantially extended the reach of the federal government. Arguably, of all the 1862 legislation, the creation of the USDA has had the greatest impact on the lives of American citizens and on people around the world. With a wide mandate ranging from food stamps to foreign diplomacy, from tourism to grain surpluses, the USDA has both mirrored and influenced the good and bad of American culture. These five idiosyncratic essays address some of the myriad aspects of the USDA, reflecting on its history, writ large; its management of the nation’s forests; its race relations; its efforts to conserve America’s privately held lands; and its sometimes contradictory global initiatives. Together they comprise a varied set of lenses on this hugely influential bureaucracy.",

The episode, often dismissed as mass hysteria or sensationalized reporting, demonstrates the growing dissatisfaction of many ranchers concerning government intrusiveness and restrictive policies. These frustrations found a release in response to the mutilation phenomenon during which ranchers vented their anger by taking direct aim at the federal government. The turbulent economic conditions of the period paired with government interference in the cattle industry helped sustain the mutilation phenomenon as ranchers projected their fears and insecurities through the bizarre episode. The hostility ranchers showed toward the federal government during the mutilation scare presaged and helped provide the impetus for events such as the Sagebrush Rebellion. The mutilation phenomenon also underscores the pronounced effects of the libertarian movement of the 1960s that gave rise to the New Right and gained adherents across the West and Midwest.",

Scientific beekeeping focused on improvement, which, in turn, depended on the dissemination of ideas and practices. This analysis, therefore, encompasses the mentalities and tactics of popularizers. The article also identifies two neglected concepts in the popularization campaign. First, popularizers saw scientific beekeeping as a way to end the tradition of killing the bees in order to safely harvest. Second, they sought to promote a rural industry for the economic welfare of the nation. The case study of Exeter's Western Apiarian Society reveals precisely how popularization functioned in reality. The result is a more thorough history of scientific beekeeping and how the rhetoric of improvement related to the culture of practice.",

    "abstract": "The Commission on Country Life established by Theodore Roosevelt submitted its report in January 1909. Its vision of a country life that could be as economically viable and genuinely fulfilling as an urban alternative is still relevant. In fact, as twenty-first-century rural communities seek to foster democratic participation while dealing with issues of agricultural sustainability and ecological realities, the commission’s recommendations have an almost prophetic cogency. Yet the continuing value of the report does not mean its limitations should go unexamined. This paper reviews the commission’s findings and recommendations to argue that its gender assumptions had specific outcomes for rural women. On the one hand, they influenced the gendered structure of the nationalized farm extension program established in 1914. On the other, they provoked a reaction that was a catalyst for rural women to enter directly into an ongoing debate about their roles and circumstances.",

    "abstract": "Before the Revolution, colonial American consumers reconstituted the English apple orchard. Unremarkable random seedling apples and high flavored English cider fruits were devalued. Late colonial consumers selected a range of sweeter, more versatile apples for fresh use and culinary preparations, others for drying, and many winter keepers for long-term storage. These trees were supplied by distinctive, horticulturally trained farmers who produced grafted trees as part of their mixed crop output. Demand for this first catalog of American apple trees exploded in the Ohio Valley, where surging farm establishment fueled commercial agricultural enterprises. By 1800 pioneer artisan horticulturists were selling America's favorite cultivated apple tree varieties to frontier farmers while mythologized peddlers of unimproved, random seedlings contributed only marginally. By 1820 craft nurserymen marketed tens of thousands of grafted apple trees annually and were among the most commercially oriented farmers in the Old Northwest.",

    "abstract": "The Georgia peach boom around the turn of the twentieth century was often hailed as a successful experiment in diversification. Peach growers, the story went, threw off the tyranny of King Cotton by pledging their allegiance to the \"Queen of Fruits.\" This portrayal is partly true; unlike other proposed alternatives to cotton, peaches flourished in many places. But the history of the \"labor problem\" in the Georgia peach belt makes it clear that peach production depended on the cotton economy. Peaches required large amounts of labor only at harvest time, which came during a lull in the cotton season. Thus, for many years, growers found a ready labor supply in a rural population otherwise at loose ends. As this population relocated to cities, and as cotton farmers mechanized their operations, peach growers turned increasingly to the federal government to help shore up their workforces.",

Critical reading of three distinct bodies of sources: early modern European agricultural manuals, literature on fish culture compiled in western Latin Christendom, and managerial records of fourteenth-through seventeenth-century fish culture enterprises establishes two new understandings. First, land manages took self-conscious measures to integrate their arable and pond cultures with the aim of conserving and recycling essential nutrients. Second, agricultural handbooks from this period both reflected traditional practices of illiterate peasant farmers (and hence their \"traditional ecological knowledge\") and informed certain managerial decisions.",

Public complaints about moor smoke’s threats began in the eighteenth century and peaked after the German Empire’s unification in 1871. By that time, most agronomists contended that the larger threat was the “backward” practice of moor burning itself, which they blamed for the region’s environmental devastation and dire poverty. The substitution of German raised bog cultivation, or Hochmoorkultur, for moor burning was nonetheless slow. This did not, however, reflect a failure of state authority. Rather, state officials’ close collaboration with local agricultural experts and social reformers bolstered the recognition that there would be no instant remedies and that a ban would be counterproductive. Instead, regulations were introduced to make the practice safer and less “arbitrary” until it was outlawed in the 1930s.",

    "abstract": "When human numbers are the criteria, Brazil is the seventh-largest nation. But it would arguably be the world's most populous polity if we were to include nonhuman creatures in our official counts. With habitats spanning continental tropical forests, open highlands, and subtropical grasslands, Brazil is biodiverse and bio-profuse. Significantly, for five centuries chroniclers, travelers, and scientists placed Brazil's animal life very much at the center of their attentions. Historians, on the other hand, have shown only a passing interest.Ana Lucia Camphora characterizes Animals and Society in Brazil as a “partial survey” of historical work on Brazil's nonhuman creatures from 1500 to 1900 (145). The book reminds us of the unambiguous visibility of animals to past observers and highlights the work of recent scholars. In fact, as the author's assessment reveals, Brazil's historians made a brief foray into animal studies in the middle of the twentieth century, including Sergio Buarque de Holanda, who first saw animals as agents in both facilitating and thwarting colonization, and Myriam Ellis, who meticulously reconstructed Brazil's colonial shore-whaling industry. But only in the last decade has interest in nonhuman actors returned.The book progresses by theme. Early chapters examine colonial nature as utility and commodity. Colonists asked few questions of nature beyond what posed a threat, what could be eaten, and what could be exported. While we cannot number the creatures exported from Brazil's shores, every year ships carried away parrots, monkeys, sloths, insects, butterflies, and reptiles, dead and alive, to delight European consumers and satisfy collectors. For living specimens, mortality during the Atlantic passage was appalling.One chapter considers the animal's place in human health and sickness, primarily the knowledge inherited from Indigenous peoples of the value of animal flesh, organs, bones, and excrement to cure human ailments. Camphora also explores the culture of the hunt, recognizing hunger for flesh as one of the traits that united Europeans, Indians, and Africans in a common pursuit of game. Here, too, the Indigenous made the most significant contribution in names, skill, and ecological knowledge, and Brazil's abundance of mammals, birds, fish, and shellfish contributed substantially to the success of humans, many of whom—Native, colonist, and enslaved—lived lives more akin to hunters and gatherers than settled agriculturalists. The author offers a brief assessment of Brazil's whaling industry, sustained for three centuries under a royal monopoly but destroyed by free-trading American whalers who decimated southern right whale populations in a matter of decades after 1801.Portmanteau biota, particularly cattle, horses, and mules, are addressed in the final chapters. Camphora notes animal centrality in the production of various aspects of Brazilian culture and in shaping social relations. Equestrianism and ranching formed conspicuous elements of both elite and plebeian identities. The book makes striking comparisons between beasts of burden and human slaves, both of whom were conditioned and coerced to labor with intimidation and violence. Working side by side with animals, slaves were similarly chained, yoked, branded, and whipped. In fact, many of the implements used to subjugate humans had similar designs and the exact names of those used on animals. The final chapter concludes with a description of the regrettable waste of animal flesh in rural areas and the unsanitary conditions of urban slaughterhouses.Animals and Society in Brazil introduces a broad set of themes and, hence, makes a suitable first introduction to the possibilities of the field. Richly illustrated with period drawings and interspersed with long quotes from early observers, it underscores the potential of the primary source base. Sometimes the author digresses on purely human affairs in long asides that were not part of the original Portuguese edition but were added to meet the needs of readers unfamiliar with Brazil's history. These supplements interspersed among the book's attempts to cover so many topics through four centuries in just 150 pages can make the content on animals feel hurried. Few historical arguments are developed, and little in the way of synthesis is offered. The author uses ethnographic projection to plausibly characterize past Indigenous attitudes toward animal life, but the use of romantic nineteenth-century literature to do the same is less successful.Reflecting the state of much of the current field, the book favors animals that were useful to or in some relationship with humans. More research examining wild animals, such as José Luiz Andrade Franco's work on jaguars and Diogo de Carvalho Cabral's investigations of leaf-cutter ants, might have enriched the book. Indeed, the literature persists in presenting animals as crude calories, units of labor, human amusements, and cultural discourses, creditable topics that still need more work, but Camphora's survey reveals how much has yet to be said about agents worthy of more impartial considerations, an emphatic condemnation of what the author calls an ongoing “uncomfortable silence” (1).",

    "abstract": "The search for an ancient society that approached a sustainable balance with the environment must inevitably lead the environmental historian to Egypt. The Egyptians were in charge of their own government and able to set their own environmental policies from before 3000 B.C. to after 1000 B.C. No other ancient civilization lasted so long, while maintaining a stable pattern in its economy, government, religion, and ecological viewpoints and techniques. Many historians of Egypt remark upon the stability of Egyptian culture in a pejorative tone, attributing a lack of change to traditionalism and absence of creative thought, as if stability were only stagnation. But it will be suggested here that the stability of Egyptian civilization was the result of the sustainability of Egypt's ecological relationships. In his book, Early Hydraulic Civilization in Egypt, Karl Butzer remarked with great insight, It has become difficult to ignore the possibility that major segments of ancient Egyptian history may be unintelligible without recourse to an ecological perspective.1 His advice should be followed by anyone who seeks understanding of ancient Egypt. Butzer also remarked that the history of flood-plain civilization in the Nile Valley offers a test case of human-land relationships.2 But a further observation can be made: The ecological attitudes and practices of the Egyptians were rooted in a world view that affirmed the sacred values of all nature, and of land in particular. Egypt, although one of the first societies to attain civilization in the sense of developing cities, remained basically agrarian rather than urban. As Adolf Erman said, Agriculture is the foundation of Egyptian civiliza-",

    "abstract": "Betwwen 1895 and 1920 technological, economic, demographic, and cultural changes transformed American rural life. This article argues that historians should not take agricultural newspapers as is and assume that they expressed the framer's point of view. Because most of the publishers and editors of farm newspapers lived in cities and were influenced by progressive reformers, farm newspapers often reflected urban reform ideas. At the same time, farm newspapers provided space for opposing viewpoints by publishing letters to the editor. The coverage of agricultural education and rural school consolidation in four midwestern farm newspapers provides an illustrative case study of this interaction. While publishers and editors promoted reformers' recommendations, many farmers did not agree with or follow their advice. As a result, farm newspapers are better seen not as expressing the ideas of farmers, but providing a forum for reformers and farmers to debate proposed changes to country life",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is widely accepted that, in today’s developed countries, \"rural\" no longer equals \"agricultural.\" However, few historical studies of modern occupational change in the countryside are available, especially for continental Europe. The transformation of rural Spain in the twentieth century is a case study in this broader history, reflecting upon the causes and implications of different paths of rural change. The decline of agriculture in the economy of rural Spain occurred mostly during the second half of the twentieth century and was closely related to out-migration and depopulation. Only some rural areas in the country’s more dynamic regions witnessed simultaneous occupational change and population growth. Most rural communities, on the contrary, had to face the erosive effect of depopulation on their social fabric.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the links between market-oriented activities and subsistence production among peasant farmers in the Thyolo and Mzimba districts in Malawi from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s. The two districts were chosen because of their differences in terms of land-labor ratios, quality of soils, and structure of market engagement. Exploring the different paths of agrarian change in these two districts demonstrates that they were dependent on the structure of market engagement and its effects on the supply and flexibility of labor. African agricultural history is best understood when agricultural systems are viewed in connection to the overall economic activities of rural households. More simply put, the dynamics of agrarian change in rural Africa cannot be understood without linking such changes to the wider economy and their impact on local labor processes.",

    "abstract": "In Southern California, regional and national myths of agrarian life as pastoral became entwined with paternalistic policy and racialized visions of the Mexican laborer. Re-worked in the context of the New Deal and increasing strike activity across California after 1928, these rural myths and policies shaped plans for the resettlement of Mexican-American workers in self-sustaining villages within Los Angeles County. Under the direction of government officials, reformers, and employers, these plans articulated diverse ideologies and agendas: the New Dealer's commitment to reform and rehabilitation through planning and paternalism, and the employer's drive to segregate and racialize labor under a pastoral ideal. Yet the village schemes foundered; weakened by employers' lack of commitment to worker welfare and fears of rural sedition, by the inconsistencies of the New Deal rehabilitation policy, and by an inability to manipulate the realities of agribusiness. This failure bore testimony to the mythic nature of an agrarian tradition in California.",

    "abstract": "During the Shelterbelt Project of the 1930s, foresters trained and instilled with Progressive-era values confronted an uncooperative public and nature on the Great Plains. Foresters assumed planting trees in shelterbelts was primarily a scientific and technical task. However, they quickly compro mised technical guidelines in the face of bureaucratic pressure and local desire. Foresters assumed compromise undermined technical success, but this was too simple an explanation. In some cases, such as the overuse of cottonwood, public pressure undermined long-term success, but in other cases, such as the narrowing of belt width, public pressure improved long term prospects. Public unwillingness to engage in drawn-out and uncertain solutions and a bureaucratic refusal to open up the planning process con sistently undermined the overall success of the project. Conservation plan ning in a democratic state is inherently multifaceted: political and social realities demand equal billing with technical ones, and natural and scientific uncertainties require that conservation planning be a process, rather than an immediate solution. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S FIRST major experiments in cooperative conservation began during the early years of the Dust Bowl. In 1933 the newly elected president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, set about searching for solutions-or at least palliatives-to the growing economic and envi ronmental disaster on the Great Plains. Typically, President Roosevelt encouraged a multitude of competing plans, including new agencies like the Soil Conservation Service and Agricultural Adjustment Administra tion, and new projects within old agencies like the Shelterbelt Project of the Forest Service.

    "abstract": "Farmers and planters in the antebellum South held large tracts of unimproved land because they practiced shifting cultivation. Southern cultivators burned tracts of forest growth to quickly release nutrients into the soil. After five or six years, when the soil had been depleted, the old field was abandoned for as long as twenty years. Environmental factors such as poor soils, rugged topography, and livestock diseases accounted for the persistence of this practice, more so than slavery or the availability of western lands. Shifting cultivation slowly declined in the postbellum era, but southern farmers continued to improve a far smaller percentage of their land well into the twentieth century.",

    "abstract": "Recently, agriculture has assumed an elevated role in world diplomacy due to pressing issues like international poverty relief, changing environmental conditions, farm trade imbalances, rising food prices, and the diversion of crops into bio-fuel production. Consequently, agricultural interests and production have become increasingly entwined with the politics of national protectionism and identity, domestic security, and the preservation of trading advantage in developed and developing countries alike. This study examines the current impasse in world agricultural negotiations as an outgrowth of US foreign aid and trade policymaking as it evolved during the Cold War. In particular, it chronicles the historic shift in US foreign policy away from \"give-away\" food aid and surplus sales and toward the championing of global agricultural redevelopment under such programs as the Marshall Plan and PL 480, the Food for Peace program. As more a plowshare than a sword, the American Cold War push for worldwide agricultural modernization led many countries to experience new levels of food self-efficiency and export capabilities. Along with production parity, however, has come escalating levels of trade competition and national protectionism, which challenges again the achievement of world agricultural stability and prosperity.",

    "abstract": "Having been evicted from their homes because of incentives created by the New Deal's AGricultural ADjustment Act, sharecroppers in Arkansas formed the biracial Southern Tenant Farmers' Union (STFU) in 1934. Led by socialists and radicals, the organization ultimately claimed upward of thirty thousand members and constituted an assault on the social, economic, and racial status quo of the South. Historians have celebrated the STFU, especially its commitment to biracial cooperation and equality. This article digs beneath this carefully constructed image of the union to scrutinize the internal dynamics of the movement. It revises a number of interpretations surrounding the STFU. Although the greatest obstacles to the union's success were external, it also faced internal divisions that diminished its efficacy. The STFU's decentralized structure did not foster strong connections between leadership and membership, resulting in misunderstandings. But most importantly, the union struggled to live up to its creed of biracialism and equal treatment of African Americans. Ultimately, the STFU was less an aberration that tirelessly confronted the social and racial ills of the South and more an organization that reflected some of those ills even as it grappled with them.",

It evaluates the extent to which the interwar years constituted a period of depression or regeneration in the way the activity was organized and pursued, followed by an in-depth analysis of the impact of the Second World War. The study shows that the prevailing wisdom about the reasons for the decline of game shooting merits reappraisal, particularly in view of the unprecedented changes to the sport that resulted from the government's control and direction of food production during World War II.",

In the American Midwest, vast spaces and difficult travel conditions hindered frequent face-to-face conversations, and advocates for woman suffrage recognized the power of paper as an inexpensive means to reach isolated rural voters. An analysis focused on the material culture of the thousands of pamphlets, leaflets, and flyers used by suffragists exposes the practical decisions that shaped political campaign strategies. It also reveals that suffrage activists placed tremendous importance on propaganda; they planned their political campaigns around small papers with big messages.",

While paralleling the categories, methods, and evidentiary sources of One Kind of Freedom, this article instead takes a micro-level approach, comparing store development in two Reconstruction-era Louisiana parishes―one devoted to cotton production, the other to sugar. Data from these parishes and elsewhere in Louisiana suggests several problems with Ransom and Sutch's conclusions, especially their famous territorial monopoly thesis. Moreover, the superior performance of sugar parish stores underscores the significance of differences between the credit-dependent sharecropping system prevalent in cotton regions and the cash wages paid to sugar workers—distinctions that have often been intentionally blurred in recent historiography.",

Farm families, which held a special place in the ideology of a self-sufficient United States, partnered with institutions and child-placing agencies to house tens of thousands of dependent children. Those involved in child welfare believed that they could reverse the trend of dependency by placing children with Americans of high esteem. Farmers, for their part, could expect labor from their placement children in exchange for care. The availability of dependent children filled an important farm labor need while attempting to satisfy the goals of reformers.",

Agricultural institutions sought to assign more power to institutionalized scientific knowledge, shrinking the role of farmers. Berry sought an alternative definition of knowledge, drawing upon his training as a writer, as well as his experiences with manual farm work and the methods of environmentalist organic growers. He eventually concluded that only a community of farmers could produce and store effective knowledge and insisted that knowledge must be tacit -- largely situated in locality, skills, and culture. His ideas had little influence on most people employed in contemporary agriculture. However, those ideas profoundly shape the work of sustainable food advocates, such as Michael Pollan, who like Berry fear reductionism and celebrate the values of traditions.",

    "abstract": "Beauty or Statistics, by Bert Theunissen, is a valuable and innovative piece of scholarship based on meticulous research. It advances a broadening field devoted to understanding how animal breeding evolved in relation to the science of genetics, arguing that it is too simplistic to see the infiltration of genetics into practice as merely modernization. The book looks at the interface between science and practice in the breeding of farm animals, with a special focus on Dutch livestock breeding. The number of species dealt with is unusual, covering cows, sheep, pigs, chickens, and horses, and such wide coverage allows for the identification of trends outside the differing breeding cultures that can be found in livestock industries. The writing is clear and makes difficult subjects easy to understand.Historical animal breeding, and particularly its relationship to advancing science, has attracted two separate sets of academics: one principally interested in the cultural side of practical breeding as well as impinging social dynamics, and another that remains primarily concerned with the history of genetics in conjunction with its connections to practical animal breeding. There are few academics equally learned in both genetic and practical breeding methodology, a situation that weakens efforts at understanding how one set of strategies interacted with the other. Ignoring what constituted scientific breeding approaches undermines any arguments that might be made about why genetics impacted or did not impact practical breeding. Understanding the history of genetic methodology, but having no appreciation for what practical breeding methods entailed, does not lead to a particularly productive way of tackling the interface either. This book beautifully straddles the line between the two apparently diverse (and often divisive) attitudes to breeding, because of a deep understanding of both genetic and practical breeding methods. It gives concrete details, for example, as to how practical breeding could proceed successfully (and does proceed) with no input from genetics. At the same time, it explains the tactics underpinning the genetic approach and how these might interface with practical methods. The positions breeders and scientists held with respect to quantitative genetics and classical genetics (namely, hybrid breeding) are also discussed in light of developments within science and attitudes of breeders toward those developments. Because elucidation of the science/practice interface reaches a new level in this book, Beauty or Statistics takes the story of animal breeding to a more advanced stage.The introduction provides an elegant overview of breeding strategies as applied in both practical and scientific breeding, setting the intellectual background to the story. The author then gives a comprehensive outline of the book's content by reviewing issues addressed in the different chapters. The chapter on the breeding of dairy cattle by the Dutch introduces the idea that changes in breeding practices resulted from many factors. As the author states, “Cattle breeding was guided by an amalgam of considerations, as diverse as they were disputable, pertaining to practical experience, methods, scientific insights and technologies, ideas about responsible farming, aesthetic preferences, commercial interests, economic circumstances, and government policies” (62). The “beefing” up of black-and-white cattle after 1900, and the concurrent drop in milking capacity, led to extensive exportation in the 1950s to countries outside the United States and Canada. By the 1990s, however, Dutch herds of black-and-whites were again highly specialized for milk and had also become thoroughly “Holsteinized.” The chapter on Dutch chicken-breeding patterns shows that the trend in the Netherlands toward the hybrid breeding systems developed by geneticists, and the resulting corporate control of the breeding industry, were heavily influenced by the situation in the United States. When breeding became a separate globalized industry within an integrated system, Dutch breeder companies of egg-laying chicks retained an important position.Pig breeding in the Netherlands was similar to and yet different from chicken breeding. Pig breeding ended up being a strange blend of pure breeding, crossbreeding, and hybrid breeding. Private companies came into existence in order to practice hybrid breeding of boars, while the breed associations remained concerned with pure breeding or crossbreeding. The history of pig breeding in the Netherlands, the author states succinctly, illustrates “the inadequacy of the ‘art-to-science’ scenario as an explanation of how breeding became scientific” (117). The chapter on sheep breeding provides an interesting contrast to the “art-to-science” trends in the dairy cattle, chicken, and even pig worlds. As far as the breeding of Texel sheep was concerned, traditional methods not only trumped all efforts at introducing quantitative genetic strategies but also led to the production of superior sheep. The chapter on the Dutch Warmblood outlines how after 1960 farm and hobbyist breeders transformed an agricultural animal of different styles into a sport horse. While breeding the new Warmblood would ultimately involve a scientific reliance on data, and a move to quantitative genetic principles, by the time these trends took place the breeders had already remade the Warmblood into its modern version. In the end, Warmblood breeding reflected scientific standards and technology as well as traditional approaches to breeding.The conclusion provides overviews on breeding from a general and international point of view by using the Dutch example to show how science interacts with traditional breeding. In doing so, the author confirms that this book is more than a study of Dutch agriculture. It is a study of breeding in relation to traditional and scientific views.",

    "abstract": "It is a troubling time to be hopeful about land and labor in Brazil. As Merle Bowen notes in the concluding chapter of For Land and Liberty, the current president, Jair Bolsonaro, and his administration have dismantled environmental protections, opened protected areas to agro-industrial development, and stalled programs that provide access to land for members of Brazil's quilombo communities. Gains from conditional cash transfer programs and the rewriting of public school curriculuma are being reversed, eroded, or eviscerated. Other attacks on the lives and livelihoods of Black and Brown persons in Brazil include assassinations of environmental activists, attempts to revoke affirmative action in higher education, and the undermining of public health efforts to address COVID-19, which has disproportionately affected Indigenous and other minorities.Bowen spent fifteen years examining the ways structural racism operates in rural areas of Brazil, where access to land and labor continues to be one of the most pressing issues. Residents of Black rural communities are corralled by a “highly concentrated and racialized system of landownership” (212). The slow and highly contentious land reform process competes with agro-industrial interests, logging and mining companies, grileiros (people who claim ownership with fabricated deeds), and environmental protection projects, resulting in forced relocation, dispossession, and shifts in the nature, extent, and types of labor available.Bowen assembled information from a vast array of sources and stakeholders including anthropologists, government ministers, landowners, and Afro-Brazilian activists, as well as archives, primary and secondary publications, and ethnographic data. She provides a detailed, close-up view of what this looks like “on the ground” for twelve Black rural communities in two very different regions: Bahia (in the northeast) and the interior of São Paulo. This attention to regional differences is an important complement to the scholarly literature, as it provides a deeper understanding of the history, local conditions, demographics, crops, instability of wage labor, and the gendered nature of labor, disrupting the tendency to homogenize or romanticize the struggles that quilombolas face.Chapter 2 traces the history, heterogeneity, and shifting agendas of Black activists and the efforts that led to the insertion of a land reform initiative in the 1988 Constitution (Article 68), which guaranteed permanent collective ownership to federally recognized Maroon communities (also called remanescentes de quilombos or quilombo remnant communities). There are an estimated four thousand quilombo communities in both urban and rural areas in Brazil. The communities Bowen focuses on are representative of those still waiting for a land title. The titling process is long and complicated, and until they receive a land title, residents of traditional Black communities are under constant threat of expulsion or relocation. Petitions for land titles have generated charges of reverse racism and violence from those who refuse to accept the legitimacy of quilombola rights to territory. Since 1988, receiving a title has been the exception rather than the rule.Bowen's research provides a fine-grained assessment of the challenges in applying Article 68, including operationalizing “who” is a quilombola, and how shifting jurisdictional procedures, state laws favoring titling, and market forces have impacted the daily lives of rural quilombolas (Chapters 2 and 3). The anchor or signature of identity for those in Black rural communities is “rootedness” to the land they occupy, drawn from an intergenerational accumulation of agroecological knowledge and practices, a distinction from urban communities that do not rely on the land for their livelihood (Chapter 4).In Chapter 5, Bowen turns to the “commodification of Quilombola culture” as a revenue strategy and a chance for “self-determination and self-making” (182). There has been less investment in quilombo tourism than in tourism along coastal beach areas, ecotourism in the Amazon region, or pro-poor/reality tourism in urban shantytowns. Despite the lack of evidence, assertions are made about the potential positive impact of tourism in quilombos through job creation. Although there is little research on tourism in quilombos, some suggest that it presents a simplified and incomplete rendering of the past (and present) by focusing only on African cultural retentions while obscuring the knowledge, experiences, and skills of enslaved workers in a nation that was built on their labor. Success is more evident when quilombolas set the terms for what to showcase and have a major stake in ownership and representation. Unfortunately, conflict with tourist agencies' agendas and other imbalances in the quilombo tourism industry have reinforced racial, class, and gendered disparities, and do little to reduce poverty.Scholars of Latin American studies, Africana studies, history, geography, anthropology, and agrarian studies will get an extensive overview of the regional complexities in applying a land reform program, including what was promised and what has failed to deliver. It is not altogether a grim portrait; but the long-term benefits of these policies in transforming the livelihoods of those in Black rural communities remain contingent on access to labor as well as a land title.",

    "abstract": "Alex Drace-Francis's book The Making of Mămăligă tells the story of maize in Romania—and more broadly in central and southeastern Europe—over six centuries. In a pithy and highly entertaining history of the crop, Drace-Francis covers, often in surprising detail, known historical moments and periods in a new light by foregrounding maize as the lens through which to view Romania's history. Maize, and later that Romanian national-cultural dish mămăligă (a maize porridge), becomes the focal point of a history of capitalism, a social history, a history of political crises, and—especially toward the end of the book—a cultural history.The book opens with a detective story that is never solved: How and when did maize become an established cereal in southeastern Europe? The opening chapter takes us on a transatlantic journey from the Caribbean to the Carpathians—a remarkable feat to link two regions so convincingly—and concludes that the origin story of maize in the region still belongs to the realm of speculation. There is also much intriguing confusion as far as maize's different names are concerned. Its novelty in southeastern Europe earned maize the name \"Turkish wheat\" (22), which is a misnomer rather than evidence for the \"Ottoman theory\" of how maize arrived in Romania. Elsewhere, in Maramureș, the term tenchi, from the Hungarian for \"sea\" (tenger), seems to suggest a maritime route to southeastern Europe, again with inconclusive evidence (26). More confusingly, there are historic place names and personal names in Romania that correspond to different words for maize and its products including Mămăligă, Cucuruz, Porumb, and Mălai, yet the links are tenuous to say the least. Drace-Francis shows us that the history of maize is on surer footing from the mid-eighteenth century. It is striking, however, how late some of the earliest documented mentions of maize are in southeastern Europe and Romania specifically. Drace-Francis makes the point convincingly with some well-chosen maps. In some parts of Wallachia, maize featured for the first time in the late eighteenth and even early nineteenth centuries, which is surprising given how crucial maize became to Romanian society and its economy.By the late eighteenth century, then, the cultivation and trading of maize boomed in Wallachia and Moldavia. Drace-Francis approaches maize in modern Romanian history in two ways and does so very successfully. First, The Making of Mămăligă includes a rich collection of cultural sources that Drace-Francis uses to document the presence, role, and sociocultural meaning of maize. For instance, patriarchal control over growing and trading maize came under pressure from women in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as shown in the diverse sources Drace-Francis employs, from letters to court judgments to petitions. Second, he demonstrates the central importance of maize to key events and periods in Romanian history. While holding back from saying everything was owed to maize, Drace-Francis does attribute, to some extent, the shifting political power balance in the region—from Ottoman to Russian and Habsburg power—to the growth of maize as a key ingredient of Romanian agriculture. He also shows the intricate interdependence between political calm and upheaval on the one hand and the maize agricultural industry on the other. It was, conversely, in periods of a maize boom that sociopolitical change occurred. Tudor Vladimirescu, the peasant leader of the 1821 revolt, rose to power because of his success in trading maize. The revolt of 1821 saw the competing leaders—Vladimirescu and Ipsilanti—take a keen interest in controlling maize production and trading. Equally, the Treaty of Edirne in 1829 did much to inject Romanian maize into an international market. The highpoint of Romanian maize, however, arrived with the peasants' revolt of 1907 to which Drace-Francis also attributes a maize trigger. The government's aim to strengthen the maize reserves was pursued by raising the land tax, which in turn sparked that pivotal revolt. Peasants who participated in the revolt took political revenge by setting fire to the maize stores of landowners.The history of Romania and southeastern Europe through the lens of maize is riveting. And yet the book's history ends in the early twentieth century, even though there is surely a story to be told about Fascist, Communist, and post-Communist maize. Instead, chapters 7 and 8 form a radical break with the previous six chapters. From a chronological story in which maize narrates key moments in Romania's regional history, the final two chapters turn to mămăligă itself. Cookbooks, medical expertise, and novels form the source base for Drace-Francis's central question: How did mamaliga become so iconic for self-representations of Romanian society? Cookbooks and recipes in the eighteenth and nineteenth century hint at the cultural importance of mămăligă. In literary references to mămăligă, often incidental, the dish became a reference point for peasant life, and sometimes Roma society. More fruitfully, Drace-Francis charts folklore and proverbs associated with mămăligă to gauge the central position the dish came to occupy in Romanian society. Tantalizingly, he ends his book by telling the reader that the making of mămăligă did not end in 1907 and that may well be something for a future project. In all, Drace-Francis's The Making of Mămăligă makes an excellent case for food and agricultural history mixed in with some rich cultural history. For those readers who \"don't yet know how to eat mămăligă,\" this book is an essential starting point (37).",

    "abstract": "Tucked away in the backyards of California's Santa Clara Valley lies a revolutionary secret hidden in plain sight: people of all backgrounds are growing ancestral food in home gardens. In doing so, they are reconnecting with the land and their communities through convivial labor. Ethnographer Gabriel Valle spent four years visiting local home gardens, chatting in kitchens, and accompanying his interlocutors to public spaces to forage for food that is often overlooked and left to rot. Pulling from in-depth interviews, participant observation, and garden conversations, Valle's research aims to provide answers to the following question: \"What practices do home gardeners engage in to protect against vulnerability, attain social mobility, improve health and wellbeing, and strengthen ties to the neighborhood and community?\" (160)His answers fill a resounding gap in the literature. Histories of the Santa Clara Valley often describe the region's agricultural industry or celebrate Silicon Valley as a place of innovation, technological progress, and wealth. The historical attention paid to these industries, while important, further marginalizes understandings of the working class and their lived experiences of resistance and autonomy outside of industry. It is in these margins that Valle seeks the beans, squash, corn, tomatoes, and herbal medicines that serve as proof that the people of the Santa Clara Valley \"pursue dignity and autonomy by growing, sharing, and consuming food\" (20). The home gardeners in this book enact what Valle calls \"convivial labor\"—production and labor outside of the capitalist system that produces value for those who practice it and has the potential to \"[fulfill] our species-being\" (13). Convivial labor takes place in autonomous spaces that push back against hegemonic and capitalist forces that have alienated people from feeding themselves and maintaining good health. Valle posits that contemporary US life under capitalism has alienated the average person from the land and the food it can produce. He highlights how immigrants to the United States experience this alienation differently, as they recall living off the land and experiencing better health and \"the good life\" in their home countries. Their transition to becoming low-income wage earners in the United States often forces them to rely on processed and unhealthy foods that negatively impact their health.Valle's five chapters consider food and the land in relation to place-making, happiness, healing, and revolution. Interspersed between the chapters are interludes that feature poignant moments and images, from the garden to the kitchen, where certain skills and recipes highlight the ingenuity of convivial laborers, who literally sow the seeds for sustainability and community health. In the image of the Santa Clara Valley that Valle paints for his readers, working-class voices, practices, and behaviors offer hope for the future that functions outside of policy and rights, and instead acts. Home gardeners get their hands dirty and problem-solve through the production and reproduction of food. At times, Valle's interlocutors and their stories get lost in the sheer number of theoretical connections he makes; yet that does not detract from the fact that the text makes important ethnographic and historical contributions.Chapter 2 makes a particularly strong case for gardening as a lifestyle connected to self-determination, resilience, and Indigenous lifeways. Relying heavily on examples from Indigenous Ohlone history in what is now California, Valle traces how violent histories of conquest and capitalism function to strip people of their ability to produce their own food. He connects these histories to historical memory and practices in Grandma's garden, where she enacts Indigenous foodways that push back against empire. Valle succeeds in highlighting the ways all people, but especially Indigenous people, have been structurally and violently removed from life-sustaining lands and practices. In this process, they have been forced to live life at the margins, consuming unhealthy foods that revolve around convenience instead of nutrition, sustenance, and communion with humans and the environment.Gardening at the Margins offers students and scholars of environmental anthropology, food studies, and Latinx studies a critical community-engaged account of home gardens in the Santa Clara Valley, an overlooked site of California labor and ethnic history. In it, Valle does not despair. Instead, he \"celebrate[s] the acts of gardening, cooking, and eating as potentially emancipatory\" (16). Readers can expect a close look at the cultivation and sharing of food via tiny moments of joy, community, solace, and connection. Building on Joel Robbins's \"anthropology of good,\" Valle's gardens \"emphasize how people imagine better worlds and . . . how they work to enact them\" (35).",

Nale to navigate the disconnect between the official REA project, which assumed a gendered division of labor, and the real needs of the farm women they served. Through the Comanche County REA Women's Club, the article explores how REA administrators imagined that women would participate in its cooperative-led electrification efforts, women's engagement with and resistance to the REA's programming, and how technology adoption was ultimately mediated through women's priorities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The “iron triangle” concept originated in a set of debates about power and influence in the US political system. Applied to agriculture, the iron triangle described a set of political relationships in which farmers and their representatives enjoyed a privileged position in the policy process. Although the contemporary reality is much messier than the triangle metaphor implies, agricultural policy in the United States continues to reflect the power and influence of large-scale commercial farmers and their allies in adjacent sectors such as insurance and banking. This continued dominance reflects an ongoing process of political and policy adaptation that enables the productivist core of the farm sector to retain much of its power despite broader changes in the political and economic context of US agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article analyzes the revitalization of Jamaica's sugar industry in the first half of the twentieth century and the overall shift in agricultural focus from bananas back to sugar in the context of the effects of the banana blight known as Panama disease. It argues that Panama disease and the response of small and large farmers to it, as well as weather events and changes in global markets, led growers to switch from banana to sugar cultivation. Afro-Jamaican smallholders led the shift to sugar in the 1910s, as they were the first to grapple with Panama disease in Jamaica. By the mid-1920s Panama disease had reached large banana plantations as well, and many planters, like smallholders a decade prior, responded by turning their plantations into sugar, rather than banana, monocultures. By the end of World War II, as a result of Panama disease, along with transformations in the sugar industry that came in the wake of the disease's spread, sugar had once more become Jamaica's primary agricultural export. Examining the Jamaican sugar industry as part of the history of Panama disease highlights that plant diseases affect much more than the specific crop they infect. Rather, they can have significant ramifications for other crops and the associated industries that make up the broader agroecosystems.",

From the 1930s to the 1970s, a wheat-cotton coalition helped to forge a policy of supply management that relied on price supports, production controls, and export subsidies that aimed to increase farm incomes, stabilize agricultural markets, and prevent overproduction. In the 1990s, however, supply management policy was ended and its central goals of stabilizing markets and managing supply were cast aside. This current policy era has been driven in part by corn and soybean interests and shaped by three global forces that encourage the expansion of production for these commodities: global liberalization and expanded free trade, the advent of genetically engineered seeds, and the expansion of the meat industry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of radiation techniques in agriculture held great promise in postcolonial India's quest to put agriculture on a “scientific basis.” Unpacking its epistemic debates, and the dynamics of international technical assistance, this article contends that the pursuit of atomic agriculture constituted a dominant sociotechnical imaginary among Indian elites to modernize the country's traditional agrarian system. Inducing desirable changes in crops via irradiation occurred against the backdrop of Cold War competition among great powers to woo developing countries through technical aid and assistance, coupled with New Delhi's imperative to become self-sufficient in food-grain production. For Indian scientific elites, the possibility of “man-made evolution” through radiation-induced mutations was institutionally promising. Indian scientists became the standard-bearers of atomic agriculture in the developing world through the effective use of “mutation breeding” as a “complementary” crop improvement technique. However, global epistemic and organizational divides often cast a shadow on the utility of nuclear techniques for India's food sufficiency needs. The use of radiation techniques also became contentious for eclipsing alternate policy pathways in India's agriculture and food systems. India's tryst with atomic agriculture nonetheless embodied its combined desire to attain scientific modernity, strategic autonomy, and self-reliance in food production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores atomic agriculture through the lens of political shelter, focusing on examples from the United States, the Soviet Union, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Enthusiasm for atomic energy techniques, especially in the 1950s and early 1960s, was an abnormality in the sense that their perceived value—to society possibly, to governments certainly—overruled conventional arguments. Though later debates about atomic energy often revolved around safety and health effects, most of the early criticisms were more mundane, typically turning on whether they ever would be economically viable. Occasionally the criticism was more severe, as when discussing mutation plant breeding in the Soviet Union. What we find in exploring agricultural techniques in atomic energy, in national contexts as well as at international agencies, is how routinely experts pointed out that these approaches were promising but ultimately inferior. Yet they were pursued anyway, boosted by the priorities of governments and government-funded international agencies. The political and military value of atomic energy sheltered individual scientists, laboratories, and entire research programs from skepticism and outright criticism.",

As Michael Perman observed, there is still, at this late date, con? siderable uncertainty about the genesis and function of the Klan. The standard scholarly account of the Klan, Allen Trelease's White Terror, stresses partisan motivation. Most scholars concede the centrality of polit? ical goals, broadly defined; the victims were predominantly black and white Republicans assailed by opponents of Reconstruction. Nonetheless, there is widespread conviction that the sometimes virulent bloodshed must have had wider social origins, especially those developing from the postwar changes in the plantation system.1 One commonly held view ties the emergence of terrorism to the unprecedented labor turmoil following emancipation. In Social Origins of the New South: Alabama, 1860-1885, Jonathan M. Wiener described the Klan in the Alabama Black Belt as an instrument of the planter class, rather than the poor whites. He holds that in the cotton belt the Klan worked in pursuit of the goals of the planters, helping perpetuate the plantation system rather than narrow political objectives. Eric Foner's",

By the time she wrote in 1962, the USDA had three quarters of a century of experience with biological control-the reduction of pest populations by their natural enemies.' Biological control had risen and fallen in the USDA. Following the original, spectacular success against cottony-cushion scale in 1889, the Bureau of Entomology, later Entomology and Plant Quarantine, conducted a wide assortment of biological control projects. Some of the most ambitious, such as those on the gypsy moth and the European corn borer, stand largely as failures. Complete successes using biological control during the period can be counted on one hand, but other institutions such as the University of California and the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association accomplished more. The USDA lacked the institutional commitment California and Hawaii made to biological control. Yet the federal department resisted the efforts of other states to enter the field. The Bureau of Entomology sought quick solutions instead of the long-term research and planning needed for the use of natural enemies. The greatest impediment to success was the bureau's failure to grant any unit full jurisdiction over biological control. In 1951, even as many of the drawbacks of pesticides were becoming clear,",

    "abstract": "Abstract This essay considers the role of slavery in American agricultural history by examining the impact of political decisions during the period when the boundary between free and slave states was not yet settled. This boundary was not dictated by geographic imperatives. In Kentucky, an early \"beach-head\" in the bluegrass district allowed slavery to become firmly entrenched, even in a state where the majority of farmers held no slaves. On the other hand, slavery was vigorously debated in all of the Northwest Territories--losing a close vote in Illinois as late as 1824. The essay argues that American agricultural history would have been very different had these votes tipped the other way. Evidence from three outlying slave regions--the Kentucky bluegrass, Missouri’s \"Little Dixie,\" and the wheat belt of Virginia--shows that slavery could adapt readily to crops and regions commonly considered ideal for family farms, so long as land values were sufficiently high. Drawing on census samples collected by James Irwin, the essay argues that the peculiar affinity between slavery and wheat-growing in Virginia can best be explained by property rights. Specifically, control over a captive labor force allowed slaveowners to expand wheat acreage without fear of the harvest peak.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Theodore Roosevelt charged his 1908 Country Life Commission with looking into the deficiencies of agriculture and country life and the means by which they might be remedied. Though some scholars have judged it a positive milestone in American agricultural history, prevailing assessments are critical, negative, and often conflicting. Critics view it as an example of patronizing, technocratic social engineering aimed at urbanizing and industrializing the countryside to benefit national and industrial economic interests. Yet this interpretation is inconsistent with the commission’s report. Rather than offering a technocratic program to engineer agriculture and country life, the report is one of the first high-profile, comprehensive attempts to outline a broad-gauge vision of sustainability in American agriculture. It reflects an ecological sensitivity and a variant of Progressive Era reform devoted to key civic and economic ideals. Though flawed, the commission’s vision of agriculture and country life deserves to be seen as a milestone in the story for the struggle for sustainability.",

Farm safety leaders fashioned a largely educational movement to address farm families’ technologically complex environments, since farming’s entrepreneurial nature required a different approach than did efforts in other occupational domains. The nation’s rural policymakers had largely neglected that issue until the Second World War, when they recognised that farm accidents threatened the nation’s wartime mobilization efforts. The farm safety movement was characterized by a cooperative effort, which included the National Safety Council, the United States Department of Agriculture, land grant colleges, and the nation’s rural youth organizations. However, efforts to impose more stringent regulations faced resistance from farmers after the creation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Historians have portrayed the formative period of agricultural extension work in the United States as a search for the best method of convincing farmers to change their farming practices in order to improve agricultural efficiency, productivity, and profitability. However, one of the key leaders in extension’s formative period, Cornell University’s Liberty Hyde Bailey, articulated a different vision of extension’s central purpose and promise. Drawing on his writings during the years in which he led the development of Cornell’s extension program (1894-1902), this article argues that Bailey’s vision of agricultural extension work was centered on the provision of education aimed at awakening farmers to a new point of view on life. The new point of view combined sympathy with nature, a love of country life, and a scientific attitude, expressed by a habit of careful observation and experimentation. The main purpose of awakening farmers to this point of view was not to develop a more efficient, productive, and profitable agriculture, but to advance the larger cultural ideals of a \"self-sustaining\" agriculture and personal happiness. The account of Bailey’s vision provided in this article suggests the need to reconsider the story of the origins and early development of American agricultural extension work.",

In colonial settings it proved particularly important, as settlers often lived remotely from the markets for their produce, and they did not have existing farming traditions to rely upon. This paper traces the early history of agricultural periodicals in New Zealand and considers their position relative to other potential sources of farming instruction, such as agricultural colleges and the state. Through a case study of New Zealand's first agricultural periodical, the New Zealand Country Journal (1877-1898), it then examines what kinds of information was being circulated, the sources of that information, and how this helped to shape farming practices in a new land.",

    "abstract": "This article suggests that the idea of modernization, the uni-linear transition from peasantry to commercial agriculture, has shaped much of the writing of rural immigrant communities during the twentieth century. It also suggests that the history of immigrant and ethnic farm communities has begun to take a different tack during the last decade. This change reflects trends in the broader historiography of settlement society, including a shift from social history to cultural history. Modernity is no longer seen as an unrelenting force, natural and dominant in character. Rather postmodernity's concern with fragmentation and asymmetry, and the linguistic turn with its fixation on cultural invention and created mythology, seemed evident. Regional, national, and international-based studies alike reflect this new research agenda, and this article highlights seven books in particular. Three, focusing on settler society and rural culture in regional, national, and transnational variations, describe modernity in particular; they see the very idea of change, once seen as inevitable and inexorable, as constructed, invented, and contrived. Three others are local studies of specific ethnic rural groups in which the immigrant or ethnic farm community stands at a cross current to a commercializing countryside, contesting and subverting the very intentions of the agents of the market economy and state interests. The final book is the author's own recent work in comparative history, Diaspora in the Countryside: Two Mennonite Communities and MidTwentieth Century Rural Disjuncture. The two central words diaspora and disjuncture suggests that these communities, one located in Canada and the other in the United States, responded to economic changes through a diversity of lifeworlds, including farm commercialization, urbanization, and a conservative recreation of an old order agraria. These Mennonites created a set of contradictory mythologies and master narratives that sought to bring teleological sense, social order, and meaning to inchoate and fragmented cultures. The seven books thus acknowledge quotidian complexity, ethnic variation, and national and regional difference. They are representative of what appears to be a wider trend in the academy of North American rural history.",

They charge that scholars rely too heavily on ill-defined concepts-like agency-and under-appreciate the determination force of the capitalist consumer economy. This essay appraises the key themes, methods, questions, and conclusions contained within recent US history. While consumer agency looms large in many works, consumer studies also explore the influence of structural economics, material goods, and institutions that shaped consumer behavior. Moreover, distinct periodization is important in recognizing and understanding the shifting contours of American consumption. This article appraises how recent scholarship in rural consumer culture relates to these broad categories and what this reveals about rural history in general. In the end, this paper probes the central challenge posed to historians by the notions of consumer choice and agency.",

    "abstract": "Over the course of twenty-eight years, between 1964 and 1991, members of the Iowa Porkettes, the women's auxiliary to the Iowa Pork Producer's Association (IPPA), promoted pork products in order to assert their roles as agricultural producers. For the members of the Porkettes, technological change and the growth of agribusiness provided new opportunities to challenge patriarchal hierarchies in agricultural organizations. Over time, as the overall number of hog farmers declined and the agricultural marketplace increasingly demanded professional expertise, the Porkettes transformed a women's auxiliary into a female-led commodity organization. Initially, members participated in appropriately \"feminine\" activities including Pork Queen contests, lard-baking contests, consultations with high school home economics instructors, and the distribution of promotional materials. By the late 1970s, however, members began to employ a new rhetoric shaped by their labor on the farm to claim an important stake in the production and marketing of commodities. They took responsibility for large-scale advertising campaigns, managed a growing budget, and became leaders within the IPPA. Their experiences offer insight into broader developments of second wave agrarian feminisms that enabled farm women's organizations to renegotiate gendered divisions of labor, claim new public spaces for women, and demand greater recognition from male agricultural leaders.",

It argues that, although desiccationist theory was prevalent, its acceptance among colonial authorities in the Gold Coast was far from hegemonic. There were important dissenting colonial voices, particularly among agriculturalists, who argued that declining cocoa yields were due to plant diseases, most notably cocoa swollen shoot disease. It was based on the latter's non-environmental model of disease transmission, rather than the premises of desiccation science, that the government's postwar \"cutting out campaign\" of cocoa was predicated. Nevertheless, the foresters' correlation of the deterioration of cocoa areas with fears of desiccation was not without its effects on state practice, providing the rationale for an accelerated program of forest reservations in the 1930s.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the early twentieth century California became a big exporter of some agricultural products that, until then, had only been grown on a large scale in the Mediterranean basin. As a result, exports of those products diminished or stagnated in Mediterranean countries, with important repercussions on their economies. The Spanish orange industry, however, continued to expand, despite the fact that a substantial percentage of Spanish oranges came from farms owned by (often illiterate) small peasants who, in comparison to the California growers, used a great deal of labor, small amounts of capital, and little science. This paper shows that Spanish farmers were in fact capable of growing high-quality oranges at prices that were more competitive than those in California, although instead they often preferred to satisfy the strong demand for middling fruit from Great Britain because it was a more profitable business. This, combined with a deficient use of brand names, gave the Spanish citrus industry serious reputation problems by the 1930s, from which, however, it recovered quickly.",

Antibiotics—once viewed as substances that could rid milk of bacterial hazards—became understood as food adulterants when residues of the drugs were detected in milk. Although consumers’ concerns about food purity became critical in the postwar era, only in the late 1950s and early 1960s did public health officials and consumers take interest in the potential human health effects of antibiotic residues. Veterinarians and milk processors, not consumers, led the effort to curb indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the 1940s and 1950s. Paying close attention to the context in which farmers chose to use antibiotics and monitored drug residues, this article seeks to explain why farm people adopted veterinary drugs and how they adapted to new regulatory structures and shifting ideas about milk purity.",

Drawing on a broad range of archival records, this paper explores the three main factors that encouraged the Canadian government in this course: growing doubts about the wisdom of isolating communist China; mounting anger at Washington, DC’s use of subsidized wheat sales to capture traditional Canadian markets; and a surging sense of Canadian nationalism that sought a distinct role for Canada on the world stage. Clearly, as was so often the case in postwar Canadian foreign economic policy, a narrowly defined national interest easily trumped the ideological pressures of western solidarity.",

    "abstract": "Drawn from a plenary discussion at the 2013 Agricultural History Society’s annual meeting in Banff, five scholars examine the relationships of specific crops to their surrounding cultures. The question “does crop determine culture?” provided opportunities to explore crop determinism and interrogate the relationships between particular crops and their production methods. The question intended to avoid the narrow association of “culture” with cultivation techniques, and each scholar discussed agricultural production methods in ways that included elements of their wider contexts. As usually happens in the history of technology, these historians spoke of cultivation methods that both reflect and shape those phenomena more often classified as social, cultural, political, or economic, rather than narrowly technological. The plenary ends with a call for readers to answer the organizing question for themselves, in their own studies of agriculture and its environments.",

    "abstract": "This article discusses the motivations and actions of farmers who protested against the construction of a high voltage powerline in Minnesota between 1974 and 1980. A deeply rooted agrarian identity fostered a sense of injustice over the construction of the powerline, and early victories gave a perceived collective agency that allowed for sustained commitment despite numerous setbacks. This movement was not about promoting social change; rather, it was about protecting perceived traditions, which were at the core of the popular ideology the farmers embraced. Farmers were morally outraged when they perceived that their traditions and values were threatened by the powerline and justified their unlawful activities in a vain attempt to stop its construction.",

Using the example of plant nutrition in Germany, it shows how increasing fertilizer use ran against the best scientific advice in significant ways. Ultimately, the lack of scientific knowledge helped accelerate the transition to industrialized, high-input farming. The article stresses the agency of farmers, who were key players in a complex of web of negotiations among experts, advisors, officials, and practitioners that spanned several generations. For farmers facing a wide range of difficult issues, cognitive simplicity on the plant nutrition front was more important than the side effects of excessive fertilizer use: wasting thoughts would have cost more than wasting resources. At the same time, acting against the advice of scientific experts produced an anxiety that scholars should recognize as a key aspect of agricultural modernization.",

    "abstract": "Rainmaking flourished on the Great Plains during the 1890s drought. A complicated hybrid of sincere belief in science and confidence games, Plains peoples’ willingness to place tentative faith in the practice reflected larger insecurities about the advisability of practicing agriculture in a marginal environment and their ability to succeed in the face of periodic, intense, drought. An extension of older weather modification theories—such as rain follows the plow—rainmaking facilitated hope and empowered believers. Doubters, meanwhile, participated under the guise of entertainment, a harmless diversion that allowed them to delay any absolute judgment regarding the legitimacy of the practice. Suspension between skepticism and belief in rainmaking, in effect, allowed faith in the region, even during conditions of devastating drought, to remain alive. A supposed panacea for the Plains’ most significant environmental insufficiency, rainmaking resurfaced beyond the 1890s whenever the rains stopped. Hope, like moisture, was in constant demand.",

The research shows that all apple orchard businesses are still family owned, and most of them have a history going back at least three generations, but the way orchards are run is increasingly focused on industrial-scale efficiency and productivity. Short-term economic decisions often take priority over longer-term sustainable choices. Diversity on all levels is decreasing. There are fewer growers and a reduced number of retail outlets to supply. In turn, growers become more and more specialized by narrowing the range of varieties. Interviews have also shown that growers who have chosen to diversify into other niche markets are benefiting from that decision and are also contributing to their region's economic, environmental, and sociocultural wellbeing.",

    "abstract": "Pushing back against the “Texas Myth,” memory, and history that focus on the frontier, cowboys, and rural life, contributors to Lone Star Suburbs present the reality that most of the state's residents lived in suburbs by the turn of the twenty-first century. According to the 2010 Census, 85 percent of Texans lived in cities and 90 percent in metropolitan areas. Because Texas cities had liberal annexation powers, they expanded to include the boom of mid and late twentieth-century suburban growth.The most interesting essays in the collection consider how Texans’ “rural values” are intertwined with suburban culture and politics. Other contributions do the necessary work of documenting the history of suburbanization in Texas and add to recent scholarship on the suburban experience of African Americans and immigrants. Paul J. P. Sandul provides a historiographic overview and discusses how the Texan embrace of “rugged individualism” and use of “the rural image as a way to mark themselves as different and as better than people from other states”—as “real Americans”—leaves them “hesitant to identify the suburban in their state” and instead “minimizing the suburban side of their history” (11, 13).The planning and boosterism that accompanied the expansion of Texas's metropolitan areas are addressed in several chapters. Tom McKinney tells the story of the Texas Highway Department's engineer-managers who oversaw the urban highway planning that facilitated and encouraged suburban growth. Looking at midcentury planning in Arlington, Irving, Garland, and Grand Prairie, Robert B. Fairbanks demonstrates that suburban growth was not accidental. In fact, well-planned “suburban cities” were envisioned and encouraged by local boosters. For example, Philip G. Pope explains how Irving's chamber of commerce leveraged the identity the city gained as home to the Dallas Cowboys’ Texas Stadium, thus transforming it from a bedroom community into an important center within the greater metropolis. Andrew Baker provides a through discussion of how new suburban areas were governed—expansion of county powers, special tax districts, annexation, or incorporation—and their relative merits.Holding rural identities and valuing rural spaces influenced politics and policy at the metropolitan fringe. Baker's case study of the local debate around disincorporation in Chateau Woods includes an official who self-identified as a “country boy,” reluctantly entering politics to address government abuses. Andrew Busch writes about the grassroots origins of environmental protection in Austin, which included limiting the loss of rural spaces to suburban sprawl. He also notes its problematic aspects: when environmentalists managed to overcome their paradoxical opposition to both sprawl and increased density, additional development was directed toward minority and low-income spaces, leading to displacement.The racial and ethnic diversity of Texas's late twentieth-century suburbs is addressed by several essays. Two chapters use oral histories to document the motivations for African Americans’ moves to Texas suburbs: Theodore M. Lawe and Gwendolyn M. Lawe look at Dallas and Herbert G. Ruffin II studies San Antonio. As they note, more work is needed to understand the relationship between the African American suburban middle-class and economically distressed Black working-class urban neighborhoods. Son Mai adds to the growing literature on “ethnoburbs” with his excellent work on Houston's “Little Saigon,” which demonstrates how these suburban ethnic communities differed from older, urban Chinatowns.The most novel essay of the collection is Jake McAdams's history of the cowboy church movement, informed by oral histories gathered from church members. With its roots in come-as-you-are rodeo worship, cowboy church leaders and congregants embraced rurality, its trappings, and its attributed values—even though most of them lived and worked in the suburbs. He suggests that the cowboy church “appropriates tropes and ideals that have been at the heart of suburban rhetoric and growth” (162) and, like the suburbs, is “rural performance with the comforts of more ‘civilized’ areas” (161). McAdams argues that Cowboy Christians “blame city dwellers and other suburbanites for destroying the nation's morality and their beloved rural landscape,” yet they themselves—and almost all Texans—are also living in the suburbs (161).This anthology successfully achieves the goal its editors set for the volume—it is a “conversation starter” that should lead to additional research (ix). The population of Texas's late twentieth century was suburban; this recognition and accompanying paradox, that so many residents continue to embrace a “rural culture” and the “Texas Myth,” ought to inform a wide breadth of future historical scholarship.",

    "abstract": "There are many ways to write a global history: one is to survey multiple locations across time spans and geographies with interconnections and themes. Another is to dive deeply into a particular place, unfolding the daily lives, experiences, and hopes of local communities and individuals, tying them into global networks of travel, trade, diplomacy, entertainment, political alliance, and commercial interest. Droessler pursues the latter in Coconut Colonialism, a thoughtful, gracefully written, and deeply committed history of Samoa.The title is a bit of a feint—while the development of a copra economy in German Samoa is the heart of the narrative, this is far more than a chronicle of coconut plantation labor or agricultural politics. This is agricultural history in the broadest sense. Droessler ranges from the lore and culture of the coconut in Samoan society to the world built by planters and grove workers, through the multiple globe-spanning travels of ethnographic performers, infrastructure builders, and civil-servant mediators between the Samoan communities and German administration.These dramatis personae populate a remarkable and deeply nuanced set of scenarios, from the Samoan translator and administrator Charles Thomas Taylor to Chinese immigrants like Ko Tuk Shung in labor disputes and Melanesian workers like Tui Sakila. We follow plantation friendships between Ielu and Malua, agitators like Taio Tolo—who regards his fellows as like the Illustrados in the Philippines—and world-spanning nurses like Grace Pepe. In all, Droessler does not merely recount ethnological reconstructions of groups but traces Taylor's personal ambitions to travel, the San Francisco sojourns of Pepe, and the questions of rank and respect that troubled Tolo. We see these people's experiences (and those of dozens of other figures) in detail within and outside the German administration.The stories are generously yet concisely told. Droessler avoids excessive academic apparatus and instead focuses on the characters, their hopes, challenges, and quirks. Samoan men and women accepted harsh plantation work, but on their own terms, establishing their own cooperatives and trading networks. In this, Coconut Colonialism draws on an array of historiographical traditions: the island, field, and plantation social narratives of scholars like Ronald Takaki or Gary Okihiro; the voyaging mobility of Islanders underscored by David Chappell, or the performative self-fashionings examined by Adria Imada. Droessler grounds these in personal stories and puts individual lives into his “globalization.”Droessler searches out the personalities and characters behind the work that connected the building of coaling stations and establishment of radio towers as colonial service, yet also sees the linkages to communications for Islanders with a wider world of information. Those serving directly in the colonial administration occupied a “precarious position,” invaluable to the Germans while also advancing their own ambitions within status and compensation ranks and, at times, agitating for greater self-determination while also drawing on their own chiefly, noble statuses as matai. We see gender materially rooted in Samoan male-female roles such as the ‘aumāga and aualuma working groups, through malaga communities and the matai society, and deployed in hygiene and public health programs assigned to women. These investigations allow Droessler, for example, to recount the life of Grace Pepe as trainee and then nurse and also examine the decimating 1918 flu pandemic that scourged Samoa.Throughout the work, Droessler remains close to his sources. Though making some significant points about capitalism, workscapes, Oceanian globality, and the colonial roots of globalization, his analysis is rather built directly into his impressive elucidation of experiences and the manifold meanings of agricultural work and village society. These encompass an international range of immigrants, from Samoan coconut huskers to performers enacting Islander culture on stages in Europe like Tuvale—a high-ranking matai who saw the songs and dances he presented to audiences as diplomatic gestures in exchange for European hospitality—and figures like Tupua Tamasese Lealofi I, who navigated white-collar administrative functionaries vying for attention and status within colonial structures.Droessler unpacks racism as a fact of everyday life in multiple dimensions and not just between German rulers and Samoan workers, but also as inflected by the experience of Chinese laborers, Melanesian workers, and the prejudices around their cohabitation with local women in plantation and farm settings. He also illuminates the lived self-definition of the famed “half-castes” who often populated higher social ranks, including Ta‘isi O. F. Nelson, who would later lead the Mau movement for Samoan political self-determination. This comes at the point about which this book ends, with the colonial system under stress from global political transformations. And this is Droessler's well-made point: to understand global change, see the local actors, and the real lives that populate these histories.",

    "abstract": "The powerful mythos of George Washington as a virtuous and honorable man who, in his youth, chopped down a cherry tree only to confess his transgression immediately, continues to shape popular public perception of the American Cincinnatus. Modern historians have worked to deconstruct this hagiographic image of Washington, and Bruce Ragsdale further contributes to these efforts with Washington at the Plow. Ragsdale not only focuses on the founding father's identity as a farmer and an enslaver, but he also examines how Washington navigated a complicated tension between his public reputation and his private interests in a changing Atlantic World.The main thrust of Ragsdale's work focuses on Washington's life as a Virginia planter during the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary periods. Despite his many absences from Mount Vernon and his other properties during his tenure as leader of the Continental Army and, later, as president, Washington maintained a vested interest in capitalizing on the agricultural output of his estates. Indeed, his near obsession with British farmers and the New Husbandry movement greatly informed the various experiments Washington implemented on his plantations to increase both the efficiency of enslaved labor and crop production in the late eighteenth century. For example, on his Virginia plantations Washington adopted British models of crop rotation that skillfully adjusted for the different ecological factors of the Eastern Seaboard. He also made changes to the layout of Mount Vernon's landscape, including the construction of new buildings, after being inspired by the improvement projects made to Britain's large estates. However, as Ragsdale demonstrates, Washington's personal desire to capitalize on the economic independence of his farms often conflicted with the founding father's efforts to uphold his popular reputation.Throughout his work, Ragsdale demonstrates the many ways in which Washington maintained a public persona that often contradicted the lived reality of those whom the Cincinnatus enslaved. For example, Washington's letters claim that he opposed the separation of enslaved families and that he abhorred the practice of selling enslaved persons; however, Ragsdale reveals that Washington often engaged in these practices. He accepted enslaved peoples as payment for loans or purchased enslaved peoples with specific skills, such as the enslaved bricklayer named Neptune, to use in new farming experiments on his plantations (146). Ragsdale also emphasizes how Washington's participation in the amelioration movement—brought on by the rise of gradual abolition at the turn of the century—only served to obscure the violence inherent in the institution of American chattel slavery, although not explicitly. As Washington encouraged overseers and white laborers to increase the surveillance of enslaved peoples on his many estates, he kept a detailed record of their movements and demanded increasingly high rates of productivity and efficiency that disrupted enslaved communities. Other works, such as Edward Baptist's The Half Has Never Been Told (2015), clearly highlight how technological advances in both agriculture and commerce only intensified the violence and brutality of enslavement. Although examples of violence against the enslaved men and women on Washington's estates are only briefly addressed, including the physical trauma and abuse that resulted from Washington's increasingly complicated agricultural demands, Ragsdale is careful to acknowledge Washington's willful exclusion of violent punishments in the archival record as well as the manipulation of any language used to describe these occurrences.Although one of Washington's main goals was to serve as an example of the farming and husbandry enterprises the new nation needed to operate as a sovereign economic and political institution in an increasingly globalized world, by the end of his presidency, he failed to make any considerable changes. Other than his participation in the Philadelphia Agricultural Society or the organized visitations to Mount Vernon, the many farming or management changes Washington made to his estates had little impact on the broader population of either Virginia or Pennsylvania farmers. Even so, students and scholars interested in the transmission and transformation of agricultural knowledge and farming practices in the Atlantic World will find Ragsdale's work helpful, especially the many examples of Washington's successes and failures as a farmer. Scholars of slavery may also find useful information concerning the organization of Washington's enslaved labor and the examples of Washington implementing British plantation models from the Caribbean for increasing productivity at Mount Vernon. More importantly, however, Bruce Ragsdale's focus on how Washington navigated the changing national debates on slavery following the American Revolution in both his public and personal life highlights the complicated role Washington himself played in the creation of his own legend.",

    "abstract": "There is a pressing need in indentured labor studies for new approaches to examining and conceptualizing the nature and dynamics of the global migrant labor system that scattered some 2.2 million indentured Asian laborers, two-thirds of whom were Indians, throughout and beyond the colonial plantation world between the 1830s and 1920s. In this revised version of his dissertation, published as part of Cambridge University Press's Global South Asians series, Reshaad Durgahee seeks to demonstrate how historical geography can deepen our understanding of the indentured Indian experience in Mauritius and Fiji between 1871 and 1916. Regrettably, his efforts have resulted in a seriously flawed work that makes only a modest contribution to our understanding of that experience.Durgahee notes in his introduction that he wants to escape the conceptual and other limitations inherent in the historiographical propensity to examine the Indian indentured experience in various colonies in isolation from one another. To this end, he argues that the concepts of “the indentured archipelago” and “subaltern careering” allow us to develop a fuller understanding of the historical geographies of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century indenture and imperialism. His second and third chapters seek to explore indentured spaces in, respectively, Mauritius and Fiji, while a fourth chapter focuses on the concept of subaltern careering. Chapter 5 examines the development of new indentured migration routes within and beyond the colonial plantation world, a process that he asserts involved the emergence of Mauritius, Fiji, and the British and French West Indies as regional immigration entrepôts. A brief conclusion summarizes the arguments that he advances in preceding chapters.While Durgahee can be commended for wanting to escape from what I have characterized on previous occasions as the “tyranny of the particular” in indentured labor studies—that is, an unwillingness to situate the case studies that characterize this field of study in more fully developed local, regional, and pan-regional contexts—his efforts to do so are less than compelling for various reasons, beginning with his failure to develop a convincing argument about the heuristic value of the notion that an “indentured archipelago” existed during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Although he notes that the colonies in this archipelago did not develop in isolation from one another and calls for the comparative study of the indentured experience in this archipelago, he elects to examine Mauritian and Fijian developments side by side, in parallel, rather than comparatively. In so doing, he largely ignores Mauritian social and economic history before 1871, a thorough knowledge of which is central to understanding indentured life not only on the island but also elsewhere in the colonial plantation world. As a human geographer interested in how space shapes people's lives, he pays surprisingly little attention to changing patterns of spatiality on the ground in both these colonies. There is likewise little sense of change through time in a work of historical geography, much less of the dynamics of these changes, such as the Mauritian sugar industry's dependence on domestically generated capital at a time when the dramatic expansion of beet sugar production transformed the global sugar market. Durgahee's treatment of worker agency is simplistic and fails to consider, for example, the role that changing patterns of illegal absence, desertion, and vagrancy played in shaping indentured life, a serious omission since these manifestations of worker agency have been the subject of a substantial body of scholarship. While his interest in subaltern imperial careering provides welcome new insight into the complexities of indentured Indian immigration, his claims about its historical significance are undermined by the fact that the eighteen thousand individuals in question accounted for less than 2.3 percent of the eight hundred thousand indentured Indians who reached European colonies between 1870 and 1920.The promise inherent in a historical geographical approach to understanding the indentured Indian experience is compromised by Durgahee's failure to engage in the kind of rigorous analysis that this topic requires, a failure made manifest in a surfeit of descriptive narrative prose that also highlights his failure to demonstrate a solid command of important relevant scholarship on indenture in Mauritius and Fiji and the wider colonial plantation world (e.g., David Northrup's Indentured Labor in the Age of Imperialism, 1834–1922). Stylistically, this book contains too many instances of the kind of redundancy that makes it read like a dissertation. The usefulness of the book's maps is limited because of their small size, while most of the illustrations are difficult, if not impossible, to see clearly because they are so dark. Such conceptual, evidentiary, and presentational problems are not what one normally expects to find in a Cambridge University Press publication.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Created in 1943, the Mexican Agricultural Program (MAP) was a collaborative program between the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican government aimed at improving yields of corn and wheat varieties in Mexico. The MAP's wheat program was more influential than its corn breeding program, and wheat became the centerpiece of the Green Revolution beginning in the 1960s. This article reveals that the environmental origins of the MAP's wheat program lay in combating a plant disease fungus commonly known as wheat rust, which harmed farmers in both northern Mexico and the US hard red spring wheat region. Rust outbreaks originated in US barberry bushes, so one might think that Mexican scientists would have entered the United States to solve this problem with transnational wheat rust. Instead, the reverse occurred. Nevertheless, the MAP successfully produced new rust-resistant wheat during the formative years of the MAP's wheat program. Between 1943 and 1953, rust-resistant wheat helped increase Mexican wheat production 84 percent and yields 59 percent. Rust-resistant wheat offered an alternative model for a sustainable, resource-neutral green revolution. Rather than remain in their field of expertise, plant pathologists pivoted to semidwarf wheat and fertilizer use after 1953, a shift that defined the course of the Green Revolution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract From 1926 to 1974, the United Fruit Company operated the Lancetilla Experiment Station near Tela, Honduras. As a laboratory and botanical garden where one of the world's largest living collections of tropical fruits could be found, it stood in apparent contrast to the vast banana monocultures of the surrounding area. While United Fruit's infamous plantations depended on the application of pesticides and chemical knowledge to produce a single commodity crop, its Lancetilla Experiment Station pursued a broad research program oriented toward agricultural diversification. This essay examines the history of Lancetilla to explore the company's sponsorship of science and the multiple, shifting meanings of “diversification” within this prototypical transnational agribusiness. The history of experimentation at Lancetilla reveals a range of contested visions of economic development in twentieth-century Latin America, and it is a history that has left surprising traces in both local Honduran landscapes and the face of global agribusiness today. Ultimately, by introducing oil palm to Central America, United Fruit's crop diversification project served to replace one monoculture with another.",

    "abstract": "The reintroduction of the American chestnut to North American forests is currently facing a “critical step,” according to the American Chestnut Foundation (TACF). The US Department of Agriculture is reviewing an application from SUNY's School of Environmental Science and Forestry to deregulate a genetically engineered chestnut tree, nicknamed Darling 58, that shows promise in resisting the Cryphonectria parasitica fungus, known as chestnut blight. Supporters believe that clearing this bureaucratic hurdle could pave the way for the restoration of the “king of the canopy” and reverse the decline that began 118 years ago when the blight first appeared at the Bronx Zoo.Such is the latest chapter in a long-running saga that stretches back hundreds, if not millions, of years. In his timely and much-needed book, The American Chestnut, Donald Davis provides anyone interested in the chestnut's restoration with the historical context to understand the stakes involved. Rather than focus on supporting a thesis, Davis “surveys the ecological history of the tree over the past twenty thousand years and provides an informed discussion about human-chestnut relationships for half that period” (6). Davis, an independent scholar whose Where There Are Mountains: An Environmental History of the Southern Appalachians remains a significant contribution to the environmental history of the mountain region, was also a founding member of the Georgia Chapter of TACF.On one level, Davis tells a story familiar to anyone with passing knowledge of American forest history, but The American Chestnut is the most thoroughly researched and comprehensive account to date. Davis guides the lay reader through scientific studies in order to piece together evolutionary history and prehistoric human-chestnut relationships. Using more anecdotal historical sources through most of part 2, he argues that because of its strength, resistance to rot, and straight grain, Americans used chestnut lumber to construct a wide variety of buildings, make charcoal, fuel iron forges, support iron rails, and build worm fences. They used the nuts as sustenance, as livestock feed, and as a tool to barter. Davis documents all of this in rather meticulous detail across six chapters, concluding that “it was the totality of its uses that made it so important to humans” (219). He provides insights into lesser-known episodes, including the role of chestnuts in the Civil War, the business of urban chestnut roasters, and the trade in nuts. He also includes some chestnut recipes found in early American cookbooks.Davis reminds us that the decline of chestnut trees began well before the arrival of the blight, the subject of part 3. Readers will find it interesting that Cryphonectria parasitica was not the first pathogen to wreak havoc on the chestnut and stir fears of its disappearance. In the mid-nineteenth century, Phytophthora cinnamomi, also known as ink disease, destroyed chestnut populations in the coastal plain, restricting their range in much of the South. Highlighting the ways in which humans contributed to the blight crisis, he contends that because nineteenth-century nut growers “continued to embrace 18th-century prejudices against untamed wild nature,” they began importing European and Japanese varieties, which “doomed” the chestnut as a “vital, self-reproducing species” (132). Industrial timber removal, repeated fires, and consequent insect damage accelerated the blight's spread, and by the time politicians finally banned the importation of nonnative chestnuts in 1912, it was too little, too late. Perhaps most egregiously, once Americans accepted the reality of inevitable chestnut loss, timber removal accelerated as an effort to both slow the spread and to profit from its timber before it disappeared.In part 4, Davis delves into the debates swirling around the American chestnut's restoration to eastern forests. He weighs the promises and pitfalls of the three most advanced restoration programs: the backcrossing of American and Chinese chestnuts to produce a blight-resistant hybrid; the breeding of the few American chestnuts that seem to possess blight resistance; and the genetic engineering of Darling 58. Indeed, as the USDA considers deregulating Darling 58, Davis warns against it, citing “the law of unintended consequences” as reason enough for researchers involved in the “chestnut restoration arms race” to take more time to study the potential side effects of “prematurely releasing GE trees into the wild” (212).I have a few quibbles. At times, the writing gets repetitive, especially in the six chapters detailing human uses of chestnuts, and his extensive discussion of sources sometimes detracts from the narrative flow. This reviewer would have liked to see more engagement with scholarship on the commons, specifically regarding nut harvesting and selling. Nevertheless, Davis has written the definitive environmental history of the chestnut, and I suspect it will remain definitive for some time to come.",

The agricultural ladder of success ranged from landowners at the top, to renters, sharecroppers, and finally agricultural laborers. Since African Americans as a group were kept on the bottom rung of the whole social structure, historians have tended to overlook distinctions among them. If historians discussed rural blacks of the Reconstruction era at all, they tended to view them as an undifferentiated mass of agricultural workers or, at best, as tenant farmers. This oversight has hindered historians' understanding of the time span in which tenantry was established. Furthermore, it has obscured the political struggles that existed between freedmen and whites in the postwar period, including white attempts to manipulate black land tenure through legislation, bureaucratic action, economic pressure, and terror, and African American attempts to negotiate fair labor practices.'",

    "abstract": "The creation of the United States Department of Agriculture marked an important watershed in both the history of American agriculture and of the federal government's involvement in that industry. It was then, in the 1890s, that the interests whose leaders championed the needs and wants of agricultural scientists began to win significant victories to shape both the new Department and the industry in the scientists' own image. As Alan I Marcus has argued in his stimulating account of the enactment of the Hatch Act of 1887, that bill represented a compromise between the advocates of systematic farming farming as a business who had largely dominated organized agriculture since the 1870s and the champions of agriculture farming according to truth as scientists might choose to portray it. The Hatch Act created the apparatus and appropriations for the agricultural experiment station nexus, meaning at least one experiment station in each state with a land-grant institution, and an Office of Experiment Stations within the Department in Washington. But the legislation did not mandate only research of interest to agricultural scientists. Its purposes included the acquisition and diffusion among the people of useful and practical information on subjects related to agriculture, a definite bow to the interests of systematic farming, as well as promoting scientific investigation and experiment respecting the principles and applications of agricultural science^ a definite weakness insofar as advocates of agriculture were concerned.'",

While war prisoners worked in a variety of crops and non-agricultural industries, one of the greatest concen tration of camps and captive workers devoted to a single crop occurred along the southern stretch of the Mississippi River. Cotton planters in Ar kansas, Mississippi, and northern Louisiana secured over twelve thousand war prisoners from 1943 to 1946. German and prisoners reinforced a labor system based on boundaries of color even as their presence in the fields revealed racial contradictions. Even as the inexperienced field undercut planter profits, exposed racial tensions, and undermined racial ized notions of work, their presence helped to extend the life of an exploit ative plantation economy. Despite the limited scope and dubious success rate of POW labor, cotton planters in the Deep South found a temporary workforce to hold a place on the plantation for African-American labor. ON A BLAZING SUMMER MORNING IN 1943, dozens of curious planters gazed across a field full of white men chopping cotton. These spectators had gathered at E. J. Mullens's plantation near Clarksdale, Mississippi, to witness an unusual experiment. With the cooperation of military officials, local planters had secured sixty prisoners-of-war from nearby Camp Como. When the POWs arrived by bus, Mullens put his regular hoe crew of black farmhands on one side of the railroad and the Italian hoe hands on the other. Noting that the workers operated JASON MORGAN WARD is a doctoral candidate in history at Yale University.

    "abstract": "Abstract In California history, the contributions of ethnic and immigrant agriculturalists continue to be misrepresented and misunderstood. Rural California studies are just emerging out of the shadow cast by Carey McWilliams’s 1939 exposé Factories in the Field, which cemented a monolithic image of white, detached owners of large landholdings running industrial farms, while people of color toiled without power, safety, or a livable wage. McWilliams was not necessarily incorrect, but the reality is far more complex. The following article seeks to recover some of the stories obscured by broad brush strokes of California agricultural history by examining the local dynamics of ethnic participation and interethnic cooperation in one agricultural region. While this work does not necessarily dismiss the economic relations that have been described in previous literature, it does challenge the racial and ethnic categorization of those relations and reveals the truly multicultural nature of the development of California agriculture. The evidence also prompts a reconsideration of nativism in local settings, especially in tight-knit communities with integrated industry, where the manifestation of nativist activity or sentiment was often subdued or qualified.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Modern environmental activists unified behind calls for a change in how humans understood their relationships with nature. Yet they approached their concerns through a variety of historical lenses. Countering arguments that suggest environmentalism had its deepest roots in outdoor leisure, the countercultural back-to-the-land movement turned to a markedly American practice of pastoral mythmaking that held rural life and labor as counter to the urban-industrial condition. Counterculturalists relied specifically on notions of simple work in rural collective endeavors as the means to producing a healthy body and environment. Yet the individuals who went back-to-the-land often failed to remedy conflicts that arose as they attempted to abandon American consumer practices and take up a \"primitive\" and down-to-earth pastoral existence. Contact with rural nature time and again translated to physical maladies, impoverishment, and community clashes in many rural countercultural communes. As the back-to-the-land encounter faded, the greater movement’s ethos did not disappear. Counterculturalists used the consumption of nature through rural labor as a fundamental idea in a growing cooperative food movement. The back-to-the-land belief in the connection between healthy bodies, environments, a collective identity helped to expand a new form of consumer environmentalism.",

While war prisoners worked in a variety of crops and non-agricultural industries, one of the greatest concentration of camps and captive workers devoted to a single crop occurred along the southern stretch of the Mississippi River. Cotton planters in Arkansas, Mississippi, and northern Louisiana secured over twelve thousand war prisoners from 1943 to 1946. German and Italian prisoners reinforced a labor system based on boundaries of color even as their presence in the fields revealed racial contradictions. Even as the inexperienced field hands undercut planter profits, exposed racial tensions, and undermined racialized notions of work, their presence helped to extend the life of an exploitative plantation economy. Despite the limited scope and dubious success rate of POW labor, cotton planters in the Deep South found a temporary workforce to hold a place on the plantation for African-American labor.",

In the 1910s Elinore Pruitt Stewart’s Letters of a Woman Homesteader and Oscar Micheaux’s The Homesteader minimized the hardships and exaggerated the benefits of homesteading. In the 1920s Ole Rolvaag’s Giants in the Earth reflected the public’s reduced faith in homesteading and rural life. In the 1930s the novels of Laura Ingalls Wilder and Rose Wilder Lane reflected conservative opposition to the New Deal. Mid-twentieth-century western novels and films about homesteaders reflected Cold War tensions and family values. Influenced by the women’s movement, the 1979 film Heartland highlighted the strength of women homesteaders. Early in the 1990s a back-to-the-land movement called “homesteading” flourished. The Hollywood blockbuster, Far and Away, and reality television programs like Frontier House tapped into this fascination with returning to the land and living as homesteaders did.",

Other states have likewise created plates to allow drivers to voice support for farmers. Like Virginia's \"Tobacco Heritage\" plate, many use traditional imagery and direct appeals to the history of agriculture. Given the United States' automobile culture, the plates are prominent, if small, works of public history that offer official sanction to a particular view of agriculture's past. In creating the license plate, the Virginia legislature valorized a particular telling of tobacco's past and is best understood as part of a much larger effort to employ history to deflect criticism of the tobacco industry. This effort, like the license plate, relied on simplified imagery that elided the complex history of tobacco in Virginia",

Steinbeck used frontier mythology to tap into American nostalgia for yeoman agriculture and anxiety about its perceived collapse during the 1930s. This essay explores the historical experience of Sallisaw, the Oklahoma community Steinbeck fictionalized in his novel. It argues that many aspects of Steinbeck’s work reflected reality, but that the roots of local farmers’ social and economic marginalization ran far deeper than he suggested. Furthermore, it demonstrates that struggling agriculturalists responded in a variety of ways to the catastrophe of the Depression, turning to federal relief, conservation, and marginal farmland when confronted with hard times.",

    "abstract": "In 1913 Clarence Poe, the editor of the Progressive Farmer, launched his infamous campaign to racially segregate rural North Carolina. Historians of comparative race relations have used Poe’s proposal as an example of the intellectual exchanges between South Africa and the US South. This article reinterprets Poe’s segregation campaign by placing it in the context of his decade-long engagement with the transnational Country Life Movement that spanned the Atlantic in the years before World War I. While visiting England, Ireland, and Denmark, Poe engaged with prominent romantic agrarian thinkers and encountered scenes of a harmonious, beautiful, and prosperous Anglo-Saxon country life that he longed for the South to emulate. In light of these influences, Poe’s fight to remove blacks from the rural South had less to do with imported racial ideas and more with Poe’s commitment to recreating the Irish countryside in the South. It was Poe’s romantic agrarianism that inspired him to spearhead what was, by all accounts, an economically misguided and morally repugnant policy.",

    "abstract": "Between 1838 and 1876 New Jersey market gardeners embraced new technologies and methods of cultivation to overcome the obstacles that space and seasonality placed in the way of marketing produce in New York City and Philadelphia. Farmers used technologies like the railroad, the tin can, and the hot bed to alter both seasonal growth cycles and the spatial arrangements between producers and consumers. Through strategies used to manage time and space, these farmers participated in the larger process of modernization that occurred throughout the United States and Europe in the nineteenth century. The fact that modernization was a rural process that market gardeners actively encouraged is important because geographers and social theorists typically define modernization and related issues of time and space as urban phenomena connected to large-scale industrial capitalism. This paper shows that New Jersey’s market gardeners encouraged innovative technologies and contributed to the development of modern industrial culture.",

While conflict over education was the main stimulus for the move, this paper argues that the migration also offered an opportunity to restore the system of land tenure Mennonites had practiced in Imperial Russia. Conservative Mennonites had reified a tsarist-imposed system of semi-communal land tenure, making it a requirement of faithful religious and social practice. These sensibilities were, however, incompatible with the land tenure system of the new Dominion of Canada giving rise to tension and conflict. When migration became a reality, conservative Mennonites sought to reestablish the colony and village tenure system by seeking a block sale of their individual lands in Manitoba and by purchasing land in Mexico under colony title, thereby restoring semi-communal land tenure.",

    "abstract": "The activities of Mexican banker and hacendado Zeferino Dominguez in the early twentieth century raise questions about the assumption that Mexico was merely the beneficiary of modern agricultural science developed in the United States. Dominguez was a banker and large landowner who turned his haciendas into private agricultural experiment stations, conducting research on better methods of growing corn, cotton, wheat, and beans with the labor ofhispeones. He shared his results through lecture tours and published works in Mexico and traveled extensively in the United States, speaking to groups of farmers and agricultural scientists about his methods of dry farming and corn propagation. He exhibited at agricultural fairs and exhibitions, attended Farmers's Institutes and conferences, and published a manual for use by average Ameri? can farmers. Like many agricultural reformers in the United States, he ad? dressed the problems of rural poverty and land concentration not with social? ism, but with visions ofa Mexico filled with small, capitalistic, home-owning farmers producing with scientific methods and business efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Early Spanish colonists in regions of northern New Mexico and southem Colorado sought locations where irrigation works could be constructed to make new settlements possible. Between 1867 and 1872 four Hispanic vil? lages, based on an economy of irrigation, agriculture, and livestock grazing, were established in the middle Rio Puerco valley, northwest of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Within a decade, overgrazing in the larger Rio Puerco water? shed initiated a process of erosion and entrenchment ofthe Rio Puerco that eventually led to the abandonment of three ofthe villages. The surviving vil? lage ofSan Luis has kept its sense of community alive despite environmental losses that brought an end to agriculture and severely limited the possibilities for raising livestock. San Luis's institutions of agriculture once provided its unique connection to place. The community now survives on faith, as it once survived on agriculture, and draws spiritual, ifnot actual sustenance from the land it hopes someday to reclaim.",

This area is home to some of the most productive wheatland in the nation, but because of constant farming activity on its steep slopes, soil erosion has been a problem since the turn ofthe twentieth century. Erosion threatened the long-term viability of farming in the Palouse and the economic health of greater eastern Washington. Local efforts at stemming the problem were nonexistent in the 1910s and 1920s, but after the depres? sion began, New Deal erosion control programs attempted to improve the erosion situation in the Palouse and countless other areas in the United States. A great deal oftime and money were devoted to the problem, includ? ing the construction of a USDA erosion experiment station in Pullman, Washington. However, federal erosion control efforts were only minimally successful, in part because programs to stop erosion were voluntary, not compulsory. Not enough farmers initiated or maintained soil conservation techniques, and Palouse farmers continued to endanger their most crucial natural resource.",

He moved to the USDA in Washington, DC, where he pioneer ed the field offarm management and helped establish cooperative programs that evolved into the Agricultural Extension Service.

He remained linked to his Missouri roots by participating in the National Grange his entire adult life, while he also was a member of the American Academy of Science and re? ceived an honorary doctorate for his pioneering work in genetics. The plant genetics work he participated in was largely responsible for agricultural over? production and ultimately the depopulation of rural America by the 1930s. He sought to resolve the situation with his plans for a national agricultural al? lotment program, which eventually became the foundation for federal farm programs. His books, The Law of Diminishing Returns (1924) and Balancing the Farm Output: A Statement of the Present Deplorable Conditions of Farming, its Causes and Suggested Remedies (1927), helped shape agricul? tural policies for decades.",

    "abstract": "The uses of enslaved labor outside the context of staple crop production be? come evident through an examination of colonial Somerset County, the southernmost Maryland county on the Chesapeake Bay's Eastern Shore. By the early eighteenth century, conditions in Somerset amounted to something of a paradox. The countys planters were thoroughly embedded in the larger Chesapeake plantation society and replicated, insofar as they were able, the features of that society, including the use of slave labor and cultivation of to? bacco. Yet poor soil conditions pushed residents to the edges of the tobacco economy. Unable to grow tobacco profitably, Somersefs men and women identified alternative export commodities that were more suited to the re? sources at hand, including lumber, meat, and ships. In addition, many Som? erset residents were active in an expanding coastwide trade that linked eco? nomic activity in the county to markets elsewhere in the colonies. Russo examines the allocation of enslaved labor in Somersefs diversifted economy using information drawn from judicial, tax, probate, and land records. Consideration ofthe evidence for Somerset County indicates that scholars need to devote more attention to the characteristics of slavery in anomalous areas that exist within broad staple-producing regions.",

Overall, the Greek government succeeded in incorporating these refugees economically and politically into the extant population. This paper explores rural refugee settlement as a productive force on the domestic economy and examines its impact on the rural markets of Greece. It also investigates how a poor, war-weary country with a population barely over five million provided land and employment in a largely successful effort to integrate almost six hundred thousand refugees into its agricultural labor market. The author further evaluates how Greece preempted the potential radicalization of the refugee vote through reform, repression, and the involvement of refugees in the hierarchical Greek political system.",

    "abstract": "This address is an exploration of a lifetime of disparate and often conflicting observations about how different people view what is right and good for agriculture, food, and farmers around the world. The exploration utilizes the concept of wicked problems to focus on the issue of differing historical interpretations of global agricultural development. Sandra Batie defines wicked problems as \"dynamically complex, ill-structured, public problems\" for which \"there can be radically different views and understanding of the problem by different stakeholders, with no unique 'correct' view.\" The wicked problem construct is applied to four core ideas in the history of agricultural development -- small farms, cash crops, agrarian ideals, and international development -- to demonstrate the potential for using this concept to approach complex problems of historical interpretation and contribute to solutions to the challenges of global agricultural development. The author suggests historians should acknowledge contradictory interpretations adn work toward reconciliation and synthesis, where it is possible and, where not, toward a clear explication of the basis for remaining differences. The author also encourages historians to seek multidisciplinary research opportunities that will help bring insights about historical context to policy deliberations.",

This period is revealing precisely because the reversal of fortunes in the Polish agricultural economy required the Polish government and some western counterparts to maneuver through periods of both agricultural advantage and disadvantage. Agricultural strategies as means and ends motivated the Polish, British, West German, and American governments to actions that bent, stretched, and limited some well-established practices in Cold War relations across divided Europe. By explicating the political consequences of changing flows of agricultural exports and imports in one specific context, this essay serves as case study of the role of agriculture in the global context of the Cold War.",

    "abstract": "This study follows the thread of gender divisions in dairying in Denmark and the American Midwest in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Gender organization of dairying shifted at this time in diverse European and North American contexts. As agriculture mechanized and production scale increased, access to advanced education and international markets became critical. Women, who had been in the forefront of the development of dairying, ceded their leadership to men as these changes occurred. While some scholars see this shift as a strategic loss for women, this study finds that variables of class, marital status, rural demographics, and alternative occupations mediated the rural women's experience of change. Not all women experienced the change as a loss. The question of which women were invested in dairying is critical to understanding the course of change. Increasingly, middle-class farm women were turning away from the hard work of dairying and investing themselves in new ways in the upward mobility of their family farms. Rural life shaped distinct gender patterns in European and American history, and the rural experience shaped the larger trajectory of women's economic and political evolution, even though few rural women were involved in the organized women's movement.",

In the early twentieth century, as long-settled families departed for urban employment, European immigrant families escaping the mines and mills bought abandoned farms. Motorized transport enabled farming families to send household members to the city each day and furnished them with a local market for their produce. This flexible combination of subsistence production, wage labor, and petty commodity production revitalized the rural economy and sustained the community in spite of the consolidation of the dairy industry. This essay explores the social changes that accompanied this profound reorientation of local life.",

Beginning in the 1890s the national government began to assume new responsibilities for natural resource management. By the end of World War I, Congress exercised some form of control over western irrigation, flood control, and range and mineral policies. Yet Progressive Era national policymakers were also deeply interested in wetlands drainage. In the early 1900s they launched an abortive movement to nationalize drainage in the hopes of creating new farms, improving public health, and relieving urban congestion. The failure of the movement illustrates that centralization, which scholars identify as a primary theme of Progressive Era conservation, was neither inevitable nor inexorable. Ironically, the growth of the embryonic administrative and regulatory state sometimes precluded the development of centralized natural resource programs by pitting different natural resource agencies, local communities, and constituent groups against one another in a bitter and irreconcilable feud over power and funding.",

    "abstract": "From 1950 to 1952 Harry S Truman invested significant personal effort and political capital in an effort to improve the circumstances of migratory farm workers and to revise the Bracero Program with Mexico. To this end, Truman created the high profile President's Commission on Migratory Labor in American agriculture in 1950. In its report, the commission recommended extending a variety of social legislation and economic protections to domestic farm labor, and it further recommended slowing or ending the importation of foreign, particularly Mexican, workers. The Truman administration energetically worked to convince Congress to act on those recommendations, even enlisting the support of the Mexican government. However, the power of growers' interests and the conservative bloc in Congress halted any significant reform. Instead, the Bracero Program was further institutionalized in the form of Public Law 78 and remained in effect for more than a decade thereafter.",

    "abstract": "Both missionaries and government policymakers in colonial Zimbabwe consciously identified agriculture as an important avenue in establishing broader paradigms of explanation. Missionary promotion of new farming practices inevitably challenged the existing spiritual landscape by insisting that rationalized individual labor could overcome powerful natural forces. This article examines various facets of the American-based Methodist Episcopal Church's agricultural evangelism in a period of growing state intervention. Despite careful missionary attempts to manage the outcomes, individuals with their own agendas absorbed and transformed these policies. Local farmers utilized imported agricultural knowledge for their own purposes and did not conform to the experiences or expectations of American-trained agricultural missionaries. Within these mission communities, converts successfully blended new forms of worship with existing social priorities and also adapted aspects of imported farming techniques to actively create innovative strategies for negotiating life under colonial rule.",

    "abstract": "With the opening of the Black Hills to white settlement in the mid-1870s, thousands of fortune-seekers made their way into Dakota Territory. George Edward Lemmon, a man later renowned as one of the world's most accomplished cowboys, was among them. During the 1880s his employer, the Sheidley Cattle Company, grazed thousands of cattle in western Dakota Territory, many of them on Sioux Indian land. Indeed, the company owed a great deal of its success to illegal grazing on the Great Sioux Reservation. Opportunists such as Lemmon supported Indian reservations because they could use those lands to make a profit. The interaction between large-scale white ranchers and the Indians of the Great Sioux Reservation provides insight into the development of the range cattle industry in the northern Great Plains and illuminates the motivations that led many ranchers to support, rather than oppose, the reservation system.",

But farm populations were often more resilient than the iconic photographs of the era suggest. While recent studies highlight that tenacity, less is known about the process of recovery and postwar growth. This paper offers a window on both. The evidence discussed here survives as a legacy of a long-lived, state-run agricultural statistics program in Kansas. The State Board of Agriculture conducted annual household surveys of farms between 1873 and 1981. Linked together over time, these farm-level surveys offer a detailed record of the residential and land-use histories of three communities, and they begin to illustrate how farm households met the challenges of the drought years and adjusted to the new agriculture in the post-World War II era.",

Unremarkable random seedling apples and \"high\" flavored English cider fruits were devalued. Late colonial consumers selected a range of sweeter, more versatile apples for fresh use and culinary preparations, others for drying, and many \"winter keepers\" for long-term storage. These trees were supplied by distinctive, horticulturally trained farmers who produced grafted trees as part of their mixed crop output. Demand for this first catalog of American apple trees exploded in the Ohio Valley, where surging farm establishment fueled commercial agricultural enterprises. By 1800 pioneer artisan horticulturists were selling America’s favorite cultivated apple tree varieties to frontier farmers while mythologized peddlers of unimproved, random seedlings contributed only marginally. By 1820 craft nurserymen marketed tens of thousands of grafted apple trees annually and were among the most commercially oriented farmers in the Old Northwest.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Beginning in 1878 with the International Phylloxera Convention of Berne, international conventions have sought to relieve national agricultural industries from two specific burdens. First, by defining phytosanitary practices to be enforced by national plant protection services, these conventions attempted to prevent the introduction of plant diseases and pests into national territories from which they were previously absent. Second, by standardizing these practices—especially through the design of a unique certificate of inspection—the conventions attempted to eliminate barriers such as quarantines affecting international agricultural trade. The succession of phytopathological conventions seemed to epitomize the coalescence of an international community against agricultural pests. What actually coalesced was bio-geopolitics wherein plant pathologists and economic entomologists from North America and the British Empire questioned the so-called internationality of the environmental and economic specificities of continental European agriculture, embodied in \"international\" conventions. Although an international phenomenon, the dissemination of agricultural pests provided opportunities for cooperation on a strictly regional albeit transnational basis that pitted bio-geopolitical spaces against each other. This article retraces the formation of these spaces by analyzing the deliberations of committees and congresses that gathered to define an international agricultural order based on the means to prevent the spread of plant disease and pests.",

It demonstrates that many agricultural communities in California, particularly so-called agricultural colonies, represent a unique rural suburban type labeled here as \"agriburbs.\" Agriburbs, such as Ontario, were communities consciously planned, developed, and promoted based on the drive for profit in emerging agricultural markets. Advertised as the perfect mix of rural and urban, they promised a superior middle-class lifestyle. On the one hand, agriburbs evoked the myths of agrarian security and virtue, a life on a farm in an environment that was good for both soil and soul. On the other hand, agriburbs were ideally urbane but not urban because of their many amenities that represented cultural symbols of modernity, refinement, and progress. An understanding of California’s agriburbs deepens an appreciation for both the growth and development of California at the turn of the twentieth century and the diversity of suburban types across the American landscape.",

    "abstract": "Historian Yesenia Barragan has produced a profound and cutting-edge interpretation of American freedom and unfreedom. In Freedom's Captives: Slavery and Gradual Emancipation on the Colombian Black Pacific, Barragan weaves a case study of Colombia into the larger fabric of Black Atlantic history. One of her major interventions is to rethink the significance of the early republican period in general and gradual slave emancipation in particular. These are well-known but rarely studied conjunctures, and the latter receives short shrift from scholars. Yet as Barragan asserts, Colombia's 1821 gradual emancipation law was a “relatively successful biopolitical experiment in social control” that generated a new racial order, new labor regimes, and new (if rarely fulfilled) antislavery sensibilities (22). This gradual emancipation rule, as Barragan calls it, took three main forms: self-purchase, public manumissions, and the so-called Free Womb provision. The book analyzes each from both the legal-political perspective and the perspective of the affected African-descended people. Together they shaped the possibilities of bondage and liberation for a generation.Freedom's Captives zeroes in on the Chocó, a relatively remote, rainforest-covered, and gold-rich province of northwest Colombia. Historically and to this day, the Chocó's population has been overwhelmingly of African descent, a legacy of Spanish colonialism, Atlantic slavery, and coerced gold extraction from the region's mineral-rich waterways. Yet as Barragan argues, the region's remoteness and mineral wealth opened possibilities for autonomy and even legal freedom for Afro-Colombians.Early chapters trace the rural and town-based worlds of both enslavers and unfree peoples of the Chocó, with a focus on the men who rowed boats and women who prospected gold along the infinite waterways of this jungle region. The story then zooms out to a national perspective of early republican legal and political cultures, with a focus on the 1821 gradual emancipation law at the Congress of Cucutá. At stake was the legal creation of the much-contested Free Womb provision, whereby a child born to an enslaved woman would at adulthood gain legal freedom but remained a “captive” until then (134). Barragan then returns to the Chocó to examine how these national legal changes informed the social calculus of Pacific lowlanders. The Free Womb captives endured an active market in the buying and selling of their unfree labor while self-purchase, the main route to legal freedom, fueled the extractive economy of gold mining. Public manumission ceremonies, despite their political and emotional charge, nonetheless reinforced the subordination of enslaved people. The book's narrative ends around final abolition in the early 1850s, when a new subsistence-based society took hold in the Chocó, much to the chagrin of Colombia's ruling classes.Scholars will find that the book has many strengths. For one, its constant comparisons to other country contexts add up to a thorough accounting of hemispheric changes in gradual emancipation. The comparative analysis is capacious and deeply integrated into every chapter. Barragan has read widely in the scholarship. I have not seen a monograph that so systematically introduces relevant interpretations of other countries. As Barragan points out, Colombians at the time were in conversation with other Americans about emancipation, hence our need to understand how Free Womb provisions and other abolitionist ideas circulated beyond Colombia. Students of comparative slavery and emancipation in the Americas will appreciate such thorough cross-country connections that are rarely made by historians, as well as the most up-to-date bibliography and synopses of the state of the field. But it is much more than that. The effect of reading this constant comparative framework is substantial. For the first time, the Colombian example feels properly integrated into the wider story of slave emancipation in the Americas. Barragan has placed the country at the forefront of the scholarship on the subject.On top of the important comparative analysis, the book is deeply researched. Barragan carried out work in six archives in four Colombian cities plus archives in Britain and the United States. (Investigating notarial records—notoriously byzantine—in the Chocó could not have been easy!) In addition to these manuscript collections, Barragan uses an array of historical newspapers and published primary sources. The result of such comprehensive research is a narrative that portrays the world of the Colombian Pacific in vivid detail. The everyday lives of free and enslaved rural lowlanders rise from the page. While warning us about the lapses and silences in the written record, Barragan has nonetheless reconstructed to a remarkable extent the stories of individuals struggling for freedom.A final strength is the writing. Barragan is a wordsmith. The care she has taken in crafting sentences shines throughout, making the book a pleasure to read. The grace of the prose only adds to the intellectual bounty of this important book.",

The introduction of agrochemicals in the mid-twentieth century was a watershed event for many Mayan farmers in Guatemala. While some Maya hailed synthetic fertilizers’ immediate effectiveness as a relief from famines and migrant labor, others lamented the long-term deterioration of their public health, soil quality, and economic autonomy. Since the rising cost of agrochemicals compelled Maya to return to plantation labor in the 1970s, synthetic fertilizers simply shifted, rather than alleviated, Mayan dependency on the cash economy. By highlighting Mayan farmers’ historical narratives and delineating the relationship between agricultural science and postwar geopolitics, the constraints on agriculturists’ agency become clear. In the end, politics, more than technology or agricultural performance, influenced Guatemala’s shift toward the Green Revolution.",

    "abstract": "This richly illustrated and engaging comparative study focuses on visual representations of plantations in three frontier zones of economic expansion during the nineteenth century: the world of cotton in the lower Mississippi Valley of the United States, sugar plantations in the interior of Cuba, and the coffee zone in the Paraíba Valley of Brazil. Each region became a world leader in the production of their respective crops during what one of the authors (Dale Tomich) has called the “second slavery,” the period after 1800 when increased technological and transportation developments, new forms of land management, and new systems for organizing labor resulted in a significant increase in commodity production and the mass movement of enslaved peoples into these regions. The authors emphasize that “world economic conditions” such as industrialization, population growth, and urbanization drove demand for these crops and fueled agricultural expansion in the three regions, but that local environmental conditions and the demands of different crops gave rise to distinct plantation forms and landscapes in each.In outlining economic forces and agricultural developments, the authors synthesize clearly and effectively the rich literature on cotton, sugar, and coffee plantations that has emerged over the past several decades. What distinguishes their work in this book, of course, is the attention to images of the landscapes that resulted from these developments: the maps, plats, paintings, lithographs, and photographs of plantations, buildings, machinery, and enslaved people, many reproduced in full color. Their goals are twofold: to explore “how visual documents help us to understand these landscapes” and to examine what “such landscapes tell us about the history of the commodity frontiers of the second slavery” (145). In doing so, they move beyond what they see as a limitation of many existing landscape studies, namely the focus on “landscape” as an abstract idea divorced from “any specific material, social, or historical content or context” (5). Such studies may call attention to how landscapes (and representations of landscapes) can articulate power relations, but they do not explore fully the specific historical circumstances in which those relations emerged. That is the focus here.The book is divided into two sections, each with three chapters, one for each region. The first section focuses on the development of plantations and plantation agriculture. The authors make excellent use of regional maps to illustrate different patterns of landholding, the expansion of commodity frontiers across space, and the transportation networks (river and boats, trains, and mules) needed to link plantations to markets. The second section explores the economic and spatial layout of plantations. The analysis of the images here is especially rich. There are some maps, but paintings and photographs are more prominent. The authors offer clear and insightful commentary on these various images as they explain how the spatial layout of plantations and plantation buildings reflected the physical and environmental conditions needed to grow various crops, the labor routines involved in production, and the technological developments that facilitated rapid increases in output. Images of work logs and gin houses in the Mississippi Valley, steam engines and vacuum pans in sugar ingenios, and the drying terraces on coffee fazendas in Brazil all dramatically illustrate new modes and spaces of production on plantations. Even familiar images, such as scenes from a cotton plantation that appeared in Harper's Weekly in the 1860s, are analyzed in the context of work, space, and labor control.While the discussion of images of plantations and plantation operations in each region is illuminating, the comparative framework makes the book especially valuable. Maps of the Cuban and Brazilian plantations, for example, depict a group of structures at the center of those estates that were central to the production process while no such grouping appears on maps and plats of cotton plantations. Likewise, images of barracks housing enslaved people on coffee plantations, which developed in response to the expanded scale of production, and the placement of those barracks differed significantly from the individual structures that housed enslaved people and the spatial layout of cotton estates. In short, the authors' focus on how global economic forces interacted with local environments to reshape the landscapes of these three regions, and their argument that critical attention to images can reveal how those transformations played out on the ground, make an important contribution to our understanding of the period of the second slavery in various parts of the Americas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The New Deal resettlement communities appear in the literature as efforts to ameliorate the wretched condition of southern sharecroppers and tenants.However, those evicted to make way for the new settlers are virtually invisible in the historic record. The resettlement projects were part of larger efforts to modernize rural America. \"Modernization\" is a complex process whereby a relatively specific set of assumptions and behaviors make other assumptions and behaviors \"wrong, \"both morally and pragmatically. The removal of former tenants and their replacement by FSA clients in the lower Mississippi alluvial plain — the Delta — reveals core elements of New Deal modernizing policies, exposing key concepts that guided the FSA’s tenant removals: the definition of rural poverty as rooted in the problem of tenancy; the belief that economic success entailed particular cultural practices and social forms; and the commitment by those with political power to gain local support. These assumptions undergirded acceptance of racial segregation and the criteria used to select new settlers. Alternatives could only become visible through political or legal action — capacities sharecroppers seldom had. However, in succeeding decades, these modernizing assumptions created conditions for Delta African Americans on resettlement projects to challenge white supremacy.",

    "abstract": "Historians have noted the importance of chattel-mortgage financing in nineteenth-century Midwestern agriculture, including its contribution to farmer distress but have not examined its icidence, purposes, or practices in detail. Here the authors describe chattel mortgages in the town of Springdale, Dane County, Wisconsin between 1848 and 1900, focusing on the borrowing and lending practices of the farmer householders listed in the population and agricultural federal census shedules of 1860 and 1880 and relating them to economic development, production patterns and the ethnocultural backgrounds, tenure and gender of the farm operators. They provide comparative data on the extent to which the farmers also borrowed on landed security. They include two detailed case histories of unsuccessful chattel borrowers but also show the importance of chattel credit in the agricultural mechanization that occured during these years. This type of credit involved smaller principal sums than land credit but was a significant element in the business and commercial processes of the town and although more costly than land credit the difference was apparently less than has been suggested on the basis of experience elsewhere in this era. Farmer distress as reflected in foreclosures was greatest here at earlier dates than those of the Populist Era",

    "abstract": "The article addresses the question as to whether manorial estates in pre-plague England were responsive to market stimuli, as the authors of a 1993 study have argued based on a model originally proposed by the nineteenth century agricultural economist Johann von Thunen. By testing three hypotheses referring to the degree of commercial orientation, levels of intensity regarding various inputs, and the spatial configuration of field systems, the paper concludes that the productive profiles of these estates did not conform very closely to the expectations of von Thunen's model. The explanation lies in the fact that, having access to the seigneurial prerogative of tapping into their peasants' resources, manorial estates were not hard pressed to maximize profitability through a drive towards efficiency",

    "abstract": "Native Americans and white ranchers/farmers in eastern Montana and western South Dakota have often been in conflict over natural resources, such as water and grazing lands. But in the 1970s, the two groups began to develop a common interest in protecting the rural environment from large-scale development. Since the 1980s, they developed a series of interethnic environmental alliances that successfully opposed coal and uranium mines, bombing ranges, and other outside threats to their lands and cultures. A common defense of the local place provided a path out of historic natural resources conflicts. Alliances tended to be initiated by traditionalist and activist Native Americans who strongly asserted their tribal identity at the same time as they built bridges to white neighbors around common environmental concerns. This approach simultaneously strengthened a recognition of difference and similarities between Native and non-Native communities. The grassroots alliances promoted a territorially based, multiethnic place membership to build cooperation across racial lines, rather than state-sponsored reconciliation programs. Continuing cultural and economic differences made individual alliances difficult to sustain, although the series of alliances progressively improved relations between certain local communities",

    "abstract": "The 1950s are often described as an anxious period in American history. Sometimes that anxiety was fed by fears about juvenile delinquency. In the Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota, public apprehension was fueled also from an influx of Mexican people brought to the region by the rapidly expanding sugar beet industry. To address these perceived threats, state and local public officials, civic organizations, and the sugar industry launched a campaign to replace Mexican migrant laborers with local teenage workers. Hence, the number of Mexican people in the region would be re? duced significantly, while teenagers were provided jobs that would keep them out oftrouble. The Youth Beet Program (YBP) failed as a barrier to Mexican migrants; the teens simply could not produce as well as the migrants. The communities did believe the YBP helped discourage juvenile delinquent be? havior. Therefore, the YBP functioned into the 1970s.",

    "abstract": "Rural credit in the Bohemian crown lands of the Habsburg monarchy be? came available on a wide scale only after the abolition of serfdom in 1848. Although organized to serve municipal interests, savings banks and SchulzeDelitzsch credit cooperatives initially provided rural credit, primarily in the form of mortgage loans. Such local financial institutions embraced a social mission ofaiding the poor and promoting small producers, while seeking to encourage economic modernization and Czech national revival. Strengthening the economic position of small agricultural producers fit in with both the socioeconomic and national motives of local financial institutions in the 1860s and 1870s. With the agricultural depression of the 1880s, however, agrarian leaders criticized credit cooperatives and savings banks for promot? ing urban interests over those of their rural customers, and new financial in? stitutions, particularly Raiffeisen-type cooperatives, were founded in the 1890s and 1900s to better meet the credit needs of small farmers. These new coopera? tives contributed to the growing political and economic integration of the peasantry into the Czech national life.",

    "abstract": "Scholars have recognized World War I as a time of crisis for German Americans. The government's campaign against the hyphen and for 100 percent Americanism threatened all ethnic Americans but espacially those of German descent. This essay examines the wartime events in two rural German catholic communities in central Minnesota and asserts the power of local culture to shape the communities' response to the nativism unleashed by the war. More specifically, the war exacerbated pre-existing conflict between area farmers and members of the village merchant class. This played out politically. Merchants wre supportive of the loyalty campaign and tried to control its impact, while area farmers broke from a tradition of antipathy to populist politics and rushed to join the newly established Nonpartisan League. These differences expressed conflicting material interests, but they also reflected a growing community-wide debate over the meaning of local identity and the content of local culture. That the merchant class failed during the war to challenge significantly the communities' island debate-indeed the merchants' own interests precluded a closer alliance with the larger national community-speaks to the tenacity of ethnic culture in the countryside and its ability to support resistance to larger hegemonic forces",

These farmers, responsive to the constraints of the mountain landscape that surrounded them, tended to rely on less invasive, century-old technologies to work their fields. Although contemporaries widely disparaged this way of life, the records of these communities reflect a long history of viability and suggest that the ecological basis ofupcountry agriculture was strong. This ar? ticle, which is part of a larger project that studies the transition from small farms to publicly owned forests in Appalachia, analyzes the agricultural pat? terns within five Blue Ridge Mountain hollows and the economies of subsis? tence farming in the early twentieth century.",

Some growers had tens of thousands of vines under cultivation and produced wine and brandy that, according to contemporary accounts, rivaled the ftnest wines of Mexico or even Spain. As the century wore on, the fruits of the vine increased in importance in comparison with other agricultural products. In most years only maize competed with wine and brandy as the most valuable agricultural crop. So important were these commodities to the economy of El Paso that every year as many farmers grew grapes to produce wine and brandy as any other product. Traditionally, most of the annual production was consumed locally, although there was a brisk export trade south to Chihuahua and north to Albuquerque and Santa Fe. This trade continued until the annexation of Mexican territory north of the Rio Grande following the Mexican War in 1848. Wine continued to be produced on both sides ofthe river until the first decades ofthe twentieth cen? tury when the combination of population growth and salination of the soil ended an industry that had flourished for two and one half centuries.",

He moved to the USDA in Washington, DC, where he pioneered the field of farm management and helped establish cooperative programs that evolved into the Agricultural Extension Service. Spillman, an iconoclast of sorts, straddled the rural world of empirical thinking as well as the world of professional science. He remained linked to his Missouri roots by participating in the National Grange his entire adult life, while he also was a member of the American Academy of Science and received an honorary doctorate for his pioneering work in genetics. The plant genetics work he participated in was largely responsible for agricultural over-production and ultimately the depopulation of rural America by the 1930s. He sought to resolve the situation with his plans for a national agricultural allotment program, which eventually became the foundation for federal farm programs. His books, \"The Law of Diminishing Returns (1924)\" and \"Balancing the Farm Output: A Statement of the Present Deplorable Conditions of Farming, its Causes and Suggested Remedies (1927)\", helped shape agricultural policies for decades.",

Using triangulation surveys, engineer Charles Southworth produced a series of maps that abetted the enactment of the Florence-Casa Grande Project of 1916. Using a combination of Pima voices and modern GIS analysis substantiates that the Pima were versatile in responding to severe water deprivation a century ago and adapted by scaling back the amount of land they cultivated, eliminating the least productive lands from cultivation, and relocating or abandoning villages. More critically, the Pima shifted their agrarian practices from waterintensive crops to less intensive crops, such as small grains. Letting Pima voices speak for themselves gives credence to an indigenous perspective of these traumatic events. Thus, combining a Pima voice and modern technology illustrates the depth of hardship facing the Pima a century ago. FOR THE PIMA, AGRICULTURE HAS always been more than a means of earning a living. It has been a way of life that has defined their very essence as Akimel O'otham, or People. In the latter years of the nineteenth century, events beyond their control disrupted the Pima DAVID H.

The development of private fishponds as an increasingly important component of American mixed husbandry practices in long-settled areas by the end of the eighteenth century illustrates early American farmers' ability to successfully adapt to self-wrought changes in their physical environment.",

    "abstract": "In California history, the contributions of ethnic and immigrant agriculturalists continue to be misrepresented and misunderstood. Rural California studies are just emerging out of the shadow cast by Carey McWilliams's 1939 expose Factories in the Field, which cemented a monolithic image of white, detached owners of large landholdings running industrial farms, while people of color toiled without power, safety, or a livable wage. McWilliams was not necessarily incorrect, but the reality is far more complex. The following article seeks to recover some of the stories obscured by broad brush strokes of California agricultural history by examining the local dynamics of ethnic participation and interethnic cooperation in one agricultural region. While this work does not necessarily dismiss the economic relations that have been described in previous literature, it does challenge the racial and ethnic categorization of those relations and reveals the truly multicultural nature of the development of California agriculture. The evidence also prompts a reconsideration of nativism in local settings, especially in tight-knit communities with integrated industry, where the manifestation of nativist activity or sentiment was often subdued or quali",

This article uses Minor's diary, the only extant document of its kind for the seventeenth century, to reconstruct key features of the colonial New England agrarian experience. Arguing that work played as significant a role as religion in shaping early New Englanders' lives, the article examines not only how farming contributed to the Minors' economic prosperity and independence, but also how its physical demands and seasonal rhythms shaped Thomas Minor's worldview more generally. Agriculture provided an important context for Minor's relations with his wife and sons, with nature, and even with a sense of his own mortality. Minor emerges as someone less interested in calculating profit and loss on his farm than in accomplishing a hard day's work as a steward of the land that he hoped would support his family for generations to come.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the mid to late nineteenth century, the agricultural periodical emerged as a major new medium for circulating information. In colonial settings it proved particularly important, as settlers often lived remotely from the markets for their produce, and they did not have existing farming traditions to rely upon. This paper traces the early history of agricultural periodicals in New Zealand and considers their position relative to other potential sources of farming instruction, such as agricultural colleges and the state. Through a case study of New Zealand’s first agricultural periodical, the \"New Zealand Country Journal\" (1877-1898), it then examines what kinds of information was being circulated, the sources of that information, and how this helped to shape farming practices in a \"new\" land.",

Southern cultivators burned tracts of forest growth to quickly release nutrients into the soil. After five or six years, when the soil had been depleted, the old field was abandoned for as long as twenty years. Environmental factors such as poor soils, rugged topography, and livestock diseases accounted for the persistence of this practice, more so than slavery or the availability of western lands. Shifting cultivation slowly declined in the postbellum era, but southern farmers continued to improve a far smaller percentage of their land well into the twentieth century.",

Both wealthy landholders and Indigenous agricultural workers experimented with discursive elements as they attempted to draw state authorities to their side. Following their debates also inverts the normal view of power relations. The landholder, General Francisco Gómez de la Torre, presented himself as a victim, while his workers used various combinations of class and ethnic discourse to mobilize their base and gain sympathy from outsiders. The failure of government officials to support Gómez de la Torre exposed significant cracks in the ruling structures, which Indigenous workers learned to exploit. These conflicts reveal that the Ecuadorian government was not as hegemonic as is sometimes assumed; it was an arena of competing projects and interests with political officials often at odds with one another. At the same time, subaltern resistance was also not homogeneous, and divisions between Indigenous workers challenge a simplistic picture of a unified counter-hegemonic discourse. As a result, state power formed a showcase for many different groups to present and contest their social and economic interests.",

Progressive reformers responded to this crisis with various suggestions meant to more firmly attach youngsters to their rural roots. Among the many solutions advocated were rural youth organizations. The Farm Boy Cavaliers of America, which also enrolled girls, pursued a more innovative path than most, emphasizing not only entertainment and instruction, but also a high degree of economic education and independence for farm children. The program offered an alternative to the Boy Scouts, which Dexter D. Mayne, the organization's founder, believed to be unsatisfactory and inappropriate for farm youth. Ultimately, the organization may have promoted too much freedom for the rural youth, advocating behavior that parents could not approve of or afford in the cash-strapped early days of the century.",

    "abstract": "In early modern Brandenburg-Prussia, feudal lords (Gutsherren) were primarily the owners of both large estates that required peasant labor and large forests from which they were obligated to supply their peasants with life’s necessities. This paper examines the practice of timber granting to peasants in the sovereign demesnes of the Kurmark Brandenburg from 1650 to 1850. To challenge the general understanding that peasants both remained dependent on timber grants and abused them until approximately 1800, this paper investigates the increases in peasants’ share of the building costs for their farmsteads and the positive effects of timber regulations in the eighteenth century, including self-regulation by peasants. In addition, while previous studies have accentuated the peasants’ thefts of wood after losing their entitlements to the lords’ forests due to the reform legislation of the early nineteenth century, this paper presents cases in which peasants successfully retained their entitlements, gained payment for timber grants, or afforested their own land.",

    "abstract": "The character of local exchange has long assumed an important place in the historiographical debate on the capitalist transformation of the American countryside. Whereas that character has been carefully examined in nearly every rural corner of the United States, it is poorly understood in the context of early agricultural California. Based on a systematic analysis of the diaries of one California farmer, this essay explores the everyday, local exchange practices of ordinary farmers, especially among neighbors. It finds farmers relying on one another extensively for a wide range of goods and services and maintaining dealings that assumed both commercial and non-commercial characteristics. It argues, moreover, that such findings reinforce criticisms of how scholars have traditionally defined early California’s rural economy and that they challenge some of the dominant paradigms in rural American historiography that characterize the nineteenth-century economy either in essential terms or in terms of an uneasy coexistence of ambivalent systems.",

But at the time and since the effectiveness of rural rehabilitation has been overshadowed by the political fight over the FSA’s survival and the more ambitious (and controversial) resettlement program. Examined in terms of the practical goals of reducing rural poverty, rather than as a gauge for political and ideological trends, the FSA had decidedly modest results. Some of this can be attributed to the limitations and restrictions imposed by hostile political forces and a stingy Congress, but as this essay shows, much of the fault lay within the FSA, as it struggled to define goals and carry out anti-poverty programs for some of the poorest people in America.",

A closer examination suggests otherwise. Rather than engage in traditional agricultural pursuits, agricultural colleges now seek to employ science to produce managers of living biological and ecological systems, managers who will prevent degradation and generally achieve results that ultimately approximate a steady state. Rural America receives markedly little attention in these colleges. This managerial ethos has also overtaken the scholarly discipline of agricultural history. Health and longevity, sustainability and environmentalism have assumed center stage. Whether deliberate or en passant, these new metrics have first supplemented and, in many cases finally supplanted, race, gender, and class as useful categories of historical analysis. The new agricultural history has victims, but it lacks people.",

Poe was driven by the desire to help struggling white farmers, and he believed that the segregation of the countryside was necessary for these farmers to acquire land and build tightly knit rural communities. He had been introduced to the notion that the countryside could be segregated by Maurice Smethurst Evans, an influential white South African politician and author who had played an important role in shaping the preApartheid system of segregation in South Africa. In exploring why Evans’s ideas appealed to Poe, this essay illuminates the goals and international roots of rural segregationist ideology in the American South. Rural segregationist thinking, which historians have not yet fully engaged, was quite different from the strain of Jim Crow in circulation in cities.",

Contrary to prevailing academic views, this paper demonstrates that the 1851 gold discoveries set up favorable economic conditions for commercial domestic crop growing, including wheat production. The spread of wheat farming was especially rapid in the hinterland Central Victorian goldfields region. The undeveloped system of overland transportation granted newly established local farmers immunity from outside competition, whilst cheap land and application of labor-saving harvesting machinery lowered the production cost of wheat. By the early 1860s the colonial wheat frontier had moved far inland to the edge of the vast virgin plains bordering Central Victoria to the north. This shift would greatly simplify later largescale northern agricultural settlement, when Victoria turned into a large wheat exporter.",

The railroads and local real estate boosters promoted central Washington’s desert as an orchard paradise, “where dollars grow on trees,” but the reality was far different. While prospective growers had been told that lush orchards were a simple product of nature, irrigated farming required a large input of capital, a high degree of horticultural expertise, and lots of hard work. The conflict between nature and the manmade landscape was evident in the efforts of growers. Instead of being a place of easy wealth, novice orchardists were often frustrated by their new landscape and the pressure to conform to industrialized methods. Although the Washington apple industry was ultimately successful, many growers struggled and failed due to lack of capital and expertise.",

    "abstract": "JOAN THIRSK, THE DOYENNE OF BRITISH rural history, died on October 3, 2013. She was ninety-one. Joan’s record of research and writing lasted for more than sixty years, and she was important to British and continental European historians for several reasons. In her work on the early modern period, she demonstrated the use of a much wider range of documentation than had hitherto been employed to reveal local variations in farming and rural economies and the explanations for them. In particular, she pioneered the use of probate inventories to identify regional farming systems and trace the processes of innovation and saw her methods subsequently expanded upon and computerized. She also opened up a new area of research in the medieval origins of open-field farming when she wrote two articles on the subject in the 1960s, and the rich vein of subsequent historical and archaeological work on the subject owes a great deal to her questioning of the original orthodoxy. At virtually the same time, she also wrote one of the articles that stimulated interest in the linkages between agriculture and industry and consequently opened up the debate around the question of proto-industrialization. More recently, she introduced the concepts of alternative and mainstream agriculture to compare late twentieth-century agricultural changes with similar periods back to the fourteenth century. Her final book, written when she was in her eighties, found her branching out into food history. And all this had to be fitted into a full life of teaching, editing, postgraduate supervision, reviewing, and raising a family. Joan was the daughter of Daisy and William Watkins and was born and raised in North London. After attending the Camden School for Girls she went, in the early years of the Second World War, to Westfield College, University of London, to read French and German. Her undergraduate studies were interrupted after a year by military service and, as a result of her knowledge of German, she became a subaltern in the",

    "abstract": "In 1907 baseball's promoters decreed that Civil War hero Abner Doubleday created the game in the village of Cooperstown, New York, in 1839. Baseball thus acquired a distinctly rural American origin and a romantic pastoral appeal. Skeptics have since presented irrefutable evidence that America's pastime was neither born in the United States nor was a product of rural life. But in their zeal to debunk the myth of baseball's rural beginnings, historians have fallen prey to what Annales School founder Marc Bloch famously called the \"idol of origins,\" and all but neglected the very real phenomenon of rural baseball itself. The claim that baseball has always been \"a city game for city men\" does not stand up to empirical scrutiny anymore than the Doubleday myth itself, as this address demonstrates with three case studies -- Cooperstown in the 1830s, Davisville, California, in the 1880s, and Milroy, Minnesota, in the 1950s. Baseball may have been a source of rural nostalgia for city people, but it was the sport of choice for farmers and a powerful cultural agent.",

On one hand, the field has shifted from being one enjoyed and pursued by a wide variety of people, including government bureaucrats, agricultural scientists, economists, politicians, intelligent laypeople, and academic and public historians, to being one dominated by professional historians and a few other academics. On the other hand, the sub-discipline has been transformed from one with a fairly narrow focus on agricultural politics, economics, and technology, into rural history, a broader and more inclusive subdiscipline focusing on social and cultural history but including much more.1",

    "abstract": "Between the American Revolution and the 1840s, silk cultivation was pursued enthusiastically across the United States. Although scorned at first, silk's republican virtues were rediscovered and rearticulated in the antebellum era by a range of proponents. Owing to an evolving infrastructure that integrated the press, the post, and agricultural societies, the appeal of silk drew in farmers and manufacturers of all classes and across many regions. Their disparate circumstances and motivations made a peculiar interest group, but one that secured considerable political and promotional support. More than just an exercise on paper, American silk was widely produced, thanks especially to the labor of women. Eventually, the far-flung community of sericulturists fell prey to environmental and labor-related limitations. But the speed of their downfall, linked to a speculative bubble in mulberry trees, was also due to the distinctive features of their agricultural reformism and its creative relationship with credibility.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding assumption posits that white ranchers from the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue, now Haiti, provided the knowledge to establish the first cattle ranches in Louisiana in the mid-eighteenth century, that blacks merely provided the labor, and that the herding ecology involved was the same as that of the Acadian ranchers who followed.Reconstruction of the locations of the first major ranches and the backgrounds of their owners and slaves, however, reveals that none of them came to Louisiana from Saint-Domingue and that the ranches occupied the western margin of the Atchafalaya basin, an environment quite different than the prairies of southwestern Louisiana later inhabited by Acadian ranchers.While the sources cannot yield a complete account of the process through which cattle ranching became established, they do suggest that none of the white ranchers brought relevant experience from the Caribbean or France, that some of the blacks might have brought such experience from Africa, and that people of African, European, native, and mixed origins all contributed knowledge and creativity, as well as labor, in founding a distinctive herding ecology that differed substantially from that of the subsequent Acadian ranches.A 1766 LOUISIANA CENSUS RAISES THE possibility that blacks might have played a major creative role in establishing cattle ranching in that part of North America despite the longstanding assumption that white ranchers from the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue, now",

    "abstract": "In the nineteenth century many farmers kept a diary of the farming year to record such features as the weather, crop yields, animal husbandry, and prices. Research into church and people in the parishes of Fordyce and Portsoy in North East Scotland led to the discovery of a four-volume journal kept by James Wilson, a farmer in the Banffshire Parish of Deskford between 1879 and 1892. This journal provides a detailed picture of many aspects of rural life including farming, family, neighbors, religion, friends, and entertainment. Moreover, Wilson wrote poetry and kept a record of his lectures given to the local Mutual Improvement Associations. Taken together, the journal, poems, and lectures provide a significant body of literature giving insights into rural society. The journal also covers an important period in farming at the nexus between a time of \"high farming\" and the agricultural depression of the late nineteenth century.",

Skillfully combining the methods and findings of policy history with those of policy analysis can produce a synergy with great value for both disciplines. Examples drawn from more than twenty years experience with the USDA illustrate key principles for positive crossfertilization between study of the past and of the present. From historical analysis, these principles include disciplines of evidence-based analysis and skeptical inquiry using diverse sources, breadth of vision regarding context, and the perspective of time. From policy analysis, they include the disciplines of statistical methods, awareness of the multiple interacting components of policy formation, and the impacts on analysis and decision-making of working from the present without knowledge of what is to come.",

This process has generally been understood as the application of the American agribusiness model to the European livestock sector through the direct and vertical connection between large feed companies and local farmers. Spain is a good place to test this idea, given the phenomenal expansion experienced by its livestock sector in the second half of the twentieth century and the strong influence large multinational, particularly American, feed manufacturers had on this growth. Oral histories offer insight into the microeconomic forces at work in the recent development of Spanish livestock farming and highlight the role of local entrepreneurs in the establishment of livestock agribusiness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In contrast to both the critique of rural backwardness made by the Country Life Movement and the lament about rural declension expressed by proponents of agrarianism, the history of the Nanticoke Valley of south-central New York State demonstrates the possibilities for rural revitalization that lay in new connections between the countryside and the city. In the early twentieth century, as long-settled families departed for urban employment, European immigrant families escaping the mines and mills bought abandoned farms. Motorized transport enabled farming families to send household members to the city each day and furnished them with a local market for their produce. This flexible combination of subsistence production, wage labor, and petty commodity production revitalized the rural economy and sustained the community in spite of the consolidation of the dairy industry. This essay explores the social changes that accompanied this profound reorientation of local life.",

    "abstract": "Abstract \"Federal Reclamation and the American West in the Twentieth Century\" looks at four phases in the history of the Bureau of Reclamation. The first phase lasted from the adoption of the Reclamation Act of 1902 into the 1930s. In those years, the bureau attempted to create small family farms by bringing water to the desert lands of the West. That effort failed, in part because farming was becoming less attractive in the United States during the early decades of the 20th century, in part because irrigation was too expensive, and in part because the bureau made many mistakes in administering the 30 projects it created. A second phase of the bureau’s life began in the 1930s, with the \"high dam era.\" From 1930 into the 1950s, the bureau’s mission became inconsistent as it strived to serve a new constituency, city dwellers and industries on the Pacific Coast, at the same time it continued to push the family farm. The bureau entered a third phase of life after World War II, when the power it generated became identified with winning the Cold War against the Soviet Union and agribusiness eclipsed the family farm in the West. Finally, once big dams began to look too expensive and like \"old technology,\" the bureau recreated itself into an agency which now claims to work in the interest of protecting the environment and serving as the West’s \"water broker.\" The Bureau of Reclamation, which has done as much as any federal agency to build the modern American West, has shown an amazing ability to pursue inconsistent objectives and to recreate itself.",

    "abstract": "Although most Americans enjoy a plethora of food choices, as well as an abundance of foods throughout the years, most of this food is processed and travels a long way to our tables. In exchange for plentiful food, evidently, we have given up local and regional sources and supplies of food. Since about 1930, the trend toward centralization, standardization, and specialization has discouraged local production in food, as it has discouraged local and regional production in other industries. This essay considers how this process occurred in perhaps the most archetypical agricultural state (Iowa), to understand how national trends played out on a small stage, and how Iowans responded to these pressures. In the last few years, local and regional food producers have begun to rebound in reaction to these trends.",

In order to support their small herds of cattle, these individuals relied on unfettered access to grass and especially water, a resource in short supply on the semi-arid prairies of Texas and Alberta. Larger ranchers and cattle syndicates resented the challenge posed by the settlers andfeared the competition for water and grass. Supported by officials in Austin and Ottawa?who favored rapid industrial development on the Plains?cattlemen seized con? trol of the range by fencing pastures and water holes and evicting squatters. When homesteaders resisted this exclusion, government authorities dispatched their rural constabularies?the Texas Rangers and the North-West Mounted Police?to protect a closed but embattled range.",

However, the violence in rural Iowa from 1930 to 1933 became far more widespread, insidious, and personal than these two nationally cover ed mob incidents. The most extensive violence during the early Depression years involved hired hands and family members attacking and killing each other on scattered farmsteads, bandits robbing vulnerable country folk for their hidden money, gangsters stealing from small town banks, prohibition officers raiding rural stills, or farmers hanging themselves from barn rafters. The climate of financial fear, whether real of exaggerated, added to this overall morbid tension, and mid? western rural society no longer projected an idealistic image of strength, peace, and prosperity but rather one offear and violence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Radio was one of several technologies that early twentieth-century reformers promoted as a means of modernizing and improving rural American life. Although the new medium was introduced in the 1920s, it was during the Depression decade of the 1930s that most rural families bought their first set. With the coming of radio, formerly isolated rural homes had access to world news, current weather and market reports, and a host of USDA-produced agricultural programs. However, it was the national network entertainment programs with their many advertisements that promised Depression-era rural listeners a better tomorrow in the form of a modernized urban consumer lifestyle. This article explores the coming of radio to rural areas during the 1930s and reviews some contemporary industry research findings on rural radio usage and consumer behavior.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the environment and agricultural activity in the Palouse, a fertile, hilly prairie in the inland Northwest, during the Great Depression and World War II. This area is home to some of the most productive wheatland in the nation, but because of constant farming activity on its steep slopes, soil erosion has been a problem since the turn of the twentieth century. Erosion threatened the long-term viability of farming in the Palouse and the economic health of greater eastern Washington. Local efforts at stemming the problem were nonexistent in the 1910s and 1920s, but after the depression began, New Deal erosion control programs attempted to improve the erosion situation in the Palouse and countless other areas in the United States. A great deal of time and money were devoted to the problem, including the construction of a USDA erosion experiment station in Pullman, Washington. However, federal erosion control efforts were only minimally successful, in part because programs to stop erosion were voluntary, not compulsory. Not enough farmers initiated or maintained soil conservation techniques, and Palouse farmers continued to endanger their most crucial natural resource.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Post and rail fences had a relatively minor role in England in the eighteenth century, primarily to protect young hedges. However, they rapidly became the most advanced form of fences in the new Australian colonies founded in 1788 and later. The key feature is that thinned tenons on the ends of rectangular split rails fit closely into mortises cut in the rectangular split posts. Post and rail fences were widespread but never common because of the high cost, lack of secure land tenure, and ubiquitous use of shepherds to guard against predatory dingoes. With the introduction of cheap iron wire in the mid-1850s, farmers and pastoralists gained many advantages from fencing their boundaries and paddocks. By 1900 post and rail fences were obsolete technologically, although farmers built decreasing numbers up to the 1960s. More recently, many people are relocating old post and rail fences onto peri-urban subdivisions and erecting new ones to create a rustic appearance. Post and rail fence use in advertisements and other media shows that they have achieved a new status as an icon of rural Australia.",

Second, it addresses a related problem that has a much longer history of human poisoning, but that turned out to have quite unexpected causes in New Zealand. From this analysis, the historic bases on which present-day science funding policies were \"reformed\" in the 1990s are questioned.",

    "abstract": "A new thirst for paint and color in cities made extensive flax production profitable in the northern Great Plains and Prairies and contributed to the cultivation of the most fragile grassland ecosystems. The production of flax seed for linseed oil became an early spin-off of the Prairie wheat economy but, unlike wheat, flax vanished from old land after one or two rotations and reappeared in districts with the most new breaking. Officials explained the migrant crop as preparing native grasslands for cultivation or exhausting soil in old land, but farmers brought flax to their new breaking for other reasons. Producers would only put flax on any land when a range of economic and environmental conditions were in place. It was never sown without promise of adequately high prices or in the absence of affordable seed and other inputs. When price allowed, it usually appeared on new breaking because it could be planted later and transported further without upsetting the balance of other activities and without farmers learning many new techniques. Scientists discovered that diseased soil drove flax off old land, not soil exhaustion. Circumventing the disease was possible but costly, and farmers simply replaced flax with the next most lucrative commodity.",

    "abstract": "In the second half of the nineteenth century, lumbermen logged the virgin pine forests of northern Michigan. The assumption was that the \"plow would follow the axe,\" and agriculture would dominate the region as it did in the southern half of the state. When farming did not quickly take root, William James Beal and Liberty Hyde Bailey led an expedition of scientists and journalists on a trip across northern Michigan in June 1888 to collect botanical samples, to find a site for a state forest reserve, and to recommend appropriate farming enterprises. This essay contends that without a key reforestation advocate in charles Garfield the explorers focused too much on the questions related to botany and agriculture.While agriculture would ultimately thrive in some parts of the cutover, much of the region was unsuitable for intensive farming. The failure of the scientists to convey these limits adequately in newspaper articles and subsequent reports allowed for their work to be used by agricultural boosters throughout the region. The result was a cycle of erosion, fire, and farm abandonment that proved to be a political problem in Michigan for the first three decades of the twentieth century.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article draws attention to the unfolding debate concerning forest cover loss, climatic change, and declining cocoa production in the Gold Coast (Colonial Ghana) during the early twentieth century. It argues that, although desiccationist theory was prevalent, its acceptance among colonial authorities in the Gold Coast was far from hegemonic. There were important dissenting colonial voices, particularly among agriculturalists, who argued that declining cocoa yields were due to plant diseases, most notably cocoa swollen shoot disease. It was based on the latter’s non-environmental model of disease transmission, rather than the premises of desiccation science, that the government’s postwar \"cutting out campaign\" of cocoa was predicated. Nevertheless, the foresters ’ correlation of the deterioration of cocoa areas with fears of desiccation was not without its effects on state practice, providing the rationale for an accelerated program of forest reservations in the 1930s.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Green Revolution of the 1960s brought about a dramatic rise in global crop yields. But, as most observers acknowledge, this has come at a considerable cost to biodiversity. Plant breeding, synthetic fertilizers, and mechanization steadily narrowed the number of crop varieties commercially available to farmers and promoted fencerow-to-fencerow monocultures. Many historians trace the origins of this style of industrialized agriculture to the last great plow-up of the Great Plains in the 1920s. In the literature, farms in the plains are often described metaphorically as wheat factories, degrading successive landscapes. While in many ways these farms were a departure from earlier forms of husbandry in the American experience, monocultures were quite rare during the early transformation of the plains. Analysis of a large representative sample, based on manuscript agricultural censuses and involving twenty-five townships across the state of Kansas, demonstrates that diverse production reached even the most challenging of plains landscapes.",

However, in several parallel attempts of New Deal agencies to reform and reclaim, scholars can find examples where socioeconomic and ecological evidence intersects.

In July of that year Reclamation Service (RS) was established to carry out provisions of new law by developing reclamation projects in West. The degree to which RS succeeded in its objectives is historically important: Paul Gates has called Newlands Act one of most significant mea? sures in shaping development of West while R. Douglas Hurt identi? fied it as the most important land legislation since Homestead Act.1 The Newlands Act specified that no entryman on a federal reclamation project was entitled to more land than may be reasonably required for support of a family. F. H. Newell, RS director, explained reasons for this provision: the object of reclamation law is primarily to put public domain into hands of small landowners?men who live upon land, support themselves, make prosperous homes. While some established land? owners intended to profit from act and lobbied RS officials to that end, in vicinity of reclamation projects themselves it was nevertheless com? monly understood that the original purpose of Reclamation Act [was]",

    "abstract": "In the decade before the California Gold Rush, the popular idea that Americans held a natural right to land as a legacy of the American Revolution was enriched and expanded by such events as the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island, the Anti-Rent War in New York, the flood of Irish refugees into New York City, growing opposition to the expansion of slavery into new territories acquired during the war with Mexico, and the Revolution of 1848 in Europe. These events strengthened popular sovereignty and the notion that human beings had rights that transcended those defined by legislatures, courts, or even constitutions. They also promoted a new discussion of how values within the United States differed from those in Europe-where land was scarce and served as the foundation for aristocratic regimes and sharp class differences. The squatter was a ubiquitous figure on every frontier of the United States, but none more than California, where both town sites and agricultural land were covered by Mexican land grants that took decades to define and confirm. This article tells the story of how powerful forces in California undermined squatter rights-and the heritage of the American Revolution as well.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In 1872 the Argentine state founded the Argentine Meteorological Service (AMS) as an appendage of the National Observatory. Under the guidance of US astronomer Benjamin Apthorp Gould and his successor Walter Davis, the AMS created a national network of amateur weather observers spread throughout the nation and even past the nation's nineteenth-century borders. The AMS proposed to state officials that in time the weather data could help to better understand Argentina's environmental and climatological diversity and have significant political and economic influence on the nation's future. This article examines the AMS's foundation and development, placing it within the Argentine nation-state building process of the last third of the nineteenth century. It argues that the state used weather observation more as a tool of expansion, as in the case of Patagonia, than as a scientific endeavor. In the Patagonian territory of Chubut, settlers and soldiers who completed weather observations argued that their findings demonstrated Patagonia to be a region of limitless agricultural possibilities, even if the truth was far from that.",

    "abstract": "Ariel Ron's Grassroots Leviathan is an uncommonly important book that sizzles with originality and incisive connections. Using a rich array of primary sources ranging from antebellum newspapers and agricultural journals to the treatises of prominent agricultural reformers and political economists, Ron shifts northern antebellum agriculture from the periphery to the heart of nineteenth-century American political economy. He shows it to be a dynamic, impactful force in US politics and economics instead of a declining, atavistic sector far removed from the centers of power and the thrust of economic modernity. In so doing, he does for northern agricultural reformers what an earlier generation of historians did for the Populists: he recaptures a surprisingly important and nuanced sociopolitical force that has often been unfairly dismissed, caricatured, or ignored.Ron divides his study into four sections. The first part describes the origins of northern agriculture reform in the early 1800s and the patrician patronage that undergirded it. This section also elucidates the breakdown of that elite-led movement in the face of the democratizing tendencies of the 1820s. The second section explores agricultural reform's revival in the 1840s, but also how the tenets of northern agricultural reform—with its faith in scientific and technical solutions—later came to align so snugly with Republican Party ideology. Using Henry C. Carey in particular, Ron outlines what he dubs the “Republican developmental synthesis,” which posited technological agricultural improvement as beneficial to and benefiting from industrial development, not antagonistic or adjacent to it (97). Thus Ron explains the future Republican Party's appeal in both the urban and rural North and foreshadows his later argument for the salience of agricultural policy in inflaming the sectional crisis.The third part explains the reformers' attempts to enlist federal funding and organization for agricultural education in the 1850s as resulting from the failure of private initiatives and lower-level governance. Farmers wanted authoritative agricultural expertise, but the many purveyors of antebellum agricultural advice were unreliable. Seeking to reduce misinformation, reformers mobilized to put agricultural science and education on more rigorous foundations. But though the 1840s and 1850s witnessed the establishment of numerous agricultural schools, these struggled mightily to stay solvent from private donations and state government funding alone. This inspired reformers to press Congress to found federally funded agricultural colleges and to create a federal Department of Agriculture, efforts that would thrust northern agricultural reformers into direct conflict with the slavocracy.The final portion reveals just how much northern projects for agriculture reform exacerbated the sectional divide. Southerners spent the 1850s furiously fending off what would become the Morrill Land-Grant College Act and the creation of the federal Department of Agriculture (USDA), both of which had to wait for secession to be implemented. Though slaveholders often couched their dissent in constitutional cavils, the real wellspring of their opposition arose from the conviction that both initiatives were stalking horses for northern free labor ideology and abolitionism. In Ron's view, such suspicions were valid, as these ostensibly nonpartisan schemes were anything but. Ron cites the large readership of the Patent Office's annual agricultural report, which were among the most widely circulated texts in the nation. Southern slaveholders realized that such a platform, in the hands of a full-fledged federal department with a heavily Northern constituency, would likely be inveterately hostile to slavery and undercut them among Southern yeomen. Slaveholders also were characteristically dubious about the need for the supposedly master class to be further educated in agricultural matters. Ron powerfully illustrates this point by summoning the words of Andrew Calhoun (John C. Calhoun's son) on the cusp of the Civil War. The junior Calhoun proclaimed that the slaveholder did not need “government aid” to direct their plantations, lest that destroy “manly self-reliance” and lead to the diminution of Southern power and prosperity (199). His fervent objections, and those of many other prominent Southerners—like Jefferson Davis, who thought these projects of agricultural reform “fraudulent”—amply support Ron's contention that agricultural reform was intimately linked to the sectional fissure.Though its contributions to understanding the sectional crisis stand out, the book has many other insights. For instance, Ron's epilogue identifies new research directions: the gap between the USDA's 1862 founding and its mid-1880s expansion, with all the intervening turbulence of Reconstruction, has never been explored in depth. The book is also chock-full of interesting tidbits, such as the “Merino Mania” sheep-importing craze of the early 1800s, or Thomas Jefferson's hatred of dogs. My one critique is that Ron's rendering of northern agricultural reform features little from the everyday farmers that supported it, which felt a bit odd given his stress on its character as a mass “social movement” (44). However, his top-down gaze is sensible, given his emphasis on agricultural reform's national political significance. All told, this is an excellent book that will inform not only historians of American agriculture but also those interested in the growth of the American state, the early Republican Party, and the Civil War.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of the American Civil War, the Confederate embargo of cotton exports, and Union blockade of cotton ports led to short-time working and significant distress in the cotton districts of Lancashire. It was a pivotal moment in the history of the global textile trade. Surprisingly, the topic has attracted little attention and been the subject of even less debate. Jim Powell has written a highly readable and sometimes polemical account that addresses this gap. In doing so, he takes a wide-ranging perspective that goes beyond the crisis of the war years to investigate the structure of the global textile trade, the strategy of industry leaders, and the relationship between capitalism and slavery. The juxtaposition of local and international events means the book will appeal to historians of Liverpool and the global textile trade alike. The focus naturally is on transatlantic trade, the American South, and cotton as an export crop. Along with historians of agriculture, commodities, and trade, students of industrial northern England will gain valuable, new perspectives.Powell's perspective is international, giving due recognition to recent interpretations of the evolution of the global cotton market by Sven Beckert, Giorgio Riello, and Prasannan Parthasarathi. Chapter 1 reviews their arguments and surveys the evolution of the cotton trade to the eve of the Civil War, including the prewar boom that flooded Lancashire's markets, and profiles those who stood to gain or lose from a sudden interruption in cotton supplies.Managing and responding to uncertainty was certainly a perennial issue for the Lancashire textile industry, and even before the war, its leaders sought to reduce dependence on American cotton. Their strategies secured neither a united response nor government intervention, notwithstanding the claims of Beckert's Empire of Cotton (2015), which Powell's evidence strongly contests. As he explains in chapter 2, the search for alternative sources was unrealistic. Their relative unattractiveness confirmed Lancashire's dependency on American cotton for reasons of quality and price, despite being vulnerable to interruption in supply. That in turn left Lancashire susceptible to speculation, which amounted to betting on how long the war would last. As chapter 3 shows, following an initial period of complacency, there was a middle period of endemic speculation before a collapse in prices in September 1864.There is a consensus among textile historians that reduced production during the war was the consequence not of reduced supply but of overproduction in the three years prior. Chapter 4 questions this view, arguing that rising raw cotton prices caused by the shortages made new production unattractive when markets were already well stocked with cheaper intermediate and final products. As a result, the Lancashire cotton industry emerged from the war significantly smaller than it might have been, effectively losing the equivalent of four years' average growth. Chapter 5 questions the assumption that Liverpool was sympathetic to the Confederacy, showing that sympathies were split according to business interests. If anything, financial and commercial players had stronger ties with the Union. In another significant divide, most merchants wished for a swift end to the war, whereas speculators wished for its prolongation. The length of the war exceeded expectations, and speculators profited accordingly. Liverpool brokers, notionally the agents of the spinners, enriched themselves, as explained in chapter 6, by trading on their own account and in both buy- and sell-side transactions, thereby profiting at the expense of Manchester and the rest of Lancashire. Selling brokers and banks profited exceptionally from the speculation. Sell-side profits drew brokers into increasingly exposed positions, reliant on short-term bank finance, which, as chapter 7 illustrates, led to several bankruptcies once prices began to fall.Price was a crucial determinant of cotton-trade dynamics and structure, a factor neglected in prior interpretations. It explains why American, as opposed to Indian, cotton remained the dominant supply source before and after the war. Following the end of slavery, the cotton supply continued as before and at lower prices. The concluding chapter shows how technical and institutional changes, independent of the war and its effects, transformed Liverpool. The transatlantic cable, the creation of a clearinghouse, and the establishment of a futures market were Liverpool's 1860s equivalent of London's Big Bang of the 1980s. The changes were intended to control speculation. Whether they succeeded is not examined here, nor are the subsequent market corner operations that posed new threats to Liverpool's reputation and price stability in the manufacturing hinterland. These events are beyond the reasonable scope of a book that offers an accessible and insightful account of the impact and changes wrought by the crisis of the early 1860s and makes a significant contribution to the wider history of cotton.",

    "abstract": "The Anthropocene—with its changing climate, rising sea levels, and deteriorating glaciers—has been accompanied by a rising interest in the wilds of the world. People are flocking to the outdoors. High places in particular are valuable commodities, now overrun by tourists in Sprinter vans. As Caroline Schaumann laments, “we are destroying the very thing we love” (290). Our desire to both enjoy the mountains and save them from overuse had its origins in the nineteenth century, fostered in part by the earliest of alpinists. In the end, Peak Pursuits asks, “What do we gain from putting our bodies in contact with mountains?” (292).From the beginning, Schaumann attempts to answer this question by looking at the bodily experiences of early mountaineers. She begins with Alexander Humboldt and Horace-Benedict de Saussure, moves through the main Victorian scientist-mountaineers and authors (James David Forbes, Louis Agassiz, John Tyndall, Edward Whymper, Alfred Wills, Albert Smith, and Leslie Stephen), and ends in the American West, with Clarence King and John Muir. The characters are all familiar, but their treatment by Schaumann is fresh. Steeped in literary analysis, she focuses not only on their mountain moments but also on their textual representations. It is both a history of mountaineering and a history of the invention of climbing narratives.So, what can we learn from these foundational figures and their writings? The answer, surprisingly, is mixed. In some sense, they experienced mountains vastly different from our own, ones without receding glaciers or Sprinter vans. As Schaumann states, “we can no longer follow in these mountaineers' footsteps or look at their writings as feasible answers to our own dilemmas” (296). Yet these early mountaineers cherished their mountain experiences, writing about them in ways that “remain exemplary and relevant” (296). There are still lessons to be learned from following, if not their footsteps, then why and how they formulated justifications for their actions in print.Schaumann seems caught. “What can we learn?” she asks. “Nothing at all and quite a bit,” she seems to answer. It is the perfect lesson from this incredibly well-written and fascinating book, because it is how the author describes all of the protagonists in Peak Pursuits. They are all bedeviled by ambiguity, shrouded in contradictions, paradoxical in all their actions—just like all humans.The contradictions in these early mountaineers abound. While they approached the supposedly unsullied spaces of mountains with reverence, they also purposefully promoted mass tourism and its often destructive consequences. While they helped popularize the benefits of mountain wanderings, they consciously targeted specific groups, fostering an elitist and exclusionary vision of alpine landscapes. Much of this is still with us today.Humboldt went to Chimborazo to attain a scientific worldview, only to be stuck in a snowstorm, unable to use his instruments. Saussure likewise bemoaned the lack of views on Mont Blanc and his own bodily limitations. Schaumann shows the tensions that existed as these scientist-mountaineers struggled to attain summits and practice science; they could not do both and often did neither. Similarly, Whymper and Tyndall often used the military language of conquest in their writings, though their experiences betray a lack of control, where danger and chance predominate. Muir sought solitude but helped usher in the capitalistic exploitation of mountain environments and a definition of wilderness and conservation that helped facilitate the expulsion of Native American populations.As Schaumann pulls out these contradictions, she also unravels further frictions hidden barely beneath the written word. Several subthemes rise to the surface. One is the importance of bodily experiences, how these mountaineers wrote about the way they felt, saw, and touched the material world. In some of the most illuminating passages in the text, Schaumann links this directly to today's new materialism (in the case of Tyndall) and to our recent focus on biosemiotics and ecocriticism (in the case of Stephen).Another one of the more fascinating subthemes is the homoeroticism apparent in the writings of these masculine heroes. Capitalizing on the popularity of dime-store novels about the frontier, King's writing helped establish the emerging myth of the rugged American West. Thus, it fostered a vision of the mountaineer overcoming the harshness of alpine regions through perseverance and manliness. Yet, like Humboldt and others, King was a complicated character, entering alpine regions to live beyond the conventions of his day. Schaumann gestures to the male intimacy they found there, from Humboldt's relationship with the Creole Carlos Montufar to Tyndall's relationship with Tom Hirst to King's relationship with James Gardner.Though all of these contradictions defy easy explanation, through a critical reading of their texts, one gains a feeling of intimacy with these early alpinists. I love this book because it does two things that needed to be done: it transforms these ephemeral characters into living, breathing, complicated people, and it transforms their narratives into sophisticated, layered, and challenging literary texts. Why they went to the mountains and what they did when they got there—what they felt, saw, and imagined—does indeed help us to imagine why we need to go the mountains, and what we need to do once we return.",

    "abstract": "The field of rural history—especially rural women's history—is one that has seen exponential growth over the past two decades. The newest entry into this field from historian Cherisse Jones-Branch is not only an important contribution to this scholarship, but it also reasserts regional history's importance to the larger context of rural history. Rural women in the South, and especially African American women, were active in civil rights, reform, and activism, helping their communities at the local, regional, or state levels. Many of their stories and names are well known, while others are waiting to be remembered. This was especially evident in Arkansas; African American women sought to change and uplift their communities. These women whom Jones-Branch “lifts . . . from the obscurity of Arkansas rural history” navigated through, fought, and challenged the deep racism and segregation prevalent throughout the state (5). In Better Living by Their Own Bootstraps, Jones-Branch skillfully navigates five decades of these women's achievements, their struggles, and the evolution of their work.The book's main focus, as the title suggests, is on the women themselves. As Jones-Branch emphasizes throughout her book, the women she examines came from different areas of life. Their professions included home demonstration agents, professionals, teachers, club members, and agricultural laborers. They organized, responded, collaborated, and created, but most importantly, their work helped to change Arkansas's rural life. The majority of the women worked collaboratively and were engaged with the individual residents and communities for which they were advocating—in one of her examples concerning home demonstration agents, Jones-Branch notes, “they were mindful of how important it was to respect rural African Americans and earn their trust” (69).During the early to mid-twentieth century, rural Arkansas women faced hunger, health problems, financial and environmental crises, and job scarcity, in addition to the burdens of racism and segregation. Jones-Branch assesses how these women used reforms, education, direct challenges to the status quo of inequality, and other methods to create change and opportunities in their communities. Clubs or organizations like the Arkansas Association of Colored Women and the Arkansas Farm Bureau Federation's Negro Division were either created or existing ones utilized to foster more support, resources, and strength for the communities they were seeking to uplift and help.Jones-Branch follows previous works by LuAnn Jones, Melissa Walker, Rebecca Sharpless, Debra Reid, and Carmen V. Harris, to name a few. This rural and agricultural history literature is echoed in her sources, as well as the extensive primary sources she employs. One of the most fascinating aspects of Better Living by Their Own Bootstraps is that she focuses two of her chapters on mini biographies of two specific women—Ethel B. Dawson and Annie Zachary Pike. These two women had different approaches to their activism. Dawson used religion to encourage rural community uplift and Christian doctrine when defending or justifying her work to help empower African Americans who were working in agriculture as mechanization and farming technology continued to advance. Pike, or “Ms. Annie,” and her husband owned a considerable amount of farmland, with tenants and up-to-date farm technology, and they became politically active at the state level in the Republican Party. She was eventually appointed to the state welfare board, advocated for African American laborers and education, and ran for a state senate seat in the early 1970s.Any criticisms of this book are minor. One example is the brief mention of the 1919 Elaine Massacre early in the book, which is not fully defined until chapter 12 despite falling earlier in the book's timeline. Perhaps a clarification of this significant event would have been helpful to the reader if it had been discussed in an earlier chapter, since this local event is one that continues to reverberate. However, overall, Cherisse Jones-Branch has written a book that is confident in its materials and narrative. More importantly, the book introduces the rural African American women who fought for their neighbors and communities to have better lives and better opportunities against entrenched racism and discrimination. Better Living by Their Own Bootstraps is a welcome addition to the fields of southern women's history, rural history, agrarian history, and African American history.",

    "abstract": "The current climate crisis has prompted significant growth in the field of energy history. Yet even as the number of energy historians expands, their analyses of human energy use remain narrowly focused on the behaviors of only half the human population. Scholars who investigate the history of fossil fuel use and its consequences still concentrate largely on the activities of male inventors, industrialists, engineers, laborers, and policy-makers who produced, marketed, used, and regulated energy in public spaces. The contributors to In a New Light successfully challenge this male-dominated narrative. In their examination of the transition to fossil fuel dependence in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Western Europe and North America, the essayists consider energy transformation from the perspective of educators, interior designers, homemakers, and other women whose activities revolved around household energy use. As the editors note in their introduction to the collection, this volume “unapologetically returns the historians' gaze to women's domestic lives as a way of deepening our understanding of gender in the history of energy, and energy in the history of women and gender” (6).The cover of In a New Light features a woman's hand reaching to pull the chain of an electric light fixture, and the generation and use of household electricity figures prominently in the volume. Following Ruth W. Sandwell's opening essay, in which she analyzes the relative absence of women in energy historiography, Karen Sayer discusses in chapter 2 the ways in which English women used and adapted candlepower prior to the introduction of gas and electric lighting. In chapter 3, Sandwell examines Canadian women's concerns about kerosene lamps, gas-powered stoves, and other combustible household devices, noting that electric companies exploited these fears when they advertised the safety of electric-powered equipment. Abigail Harrison Moore, in chapter 4, looks at the advice that women interior designers dispensed to middle-class housewives as they arranged newly gas-equipped or electric-powered homes in late Victorian England. Chapter 5 moves into the twentieth century, with Graeme Gooday's discussion of the ways in which women engineers and educators worked through organizations like the Electrical Association for Women to promote the electrification of British households. In chapter 6, Sorcha O'Brien employs oral history research to examine the electrification of rural homes in post–World War II Ireland, while Petra Dolata focuses on postwar West Germany in her chapter investigating how women in the Ruhr region experienced coal as a salable commodity, a direct household power source, and ultimately a generator of household electricity. Vanessa Taylor concludes the collection with a chapter considering energy modernization in mid-twentieth-century Britain, which included the expanded use of electrical appliances. With a particular focus on midcentury Scotland, Taylor drives home the point that women as well as men have contributed to the current global climate crisis.In addition to the seven essayists, an eighth historian makes a major contribution to In a New Light: Ruth Schwartz Cowan. Essayists cite Schwartz Cowan's study of household power transition in the United States, More Work for Mother (1983), more frequently than any other secondary source. These numerous references to Schwartz Cowan's scholarship inevitably draw the reader's attention to the volume's major drawback: not a single chapter focuses primarily on women's experience in the United States, the Western nation with the largest carbon footprint.For readers interested in rural and agricultural history, another shortcoming is the volume's relative inattention to the unique experiences of women in the countryside. Although the book's coeditor Ruth W. Sandwell and contributor Karen Sayer are prominent rural historians, they do not specifically focus on rural developments in their chapters on Canada and England. Vanessa Taylor includes the rural Highlands in her larger examination of midcentury Scotland, but only Sorcha O'Brien's consideration of postwar Ireland exclusively investigates household energy use in a rural context. Employing oral histories that she and other interviewers collected in the late 2010s among women in their seventies and eighties, O'Brien indeed sheds new light on the electrification of Ireland's countryside in the two decades following World War II. While previous oral histories of Ireland's rural electrification scheme centered on the recollections of male engineers, O'Brien and her colleagues record the memories of female energy consumers whose adoption of new appliances produced some unexpected results. Elderly rural women express nostalgia for the delicious bread they baked slowly over turf fires before they acquired modern kitchen ranges, but they retain no such sentiments for the heavy laundry work they performed before the arrival of power washing machines. As O'Brien notes, the popularity of modern washing machines among rural Irishwomen made them must-have items in Irish farm homes. The appliances even became bargaining chips when women negotiated the terms of marriage. Women increasingly refused to marry farmers who would not invest in the electric power and modern plumbing systems that enabled use of washing machines. In a society that prohibited married women from using birth control, teaching school, or working as a nurse, Irish farm wives' demand for electric washing machines represented a significant act of female empowerment.By including women in the story of energy transformation, O'Brien and the other contributors to In a New Light successfully meet their goal of complicating and enriching the literature of both energy history and the history of women and gender. While the volume lacks sufficient attention to the experiences of rural women and those in the United States, it will hopefully inspire other scholars to pursue investigations that fill those voids. With any luck, this collection will usher in a wave of scholarship devoted to the role of women in the history of energy use.",

    "abstract": "This article offers a reassessment of the New English Weekly: A Review of Public Affairs, Literature and the Arts (1932–1949). In contrast to previous assessments, which have looked predominantly at its agricultural content within the period 1939–1949, this article focuses on the organic issues it featured from 1934 onward. In doing so, it highlights that the journal facilitated the evolution of the British organic movement throughout its existence. By situating the journal in the context of organic husbandry in the 1930s–1940s it examines some of the central concerns of the organic movement, including: soil erosion, soil fertility, nutrition, and health. Crucially, it also reveals some of its more everyday preoccupations with culinary skills and recipe books. Finally, it illustrates that a detailed examination of the journal reveals some of the forgotten figures and documents of the organic movement.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the ideologies shaping the first cooperative venture between the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI), focusing the BIA’s role as a labor contractor and the Pima’s efforts to exert control over the conditions and valuation of their economic participation. Examination of the bureaus’ records and extant testimonies of Pima leaders deepens contemporary understanding of the common aims of government officials and Pima farmers, the sources of tension among these stakeholders, and the mechanisms by which Pima laborers adapted economic strategies to maintain cultural continuity. Although sometimes working in synergy, the aims of the bureaus and local Anglo farmers more often compromised the economic aims of the Pima even as the BIA and the press acknowledged the debt to the native laborers cultivating exotic crops in southern Arizona.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the nature and meaning of sugarcane arson in Cuba during the first four decades of the twentieth century. In the scholarly literature as well as popular memory, the illegal burning of sugarcane has been seen as an important means by which marginalized groups, such as slaves, rebels, bandits, and striking workers, challenged the established order during times of political and social upheaval. Sugarcane arson, however, was not just a tactical measure utilized during extraordinary moments, but was intrinsic to the island’s sugar economy. Despite varied efforts by government officials and plantation managers to prevent cane fires, a number of groups— including colonos (cane farmers) as well as cane cutters—regularly ignited sugar fields for their own purposes. Using sugarcane arson as an analytical lens thus provides a more nuanced picture of agrarian relations in prerevolutionary Cuba.",

    "abstract": "In 1986 the field of Costa Rican history underwent a dramatic shift thanks to Lowell Gudmundson's pathbreaking Costa Rica before Coffee. The title of Gudmundson's most recent publication highlights the connection the author makes between these two monographs. In Costa Rica after Coffee, Gudmundson examines the role coffee cooperatives played in creating conditions that supported the upward mobility of small-scale coffee farmers in the post–1948 Civil War era. Additionally, he considers the political, demographic, and geographical consequences of this triumph. This analysis builds on Gudmundson's work in Costa Rica before Coffee, where he demonstrated how coffee's introduction in the mid-nineteenth century transformed Costa Rica, by ushering in a period of widespread prosperity. Indeed, this crop provided both small and large landowners with the conditions for economic advancement.In just over one hundred pages Gudmundson ambitiously seeks to historically define three processes of considerable importance to contemporary Costa Rican society. First, he explores how small- and medium-scale coffee producers successfully organized cooperatives in the post-1948 period and the broad socioeconomic consequences of their efforts. Second, Gudmundson interrogates the causes and consequences of reduced coffee production in more recent decades. Last, he sets out to uncover what can account for the dramatic political shift from a Social Democratic to a Center-Right political platform on the part of the nation's once dominant National Liberation Party, or PLN.At first, the PLN's transformation may appear unrelated to the issues of cooperative development and declining coffee production, but Gudmundson skillfully makes use of census data, probate records, oral histories, participant observation, and a variety of secondary sources to convincingly argue that these processes are deeply intertwined.The book's introduction and first chapter provide readers with a basic overview of Costa Rica's post-1948 political history. Gudmundson examines the fundamental role small- and medium-scale coffee producers played in securing the PLN's political victories after 1948. The PLN courted farmers’ votes through populist ideals, anti-communist rhetoric, and policies that supported the formation of coffee cooperatives.In chapters 2 and 3, Gudmundson researches the first generation of cooperative farmers. These chapters underscore the social transformation that the cooperatives brought their members, who invested in the dream of a cooperative to process their crops. Gudmundson concludes this analysis by arguing that the coffee boom of the 1970s, which saw production rise alongside coffee prices, affirmed to many observers that the PLN's social democratic model of agrarian-centered, cooperative-based development had succeeded.In 1989, the system would implode with the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement, or ICA. Chapter 4 analyzes how farmers adapted to this dramatic event, which saw global coffee prices plummet. Post-ICA, the emergence of private microbeneficios that process small quantities of beans in situ allowed farmers to create new opportunities based on quality. These microprocessors participate in annual competitions for “best coffee” awards. The consequences of winning are real. Indeed, a 2017 winner was paid $8,000 for each fanega of coffee they sold, while the average producer earned just $140 per fanega. In 2015, microprocessors received over a third of the annual harvest. The microprocessors’ focus on quality and their ability to generate profits have clearly allowed them to chip away at the cooperatives’ once near monopoly on coffee processing.In chapter 5, Gudmundson explains how the first generation of cooperative farmers’ prosperity permitted their children to earn university degrees and contribute to the formation of a new economy ripe with opportunities for educated workers. An unintended consequence is that coffee farmers today are aging without heirs to replace them, leading many, especially in the Central Valley, to sell their farms to developers. Gudmundson argues that as coffee production has steadily declined, aging farmers and their professional children have increasingly come to see free trade, decreased social spending, and other neoliberal policies as favorable to their interests. In this context, the PLN's recent rightist turn might best be understood as a reflection of a broader shift in the economic and political outlook of this party's traditional base.Gudmundson deserves high praise for not only producing a smartly argued monograph but doing so in just over one hundred pages. The book, however, is dense, requiring sustained attentive reading despite the clarity of Gudmundson's prose. Ultimately, Costa Rica after Coffee affirms Gudmundson's prominent position in the field of Costa Rican studies and promises to become required reading for Costa Ricanists. This book additionally will appeal to Latin Americanists interested in the process of cooperative development.",

It argues that the constant threat of drought and other climatic disasters created a state of climate precarity for workers. In the variable climate of the Great Plains, these disasters could not be forecast, and employers instead shunted climatic risk onto impoverished migrants, whose contracts were ad hoc, informal, and could be made, completed, or broken in a matter of hours. It compiles data from over ten thousand newspapers in the Great Plains to show not only how harvest hand employment varied with the climate but also how climatic instability often only became apparent as harvest hands arrived in the state. This made it virtually impossible for employers to plan ahead for labor, as the demand for harvest hands could vary dramatically even from year to year. Though government and union action pointed the way to possible alternative systems, they never emerged. Ultimately, the hobo-wheat complex was an emergent property of climate and industrial capitalism, unplanned by any group or authority, made by the choices of each.",

    "abstract": "In Carolina's Golden Fields, Hayden Smith delivers a long overdue assessment of inland rice culture's importance to the South Carolina Lowcountry. Due to a dearth of primary sources and the fact that most inland rice fields have been lost to reforestation and development, historians have overlooked inland rice cultivation or have viewed it as a primitive stage of rice cultivation when compared to tidal cultivation. Rather, as Smith's work demonstrates, inland rice cultivation required planters and enslaved laborers to exercise precise knowledge of topography and hydrology to render their harvests profitable. The utilization of this knowledge began when free and enslaved Carolinians experimented with rice alongside other grains as a subsistence crop, first relying on the “providence” method and then realizing the advantages of impervious soils and water management. Using Pooshee, Newington, and Charleywood plantations as examples in chapter 2, Smith demonstrates how rice planters and enslaved laborers adapted to and manipulated varied microenvironments to make cultivation successful and ultimately create a foundation for South Carolina's colonial economy and the expansion of slavery. With the foundation set in the first decades of the eighteenth century, land acquisition and a stable market prompted rice planters to engage in ever more elaborate schemes for irrigation and drainage that mirrored new strategies being used for tidal cultivation. As Smith discusses in chapter 3, this intensive stage of development resulted in higher profits, increased demand for labor, and susceptibility to malaria, freshets, and declining soil fertility. Consequently, planters increasingly perceived the environment as unhealthy and downright hostile.Nevertheless, inland rice cultivation persisted throughout the antebellum period and contributed to the evolution of the Lowcountry's agricultural regime. Focusing on four Wando River plantations in chapter 4, Smith notes how rice planters expanded their landholdings in the post–Revolutionary War era in order to access water and have enslaved laborers construct reservoirs and canals. Smith's microanalysis of each plantation illuminates his earlier theme that this work required knowledge of topography and hydrology to make rice cultivation profitable. It also involved constant experimentation with planting strategies to maintain crop yields. For some planters, successful inland rice cultivation also provided a potential avenue into the Lowcountry aristocracy. Locked out of the more expensive tidal plantation market, social aspirants like Mathurin Gibbs and John Irving saw inland rice as a means to establish their status as planters. As chapter 5 makes clear, despite ambition and the knowledge of experienced overseers, their efforts were frustrated by environmental limitations and small labor forces. Indeed, Gibbs succumbed to malaria in 1849. Yet agricultural reformers espoused inland rice as a way to diversify their planting portfolio when the fertility of their cotton lands declined in the two decades preceding the Civil War. In chapter 6, Smith focuses on Middle Saint John's Berkeley Parish where the Black Oak Agricultural Society promoted scientific experimentation and planters had access to the numerous inland swamps and freshwater springs in Biggin Basin. These reform efforts never amounted to much, but the attempt to revive inland rice testified to its persistence as a symbol of economic salvation.With emancipation, large-scale rice cultivation collapsed and former inland rice lands returned to forest. Purchased by timber companies or converted to subdivisions in the twentieth century, little remains of the inland rice infrastructure that Smith describes throughout the book. However, drawing from plantation ledgers, manuscripts, agricultural journals, deeds and plats, geological and archaeological reports, and myriad other primary and secondary sources, Smith rescues inland rice cultivation from obscurity and gives it a central place in South Carolina's environmental history. Moreover, Hayden Smith has walked the land he describes, and Carolina's Golden Fields exemplifies his intimate knowledge of the Lowcountry, past and present, as well as his skill as a historian. His astute attention to the terrain of forest and history make this a readable, informed, and important contribution to the historiography of rice, slavery, and the environment.",

    "abstract": "In Local Lives, Parallel Histories: Villagers and Everyday Life in Modern Germany, Marcel Thomas aims to get past divided histories of postwar Germany that set up one (usually the West) as the “ideal” against which we should measure and understand the other's relative success. He finds many similarities between the perceptions and experiences of villagers east and west of the Berlin Wall.Thomas employs the German historical framework of Alltagsgeschichte (“the history of everyday life”) to better understand how two villages, in different regions of divided postwar Germany, negotiated changes in their communities in the years after World War II.He focuses on Ebersbach, in the Federal Republic of Germany, an erstwhile “market town” in Baden-Württemberg, and Neukirch, in the German Democratic Republic, a modernizing village in Saxony. Ebersbach and Neukirch are not mirror images of one another, divided only by their divergent experiences of national government between 1945 and 1989; they are, rather, similar but unique, embedded in the distinct local histories of their regions.Thomas draws on a variety of sources, including local historians and museums, in constructing his argument about the fundamentally similar nature of village life and politics in the two Germanys. One of his most interesting sources comes in the form of the oral history interviews he conducted with residents of Ebersbach and Neukirch over a three-year period.The text is composed of six thematic chapters, each of which deals with some aspect of the postwar development of the German village. Their common goal is to complicate the narrative of centrally directed change enacted at the local level and passively accepted by local communities. Instead, Thomas argues for a “give-and-take” (as he titles chapter 5) between national leadership in Bonn and Berlin, local government and bureaucracies, community activists, and ordinary citizens.In the first and sixth chapters, Thomas evaluates the twin processes of village modernization (chapter 1) and community engagement with the local, regional, and national past (chapter 6). Villagers in both Ebersbach and Neukirch looked to a modern future and understood that rural modernization represented a key component of national progress in Cold War Germany. Neither group posed an obstacle to modernization so much as they hoped to shape it to their benefit. Accordingly, while forging “Modern Villagers” entailed the development of a vision of the future by those within and outside the community, the final chapter shows how villagers marshaled their past to bolster that vision through the production of local histories.Chapters 2 and 3 deal with the shifting boundaries of the village community as it was reconceived in the postwar world and reconstituted from within by longtime residents and by newcomers. Thomas points to common contradictions in both Ebersbach and Neukirch, noting a tension between a growing desire for privacy, associated with modernity, and a nostalgia for the close-knit rural communities of the past. Both communities, too, struggled to fully integrate outsiders, including groups of ethnic German refugees, foreign workers, and urban commuters (chapter 3).Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the communities’ engagement with and perceptions of political developments in the village, region, Germany, and the world. Thomas challenges the idea that only border communities and Berlin were cognizant of their role in the broader dynamics of the Cold War and shows that Ebersbachers and Neukirchers engaged with the other Germany, often using it as a metric for the relative progress achieved by their own community. As might be imagined in a book that focuses on the village, Thomas emphasizes the effects of local, “bottom-up” efforts to negotiate political change, both as a response to “top-down” politics and as a catalyst for them.Thomas's Ebersbachers and Neukirchers are emphatically villagers, not peasants, and seldom farmers. Those who are interested in the modernization of farming techniques, the status of agriculture in postwar Germany, or the role of agribusiness in shifting the economic landscape of rural Germany might look elsewhere. Rural Germans, however, have long been linked to both food production and to an idealized past, and Thomas is attuned to how this symbolic baggage might affect the self-perceptions of rural communities in a postwar world in which nostalgia and autarky are no longer central concerns of the state.Thomas's monograph is especially useful as a model for linking local histories to national and transnational narratives. He resists simply projecting changes at the national level onto the local one, even as the national and the international are ever-present in the minds of the villagers.",

    "abstract": "For decades, historians of the American West have problematized Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis in myriad ways. Coalescing in a group often labeled New Western historians, these individuals found holes in Turner's interpretation of the American West as a place where hardy pioneers constructed democratic institutions, lived independently, and assimilated into one “American” community. For his part in confronting Turner's view, Iker Saitua “challenges the idea of melting-pot homogeneity in the American West by examining the Basque immigrant experience in Nevada as a complex collectivity in a complex geographical place” (13). In so doing, Saitua examines the relatively unknown story of Basque immigration to and settlement in Nevada to demonstrate that we still have much to learn about the region and those who reside in it.As a native of the Basque country and the Basque Government Postdoctoral Fellow at both the University of the Basque Country and the University of California, Riverside, Saitua is intimately familiar with this story. The author organizes the study by separating it into three distinct parts. Saitua begins by relating the first waves of Basque immigration to the United States in the late nineteenth century, transitions into how the Basque community became a fixture in Nevada before the outbreak of World War II, and closes by looking at how labor shortages compelled American recruitment of Basque workers following the war. Each part explores how they faced distinct challenges to establish themselves in the United States. Nothing proved easy, but perhaps the most daunting issue that Saitua covers is the racialization of Basque immigrants in the aftermath of World War I and following the Johnson-Reid Act of 1924 that constructed quotas for immigrants coming to the United States. As Saitua tells it, the Basque community in the West proved largely successful in finding a niche in the Nevada ranching economy as knowledgeable and dedicated sheepherders. Unfortunately, while their contribution provided opportunities to earn acceptance by and respect from their employers and others in the state, the community became susceptible to the volatile anti-immigrant fervor that erupted in the 1920s and continued into the 1930s.World War II changed that, however. The restriction on Basque immigration left the sheep industry desperate for laborers, and that desperation compelled many Nevadans to fight to reform the restrictive quota acts. Most notably, Senator Patrick McCarran lobbied hard to ease restrictions and open opportunities for Basques to immigrate and resolve labor shortages. The consummate anti-communist, McCarran even met with Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in 1949 and advised him to emphasize Spain's resistance to communism to improve relations between the two nations. His efforts paid off in the end with both the lessening of restrictions in 1951 and the normalization of relations between Spain and the United States with the 1953 Pact of Madrid, an agreement that encouraged economic ties and “indirectly facilitated the recruitment of Basque immigrant labor” that continued beyond 1953 (249).There is much to appreciate in this book. Notably, Saitua engages labor history, conservation and land use, foreign policy, and whiteness, and he clearly ties those distinct bodies of literature back to his study of Basque community. He has taken a relatively unknown group of people and presented an exemplary case study of how the trials and tribulations of a specific community of immigrants in Nevada can help us better understand the ways that monumental shifts—the development of an agricultural industry in the West, anti-immigration trends in the 1920s and 1930s, and the rise of production demands during World War II—impacted peoples in the West. In the process, he achieves his primary goal of using the Basque story to expand the historiography of the New Western History and counter Turner's dated notion of Americanization on the frontier.Two minor issues detract from the study. First, there is no conclusion. Each chapter works well on its own, but a short conclusion that included a summary of main themes as well as the author's contributions, or perhaps even a mention to how the Basque community fared after 1954, would refocus the book. Second, it is sometimes difficult to understand the impact of these shifts on the Basque community itself. It might help had the author grounded some of these developments with a better representation of community numbers, or how they were viewed beyond Nevada, or whether the community remains viable.Minor complaints such as these will do little to detract from the book's contributions. Saitua adeptly weaves together several complicated bodies of literature to shine a light on a largely unknown story of community development and adaptation in the American West.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This essay documents the century-long efforts of Peter Darby, Ernest S. Salmon, and Ray Neve, all of whom were directors of England's Hop Research Program. While these scientists engaged in myriad projects, the central story surrounds the development and release of hybrid hop varieties for use in beer. In contrast with the brewing industry that turned toward mechanization and industrial advancements in the twentieth century, the English hop breeding program steadily relied on hand-pollinating characteristic of Mendelian genetics. Crossbreeding, or hybridization, of hops (and scores of other dioicous plants—that is, those with two distinct sexes) traditionally occurred with scientists selecting specimens that exhibited desirable traits that could be traced to their hereditary makeup. The process was painstakingly slow, requiring countless dustings of pollen from male plants onto female flowers. Darby, Salmon, and Neve engaged in this process thousands of times before deciding on which offspring to select from the greenhouses to transplant into fields. Their promising and successful specimens today populate England's experimental hop garden for their potential in brewing or breeding future crosses; the most outstanding progeny can be found in beers near and far.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the mid-twentieth century, both public and private US development agencies organized a variety of global agricultural development programs based on various interpretations of modernization theory. In much of the existing historical literature about modernization theory and practice, these public and private agencies are often seen as closely coordinating with each other to achieve both development goals and US global hegemony. This article questions how closely coordinated such efforts were through an analysis of Rockefeller Foundation interactions with other US-based agricultural modernization programs and activities in Colombia in the 1950s and 1960s. Where the Rockefeller Foundation promoted Colombian wheat production, the USDA and other US-based agencies criticized that production and instead promoted the importation of US-grown wheat through the PL 480 program. The article utilizes Rockefeller Foundation records to examine how disparate meanings of modernization manifested themselves in mundane conflicts. Seemingly petty squabbles among US development actors in Colombia reveal the contours of their distinct views of modernization and demonstrate the need for more analysis of the practice of modernization and development programs rather than just the theories that underlay them.",

    "abstract": "The use of industrial chemicals to eradicate foliage in the name of economic, scientific, and military progress was a cornerstone of post–World War II US policy. Needless to say, their use also provoked significant controversy within the United States and across the world. It is that controversy that Amy H. Hay explores in her new book. The Defoliation of America is not only a history of Agent Orange chemicals (phenoxy herbicides) but is, more importantly, an examination of how diverse networks of grassroots activists questioned state and scientific authority. The book offers new and interesting insights into the history of how “ordinary citizens” became activists and the processes through which they challenged the use of phenoxy herbicides in agriculture, land management, and warfare.The book is divided into three sections each containing three chapters, as well as an introduction and conclusion. The first section explores the origins of phenoxy herbicides and “the quickening of conscience” around their use in the United States, Europe, and Vietnam. The second section offers case studies of phenoxy spraying and citizen response in the US West, while the third considers the toxic legacies of phenoxy herbicides, including their use in the War on Drugs. The Defoliation of America is an expansive book that links disparate networks of activism together in a coherent way and does an excellent job of interrogating the contested nature of knowledge making around phenoxy herbicides. I look forward to teaching it in my upper division science, technology, and society classes.I was particularly intrigued by Hay's eloquent descriptions of how people became activists. For some, it was reading about or participating in Operation Ranch Hand, while for others it was the spraying of their bodies or their land. This fascinated me because it highlighted something that Hay does so well, situating scientific authority and processes of knowledge making within larger structures of power. Many of the protest networks that Hay described were successful in contesting the scientific and state authority to determine the nature of proof and harm, but it is also true that many of the successes of these “anti-toxics” campaigns were little more than a way for chemical companies to buy time: US policies gave chemical companies the benefit of the doubt when it came to any potential harm. The protests of “ordinary citizens” shaped the discourse around phenoxy herbicides use in war and agriculture, but so too did the more powerful chemical companies—most often by sowing doubts of chemical harm deep within our policies and institutions.My reading of Hay's book left me with a plethora of negative emotions. I was angry for the countless Vietnamese harmed and still yet to be harmed in the name of the Cold War. I felt sad for the US soldiers who had survived war only to die from so-called manufacturing mistakes or improper use. I empathized with the people catalyzed to be activists and the struggles they faced. I was again disheartened by yet another story of agricultural laborers living with outsized exposure. Perhaps that is why I found the story of Ida Honorof in chapter 5 so compelling. For all of the stories of contested knowledge making that Hay describes, the one characteristic that permeated them all was the lack of significant accountability. Ida Honorof, first and foremost, was about accountability. She advocated for incarceration of those who had exposed the public to widespread harm. I think her observations around lack of accountability still ring true today. Thus, the main question I could not shake after reading the Defoliation of America is what accountability would actually look like. I think it would look like what Ida said it would, at least in part.The Defoliation of America is an original and fascinating look at the contested history of knowledge making around phenoxy herbicides. But I think one of its most lasting contributions will come from the larger questions it asks—important questions that have resonance for who we want to be today and what our future agriculture looks like. In particular, throughout the book, Hay struggles with the why of chemical herbicides. I think that this is key. Agricultural historians have written so well on the what and the how of pesticides. Perhaps we need to take Hay's lead and ask the why question more.",

Here, on the Hopi Indian Reservation, roots of blue corn reach deep into sandy soil that sustained one of the world's most biologically diverse agricultural systems for over one thousand years. In dry farmed fields fed by violent monsoon storms and in terraced gardens irrigated by ancestral springs, Hopi agriculturalists perfected a system of spiritual and physical subsistence that produced the majority of food consumed in Hopi communities. During the twentieth century, the rise of wage labor and increased access to cash facilitated the shift from a diet comprised primarily of traditional food produced by Hopi farmers to one dependent on food purchased in grocery stores or acquired through food aid programs, contributing to high rates of obesity and diabetes. Despite deep fractures in their food system, Hopis continued to produce and consume traditional foods while negotiating the terms upon which new foods were adopted into their culinary universe, demonstrating sustained resilience in the face of a shifting subsistence base.",

    "abstract": "An engaging look at meatpacking in Iowa and the people connected by it, Kristy Nabhan-Warren's Meatpacking America weaves a story of religion, community, and the push and pull of belonging. Taking the reader from the killing floors of pork processing plants to the decaying gardens of closed Catholic parishes, Nabhan-Warren sheds light on the complicated nature of current migration patterns and refugee experiences. She insists that small-town Iowa is far more diverse than the media tropes portray. While there is tension, Nabhan-Warren contends that there is also inclusivity and welcome. At the heart of these multiethnic and multilinguistic places is a mutual respect for faith and family.Many of Nabhan-Warren's arguments will not be new to agricultural historians; the Midwest and its people have never been a monolith. Furthermore, we will recognize and commend her attempts to place Iowa in a global context. What is new, however, is her use of faith as a lens of analysis. She utilizes religion to interrogate how faith transcends its traditional boundaries. Rural priests attempt to blend their diverse congregations amid uncertain political climates. Packers and their employees lean on religious ideology to get them through the gruesome task of providing meat for a hungry world. Refugees find solace in God as they navigate unfamiliar environments. Nabhan-Warren accomplishes two of her major goals here; she successfully demonstrates that these are diverse multifaceted places and that religion is a major connective tissue holding them together.Just as Nabhan-Warren describes the interactions between white Iowans and recent refugees as “complicated,” so too must I confess that my feelings toward this book are also complex. Several chapters include some of the best descriptions of meatpacking I have ever read, in particular “In the Belly of the Beast.” With great and sometimes painful detail, she explains how animals are dismantled for our eating pleasure. The descriptions of backbreaking labor and machine-line nature was equally enlightening and disturbing. Overall, Nabhan-Warren is a fabulous writer. I found myself turning page after page to learn more about her diverse array of characters and their stories. Her thorough exploration into the experiences of refugees and their drive to support their families was deeply emotional and at times heartbreaking. One of the highest praises I can give is that I felt like I knew who these people were, even if I never met them in real life.Yet, even as I read Meatpacking America, I kept thinking that perhaps this book was missing important pieces of the story. It seemed that just as Nabhan-Warren began to nibble at the edges of power dynamics, she would pull back. As an ethnographer, she needs to carefully consider all her subjects, including the company management of Tyson and IBP. In many ways, historians have an easier time; our subjects, for the most part, are never going to read our work. But I found that my biggest questions about labor and power were frustratingly unanswered. While Nabhan-Warren included some cursory discussions of the “right to work,” there was a distinct lack of information on current union organizing. Are there any political discussions among these refugee workers? How do these companies who claim paternalistic care for their employees feel about this possible organizing? Furthermore, as historians Roland Marchand and Bartow Elmore have shown, companies desperately try to humanize themselves to make their institutions more palatable to the masses. This includes religion. I could not help but sense that there was a coercive element to this corporate faith. How does a corporate chaplain who offers spiritual counseling deal with employees unhappy with working conditions? What difference in analysis would there have been if Nabhan-Warren had asked these questions? Did she inquire and there was nothing to share? Without addressing these questions, her subjects seem like they operate on an equal playing field, which flattens the very real power differences between multiple billion-dollar corporations and some of the most vulnerable people in the United States. Despite these unanswered questions, Nabhan-Warren does an excellent job of telling a nuanced and important story of rural life in the modern Midwest.",

    "abstract": "Seed Money is an organizational biography of the Monsanto Chemical Company, now named the Monsanto Company. The removal of “chemical” from the company's name underlies the story Bartow Elmore tells, one that includes chemical production and regulation, toxic hazards, and the multitude of ways Monsanto not only stayed in business but also thrived. From the beginning, Monsanto was a company that searched for profitable chemicals to make and often acquired other companies to get them.In the one-hundred-plus-year history of the company, five chemicals defined Monsanto: saccharin, an early artificial sweetener; caffeine, like saccharin an important ingredient in the formulation of Coca-Cola; 2,4,5-T, an herbicide that inhibited plant growth; polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), synthetic chemicals used in industry as coolants and to make carbonless copy paper; and glyphosate, the key ingredient in Roundup herbicide. The last three chemicals illuminate the worst elements of Monsanto's business model: disregard for workers' and consumers' health, avoidance of regulation, and a refusal to take responsibility for its hazardous products. Seed Money contributes to a robust literature on hazardous agricultural chemicals, including Pete Daniel's Toxic Drift (2005), David Vail's Chemical Lands (2018), and Adam Romero's Economic Poisoning (2022). Elmore also adds to the scholarship on toxic chemical regulation, environmental and health activism, and the histories of the chemical industry and capitalism.The history of Monsanto reveals some important patterns. One is the constant attempt to manipulate chemical regulations and government oversight. Two of the most egregious cases Elmore recounts involve Monsanto's success in initially transferring responsibility for any harm caused by PCBs to the user, such as the electrical power industry. Monsanto used a clause in the 1976 Toxic Substance Control Act that allowed production of the toxic chemicals for “enclosed systems,” which permitted continued production of the toxic chemicals. The second example comes from Monsanto's Idaho phosphate mining operations that produced the phosphorus needed for its top-selling Roundup herbicide. Monsanto continued to extract phosphate from the mines even after they were declared a Superfund site in 1990. This decision came after Monsanto successfully limited its liability from selling the phosphate slag, a low-level radioactive waste byproduct, to the nearby town of Soda Springs, where it was used for construction filler in homes, roads, and sidewalks. The Environmental Protection Agency even appointed Monsanto, the polluter, to the working group formed to resolve the problems caused by the radioactive phosphate slag.Monsanto's denial of the harm caused by its chemical products to the health of workers, consumers, and citizens appears repeatedly throughout the company's history. In 1949, an explosion at a manufacturing plant in Nitro, West Virginia, exposed hundreds of employees to high concentrations of a hazardous manufacturing contaminant. Over the course of the next several decades, and after receiving information from Dow Chemical as to the toxicity of the dioxin contaminant present in 2,4,5-T production in the 1960s, Monsanto concealed the dire health effects the chemical caused. It pursued a similar approach at its Anniston, Alabama, plant that produced PCBs. Toxic pollution spread beyond the plant and throughout the community, and, in the case of Anniston, to the region's waterways. Monsanto withheld information about PCBs' hazardous health effects the same way it kept quiet about the problems with 2,4,5-T's dioxin contaminant. Workers and others affected were forced to take the company to court. While Monsanto initially escaped severe financial consequences, in part by creating a new corporation that it saddled with its hazardous products, the multitude of chemical exposures threatened financial ruin.Elmore's examination of Monsanto provides a rich, well-documented, damning history of Monsanto's products, business practices, and ethics. Monsanto's failure to control its raw materials, except for the phosphorus used in its Roundup herbicide, forced the company to reinvent itself from a chemical company to one focused on biotechnology. Monsanto was determined to keep Roundup a viable product. The solution, achieved by bioengineering crops to resist the herbicide, allowed farmers to apply it year-round, saving on labor and herbicide costs. In the process, the company exercised more and more control over the seeds farmers planted in the United States and abroad. Elmore shows that a new “invisible hand” of capitalism wielded so much power that it forced farmers, consumers, and governments to accept the bioengineered seeds and accompanying pesticides. The book's only failing would be not analyzing its rich evidence even further, perhaps with a broader and deeper discussion of the chemical industry. One way to make more space for this would be to omit the biographies of Monsanto scientists, which do little to explain the ways they justified concealing the hazards of the products they made. In recounting Monsanto's long history of manipulating regulation, lying about chemical safety, and controlling crop seeds, Bartow exposes common industry practices and raises important questions about how food production has fallen under the control of multinational corporations.",

It demonstrates that agricultural writers' approach to farm, land, and labor management moved from a localized context of thrifty householding in the sixteenth century to a national context of industriousness and improvement by the mid-seventeenth century. This change in discourse, as this article will show, was an attempt to provide management advice and establish managerial power over the agricultural labor process within an increasingly connected, competitive, and impersonal agrarian economy.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural and environmental historians are skilled storytellers. They condense, organize, rework, and structure stories in ways that account for the human and nonhuman actors of the past. This can be a difficult task. After all, plant cycles, geological processes, and ecological systems hardly fit into the neat conception of time we humans have designed for ourselves. Though a challenging undertaking, it is an especially important one. Stories create a sense of place. They connect us to the natural world and humble us in the face of larger, environmental forces. They can also call us to action. As William Cronon has argued, “The special task of environmental history is to assert that stories about the past are better . . . if they increase our attention to nature and the place of people within it.” Telling effective and compelling stories might be one way that we can “hope to persuade readers of the importance of our subject.”1 A good story can spark change, grow the field, and encourage a generation of students to examine the complex relationships between humans and the natural world. Understanding the importance of storytelling in our work, we must center the narrative form as a foundational component of teaching and learning.For those invested in preserving and promoting agricultural and environmental history in the classroom, narrative-based podcasting can be a powerful tool. Unlike traditional text-based essays, podcasts have the capacity to appeal to broad audiences by using a variety of editing and production techniques including the use of multiple voices, sound effects, shifts in pacing, adjusting the length of episodes, or serializing an entire season. Podcasting can be aurally immersive and widely accessible to audiences who might otherwise shy away from more traditional forms of narration. By assigning students to research, record, and create their own podcasts, they become active storytellers, tasked to compose compelling agricultural and environmental histories with a host of new narrative techniques.As a learning tool, podcasts teach critical thinking skills through a nontextual, audio format. In addition to the traditional practice of evaluating argument and evidence, students must think about how editing, sound effects, volume, and timing can shape the listener's engagement with the podcast. This form of critical engagement helps students develop multiliteracies that are not always common in the traditional history classroom. The act of creating podcasts also offers pedagogical benefits, including an opportunity for students to engage with the developing field of digital humanities. By learning and working with microphones, audio editing software, and digital publishing platforms, students get access to new technologies through multimodal learning. Additionally, student-created podcasts offer tangible evidence of their scholarly work. In my experience, students are eager to share their research with family and friends who otherwise might not be willing to sit down and read a long-form essay. As active learners, they became invested in researching and sharing compelling stories.2In fall 2021, students enrolled in HIS 51601: Graduate Seminar in United States Environmental History at Eastern Illinois University produced an agricultural and environmental podcast series, The Nature of Illinois: Environmental Stories of the Prairie State. The course began with a traditional, seminar-style structure. Reading historiographical essays and discussing scholarly works, students spent the early course meetings grappling with the major debates and conversations of environmental and agricultural history. As we transitioned into the second third of the semester, I introduced the project and began to assign agricultural and environmental history-themed podcasts. Students listened to “Atom in the Garden of Eden,” from 99% Invisible Podcast—an episode that discusses atom gardens in the nuclear age. They reviewed an episode of Radiolab, “Even the Worst Laid Plans?,” that tells the story of how unique bacteria in dead snow geese might have accidentally provided a solution to the toxic problem at the “pit” in Butte, Montana. They followed the story of a feather thief in “The Feather Heist,” from This American Life, which tracks the colonial roots of modern museums, the culture of leisure, and the lucrative underground market for rare feathers among fly-fishers. These short assignments encouraged students to evaluate podcast episodes much like a book: look for an argument, evaluate evidence, and situate the work within the broader fields of environmental and agricultural history. They also examined the unique structure of podcasts and the ways in which sound, music, editing, and timing can shape the listener's experience. By breaking down the structural elements of a podcast, students learned to identify, and later replicate, effective techniques of podcast storytelling—a unique form that differs from traditional historical research paper assignments.3After evaluating published podcasts, students then selected their own research topics. I kept the boundaries of the assignment broad, only requiring that their research related to Illinois history. My goal was to encourage student buy-in by allowing them to follow their own interests. The remainder of the semester class sessions blended seminar-style discussion of additional readings, regular check-ins of student research, and an introduction to basic podcasting technology. I dedicated an entire class session to the technical aspects of podcasting where students learned how to use portable microphones, practiced clipping sound clips on Audacity (a free audio editing software), and explored the vast libraries of copyright-free music and sound effects on the Free Music Archive and Freesound.4 Throughout the remainder of the course, I continued to track the students' progress, often leading brief troubleshooting sessions. Many of the students grew confident in their technical skills and often served as resources to their classmates. I dedicated an entire class session to peer evaluations, where we listened through a draft of each episode. Through peer-to-peer learning, students refined their episodes for final publication at the end of the semester. The official launch of the series coincided with a small, socially distanced celebration among the class.5By designing their own podcast series, students embraced a foundational component of agricultural and environmental history: storytelling. After engaging with scholarship, completing research, and considering the ways in which historians discuss the complex relationship between ecological systems and human actors, students produced their own narrative-based podcasts. The series followed a chronological history of the region. One student explored how the colonial fur trade led to broader cultural encounters in the Great Lakes region. Another explored how overtrapping and Euro-American agricultural development led to the collapse of the American Fur Company in the region. Yet another student, interested in the history of coal mining in Illinois, used the 1909 Cherry Mine disaster as a lens to examine the ways in which the extractive industry shaped everyday life in rural Illinois. Some students turned their attention away from industry and toward recreational uses of the environment, including an episode that explores the rise of tourism in the Upper Great Lakes region as a result of increased industrialization and urban anxieties in early twentieth-century Chicago. Another student explored the ideas of Charles Macdonald, the architect behind the Chicago Golf Club and America's first eighteen-hole course. The range in topics added depth to the series and allowed each student to follow their individual interests. The Nature of Illinois: Stories of the Prairie State provides a model for instructors seeking to encourage student learning, introduce basic digital tools in the classroom, and continue to develop interest in agricultural and environmental history among students and the podcast-listening public.",

    "abstract": "This special forum highlights innovative and diverse methods of teaching agricultural history. Yet agricultural history itself can also help inform how we teach difficult topics. Take, for instance, one of the most discussed intersections between the history of agriculture and the history of science: the 1900 “rediscovery” of Mendelian genetics and its application to early twentieth-century plant breeding.1 Despite its omnipresence in contemporary textbooks and classrooms, Mendelism can be hard to understand. A 2018 study of undergraduate students at Creighton University found no difference in test scores between biology students who had started their course with either Mendel or molecular genetics.2 Mendelian genetics lent no special insight, nor did it prove itself a “softer” subject. At the secondary school level, everything from card games to gummy bears has been deployed to assist students in tracking the movement of genes through the generations.3The level of difficulty involved in grasping Mendel's laws has important historical ramifications. Staffan Müller-Wille and Giuditta Parolini have recently suggested that the spread of Mendelism among biologists was only thanks to a “computational protocol” that allowed early geneticists to reconstruct the logic behind Mendelian experiments.4 The uptake of Mendelian principles among farmers and breeders is more difficult to trace.5 A growing body of literature does point to several reasons why Mendel was popular among agriculturalists in the United States. Genetics fits with a preexisting trend toward the “rationalization” of American agriculture. Mendelism made crops uniform and predictable, opening the door to industrialized agriculture and intellectual property laws.6 In other national contexts, however, Mendelian genetics faced a turbulent reception. In France, breeders found that Mendelian principles did not always apply to cereal breeding.7 In Britain, too, famed plant breeder Rowland Biffen struggled to apply the new breeding method to the creation of disease-resistant wheat.8Given the difficulties experienced by students, alongside ongoing historiographical debates, I naturally approached the challenge of teaching a class on the modern history of Mendelian genetics with a degree of trepidation. The class in question formed part of a weeklong summer school at the University of Cambridge, titled “The Science and Politics of Food in Human History.” The summer school was hosted by the Centre for Global Knowledge Studies at the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH). Students at the point of transition from undergraduate to postgraduate studies were recruited under the University of Cambridge's “Widening Participation” guidelines. There was no requirement for qualifications or background knowledge of either biology or history.By the third day of the summer school, students had encountered a range of disciplines and classroom styles. Dr. Marie-Françoise Besnier harnessed “The Irrigation Game; or, How to Lead Your Village through the Sumerian Agricultural Year,” her way of introducing participants to the complexities of Mesopotamian agriculture. Professor Martin Jones, accompanied by crop plant specimens, explored the origins of the “Big 3” (wheat, rice, and maize), while Dr. Inanna Hamati-Ataya used maps to trace the Neolithic movement of crop plants. For students in the summer school, novel teaching materials and interactive classes were already the norm by the time of the class on “The Modern British History of Mendelian Plant Genetics.”Inspired by an alternative approach to the teaching of genetics at the University of Leeds, I took the opportunity to engage in a pedagogical experiment.9 The class began with some historical background to the problems of breeding and inheritance prior to and during the nineteenth century. This background included the classic example of how to breed faster racehorses, an argument that attracted numerous theories for over a century.10 We discussed efforts to produce stable plant hybrids, a problem in which Mendel himself—trained in horticulture and a member of the Natural Science Section of the Agricultural Society in Brno—was engaged.11The bulk of the class was devoted to a practical exercise on Mendelian genetics. Like many traditional classes on Mendel, this exercise harnessed the Punnett square.12 Yet it made no mention of genetic terminology, instead referring purely to practical characteristics in plants and animals: short or long horns in cattle, the length of wheat, and coarse or luxuriant fleeces in sheep. Students were asked to predict the outcome of these different varietal crosses down the generations. Take the classic example of green and yellow peas, where yellow (Y) is the dominant trait and green (g) the recessive. An initial cross (the F1 generation) will give you yellow peas due to yellow being the dominant trait. However, a second generation (F2) will give you the classic Mendelian ratio of three yellow peas (YY or Yg) to one green pea (gg). Interesting, but you still have the same yellow or green peas you began with. After working through a few of these examples, the students turned to Punnett squares with two traits in play. Again, take a classic example of crossing green and round (gR) peas with yellow and wrinkled (Yw) peas. A first cross gives us the dominant yellow and round (YR) peas. Yet in our second (F2) generation we find a whole mix of peas, including one hybrid (gw) that we did not have with the parent varieties or the first (F1) generation.The aim of this exercise was to see whether the students could explore how novel hybrids could be produced through crosses and the implications of this for agriculture. Students worked with a similar series of Punnett squares to produce new varieties of woolly and short-horned cattle and short-stemmed, disease-resistant wheat. For a few students, the potential of Mendelian genetics suddenly became tangible: a moment of excitement that plant and animal breeding could be directed and controlled. Yet for other students, this practical approach to Mendel made no difference to their understanding. There was almost unanimous agreement, however, that a breeding program based on Mendelian genetics would be time-consuming and costly to enact.13 This outcome was not altogether unexpected. Similar efforts to contextualize Mendelian genetics as a historical breeding problem or to study it through real-life examples have similarly produced mixed results.14The split reaction of contemporary students to Mendelism perhaps indicates why its reception in agriculture was so divided. For some, Mendelian genetics produces a kind of “breakthrough” moment, accompanied by genuine excitement. For others, this never arises. I was only able to arrive at the former through some effort. It is also important to note that the early twentieth-century agriculturalists who encountered Mendelism would already possess numerous ideas on how breeding should be done, including selection, inbreeding, and crosses. When Charles Darwin approached pigeon breeders to construct his nineteenth-century analogy between artificial and natural selection, he greatly simplified his account of their practices to form his argument.15 An alternative (and longer-term) approach to teaching Mendelism and agriculture would involve immersing students in the specific challenges encountered by breeders at different points in time. From this perspective, Mendelism was not an unforeseen and complex new system to learn but was instead a relatively simple argument which removed some of “the baffling clutter” surrounding heredity.16",

    "abstract": "Author W. Ralph Eubanks wrote, “If you can find where the past and the present intersect within Mississippi, you can indeed understand the world.”1 The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta, better known as the Mississippi Delta, has a rich agrarian history and is a space that holds national significance for the modern civil rights movement and as the birthplace of American music. Popularly known as “the most southern place on earth,” as dubbed by historian James C. Cobb, the Mississippi Delta offers an excellent case study for a high-impact, service-learning, credit-earning travel course.2 This article will discuss the rationale, design, and goals of an interdisciplinary and interinstitutional course on the Mississippi Delta.The course idea originated from Nicholas Timmerman's graduate school experience at Mississippi State University (MSU), where historian Jason Morgan Ward designed a similar service- and travel-learning course on the Mississippi Delta in collaboration with the Maroon Volunteer Center. During Timmerman's time at MSU, he was afforded the opportunity to chaperone and teach the course himself (in the spring semesters of 2015 and 2017). In the summer of 2021, Gail Carpenter of Iowa State University (ISU) approached Timmerman about the possibility of collaborating on a grant opportunity in the Study USA program sponsored by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at ISU. The grant's design is to encourage the creation of credit-bearing, domestic travel courses within the United States that “provide undergraduate students the opportunity to learn about diverse culture, food and agriculture systems, natural resources, and life sciences within the U.S.”3 The program advocated that proposals “expose/engage students in cultural diversity of the U.S.,” such as partnering with a minority-serving institution and exploring geographic locations “that are significantly different from what students experience in Ames, Iowa.”4 We believed that a partnership between a predominantly white land-grant institution and an 1890 land-grant HBCU fulfilled one of these requirements, and studying a space such as the Mississippi Delta naturally fulfilled several of the other grants’ requirements.The grant proposal argued that an interdisciplinary and interinstitutional course on the Mississippi Delta would Combine in-class and immersive experiential learning, including hands-on service activities and housing provided by local community groups in the delta.Blend history and agriculture to garner appreciation for factors that shaped the present systems in the Mississippi Delta.Collaborate across two land-grant universities with disparate backgrounds and student bodies—namely, ISU and Langston University, an HBCU.The idea was to create a domestic travel course that was intentionally interdisciplinary and to design a classroom space that engaged in conversations about the sciences and the humanities. ISU and Langston have strong agricultural science programs, so it made sense to design a course that would attract students interested in learning about the intersection between agricultural science and history. We also viewed this course as an opportunity to benefit each discipline mutually. The humanities generally struggle to prove to potential students the field's relevance, and the sciences struggle with teaching students cultural and social connections. Our grant proposal was accepted in the fall of 2021 to design and implement the course for the spring 2022 semester.The course and trip leaned heavily into research on high-impact learning practices as defined by the Association of American Colleges and Universities, which argues that high-impact learning challenges and engages students, increases retention, and contributes to cumulative learning.5 Examples of high-impact learning practices, according to scholar George Kuh, include “first-year seminars,” “learning communities,” “service learning,” “undergraduate research,” and “study abroad.”6 The idea behind developing a partnership between ISU and Langston was to establish interinstitutional learning communities where students collectively reflected on lessons learned in the classroom and the field.7 The domestic travel experience to the Mississippi Delta was the central component of the course and included service-learning opportunities, ensuring “that students' service experiences are linked directly to classroom learning,” as scholars Jayne Brownell and Lynn Swaner advocate.8The course was specifically designed as a credit-earning elective that engaged students with the history and agricultural practices in the delta over time.9 The course objectives measured students' ability to: Demonstrate a working understanding of the historical factors that shaped the Mississippi Delta.Experience the culture, people, and communities of the Mississippi Delta by visiting significant sites through an experiential and service-learning alternative spring break trip.Develop a working knowledge of the historic and contemporary importance of agriculture in the Mississippi Delta.Build critical thinking skills and analytical reading skills through the study of diverse interpretations of historical events, cultural diversity, and ethnic studies.Establish cross-campus and interdisciplinary relationships between ISU and Langston students, faculty, and staff from a variety of departments and disciplines.To measure these course objectives in the physical classroom, we designed lessons and assessments, assigned readings, hosted guest lectures, and encouraged discussions. Content covered course modules titled “Creating a Cotton Kingdom,” “At the Crossroads: The Birth of American Music,” “Aquaculture in the Delta,” and modern “Agriculture Economics.” Guest lecturers included Valarie Grim from Indiana University to discuss the agricultural history of the delta, Emary D. Smith from Alcorn State University to discuss food security in the delta, and Joseph Morris from ISU to discuss aquaculture in the delta, thus intentionally blending history and agricultural sciences.The trip took students to historically significant places such as Money and Sumner, Mississippi, to visit sites related to the murder and trial of Emmett Till. We visited Clarksdale, Ruleville, and Mound Bayou, Mississippi, to see places with historical significance to blues music and to the civil rights work of Fannie Lou Hamer and Medgar Evers, as well as to better understand the role of a historically Black town in the region. We also took students to Stoneville, Mississippi, where Mississippi State University's Delta Research and Extension Center researches catfish, cotton, and other important agricultural products in the region, and to Alcorn State University's Extension/Research Farm and Technology Transfer Center in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. During the trip, students completed approximately ten hours of community service. Some of the service-learning components of the trip included helping with spring planting at Marilyn William's family farm in Tunica, Mississippi, and assisting with the thrift store and food pantry at St. Gabriel Mercy Center in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, and at the St. Francis Community Center in Greenwood, Mississippi. The service-learning components of the course connected students to individuals and organizations in the delta working to address systemic issues in the region, such as food security, poverty, public health, and nutrition. Additionally, the service-learning components of the trip provided students from both institutions opportunities to work together through a positive team-building exercise.The region's rich agricultural and cultural history validates the purpose of this high-impact learning and travel course on the Mississippi Delta because the delta offers a unique microcosm of much of American society. The interdisciplinary and interinstitutional intentionality of the course exhibits the importance of forging partnerships between predominately white and minority-serving institutions because it afforded our students opportunities to have meaningful learning interactions with faculty and fellow students from a wide variety of cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, land-grant institutions provide a natural space for developing interdisciplinary courses between the agricultural sciences and agricultural history, thus deliberately bringing together the humanities and the sciences.",

    "abstract": "In memories of the Cold War, the German Democratic Republic's (GDR) horrific environmental record casts a long shadow. According to popular memory, the East German regime cared little for the environment and its people, poisoning the water, air, and land in pursuit of “real, existing socialism.” Thirty years after the collapse, its reputation as an “ecocidal” regime endures. This story is at best incomplete and at worst misleading. Much of it is a product of the regime's sudden end in 1989 and the “green” politics of reunification that followed. In her new book, Saving Nature under Socialism, Julia Ault demands we widen the lens beyond 1989 and the borders of the GDR. Ault argues that environmentalism and environmental thought had a longer and often contradictory history that dated back to the country's founding. Ault traces how the regime's attitudes, policies, and diplomatic efforts around the environment reflected its shifting position within Cold War geopolitics; how citizens took direction from the regime, and then later organized in semiautonomous spaces around environmental issues; and finally, how environmentalists became radicalized over the last decade of the country's existence, looking to the West and the East for answers. Ault's book is a history not just of East Germany but also of the world of environmental ideas, politics, and activism that permeated, traversed, and undermined its militarized borders.Saving Nature is a comprehensive history of state and nonstate actors, laws, institutions, and ideas about nature in the GDR. Ault shows how environmental thought was not a Western import but had taken root prior to 1949 and then expanded and evolved over the next four decades. Surprisingly, the East German state was at the forefront of this movement between 1950 and 1970, promoting environmental policies that balanced nature protection with the demands of heavy industry and the planned economy. The regime tasked mass social organizations like the Friends of Nature and Heimat and the Cultural League with the promotion of a socialist environmentalism. It passed laws and constitutional amendments to protect the environment in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It created a Ministry for Environmental Protection in 1971, less than a year after the US Environmental Protection Agency and three years before West Germany created its own ministry. And it conducted environmental diplomacy with Western and Eastern European countries, participating in bilateral and multinational negotiations in conferences from Helsinki to Stockholm, to name just two places. In other words, it behaved like all industrial countries during the Cold War, responding to the growing environmental awakening abroad while also acting with ambivalence toward effective environmental regulation at home.The story of East German environmentalism, however, is also a protest story. As mass demonstrations against nuclear power, militarization, and chemical pollution roiled western Europe, a similar, albeit smaller movement took root in the East. Under the aegis of the Protestant church, which had carved out a semiautonomous zone within the GDR, activists and church leaders hosted forums, traveled to conferences, and produced environmentalist materials. All of this occurred with the tacit permission of the regime—that is, until the 1980s. It was in this decade, punctuated by foreign and domestic crises, that the regime chose repression. Believing environmental activism threatened the financial and political solvency of the country, it classified all environmental data, deployed the Stasi against activists, and publicly pretended the pollution crisis didn't exist. Not all socialist regimes, however, chose this direction.In the most original contribution of the book, Ault traces the diverging environmentalism of the GDR and its socialist neighbor Poland. For the first three decades of its existence, Poland's environmental politics mapped directly onto the GDR's, allowing the two socialist neighbors to coordinate on numerous issues, including transborder pollution and scientific and technological exchanges. Cooperation collapsed in the 1980s as both countries faced interrelated political and financial crises. After the suppression of Solidarity, however, the Polish government pursued its own program of glasnost, tolerating more open discussion of economic problems, pollution, and human rights. By the end of the 1980s, East German activists openly admired their Polish comrades for their relative power, collaborating with them and allies in West Germany to openly confront the regime. Ault's discovery reveals an underappreciated schism in the supposed monolithic bloc, with the Polish government continuing to take its cues from Moscow while the GDR remained beholden to the planned economy and Western creditors.Ault's book raises an important question about the centrality of environmentalism to the revolution of 1989. While the regime's crackdown and the shock of Chernobyl radicalized activists, their numbers remained small. As late as 1988, there were just a few thousand active participants. And in 1989, environmental issues were one of the myriad grievances articulated by protesters, from human rights to democratization. Yet as Ault shows, pollution and environmental activists were in every part of the country. Both were impossible to miss. Add in forty years of active, state-backed environmental education, and you have a population conditioned to receive a radical critique and demand change. Environmentalism didn't spark the protest of 1989, but it covered every inch of the country for decades with dry, combustible kindling.",

    "abstract": "In the second edition of the Economist newspaper in September 1843, the paper celebrated the fact that “active and intelligent landlords . . . [were] breaking up the hard clods of ignorance . . . [and] the art of husbandry, is rapidly changing into the science of agriculture.” Whether one accepts the Economist's assessment of the changing nature of agriculture in England in 1843 or not, James Fisher's fascinating book demonstrates clearly how long delayed, conflicted, and fraught with social significance that process was.The Enclosure of Knowledge focuses on books about agriculture through the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in Britain. Fisher outlines how the popularity of such writing ebbed and flowed, but they became much more prevalent from the middle to the end of the eighteenth century. Through this century and a half, the nature of such books changed: from books that assembled local habits of husbandry into collected anecdotes, to conscious efforts to produce guides based on such practices, to works that espoused theories based on experimentation. Such writing had critics in all time periods. Complaints ranged from comments that there were too many such books, too full of borrowed advice, to the warnings of Arthur Young (who contributed no small part of these books) that “books are at hand, and it may be thought that agriculture is to be learned from them. . . . No man could be such an idiot” (187).Throughout, Fisher places his work in opposition to those who suggest that writing about agriculture was just another example of the application of Enlightenment and scientific experimentation applied to agriculture—another example of the shift from art to science. Instead, Fisher argues that such writing was an attempt at the appropriation of farming knowledge from those who labored on the land by those who did not. Such writing was as much a process of the “enclosure” of farming as the more widely discussed land enclosures of the late eighteenth century and an important part of the spread and triumph of agrarian capitalism. As Fisher says, “books disrupted and reordered how knowledge was produced, stored, transferred, acquired, exercised, and legitimated, subordinating a labour-based system beneath a book-based system. . . . The plough was subordinated to the pen as those who worked the land were increasingly subordinated to those who owned and managed it” (263–64). This study provides an effective and important corrective to scholarly books on agriculture through this period that demonstrate little appreciation for how whatever practical knowledge they contained was “lifted” from those who labored in the field and with even less appreciation for the social consequences of this writing.Fisher's study demonstrates a quite remarkable familiarity with a wide range of books on agriculture through a century and a half of such writing. The book discusses the works of some of the best-known authors of the eighteenth century—Arthur Young, William Marshall, Lord Kames, Nathaniel Kent—and a host of their less-celebrated peers. (The table in the appendix listing the authors sited by date and including details of their education, etc., is particularly useful and interesting.) Fisher handles all of this in nicely balanced, articulate, and clear prose, treating such works with the seriousness they deserve but not immune to the humor and absurdity of some of their arguments.There is less here than some may wish about the way such appropriation of knowledge was resisted, opposed, and/or ridiculed, a function partly of the focus on books published on agriculture rather than their reception or opposition to the gathering of such knowledge.There are also times in this book, perhaps, when Fisher is too insistent on making his argument. Some readers may find this especially so in the introductory and concluding sections, where the author expands on the lessons to be learned from this book. Nonetheless, it is no doubt true that this history of the enclosure of knowledge about farming “has profound significance for our understanding of how modern capitalism developed” (275). Fisher has provided us with an important reminder of this significance and a useful discussion of a remarkably extensive set of books on agriculture and has packaged it all in interesting and articulate prose.",

We have become accustomed to buying and eating these foods in a refrigerated form, and in fact would be uneasy at the thought of picking them up from an ordinary grocery shelf. Yet, at the turn of the century, refrigeration of these foods was not common among farmers, wholesalers, retailers, or consumers. Even though beef was shipped across the country (and across the Pacific) in refrigerated transport, poultry, eggs, and milk were still produced in local regions for local markets and were not usually subjected to cold storage. In order for a national, year-round market for milk, eggs, and poultry to exist, American producers and distributors needed an integrated system of refrigerated and sanitary food handling and storage facilities that stretched from the farmer to the consumer, as well as consumer confidence in cold-storage. But these foods, unlike beef, did not easily withstand refrigerated storage: milk spoiled, eggs cracked, and poultry decomposed and dried out. Refrigerated transportation, too, was not kind to these foods, spilling milk, smashing eggs, and leaving poultry bruised and discolored. Given these problems, it is not surprising that public acceptance of refrigerated food was not immediate nor easily come by. The public often believed that cold-storage food was unhealthy and, in fact, it was often dangerously contaminated with bacteria or decomposed.' This public unease over food safety fueled a fierce and continued de-",

    "abstract": "For nearly sixty years, roughly 1880 to 1950, before the affordability and widespread use of combines, grain production in the American and Canadian Great Plains was dependent on harvesting with binders. Binders cut the grain stalks and then tied them into bundles with twine that farmhands later would gather into shocks to await threshing. The majority of the twine used was made from fiber from agave plants (sisal and henequen) from Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The dependency on this Mexican commodity is illustrated by the fact that for the first two decades of the twentieth century, the United States and Canada consumed an estimated 230,000 tons ofthe fiber a year for the production of binder twine. Thus, a double agricultural dependency devel? oped between these regions that this essay seeks to explore. Along with this in? ternational dependency, corporate, social, and labor issues are integral aspects ofthe grain/twine story. International Harvester of Chicago came to dominate the twine industry in the United States, but faced stiff competition from Amer? ican and Canadian penitentiaries that developed their own twine mills using low-wage inmate labor. And in Mexico, wealthy henequen estate owners en? slaved Yaqui Indians from Sonora to work in their fields in the Yucatan. aDe? pendent Harvests seeks to introduce these themes and to east them into their proper transnational and agricultural history perspectives.",

In search of ways for cotton farmers to diversify, Vance noted that \"whether equitable or not, a system of division of the product by shares between landlord and tenant has been worked out by custom and law for cotton.\" Indeed, there was a credit system in place that facilitated cotton production, a system that dated back to Reconstruction. Lamenting that \"no generally accepted system of share cropping has been worked out for more complex forms of farming,\" Vance could not foresee that soon furnishing merchants would refashion the crop lien to facilitate poultry production. For some time, politicians, Vance, and a host of rural reformers waged an unsuccessful war against the crop lien, and its close relatives sharecropping and tenancy, which they considered to be the basis of southern problems. The poultry industry--today the model for contract farming and a multi-million-dollar business--grew out of the crop lien system, an institution thought to be the root of southern poverty.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Under British settlement, New Zealand’s export income became increasingly dependent upon new and improved pasture for sheep and cattle. While the introduction of familiar pasture plants--such as ryegrass and cocksfoot--was preferred, from the 1880s farmers also experimented with different grass species to suit newly experienced environmental conditions. Both Chewings fescue (Festuca rubra var. commutata) and paspalum (Paspalum dilatatum) were experimented with and adopted for pasture up to the 1920s. While the discovery of ecological limits partly determined the chain of events, the story of these adoptions equally reflects the influence of human and social factors upon the pattern of agricultural change. Individuals and newspapers were more integral to the process of investigating the uses of Chewings fescue and paspalum than departments and government reports. This case study emphasizes Australian and American influences more than British ones, which necessitates the reassessment of all external knowledge in the light of New Zealand’s experience.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The burning of the rangelands of the South Island of New Zealand by pastoralists in the second half of the nineteenth century has been highly contentious. The dogma of \"indiscriminate burning\" has become so entrenched in New Zealand’s environmental history that critics of burning have felt little need to provide evidence to support their assertions. Critics of tussock burning claimed that it was a catalyst for mass erosion in the hills and mountains of Canterbury. In recent years, scientists have concluded that this was unlikely as much of the erosion predated European settlement. This essay is part of the reappraisal of rangeland burning. It uses archival evidence from station diaries and memoirs to answer the questions of why the pastoralists burned, how often they burned, and when they burned. These sources show that burning was an important management tool and that the burning practices of the runholders in this study were characterized by discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The period from the end of the Civil War to about 1905 saw some key changes in American country roads, including the passage of the first state-aid road laws, the creation of the first federal road agency, and the growth of a strong urban-rural coalition promoting rural road improvements. Although these have been well discussed, two significant but unrecognized changes lay at their heart. First, the effect of the good-roads campaigns of the 1890s in convincing farmers to embrace a major intellectual shift: trading the belief that roads were \"natural\"--local resources to be husbanded--for the idea that they were \"technological\"--publicly owned tools to be engineered in the service of social ends. Second, how the shifting uses of rural roads, from groups of urban cyclists touring the countryside to mail carriers delivering letters to farmhouses, not only strengthened the growing ties between rural and urban areas but also helped transform the basic political relationships between isolated communities and county, state, and national governments. Together these turn-of-the-century changes paved the way, literally and figuratively, for the growth of the extensive highway system that today is such a dominating characteristic of the American landscape.",

    "abstract": "In May 1962 leaders from a variety of federal agencies and independent organizations gathered to \"exchange ideas about the future course of American conservation policy.\" Central to the agenda discussed were certain Kennedy administration agricultural conservation programs that sought to apply the ideology of multiple use, which formed the heart of public land conservation policy for private lands. Key policymakers, most notably Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman, used the conference and the subsequent years to argue that adjusting agricultural lands to new uses that still retained an agrarian foundation, such as on-farm recreation, would solve multiple societal problems, including rural poverty, the disappearance of the small farm, agricultural surplus, lack of outdoor recreational space for urban and suburban Americans, and urban blight. This article explains how and why federal policymakers during the 1960s attempted to transform private agricultural lands to meet these diverse, and at times competing, societal goals.",

Four years later the visitors crowding Abilene's dusty streets noted over 100 frame dwellings, a courthouse, a school, four substantial hotels, a wide choice of taverns, at least three restaurants, a mammoth livery stable, two lumber yards, a theater, a tinshop, as well as a blacksmith's, and retail establishments dealing in hardware, furniture, farm machinery, footwear, groceries, jewelry and firearms, besides numerous outlets for clothing, dry goods and general merchandise. From outlying Dickinson County, farm products of all types poured into Abilene to feed a consumer market so immense it could not be met locally, and a scattering of new frame farmhouses testified to a measure of rural wealth.

One of the issues that commissioners planned to address provoked an internal impasse: the relationship of immigration to agriculture. Charles S. Barrett, president of the Farmers Educational and Co-operative Union, insisted upon removing a section of the commission’s report that raised the possibility of settling immigrants in rural areas. His organization was actively pursuing political partnership with the American Federation of Labor. Barrett forced fellow commissioners to confront the existence of a rift between small farmers and organized labor on the one hand, and large agricultural and business interests on the other. The commission’s encounter with immigration is emblematic of its general hesitancy to address issues arising from economic divisions.",

Scientific discourse reduced regional variations to one universal ideal type of yogurt: a model for all producers. That standardized product embodied a nationalistic policy that authenticated products on the basis of their Bulgarianization. This transition of production also changed the labor profile, as housewives relinquished yogurt making to male workers in small dairies.",

But taking full advantage of the treasure trove of material culture requires a visual literacy that few historians have been trained to exercise. This essay explains some of the reasons for the disciplinary divides that separate objects and their curators from historians and their research agendas. It introduces myriad approaches to reading material culture that have the potential to inform students of rural and agricultural history. It suggests some basic steps to identify objects that can serve as material evidence of historic processes and that might also symbolize contemporary attitudes about the rural past. The possibilities are as endless as the objects created by people in the past.",

This article elaborates on this question by describing the relationships between water and people in the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho, which remains the heart of agricultural production for the state. A massive irrigation infrastructure allows the Snake River Plain's inhabitants to produce potatoes, wheat, cattle, beets, and other crops in a semi-arid desert. Although not exclusive to this region or culture, water allocation and use in the Snake River Plain reflects the social, political, and economic structures of its communities as much as the geological and hydrological histories ascribed to it.

German immigrants form Cincinnati, Ohio, founded agricultural community that traditional accounts credit with bringing about an agricultural revolution in what had been a frontier area, in the best traditions of innovation in the New South. The reality of Cullman County’s history proves more valuable to understanding southern farming than the rosy legends. Hard geographical and social realities clashed with the often impractical vision of colonizer John G. Cullmann. His Germans, with their traditional work ethic and willingness to experiment with such new products as wine and strawberries, did try, sometimes unsuccessfully, to make practical changes in southern farming. Far more families from neighbouring Georgia answered Cullmann’s call and they implemented the traditional southern cotton culture. Living among both groups were local white and black farm families from before the arrival of the Germans who also struggled in their own way to survive. How these groups failed, succeeded, and remained outlines just how limited could be the success of even the best laid plans in what remained all too much a part of the traditional South.",

    "abstract": "Based on account books, a frequently overlooked type of source, this is a study of grocery purchases made by sample customers from some country stores in Upper Canada (Ontario), in selected years between 1808 and 1861. Although literary sources suggest otherwise, no one bought chocolate; but many people bought tea, tobacco, sugar, and salt, evidently at standard levels for contemporary British society. As time went by, a growing range of prod? ucts appear among purchases, notably many drugs and medications. The ev? idence is also read for indications of what families made for themselves. Their choices, visible in everyday routine purchases, have implications for some ofthe main stories about material life, consumption, and market rela? tionships in early settlement society. It is difficult, for example, to picture rural isolation from a capitalist world if ordinary farm families regularly pur? chased goods imported from the far side ofthe globe.",

In addition, the physicians themselves conducted regular clinics at these facilities. Sometimes the physicians drove, but in many cases, they flew to the location.

    "abstract": "Conservation of natural resources in South Texas is basically a modern de? velopment that parallels the evolution of the Soil Conservation Service and other federal agricultural agencies. Since the World War II era, Hispanic pro? ducers have played an important role in adopting new conservation practices to conserve and enhance the value of their lands. Initially, the region was a natural grassland devoted to ranching, but farm development in the early twentieth century led to a sharp increase in irrigated farmland along the Rio Grande. Conservation practices during the long period of extensive ranching were ineffective. As a result, by the twentieth century much of the grasslands were turned into brushland due to overgrazing, the disuse of fires to suppress weeds and useless shrubs, soil compaction, and soil and wind erosion. His? panic farmers and ranchers had to be convinced that new practices were beneftcial. The cooperation of SCS, ASCS, and other agencies facilitated the work of introducing new practices, such as disking, root plowing, seeding of new grasses, and range management practices. Farmers also benefited from new practices. Construction of Falcon Dam in 1954 was a great boost to water conservation and flood control. The last forty years have seen a rapid growth in wildlife ranches and the sale of rangelands to prosperous profes? sionals and businessmen and women. At present, three thousand Hispanic producers are dedicated to conserving their water and soil resources, adapting to these two new developments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The belief that farm work is good for children is deeply rooted in agrarian ideals, which impute a wholesomeness to farming tied to its economic, social, and moral value to society. Nevertheless, in the context of the changing scale of work, community, and new ideas about childhood and education, Progressive reformers suggested that some farm work was unhealthy for children. To separate the agricultural labor that concerned them from the agrarian consensus, they developed a critique centered on education and industrialized agriculture. Restricting children’s labor to allow school attendance balanced two positives for farm children--education and work. Restricting child labor in industrialized agriculture simply recognized its divergence from the family farm ideal. Reformers succeeded modestly along this dual track by the 1930s. The boundaries of the agrarian framework limited further child labor regulation in agriculture, however--not until 1974 were age and hour restrictions on children’s field work applied across the industry--thirty-five years after similar protections had been provided in other industries, and exemptions continued for children working on family and small farms.",

Farm safety leaders fashioned a largely educational movement to address farm families’ technologically complex environments, since farming’s entrepreneurial nature required a different approach than did efforts in other occupational domains. The nation’s rural policymakers had largely neglected the issue until the Second World War, when they recognized that farm accidents threatened the nation’s wartime mobilization efforts. The farm safety movement was characterized by a cooperative effort, which included the National Safety Council, the United States Department of Agriculture, land grant colleges, and the nation’s rural youth organizations. However, efforts to impose more stringent regulations faced resistance from farmers after the creation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.",

English language Japanese newspaper reports from the Philippines suggest that the invaders grossly under-utilized this vast storehouse of agricultural wealth. Washington’s pre-war oil embargo severely crippled military and civilian transport services throughout the war, and Japan’s conversion of cane sugar into fuel alcohol and butane for aviation fuel failed to generate successful outcomes. Also, as the Pacific War eliminated cotton imports from the United States, India, and Egypt, placing numerous Japanese textile factories in jeopardy, Tokyo attempted to replace Philippine cane sugar plantings that previously served US markets with raising raw cotton for Japanese textile interests. In the Philippines, however, multifarious bottlenecks crippled all of Tokyo’s wartime farm projects. Though the Japanese occupation was short-lived, it demonstrated Tokyo’s intention to adjust the Philippine economy into a dependent relationship with Japanese industries.",

This article argues that historians should not take agricultural newspapers as is and assume that they expressed the farmer’s point of view. Because most of the publishers and editors of farm newspapers lived in cities and were influenced by progressive reformers, farm newspapers often reflected urban reform ideas. At the same time, farm newspapers provided space for opposing viewpoints by publishing letters to the editor. The coverage of agricultural education and rural school consolidation in four midwestern farm newspapers provides an illustrative case study of this interaction. While publishers and editors promoted reformers’ recommendations, many farmers did not agree with or follow their advice. As a result, farm newspapers are better seen not as expressing the ideas of farmers, but providing a forum for reformers and farmers to debate proposed changes to country life.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines how Mao’s grand strategy for Cold War competition inflicted a catastrophic agricultural failure in China and victimized tens of millions of Chinese peasants. It argues that Khrushchev’s 1957 boast about the Soviet Union surpassing the United States in key economic areas inspired Mao to launch an industrialization program that would push the People’s Republic past Great Britain in some production categories within fifteen years. Beginning in 1958 Mao imposed unrealistic targets on Chinese grain production to extract funds from agriculture for rapid industrial growth. Maoists placed relentless pressure on communist cadres for ruthless implementation of the Great Leap Forward. Contrary to Maoist plans, China’s grain output in 1959-1960 declined sharply from 1957 levels and rural per capita grain retention decreased dramatically. Throughout China, party cadres’ mismanagement of agricultural production was responsible for the decline in grain output, and the communist state’s excessive requisition of grain caused food shortages for the peasants. But the key factor determining the famine’s uneven impact on the peasantry in the provinces was the degree to which provincial leaders genuinely and energetically embraced Maoist programs. This is illustrated by a close examination of the Great Leap famine in Anhui Province.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This address is an exploration of a lifetime of disparate and often conflicting observations about how different people view what is right and good for agriculture, food, and farmers around the world. The exploration utilizes the concept of wicked problems to focus on the issue of differing historical interpretations of global agricultural development. Sandra Bade defines wicked problems as \"dynamically complex, ill-structured, public problems\" for which \"there can be radically different views and understanding of the problem by different stakeholders, with no unique ’correct’ view. \"The wicked problem construct is applied to four core ideas in the history of agricultural development—small farms, cash crops, agrarian ideals, and international development—to demonstrate the potential for using this concept to approach complex problems of historical interpretation and contribute to solutions to the challenges of global agricultural development. The author suggests historians should acknowledge contradictory interpretations and work toward reconciliation and synthesis, where it is possible and, where not, toward a clear explication of the basis for remaining differences. The author also encourages historians to seek multidisciplinary research opportunities that will help bring insights about historical context to policy deliberations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This essay evaluates national wetlands policy during the first decade of the twentieth century. Beginning in the 1890s the national government began to assume new responsibilities for natural resource management. By the end of World War I, Congress exercised some form of control over western irrigation, flood control, and range and mineral policies. Yet Progressive Era national policymakers were also deeply interested in wetlands drainage. In the early 1900s they launched an abortive movement to nationalize drainage in the hopes of creating new farms, improving public health, and relieving urban congestion. The failure of the movement illustrates that centralization, which scholars identify as a primary theme of Progressive Era conservation, was neither inevitable nor inexorable. Ironically, the growth of the embryonic administrative and regulatory state sometimes precluded the development of centralized natural resource programs by pitting different natural resource agencies, local communities, and constituent groups against one another in a bitter and irreconcilable feud over power and funding.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In 1942 over 110,000 Japanese Americans were evacuated from the West Coast to ten inland, barbed wire-enclosed relocation centers in the name of national security. Agriculture was a key component of the eight arid to semiarid centers located in the western United States. Each center’s agricultural program included produce for human consumption, feed crops, and livestock. Some centers also grew seed, ornamental, and war crops. Evacuees raised and consumed five types of livestock and sixty-one produce varieties, including many traditional foods. Seasonal surpluses were preserved, shipped to other centers, or sold on the open market. Short growing seasons, poor soils, initially undeveloped lands, pests, equipment shortages, and labor issues hampered operations. However, imprisoned evacuee farmers proved that diverse agricultural programs could succeed in the harsh settings primarily because of labor-intensive farming methods, ingenuity, and the large markets provided by the centers. These agricultural programs played major roles in feeding, providing meaningful employment, and preparing evacuees for life outside the centers, and readied lands for post-war \"homesteaders.\"",

    "abstract": "The historiography of rural Canada, and especially that of rural prairie Canada, has been the subject of pointed criticism during the past decade. One of Canada's leading rural historians, John Herd Thompson, con? cluded in 1990 that the net result of Canadian historical writing was a marginality of the rural majority. Historians, he said, tended to perceive members of rural societies as reactionaries and, hence, viewed rural his? tory as an anachronism. He reserved special criticism for the agricultural history of the Canadian prairies, citing it as uneven and limited. In a frequently quoted description of women's history, Thompson argued that of all prairie women, farm women were truly the last neglected major? ity. There have been other criticisms of rural prairie historiography. Some observers detected an underlying negative tone in this literature. Like the overall history of rural Canada of which it is part, wrote a reviewer of David Jones's Empire ofDust, there is little in it to support a cheerful frame of mind. Decline, despair, disintegration are the watchwords for rural Canada. Others have observed a simplistic, celebratory approach in the study of rural prairie society. For example, a 1991 history of first generation Ukrainian Canadians in Canada was chided for re-",

    "abstract": "The 1999 Supreme Court of Canada decision in the case of R. v. Donald Marshall Jr. brought about a dramatic change in Aboriginal (First Nations) fishing and harvesting rights in Canada's Maritime Provinces. Marshall argued that a series of eighteenth-century treaties signed between the Mi'kmaq and the British government guaranteed his right to fish for commercial purposes. The British and, later, the Canadian governments accorded little priority to these treaties, despite repeated protests by the Mi'kmaq. The Supreme Court's decision caught most observers by surprise, particularly because of the sweeping provisions it made for Aboriginal participation in the commercial fishery. Political controversy followed, sparked by the absence of decisive action by the federal governement, by the First Nations' determination to commence commercial fishing and by growing anger at judicial activism by the Supreme Court. The resulting tensions exacerbated long-standing ethnic tensions in the region. The Marshall decision represented a major turning point in Aboriginal harvesting rights in Canada. The Supreme Court's judgment gave new power to treaties that non-Aboriginal governments had chosen to ignore. At the same time, the decision provided Aboriginal Maritimers with assured access to important fisheries (particularly the lucrative lobster trade) and therefore a key role envolving regional economy",

    "abstract": "Abstract At the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, the United States annexed what had been the Mexican Department of New Mexico, and as it did, it absorbed millions of acres of agro-pastoral land whose parcels had been under a communal system of ownership by Mexican citizen-villagers. From the heirs’ point of view, the subsequent American system of adjudicating ownership of these traditional properties proved inadequate, leading to the loss of two-thirds of their commons to American land speculators and the U. S. National Forest. Like the Native Americans, the heirs of these grants have long seethed in resentment over the steady erosion of their hold on their traditional lands and culture. This article outlines the processes of despoliation of the land grants from their original owners, and, more centrally, suggests the historical cycles of collective struggle that the heirs have mounted since the 1840s in order to retain and wrest back their commons, as well as organize the grants that they have been able to secure. A stubborn land-grant movement has gone through various forms of collective action including clandestine violence, protest confrontation, legal strategies, and political lobbying. In the most recent phase, activists have hopeful signs that the U.S. Congress is ready to respond to their demand for return of commons now under federal jurisdiction.",

By testing three hypotheses referring to the degree of commercial orientation, levels of intensity regarding various inputs, and the spatial configuration of field systems, the paper concludes that the productive profiles of these estates did not conform very closely to the expectations of von Thunen’s model. The explanation lies in the fact that, by having access to the seigneurial prerogative of tapping into their peasants’ resources, manorial estates were not hard pressed to maximize profitability through a drive towards efficiency.",

    "abstract": "This article compares two episodes of technology transfer in the 1890s: the movement of bright tobacco production technology to south-central Africa with the spread of the crop to eastern North Carolina and South Carolina. It finds similarities in the people who introduced the crop, but significant differences in the methods used to produce it. This is troubling because the type is defined by the cultivation and especially the curing techniques used to produce it; it is also often described in the historical literature as \"Virginia tobacco,\" even when grown elsewhere. the technological differences are the product of different environments, which include not only the climate but also many elements of the technological system beyond immediate human control: the availability and organization of labor, differences in market structures and marketing institutions, and the government incentives provided to buyers. Therefore, this essay takes as its subject the paradox inherent in the official classification of tobacco types regulated by the USDA and argues that varietal types represent a form of market regulation disguised as botanical taxonomy.",

They have assumed that American farmers had developed an unproblematic set of techniques, the presence of which was essential before large-scale European settlement of the Prairies could begin. American historians of Great Plains agriculture present a far different picture of those American farmers. Dry farming in the United States did not designate an agreed-upon set of techniques, but a lively field of debate that remained unresolved for decades. Summer fallow comprised the essential practice on the driest Canadian Prairies for the conservation of moisture. Americans neither pioneered nor promoted it first; summer fallow only became general practice on the northern Great Plains after Canadian farmers had demonstrated how it could be practicably done. The flow of this agricultural innovation turns out to have been the opposite of what most Canadian scholars had assumed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the early 1940s, the agricultural New Deal was broader and more democratic than those aspects of it that survived World War II. Carl C. Taylor, who led the sociological research unit in the USDA’s Bureau of Agricultural Economics, and other rural sociologists shared a two-handed commitment to democracy. They merged social science with local knowledge and integrated federal action with citizen participation. These activist principles were best exemplified in a Third New Deal program called county land-use planning, within which sociologists played two roles. First, they \"delineated\" the boundaries of rural neighborhoods and communities so that the best representation of citizens on the local planning committees was obtained. With local citizen-researchers, Taylor’s sociologists delineated eleven thousand rural neighborhoods and nearly two thousand communities in thirty-two states. Second, they evaluated the planning program in a few select counties. The richest assessment was Arthur F. Raper’s study of Greene County, Georgia, \"Tenants of the Almighty.\" He found that, despite racism, the program made tremendous physical, economic, and psychological gains among the county’s poor blacks and whites. However, a conservative Congress aborted the federal democratic-planning program in 1942; soon thereafter these anti-New Dealers banished critical social science from the USDA. The likes of which have not been seen since, at least not in the United States.",

The development of such ponds in the New England and Mid-Atlantic colonies during the eighteenth century marked the culmination of a long process by which British-American colonists adapted to declines in natural fish populations brought on by over-fishing and disruption of habitat by water-powered mills. The development of private fish-ponds as an increasingly important component of American mixed husbandry practices in long-settled areas by the end of the eighteenth century illustrates early American farmers’ ability to successfully adapt to self-wrought changes in their physical environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The absence of dry farming techniques is the key element that many Canadian scholars use to explain the decade of delay in the agricultural development of the prairie region after the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885. They have assumed that American farmers had developed an unproblematic set of techniques, the presence of which was essential before large-scale European settlement of the Prairies could begin. American historians of Great Plains agriculture present a far different picture of those American farmers. Dry farming in the United States did not designate an agreed-upon set of techniques, but a lively field of debate that remained unresolved for decades. Summer fallow comprised the essential practice on the driest Canadian Prairies for the conservation of moisture. Americans neither pioneered nor promoted it first; summer fallow only became general practice on the northern Great Plains after Canadian farmers had demonstrated how it could be practicably done. The flow of this agricultural innovation turns out to have been the opposite of what most Canadian scholars had assumed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract English colonists and African slaves began occupying the South Carolina Lowcountry in the late seventeenth century. During the eighteenth century thousands of slaves cleared thousands of acres of swamplands to create the colony’s signature rice fields and secure its place within the Atlantic economy. This essay examines the changing perceptions and uses of trees as the key to understanding how planters transformed a perceived wilderness into one of British America’s wealthiest and most repressive plantation societies. Colonists used trees to assess and understand the land’s capacity for market agriculture. Slaves cleared land of its wood to prepare the terrain for planting, provide Britain’s empire with vital commodities, and build the infrastructure of daily material life in the region. As colonists and slaves came into sustained engagement with this landscape they learned to exploit its distinctive natural resources more intensively. This transformation is better understood as a process of agricultural adaptation than as an episode in environmental degradation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the decade before the California Gold Rush, the popular idea that Americans held a natural right to land as a legacy of the American Revolution was enriched and expanded by such events as the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island, the Anti-Rent War in New York, the flood of Irish refugees into New York City, growing opposition to the expansion of slavery into new territories acquired during the war with Mexico, and the Revolution of 1848 in Europe. These events strengthened popular sovereignty and the notion that human beings had rights that transcended those defined by legislatures, courts, or even constitutions. They also promoted a new discussion of how values within the United States differed from those in Europe--where land was scarce and served as the foundation for aristocratic regimes and sharp class differences. The squatter was a ubiquitous figure on every frontier of the United States, but none more than California, where both town sites and agricultural land were covered by Mexican land grants that took decades to define and confirm. This article tells the story of how powerful forces in California undermined squatter rights--and the heritage of the American Revolution as well.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article suggests that the idea of \"modernization,\" the uni-linear transition from peasantry to commercial agriculture, has shaped much of the writing of rural immigrant communities during the twentieth century. It also suggests that the history of immigrant and ethnic farm communities has begun to take a different tack during the last decade. This change reflects trends in the broader historiography of settlement society, including a shift from social history to cultural history. Modernity is no longer seen as an unrelenting force, natural and dominant in character. Rather postmodernity’s concern with fragmentation and asymmetry, and the linguistic turn with its fixation on cultural invention and created mythology, seemed evident. Regional, national, and international-based studies alike reflect this new research agenda, and this article highlights seven books in particular. Three, focusing on settler society and rural culture in regional, national, and transnational variations, describe modernity in particular; they see the very idea of change, once seen as inevitable and inexorable, as constructed, invented, and contrived. Three others are local studies of specific ethnic rural groups in which the immigrant or ethnic farm community stands at a cross current to a commercializing countryside, contesting and subverting the very intentions of the agents of the market economy and state interests. The final book is the author’s own recent work in comparative history, Diaspora in the Countryside: Two Mennonite Communities and Mid-Twentieth Century Rural Disjuncture. The two central words \"diaspora\" and \"disjuncture\" suggests that these communities, one located in Canada and the other in the United States, responded to economic changes through a diversity of lifeworlds, including farm commercialization, urbanization, and a conservative recreation of an old order agraria. These Mennonites created a set of contradictory mythologies and master narratives that sought to bring teleological sense, social order, and meaning to inchoate and fragmented cultures. The seven books thus acknowledge quotidian complexity, ethnic variation, and national and regional difference. They are representative of what appears to be a wider trend in the academy of North American rural history.",

Drought, searing sun, blizzards and sub-zero temperatures, and hail storms with tornadic winds at harvest time continue to make agricultural life on the Great Plains matters of perseverance and adaptation. Although the term environment is well-known, however, the concept of environmentalism is relatively new. And, while it is largely understood in the context of conservation, that is, the protection of nature, those who have lived on the Great Plains have been environmentalists in other contexts throughout the history of the region. In little more than a century, the residents of the plains have used the concepts of the change, control, and preservation of nature to govern their relationships with the en? vironment and, by so doing, make both settlement and agriculture possible on the Great Plains.",

    "abstract": "This article analyzes the postwar transformation of the Dutch Warmblood farm horse into a riding horse. It gives special attention to the farmers’ practical breeding methods and to the role that scientists and government policymakers played in the transformation process. Until the 1970s, Warmblood breeding methods were a continuation of pre-Mendelian methods that focused on qualitative assessment of a horse’s conformation, that is, its exterior characteristics. In 1980, the Dutch government undertook an effort to modernize Warmblood breeding by turning it into a collectively organized, scientific enterprise. These plans were largely subverted by the fierce opposition of breeders. Nevertheless, quantitative scientific methods, particularly quantitative genetics, started to make inroads into Warmblood breeding at the time. However, the breeders’ decision to switch to quantitative methods was a reaction to other pressures, economic and otherwise, rather than a response to the government’s call for science-based modernization. Moreover, qualitative assessment remained as important in the selection of breeding stock as before.",

    "abstract": "The combination of environmental history and Atlantic history seems like a natural one. After all, the process of forging the Atlantic World wrought vast ecological transformations on every continent bordering its oceanic basin, and environmental conditions helped shape the boundaries, success, and economies of post-Columbian Indigenous and European societies in the Americas. For many years, however, the scholarship of environmental history and Atlantic history developed largely in parallel rather than in conversation (with some notable exceptions).1 The question is not whether Atlantic history has environmental aspects that can be explored—it does, and scholars such as Alfred Crosby, J. R. McNeill, Keith Pluymers, Marcy Norton, Matthew Mulcahy, Judith Carney, and others have pointed these out—but whether an explicitly environmental perspective can shed light on the major questions that have traditionally driven Atlantic historians.2 Katherine Johnston shows that it can.The Nature of Slavery uses a fine-grained analysis of eighteenth-century perceptions of climate, environmental change, and nature's relationship to human health to comment on several long-standing debates in Atlantic history regarding the politics of slavery and the origins of race. Johnston focuses on the British Greater Caribbean, a region encompassing the British islands in the West Indies together with the Carolina-Georgia Lowcountry. As Matthew Mulcahy lays out in Hubs of Empire (2014), the sites of the British Greater Caribbean shared history, socioeconomic factors, majority populations of enslaved Africans, and, crucially for Johnston's study, environmental factors such as climate and endemic diseases. During the early modern period, the real and perceived environmental hazards of the British Greater Caribbean gave rise to the belief that the plantation economy could only succeed with enslaved Africans as the primary labor force. The climate was too inhospitable for whites to successfully cultivate the land. Or, at least, that is what planters publicized.Johnston argues that enslavers in the British Greater Caribbean deliberately deployed the \"climatic defense of slavery\"—that \"Black bodies were suited to hot climates while white bodies were not\"—in direct contradiction to their own experiences and knowledge (3). There was at the time no understanding of climate, health, or environment that supported such a claim. Enslavers knew Africans were no more suited to the West Indies or South Carolina than Europeans were. They said so privately and at length. However, over time, white colonists recognized that the climatic justification of slavery was an effective, politically palatable narrative that gave the practice \"the unquestionable authority of nature\" (194). It was \"manufactured rhetoric,\" a Big Lie, a narrative constructed not because of planters' personal observations or the medical ideas of the time, but in spite of them (4).The premise of the book, then, is simple. Twenty-first-century readers know very well that people sometimes espouse beliefs with which they do not agree for political or financial gain, so it seems reasonable to suggest that enslavers looking to protect the source of their wealth would do the same. Yet the case that Johnston builds to prove her claim is remarkably complex. Over six chapters that span the mid-seventeenth century to the mid-nineteenth century, The Nature of Slavery tackles several pillars of enslavers' environmental excuses. It reminds us that white Europeans had a long history of successfully cultivating the lands of the Greater Caribbean, uncovers the economic or social grievances undergirding planters' public-facing climatic rhetoric, documents medical and environmental theories of the time, and breaks down planters' observations on the relative health of Black bodies versus white ones.Threaded throughout the first two chapters of the book is a confrontation with one of the enduring questions of Atlantic history: Why slavery, and why Africans? The labor force of the early Atlantic World was a decidedly mixed bag. Wage laborers, convicts, indentured servants, redemptioners, enslaved Indigenous peoples, and enslaved Africans were all present in emerging agro-capitalist colonial economies. By the eighteenth century, however, enslaved Africans made up the majority of the labor force, particularly in the Atlantic Plantation Complex, to borrow Philip Curtain's term. This shift, often abbreviated as \"the labor transition,\" happened at different times in different places, and historians have long debated the timing and reasons for it. Some historians emphasize the role of cultural factors in planters' pursuit of enslaved Africans, such as European perceptions of \"Blackness\" or a sense of cultural unity within Europe that created insider-outsider ideologies. Others highlight the legal status that made enslaved African labor more attractive to planters and the economic practicalities given the high cost of recruiting and keeping European labor.3Johnston seemingly has no problem with all of the above being true in the Greater Caribbean, although she mentions economic factors most often. She is more concerned with what was not responsible for the labor transition. The labor transition was not, Johnston asserts, due to colonial understandings of climate's effect on the body. It was not because planters believed Black bodies fared better in Caribbean or Lowcountry environments. After all, the region's planters went to great lengths to attract white European laborers even after the labor transition, which, for her, means they knew whites could survive. She then uses the history of early Georgia to prove that they could, focusing on the well-worn but still apt example of the Salzburger community's success. She also sifts through the private writings of planters during the decades when the Georgia Trustees prohibited African slavery. In an admirable example of what a close reading of primary sources can illuminate, Johnston uncovers the ulterior motives of the group called the Malcontents, who campaigned for the removal of the prohibition on African slavery, taking readers through the various arguments they used before landing on a climate-based justification. Petitions claiming Georgia was too hot for white labor acted as a useful \"smokescreen for other grievances\" and succeeded largely because the rhetoric tapped into preexisting rumors of the region circulating in the metropole (13).Certainly, Johnston's assertion that planters knew white bodies could labor in the Greater Caribbean runs up against the well-established English \"fear of hot climates,\" as introduced by Karen Kupperman in the early 1980s and taken up by several scholars since.4 The characterizations of the colonies disseminated in the metropole were that the tropical climate would injure English bodies, spread disease, and cause unwanted physiological changes. Events in the Caribbean conspired to confirm such suspicions, such as the disastrous Western Design military campaign of the 1650s. As a result of such damning reports of European experience in tropics, the only conclusion was that \"venturing to the islands was likely nothing short of a death sentence\" (27). Johnston does not refute others' work on early modern assumptions about tropical climates but rather points out that those who lived in the colonies had much more complex beliefs about \"hot climates\" than those who lived in London. Only headline-grabbing disasters in the Greater Caribbean made it back across the Atlantic, while private declarations of planters' good health or salubrious surroundings did not. Furthermore, the definition of \"healthy\" was deeply nuanced and hyperlocal. Johnston examines colonists' manipulation of their local environments, homes, and their debates over the location of towns and military barracks to demonstrate that colonists did not think the region was uniformly dangerous. Johnston writes, \"For settler-colonists who lived in these places, climatic nuance—a sense of microclimates dependent upon a region's elevation, proximity to stagnant or moving water, and air flow . . . was essential to determining which places were healthy or unhealthy\" (76). To say the region was feared for being \"too hot\" does not necessarily capture on-the-ground beliefs in the colonies themselves.This section of the book—chapter 3—is the only place where Johnston's work deals with material environmental conditions in a substantive way. Although some of her previous work more fully explored deforestation, drought, and planters' alterations to the physical landscape, The Nature of Slavery is concerned primarily with ideas about nature, disease, and heat rather than the land, infections, or climate itself.5 In this way, Johnston's work stands apart from much of the scholarship on the environmental history of American slavery, and especially US slavery, as it has developed so far. Given the title, I expected the book to resemble Mart Stewart's seminal \"What Nature Suffers to Groe\" (1996), a study of how white planters and the enslaved lived within nature on the Georgia coast. Stewart's work illuminates how the enslaved helped shape the natural landscape, and in turn, how the landscape left marks on their bodies, provided them with sustenance and a measure of independence, and dictated their daily tasks. Similarly, US slavery's first stand-alone environmental history, David Silkenat'sScars on the Land (2022), deals with how the enslaved transformed and experienced a variety of physical environments from forests and mines to farms and furnaces. Environmental histories of slavery in Latin America and the Caribbean also seem primarily concerned with tracking material environmental change.6 Less has been done on the historical climate of the US South or the Caribbean. Still, Sam White'sA Cold Welcome (2017) or Michael Chenoweth's study of Jamaica's eighteenth-century climate show the benefits of including such analysis.7 Johnston's focus on ideas of the environment, rather than the environment itself, thus helps diversify this body of scholarship. However, her approach—centered as it is on the words of white colonists—means she spends considerably less time foregrounding the voices, lives, and identities of actual enslaved people than some other works.This tendency to skirt discussions of the physical environment also affects Johnston's treatment of the material reality of disease in chapter 4, an examination of eighteenth-century notions of seasoning and race. Her evidence shows that medical observers saw no discernible difference between the mortality rates of Blacks versus whites in the Greater Caribbean, and colonists clearly recognized both groups were vulnerable to the same illnesses. Furthermore, planters would have believed that any newcomer to the Greater Caribbean was at risk of illness until they were seasoned. In eighteenth-century understandings of health and well-being, both white and Black bodies required a period of adjustment to the temperature, humidity, and other environmental features of any new location—even if only moving from one plantation to another on the same island. For eighteenth-century colonists, then, \"bodies were not fixed entities\" subject to the strict Black-white binary (119). Rather, \"all bodies were susceptible to the same environmental dangers\" (121). Because planters would have not seen illness as related to skin color, and because they would have blamed any fevers or illness on excessively wet weather, lack of seasoning, or even poor behavior on the part of the victim, and because she does not see any evidence that planters acted on any observations of differing rates of illness, Johnston seemingly dismisses historians' efforts to think about what effect malaria, yellow fever, yaws, and other infectious diseases had on the changing composition of Greater Caribbean populations.In fact, Johnston directly calls out scholars who adhere to what could be called the epidemiological explanation for the labor transition. Beginning with the work of Philip Curtin in the 1960s, some scholars interested in the intersection of Atlantic and environmental history have examined the differential impacts of the Americas' disease landscape on enslaved Africans and Europeans, positing that race-based slavery may have seemed more practical than European indentures in part because men and women forcibly brought from West Africa had genetic or acquired immunity to a number of diseases—most notably, malaria and yellow fever.8 The fact that enslaved Africans in the Caribbean perhaps contracted less virulent forms of or died at slightly lower rates from certain diseases had nothing to do with race but rather resulted from where they were born or their longer-term ancestry. However, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century observers might have seen varying mortality as racial, evidence that hot climates punished white bodies differently than Black ones. As Rana Hogarth discusses in Medicalizing Blackness (2017), there was a myth of innate Black immunity to yellow fever that endured long after it was proven untrue.9 Johnston, however, downplays the usefulness of historical epidemiology in understanding why planters would or did employ a manufactured climatic justification of slavery, calling it \"an anachronistic view of racialized health\" (194). She goes further in her discursive notes, writing that \"it does not do justice to historical actors to apply modern diagnoses to past illnesses\" (242n13).Admittedly, reconstructing past disease environments is tricky work. A historian has to understand epidemiology; have access to a range of textual, archaeological, and genetic evidence; and be able to wade through a past era's medical understanding (or lack thereof). Thus, it is far easier to retroactively diagnose a disease such as yellow fever that had unmistakable symptoms than, say, influenza, which could be confused with other illnesses. Furthermore, infections and what they do to bodies can change over time—just look at COVID-19's evolution over the last few years. However, if a disease has been stable over centuries, as some have been, and if historians have evidence that points to a clear set of symptoms, then scholars can use epidemiological history to provide a more richly textured picture of the past. Early modern medical practitioners may not have definitively diagnosed cases of malaria—as Johnston points out, it could have been confused with any number of \"fevers\"—but there is overwhelming evidence that a portion of enslaved people of West African descent carried the sickle cell gene that afforded some protection against malaria from Plasmodium falciparum. Once falciparum malaria was established in the Greater Caribbean, people of West African ancestry, on average, would have been less affected by that strain than others in the region.10 Johnston's argument about theories of seasoning being the primary lens through which planters and physicians viewed infection rates, rather than along lines of Black versus white, is an important point to make, and it should change how scholars talk about the construction of biological race during these crucial decades. But it is possible to accept that planters did not turn to enslaved Africans for epidemiological reasons without dismissing the material realities of the Greater Caribbean's disease environment.All of the ideas Johnston explored in the first four chapters come together in the fifth, which covers Parliament's investigation of and debates over the transatlantic slave trade. These debates acted as a catalyst for turning unfocused notions of seasoning, health, and the environment into a clear ideology that relied on bodily difference to justify Black enslavement in the Americas. In other words, while the role of climate in the debates themselves was relatively minor, the consolidation of a streamlined climatic narrative was essential evidence for developing ideas of biological race. Johnston writes, \"If each body only suited a particular climate, then those bodies must be different internally as well as externally\" (156). Again, she uses very fine-grained readings of public versus private testimony in these parliamentary debates to lay bare the contradictions of planters' arguments. On the one hand, planters had to maintain that Africans suited the West Indian environment, and whites did not. On the other, they had to explain why Africans were dying at such high rates that the slave trade needed to continue and why whites were still successfully cultivating land there. Of course, Caribbean planters were not the only entrants into late eighteenth-century considerations of climate and race. Anya Zilberstein'sA Temperate Empire (2016) elucidates similarly twisty logic happening around the same time in a more northerly British colony, Nova Scotia, as officials tried to convince Jamaican maroons and administrators in the metropole that Black bodies could, in fact, thrive in cold places.The solidification of rhetoric that linked climate to biological race explored in chapter 5 had effects that rippled outward through the nineteenth century. Johnston's sixth and final chapter moves out of the Caribbean, back to North America, tracking the climatic justification for racial slavery through major political events of US history from roughly 1790 to 1870. The notion that only Black bodies could labor in the heat was so widely accepted by this point that it became an \"axiom too difficult to dislodge\" (157). Its popularity also remade antebellum abolitionist rhetoric. In the previous chapter, Johnston showed how abolitionists made use of climatic assumptions to prove planters' brutality toward the enslaved. Here, Johnston discusses the role of climatic ideas in abolitionist arguments over colonization—the removal of African Americans from the United States to Africa so free Blacks could escape racism or reenslavement. Although most Black Americans denied the validity of climatic rhetoric, it was so widespread they had to engage with it. Frederick Douglass, for instance, asserted that the linkage of climate and race was a \"miserable pretence . . . for getting us out of this country\" (171). But antebellum colonization schemes were not the only resettlement projects proposed for free Blacks in the United States. As Ikuko Asaka writes in Tropical Freedom (2017), there were several attempts, from the American Revolution to Reconstruction, to displace free African Americans from so-called temperate zones to the tropics thanks to the climate determinism established in the eighteenth century. Johnston spends little time on this longer history of resettlement in the United States, although she does mention how perceived post–Civil War labor shortages caused planters to completely reverse their positions on the possibility of white labor in the South's climate. Instead, she concludes the chapter with a brief mention of environmental racism. Over the long term, she argues, tying Black bodies to hot climates not only shaped ideas about emancipation but also justified the deliberate placing of people of color in hazardous environments long before the term \"environmental racism\" was coined.In the end, The Nature of Slavery is an ambitious work, not only for its temporal or geographic scope but also for the number of historiographies in which it seeks to intervene. Sitting as it does at the intersection of Atlantic and environmental history, this book will certainly interest practitioners of both. In its drive to prove its basic premise, however, The Nature of Slavery sometimes misses opportunities to explore subjects it introduces and then drops, such as the place of Indigenous peoples in climatic justifications for enslavement or, for that matter, the idea of eighteenth-century environmental racism. Nevertheless, Johnston's core argument invites us all to reconsider the stories behind the archival or published sources we frequently use in our work. What other records are we looking at uncritically? What other Big Lies might we be repeating?",

    "abstract": "O'Gorman explains in the introduction to this book that she went into the archives interested in the politics of water allocation for rice farming and unexpectedly found that much of the documentation concerned the ducks that enjoyed these anthropogenic wetlands. This then led her to think about the ways in which human societies are enmeshed in complex ecosystems with other species, and to explore various case studies about these species. The use of the plural \"histories\" in the title is quite appropriate since the book is not a single narrative but a series of case studies of different areas far apart from one another.As a Canadian historian of China's wetlands with little knowledge of Australia, I approached this book curious about wet places and the comparative history of Anglo settler colonialism. I am presumably not the only one who knows little about Australia's environmental history, judging from the fact that this is the first work on Australia's environmental history published in either of the two most venerable environmental history book series (by Cambridge and Washington University Presses). The introduction is well designed to convince Australian readers of the importance of approaching the region's history from a multispecies perspective but does not provide ill-informed foreigners like myself with enough background information on Australian geography, history, or historiography. Nonetheless, O'Gorman keeps the focus on the big issues that outsiders can relate to. I found it clear and engaging throughout.The book begins with a chapter on the contemporary politics of weaving. Beginning with a discussion of how Aboriginal women living at the mouth of the river have long used wetland sedges to weave, the chapter moves on to a broader discussion of how women in other regions use weaving as a way of maintaining traditions and building bonds. Unsurprisingly, when officials decide how water is allocated, Aboriginals usually get the short end of the stick, and they are disadvantaged in other ways, such as being prohibited by law for using wetlands for profit (this reminded me of the politics of wild rice cultivation in North America). The connections between Aboriginal people and wetlands remains a theme throughout the book, as does the importance of including them in discussions about wetland management.Chapter 2 focuses on the history of the town of Toowomba, built in the swamps in the upper reaches of the Darling River basin, from the arrival of European colonists in the mid-nineteenth century until the 1930s. The town dealt with flooding, pollution, and mosquitos, and O'Gorman does a good job of situating this history in the broader context of ideas of social regulation and disease in that period. These ideas return in the subsequent chapter, on the concern over malaria in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area during the First and Second World Wars and the anti-mosquito campaigns.The following three chapters focus on birds, and I found them the most enjoyable of the book. While birds in much of the Northern Hemisphere tend to migrate seasonally, the limiting feature of the Australian climate for many birds is not seasonal change but unpredictable longer-term climatic fluctuations, which force them to move where conditions are good at any given time without any fixed pattern. Chapter 4 explores how birds adapted to human modification of wetlands, such as irrigating large areas to grow rice, in the same Murrumbidgee region. The diversion of increasing amounts of water to rice paddies over the course of the twentieth century unsurprisingly attracted many ducks, and this chapter provides a fascinating account of the scientists that researched them, farmers who accused them of eating crops, and the growth of environmental protection in Australia.Chapter 5 explores the history of pelicans at the mouth of the river. European colonists initially slaughtered them as rivals for fish, but they then became a focus for conservation. The next chapter turns to the government itself, showing how international agreements on migratory birds became a key tool of the federal government for protecting wetlands. It is a good study of what types of cultural and administrative factors affect which ecosystems are and are not protected.Like the first chapter, the final one is mostly situated in the present, but it contains an insightful discussion of the uses to which history is put in conservation debates. A large increase in the number of protected seals in the river's estuary has reduced the ability of people to live by fishing there, and the chapter does a good job of considering how workers in an extractive industry (fishing) think about many of the issues discussed in the book. The conclusion correctly emphasizes that the types of histories discussed in the book provide important insights into how Australia's wetlands as they become even more unpredictable as the climate changes.This brief summary does not do justice to the many topics addressed in the book or its many insights, and I would encourage anyone interested in similar issues in other parts of the world—especially Anglo settler colonies—to read it. Despite vast differences of ecology, these regions were all settled as part of the same historical process, and anyone who studies any of them should be aware of what aspects of these processes are shared across space, and which are unique to specific places.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the nineteenth century many European scientists shared the view that a nation could compete successfully if only it improved its landscape via new infrastructures, such as large reclamation and river regulation projects, and via the intensive use of natural resources—for example, the scientifically planned use of forests. This “high” modernization path orchestrated by the political and scientific elites of Hungary sought to consolidate control over resources, landscapes, and competing ethnic groups and was in many respects similar to the many other versions of high modernism in Europe at the time. This version, however, represented a particular vision closely linked to the ecological systems of the Middle Danube area. Although questions of the political, economic, and technological “rise” of Hungary have attracted scholarly attention for centuries, historians have not fully explored the ecological consequences of modernization. Three of these consequences—deforestation, desertification, and flooding—are the subjects of this article. More broadly, the article aims to show how the political and economic goals of nationalism produced a science of ecological domination.",

    "abstract": "If a history of an animal disease campaign does not conjure images of assassinations, lynchings, torture, peasant riots, parachuting ice, cowboys drinking cattle vaccines at gunpoint, and archival incinerations, Thomas Rath's history of the Mexico–United States Commission for the Prevention of Foot and Mouth Disease (CMAEFA) is here to correct the record. Between 1947 and 1954, CMAEFA inspected more animals than any other animal disease campaign in history, boasted a budget greater than that of the early Marshall Plan, encountered hundreds of incidents of civil disobedience, and produced the most detailed maps of Mexico to date. The end result, according to Rath and the governments that led the effort, was a campaign \"unequalled in the annals of animal-disease eradication,\" shaping Mexican modernization efforts and the Cold War creation of international animal disease networks (3).Stressing the impossibility of distilling a linear narrative of the campaign to address the \"crisis\" created by foot-and-mouth-disease, or aftosa, in Mexico during the postwar period, Rath instead foregrounds a multiplicity of perspectives over six chapters, based largely on US records of the commission that Rath claims has remained untouched other than by US Department of Agriculture researchers. After a brief history of the role of livestock in Mexican state formation through the postrevolutionary period in chapter 1, Rath turns to the \"high politics\" of the commission, examining the political choices and negotiations between the United States and Mexican governments that guided the commission's early direction. While initially driven by the US government's preference for slaughter, the commission was met with fierce opposition on the ground. Chapter 3 examines the full breadth of this resistance, and it is here that Rath's archival work shines. Compiling a database of over 450 incidents of civil disobedience, Rath details a cross-class, if largely uncoordinated, rural mobilization that successfully catalyzed a reversal in policy toward vaccination. This concession was one of many that the commission made in response to the extensive opposition, the subject of chapter 4. Rath makes clear that just as critical to the commission's \"success\" were its selective use of violence and terror, new information networks, and secrecy and bribes to a wide variety of Mexican interest groups, which ultimately resulted in the commission's \"success.\"With aftosa largely eradicated, the book's final chapters examine the outbreak's lasting consequences. Chapter 5 turns to the domestic, showing how the absence of aftosa and the creation of new livestock institutions catalyzed an expansion and modernization of Mexico's livestock industry. Historians of Mexico, in particular, will benefit from Rath's engagement with the implications of CMAEFA for the country's postrevolutionary political history, in which he suggests that the Institutional Revolutionary Party's ability to hold onto power was the result of its blending of democratic and authoritarian rule. In chapter 6, Rath locates CMAEFA as a launchpad of US-led efforts to create international Cold War animal disease networks, but one that he argues must be understood as shaped significantly by Mexican political ambitions and knowledge as well as the resistance of Mexican peasants, rather than simply a top-down Washington creation.Rath's work is situated within a growing body of literature on how the governance of animal life, and particularly disease control, has shaped state formation and livestock modernization efforts in the twentieth century. By detailing the day-to-day complexities of one of the twentieth century's most influential, though forgotten, animal disease campaigns, Rath's is a critical contribution in moving us beyond linear and top-down accounts of these campaigns. While Rath's emphasis on the complexity and often paradoxical nature of CMAEFA often leaves open the question of how readers should understand this history beyond his stated \"simple central argument\" that Mexico's \"aftosa crisis was just that, a crisis,\" he suggests in the afterword that its strange veneer might be the result of a collective historical failure to grapple with the ostensibly contradictory roles that livestock themselves inhabit in the story (4). The point is well taken, though Rath does little to draw out these paradoxes in the book's central chapters, particularly as they relate to the wavering of who the central object of governance in the campaign might have been: Mexican human or animal life.But in stressing the everyday resistance and mechanics as the campaign played out on the ground, Rath's history makes for one of the most compelling and important accounts of a modern animal disease campaign. Historians of twentieth-century agriculture, animals, Mexico, and the United States will benefit immensely from grappling with how the midcentury dreams of scientific progress and modernization were ultimately dependent on the messiness at the heart of disease control campaigns like CMAEFA.",

    "abstract": "In Running Out, anthropologist Lucas Bessire chronicles the culture of depletion. The book results from a personal quest to reconnect to his ancestral roots, explore his grandmother's unfinished research on the now-dry Cimarron River in Southwest Kansas, and explain a mentality that has put this corner of the plains on a course for extinction. In this portrayal of contemporary society and the lack of communal thinking in favor of individual gain, readers will find unfortunate continuities with the findings of key works on the region's history. The book is an important accounting of modern resource exploitation that scholars have established as a key legacy of white settlement on the Great Plains.The book consists of four parts. \"Lines\" looks backward to the establishment of large-scale irrigated agriculture on the High Plains. Bessire's great-grandfather was responsible for breaking thirty-eight square miles of prairie and for drilling some of the first wells into the Ogallala Aquifer. Later, debts in the operation led the family to sell off land to the region's first hog farms, introducing new, huge demands for water. Reckoning with personal and familial complicity in the destruction of the aquifer and the society it undergirds is a central problem for the author. Bessire shares his research process with his father, whose connections grant access to key players in the community and insights on the rationale of depletion.In \"Bones,\" Bessire compares mining the aquifer to past eras of destruction in the West, such as the 1872–73 bison hunts. Now, the primary agents of destruction are the huge livestock businesses of Southwest Kansas. Local farmers pump millions of acre-feet of water per year (three times more water than needed to sustain New York City in a single year) to produce corn and alfalfa for the feedlots and dairies. These farmers share the blame for running the aquifer dry, as do bankers who have urged farmers to plant the most profitable crops even if they demand too much water. Then there is the federal government, which through crop insurance programs has protected the farmers from loss and encouraged farmers to gamble on ever bigger crops requiring even more water. But the author finds most culpable the absentee corporate landowners and the boards of the groundwater management districts they control. In this conclusion, Bessire echoes a long-standing argument that since the Great Plow-Up during World War I, nonlocals have spearheaded the destruction of the plains (e.g., Donald Worster's Dust Bowl [1979]).The connections between the Dust Bowl era and the present probability of running dry are evident. In \"Dust,\" Bessire observes storms of blowing soil reminiscent of the Dirty Thirties. The mentality of the farmers, that \"all it needs is water and it will produce better than any land in the world,\" meant that when farmers saw the potential for pumping the aquifer, they abandoned nascent conservation techniques introduced during the drought years (88). Indeed, the groundwater management district believes it is \"economically irresponsible\" to proactively switch to dryland farming, and it instead looks for salvation in quixotic schemes for building aqueducts or canals (109). Local farmers do not escape criticism for the short-sighted economic decisions driving their thirsty swigs at the well.The final section of the book, \"Clouds,\" is so named to symbolize the evaporated water lost from irrigation. It should be noted that clouds can also continue the water cycle with precipitation, and possibly refers to options that might slow losses, if not recharge the aquifer. New irrigation technology can create greater efficiencies, and communities could engage in collective conservation. Unfortunately, most of the region's water users have exhibited an individualistic mindset and tend to lash out at anyone challenging the ideology of depletion. They manipulate the law, government programs, and the boards of the groundwater management districts to take as much as they can, while they can. Those who stand to lose the most from running out of water, the poor and minority groups who make up the labor force in the area, have no voice in the management of the water. Control remains in the hands of the wealthy, white elite, whose capitalistic inertia bowls over all voices of caution.The personal stakes the author brings to his narrative make Running Dry compelling, and the photographs incorporated through the pages show a through line of resource grabbing by the conqueror-settlers of the West. Those of us descended from this culture, and especially those still living its legacies on the plains, should indeed reckon with this dire problem and the mentality shifts necessary to embrace possible solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the role of the stingless bee Melipona beecheii in beekeeping practices in the Yucatán Peninsula, México, in the nineteenth century. Native to Yucatán, the Melipona bee is capable of producing large amounts of honey and has been bred by Maya communities for over three thousand years. In the twentieth century, the Melipona population declined with the implementation of modern apiculture, a system designed to maximize the production of honey and wax with the European native honeybee, Apis mellifera. Previous scholarship on beekeeping has labeled the development of modern apiculture and the systematic expansion of the European honeybee across the Americas as a success story. However, these studies do not consider the cultural, economic, and social transformations brought by the introduction of Apis mellifera in environments that were already rich in bee biodiversity. In order to provide some clues about the impact of—and responses to—modern apiculture, this article focuses on the moment before this process occurred in the Yucatán Peninsula, when Melipona was still environmentally, culturally, and economically significant. The author argues that, far from being an unchanging cultural practice doomed to be superseded by modern apiculture, Melipona beekeeping continued to adapt in sophisticated ways to a modernizing world. During a period of upheaval, extraction of natural resources, environmental exploitation, violence, and Indigenous peoples’ defense of their land, the Melipona continued to be the only domesticated bee species used for beeswax and honey extraction in the entire peninsula during the nineteenth century.",

    "abstract": "In the twenty-first century, California's agricultural opportunities attract both agribusiness corporations and farmworkers, yet the lives of these two populations, as Dvera Saxton shows, are polar opposites. The Devil's Fruit uncovers the challenging medical, social, political, and economic inequalities that im/migrant (as the author designates them) farmworkers in California face. This work is the result of Saxton's multiyear field research, undertaken among im/migrant workers in monocultural farms in California's Pájaro and Salinas Valleys during the 2010s. Unlike many academic books, Saxton's stands out with its combination of theory and narrative and experiments with what she calls \"activist anthropology\" (5). Written in an engagingly journalistic way and excelling in its research goal, this book will help researchers and students to both understand the harm of modern agribusiness and reflect on the social responsibilities of anthropology and other disciplines.The book contains five chapters in addition to an introduction and conclusion. Chapter 1 debunks stereotypes of im/migrant farmworkers, especially those from Mexico, and the unjust labor conditions under which they work. Chapter 2, an examination of the monocultural strawberry industry in modern California, reveals that underneath strawberries' beautiful packaging is a range of physical harms to both workers and the environment. Chapter 3 explores the medical harm from toxic pesticides. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss methods to actively support im/migrant communities.During her research, Saxton lived beside im/migrant farmworkers and discovered the layered challenges—including resource shortages, lack of legal support, and exposure to toxic substances—directly from the workers' perspectives. Her work combines investigative journalism, oral history, and activist research, in which she assists the im/migrant farmworkers to seek medical or legal help. This methodology shortens the gap between academia and everyday life. Saxton uses narrations of farmworkers' lives to underscore the lived experience of social injustice.Saxton also records her own thoughts and emotions when aiding farmworkers. When accompanying workers to meet with lobbyists or representatives from agribusiness companies, she describes the emotions of both the workers and herself—rage, frustration, self-doubt, or feelings of helplessness toward corporate power—a dimension harder to find in sources such as official reports.Saxton positions her activist anthropology within conceptual frameworks based on existing anthropological research. For instance, Saxton uses Peter Benson and Stuart Kirsch's term \"harm industry\" to describe the inherent destructiveness certain capitalistic pursuits. She then cites research that has a humanistic and activist approach similar to hers, including Emma Louse Backe's claim that solidarity and sensibility might be more valuable in activist research than objectivity. The book includes a comprehensive thirty-two-page bibliography that is highly valuable to fellow researchers and students.The final two chapters are dedicated to exploring two specific methods of activist scholarship: accompaniment and ecosocial solidarity. The former describes long-term support through being present for the workers, and the latter refers to the establishment of a tight community. Saxton enriches her research by studying multiple actors in this harm industry, such as medical professionals, lawmakers, local schools, and nongovernmental organizations.Critics of Saxton's method might point out that the lack of objectivity could damage activist anthropology's credibility. This critique is not entirely off point. Saxton admits that her humanistic and holistic approach could have issues like scholars \"get[ting] caught in intense political and disciplinary debates,\" feeling \"emotionally overwhelmed,\" or having different social, racial, or economic backgrounds from the community they study (177). Saxton argues, however, that if scholars are more willing to engage and be vigilant, academic work could become \"more human and humane\" (171).The Devil's Fruit is an important read for activists, scholars, and public historians to grapple with twenty-first-century agribusiness's destructiveness in California and the United States at large. Saxton's argument regarding activist anthropology research is likely to provoke useful conversations among researchers and students.",

    "abstract": "In Cattle Beet Capital, Michael Weeks presents a fascinating account of the development of industrial agriculture on the Colorado Piedmont during the twentieth century. The book highlights how farmers on the Piedmont transitioned from cooperative agriculture in the 1870s to corporate sugar beet cultivation in the early 1900s to large-scale commercial cattle feeding in the latter half of the twentieth century. Along the way Weeks, a skilled environmental and agricultural historian, shows how the sustainable agroecology of sugar beets and small livestock operations gave way to \"mechanical, biological, and petrochemical technologies\" that sustained the huge commercial cattle feedlots. These technologies exploited and altered the environment (11).Weeks's book is divided into seven chapters. The first two chapters detail farming in the Piedmont from 1870 to 1930. In the early years of settlement, farmers established open-range cattle ranching that benefited from the shortgrass prairie in the area. They also developed irrigation systems for agriculture. By the turn of the century, farmers began cultivating sugar beets for the Great Western Sugar Company, yet they largely did so with methods that provided a sustainable agroecology in the region. Even so, sugar beet growing had a cost, especially on migrant workers, a topic Weeks examines in chapter 3. Since the US Department of Agriculture and Colorado Agricultural College played a key role in developing farming techniques and technology that impacted the Piedmont, Weeks discusses the growth of what he calls the \"agri-state\" in chapters 4 and 5. He ultimately concludes that the agri-state failed both farmers and the environment as it placed industry needs above research assessing the effects of new technologies, pesticides, and biocides on humans, crops, cattle, and the land. The final chapters chronicle the establishment and explosion of the commercial cattle feeding industry in the Colorado Piedmont, including the exploitative consequences it had for cattle and the environment and the destruction it wielded on smaller livestock raisers, all in the name of increased profits for owners of the large operations. The larger narrative of agriculture in the Piedmont is both unique—because of its transformation from beets to commercial cattle feeding—and common, in terms of the dominance of industrial agriculture by the end of the twentieth century.Cattle Beet Capital makes a significant contribution to the fields of both agricultural and environmental history. By showing the effects the transition from small-scale farming and cattle ranching to large-scale sugar beet cultivation and commercial cattle feeding had on human, natural, and animal environments, Weeks expertly demonstrates industrial agriculture's detrimental impacts. His work is steeped in the historiography of cattle ranching and the sugar beet industry, and it contributes greatly to these fields by focusing on the Colorado Piedmont, a place that historians have largely neglected, and by showing the weaknesses of both capitalism and the agri-state—weaknesses that enabled the growth of an industry focused more on money than on life in all its forms. Yet Weeks does so in a way that does not vilify or villainize one group or another—the story merely saddens, but in a thought-provoking way.The numerous strengths of the book make it a compelling read. However, in a few places, Weeks could have provided a little more explanation. For example, though sugar beet cultivation is a prominent part of the first half of the book, it largely disappears thereafter. Admittedly, this is because the growth of commercial cattle feeding led to corn replacing sugar beets as a crop in the Colorado Piedmont, but it leaves the reader wondering what happened to the beet sugar industry. Did it just end, or did farmers continue to grow beets? If so, on what scale? Are sugar beets still grown today in the region? Similarly, the impacts on humans of the chemicals, pesticides, and herbicides used on cattle seems underexplored. These, however, are minor criticisms and do not detract from the overall excellence of the book.I highly recommend Cattle Beet Capital for anyone interested in the beet sugar industry, the commercial cattle feeding industry, or the impact that agriculture has on the environment.",

    "abstract": "As I write this review in late 2022, the World Food Programme warns on its home page that 345 million people in eighty-two countries \"are facing acute food insecurity\" (https://www.wfp.org/emergencies/global-food-crisis). Averting catastrophe, the organization insists, requires rising \"to the challenge of meeting people's immediate food needs, while at the same time supporting programmes that build long-term resilience.\" The crisis has multiple origins—COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine come the most readily to mind—but there are deeper systemic problems that long predate the current emergencies. These are the problems that food sovereignty activists have been fighting for decades to solve. It has not been an easy struggle, but change, as Matthew Canfield's book, Translating Food Sovereignty, makes clear, has happened in the recent past and is happening in the present as activists claiming food sovereignty are \"actively transforming regulation to reflect their vision of decentralized, diverse, and democratic systems of food governance\" (25). They are doing it by turning the structures of transnational governance—widely bemoaned for the power they have diverted to corporations—to their benefit.Translating Food Sovereignty is an examination of the origins and the actions of this transformation with a focus on the Puget Sound region of Washington State, the center of food sovereignty activity in the United States. Canfield—an anthropologist—embedded himself with those activists for years, volunteering with them, interviewing them, and observing them. He also went above the regional level, participating in international conferences and online forums. This participation, he argues, allowed him to see something that other scholars had missed: that food sovereignty activists are using what he has dubbed social practices of translation to create new kinds of transnational governance. They are, Canfield writes, \"producing political constituencies and relations, undermining the forms of value supposed by global value chains, opposing the dominant forms of agricultural knowledge that have historically constituted private property and liberal sovereignty, and ultimately reimagining global governance by centering the voices of those most marginalized\" (25).Canfield asserts that food sovereignty activists were particularly prepared for this work because of their roots in agroecology, which demands decentralization, sustainability, and equitability. Activists recognized that they could through translation—a term Canfield uses to describe the practice of sharing/communicating meaning and values along transnational networks—build shared networks of governance that could challenge and even replace the global value chains dominated by corporations, who had themselves challenged and replaced states as the ultimate wielders of power. The point, Canfield insists, is that activists have recognized and have begun to take advantage of the opportunities that transnational governance created. As one example, he examines the fight over the Super Banana, a Gates Foundation program to use a genetically modified banana to fight vitamin A deficiency in Uganda. Concerned on several levels about the bananas, Ugandan activists used food sovereignty networks to push back in different locations around the world, arguing instead for solutions based on \"working with nature rather than against it\" and listening to local farmers instead of silencing them with \"innovations\" (149). In another example, Canfield shows how farmworkers in Washington State unionized as Familias Unidas por la Justicia and forged networks with other food sovereignty activists and with small-scale producers to force changes that ultimately encompassed not just their own labor conditions but also value chain governance. These are two of several examples that Canfield uses to support his point that food sovereignty activists have used and are continuing to use structures built by neoliberalism to undermine it. It is a compelling argument, and Canfield is careful throughout the book to detail how his work is in conversation with multiple scholars of activism.For Canfield, the most important point of the work that the activists are doing is that it has the potential to change more than food. They have, through their work over the past two decades, \"produced a new grammar of justice claims that directly confront the neoliberal mutations of transnational law and governance\" (194). Critically, this is not a call to return to the past but, instead, a call to build a new kind of regulatory order: one that, among other things, brings marginalized groups into the decision-making process and prioritizes sustainability. Activists' \"practices of translation,\" Canfield concludes, \"offer the most powerful democratic antidote to the social, economic, and ecological unsustainability of neoliberal capitalism\" (196). The cure begins with food, but it will not end there.",

    "abstract": "By 2022, descriptions of COVID creative projects were a familiar topic in media articles and interviews. Thus, Marion Nestle's introduction to Slow Cooked, explaining that the book was just such a pandemic distraction, might lead some to underestimate the book before them. Slow Cooked belies such an expectation. It is a memoir that is both self-reflective as well as insightful about issues far beyond the personal life of its author.Academics do not often write memoirs. Traditionally, we are trained to eschew the first-person voice and to strive for objectivity about our topics. Nestle, though, is not traditional. She has had an academic career in medical education and then in food studies—an interdisciplinary field that she helped create. In her transition from one field to another, she worked for the federal government, editing a compendium of nutritional science and health. Outside of government and academic circles, Nestle has also enjoyed a unique position as a trusted nutrition authority widely quoted in mainstream press articles, as well as an activist and influential voice in the disparate new food movements. She has certainly fulfilled her goal to be \"a critical analyst of the food industry\" (4).Slow Cooked follows a straightforward, chronological organization, but Nestle reveals much of herself in the descriptive chapters, including the passion that has animated her circuitous career. At the start of the book, we learn that Nestle was a Depression-era red diaper baby, born to first-generation Jewish Americans with a problematic marriage. Nestle indicates how this upbringing shaped her self-opinion and then how social conventions in the 1950s shaped her early professional path. Nestle followed the path of white, middle-class women to marry, have children, and support the careers of their husbands. The seeds of Nestle's future career are found here, first in her determination to carve out a new path far from a childhood that was \"bleak\" despite its \"moments of pleasure\" often connected to food, and second, as she watched her severely obese father die from a heart attack at the age of forty-seven (20). The next four chapters describe Nestle's halting steps in her first jobs, her negotiation of the sexist assumptions made about her, and her naivete about the politics of academia and government. She reveals her own vulnerabilities as well as her growing education about the ways of the world through a series of \"epiphanies.\"The first five chapters of this twelve-chapter book read as a prelude to act 2 of Nestle's life—as she titles chapter 6, \"Finally, NYU.\" Nestle arrived at New York University in 1988 as chair of the Department of Home Economics and Nutrition. She set to work remaking the department, strengthening its offerings and reputation, and within eight years it had degree programs in the new field of food studies. In addition to her work within NYU, we read about Nestle's books and her growing public reputation outside of academia. Nestle's passion for the field—on display throughout—made her open to experimentation, such as the department decision to teach about food systems with the help of a garden cultivated in the midst of the urban campus. Beyond passion, Nestle was indefatigable and sure of her ability to tackle new challenges, even after she formally retired from NYU in 2017. While Nestle's confidence in her work is clear, she also lets the reader see moments of vulnerability and self-doubt, such as her seeking advice from therapist friends. Similarly, Nestle forthrightly gives details about her miscommunication with department members that led to her stepping down as chair in 2003.Throughout the second half of the book, Nestle provides details about each book she has written, her writing process, her goals, and the reception of each. Her section on the 2018 trade book Unsavory Truth: How the Food Industry Skews the Science of What We Eat is brief but especially interesting. Nestle observes that the book did poorly commercially and was ignored by nutrition researchers and academics whose conflicts of interests it dissects. Unsavory Truth demonstrates Nestle as a truth teller (\"a critical analyst of the food industry\") willing to turn her lens on colleagues as well as profit-driven corporations. The book also expresses the idealism that has lasted throughout Nestle's career.Whether or not you are already familiar with Nestle and her other work or have only heard vague comments about her books, Slow Cooked offers a rich portrait of a public intellectual as well as insights into the food systems that impact us all.",

    "abstract": "Jonathan Saha's Colonizing Animals weaves animals into many of the key events in the modern history of Myanmar (formerly Burma), including British colonization (1824–1948) and Japanese occupation (1942–45). Colonial Myanmar, often overlooked in histories of the British Empire, is shown to be a context in which \"myriad\" nonhuman animals participated in the \"making and maintenance\" of the empire (184). Pushing beyond the single-species focus of much animal history, Saha demonstrates how the plethora of elephants, crocodiles, monkeys, dogs, and other animals clash and collide with humans throughout the text's six chapters.While many cultural histories have long embraced a multispecies approach, Saha deploys an interspecies approach to encompass the interconnections between the colonizers, the colonized, and the nonhuman animals. As a result, Colonizing Animals moves away from the typical prioritization of the animal-centered approach within the field, building instead a case for a greater understanding of history as an interspecies process. Throughout the introduction, Saha proposes that due to the overwhelming focus of animal historians on Europe and North America, new theoretical frameworks are needed in order to understand interspecies relationships in more-than-European contexts. In a meticulous and detailed discussion of historiography, Saha argues that concepts of humanism within animal studies are ruptured and fragmented in the colonial context, where the animal was dehumanized alongside colonized peoples. While postcolonial theory has addressed this marginalization and sought to recover the agency of the subaltern, the framework of the interspecies empire proposes to unify theoretical approaches.Drawing upon environmental, social, posthumanist, and postcolonial theory, Saha demonstrates how both humans and animals were commoditized and marginalized, while ultimately playing a key role in both sustaining and threatening the interspecies process of empire. The significance of interspecies relations as commodities is most potently demonstrated during the opening chapters, in which working elephants and their Burmese oozie riders are shown to be crucial undead capital in the functions of empire. Oxen, too, were living commodities, \"vital resources\" in the economic operations of the imperial state and the migrant Indian workers who reared them, themselves products of the empire (81). In both instances, control over the labor of animals was interconnected with governance over the colonized.In the third chapter, Saha shows how governance over big game mammals and venomous reptiles branded as vermin was an important symbol of authority for the imperial rulers. These species were not solely perceived to be a threat to the British colonizers, well known for their anxiety about and physical and mental aversion to tropical environments. The value of a dead crocodile was also connected to its threat to plow cattle, an agent of empire. The endangered rhinoceros, by contrast, became in imperial eyes a symbol of Burmese neglect and lack of value in wildlife, in spite of the clear correlation between British imperial hunting and the near extinction of the species.Saha further demonstrates how racial divisions were tied to interspecies relations in the fourth chapter, in which British affection toward pets was contrasted with perceptions of unnatural relations between animals and colonized humans. Oozie elephant riders were dehumanized, yet their \"domestication\" by the empire rendered them \"good animals.\" Inversely, human-snake relationships were a cause of great alarm, with snake charming a trope of racial and speciesist discourses in Orientalist literature. In the fifth chapter, the text turns toward the role of animals in Burmese nationalism, looking at how animal welfare was connected to the revival of Buddhist thought. This is followed by an exploration of primatology as an anti-colonial discourse as well as negative connections between animals and nationalist leaders. Finally, the sixth chapter discusses the role of animals as symbols of colonial authority, during key events such as the Hsaya San rebellion of 1930–32 and the collapse of imperial control during World War II, particularly with efforts to control nonhuman escapees from Rangoon Zoo.Pioneering studies have provided significant ventures into the environmental, material, and cultural histories of non-European contexts. Colonizing Animals adds to this field while calling for greater engagement with interspecies dynamics. When read in conjunction with posthumanist and postcolonial theory, Saha's work offers an important insight for scholars and students, pushing future proponents to embrace multispecies approaches. Moreover, his work challenges histories of colonialism globally to recognize the significant engagements and entanglements of colonizers and the colonized, both human and nonhuman.",

    "abstract": "The editors of Fragrant Frontier have produced an impressively researched book on the contemporary growers, in northern Vietnam and Southwest China, of three spices—star anise, black cardamom, and cinnamon, each of which has local, regional, and international economic importance—as well as the human links in the global commodity chain of these spices. This volume is much more coherent than many edited volumes, and readers should not skip any of it, as there are nice little surprises waiting here and there in the text.A good example is the \"Preface and Acknowledgements\" section, as this not only provides interesting information on how the volume came into being but also links to websites and scannable QR codes for \"story maps\" on the three spices and the places mentioned in the rest of the volume. This is a nice touch that gives this volume about the recent situation of farmers, local traders, marketplace workers, street vendors (of both the spices and foods prepared with them), wholesalers, exporters, and state officials a very contemporary feel. These story maps are only the first of an extensive number of relevant, well-done, and well-used illustrations including photographs, maps, and tables inserted throughout the following chapters.The rest of the volume is divided into an introduction followed by three chapters concentrating on Indigenous minority producers of each spice in northern Vietnam, two chapters on southwest China, a chapter that concentrates on marketing—from hyperlocal traders to international exoticizers—of Vietnamese spices, and finally a chapter reflecting on the situation as a whole and an afterword on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.The introductory chapter by the editors does a solid job of introducing the contemporary situation in the area under study, the conceptual framework used to follow the trail of these spices from the experiences of upland frontier farmers through a truly diverse array of actors in the international commodity chains for each spice, and the authors' research methodology: mostly interviews and archival and web-based research. However, one of my few quibbles about this book is that the subject of spices and their production and trade has a recorded history of nearly two millennia. The introduction would have been the perfect place for a bit more of this deep history, including insights from classics in the field such as Edward H. Schafer's The Vermillion Bird: T'ang Images of the South (1967) and Wang Gungwu's The Nanhai Trade: A Study of the Early History of Chinese Trade in the South China Sea (1958). This would have provided readers of this volume with more historical context for the chapters that follow.These chapters start, in a geographic sense, in northern Vietnam with a chapter by Turner and Derks on the production of star anise and its movement through local and regional commodity chains. As found throughout the book, there is a concise overview of the various uses of the commodity discussed. In the case of star anise, this includes an examination of its role as \"a key component in the industrial production of the anti-influenza pharmaceutical Tamiflu\" (43).This is an excellent example of the diverse uses of all of the products discussed in the book, from traditional medicinal and culinary uses to more modern reinventions. The case of star anise itself—and the boom in its demand for the production of Tamiflu, followed by a bust when the pharmaceutical giant Roche, holders of the patent for Tamiflu, began making the active ingredient from star anise synthetically—is also an excellent example of what often happens to the Indigenous peoples who provide such ancient commodities to the modern world.In turn, this story is a good prelude to the following chapter on cardamom, by Patrick Slack, and the concerns of its cultivators amid myriad state programs designed to affect, in one way or another, what they do and how they do it. One of the stated objectives of this volume is to foreground the experiences of the Indigenous farmers who provide these spices to national, regional, and international markets, and this chapter, along with chapters 4, 6, and 7, makes it clear that commodity-based rural development projects are, about as often as not, a human-made disaster for the peoples they target.A segue to another subject dear to the hearts of all of those who would like to do \"good\" with their food choices is chapter 4, on cinnamon from northern Vietnam, by Derks, Turner, and Ngô Thúy Hạnh. I have long leaned toward cynicism about such labels as \"organic\" and \"fair trade\" or about products listed as being from a specific location in the global South. This chapter, along with chapter 7 by Michelle Kee and Celia Zuberec, put me over the line into being a full-fledged cynic. That being said, I learned a lot from the chapters mentioned, and from others in this book, about the various actors in international commodity chains and about \"value creation tactics\" (2).Chapter 5, by Jean-François Rousseau and Xu Yiqiang, moves into China and focuses on cardamom and extreme weather events, showing the chaos inflicted on upland producers of cardamom and the commodity chains dependent on them when weather events such as extreme cold spells hit. All agricultural production is, of course, affected by weather. However, this chapter and the following chapter make it abundantly clear how fragile the livelihoods of agricultural workers are in the twenty-first century. These two chapters, both concentrating on southwestern China, also demonstrate just how much social issues such as ethnic inequality play into natural disasters and create human-made exacerbating factors. Chapter 6, by Jennifer C. Langill and Zuo Zhenting, is particularly blunt regarding what it refers to as \"busted promises\" and the \"environmental, economic, and political vulnerabilities\" of cultivating spices (160).The authors of the chapters in this book deal with their subjects—botanical, ecological, and human—in incredible detail. This is one of the strengths of the book, but it is also a weakness in that the chapters can become a bit repetitive. However, for those readers with a serious interest in the peoples of northern Vietnam and Southwest China, and in the production and trade of spices, these repeated details build a very well-rounded picture of the current situation. Every chapter contains information from an impressive number of firsthand interviews. These interviews are also impressive in terms of the number of languages used and the effort on the part of the scholars involved to include members of a number of highly diverse ethnic groups. This volume should find a welcome place on the bookshelves of scholars of the region, of the spice trade, and of issues raised such as governmental and international programs aimed at the producers and sellers of specialty crops.",

    "abstract": "Inquiétude dans les champs explores the outlook on agriculture of the peasants in charge of medium and large farms in northern France and in what is today francophone Belgium and Switzerland during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Fulgence Delleaux's evidence consists of the peasants' farm-management records of receipts, expenses, and dealings with multiple people. These writings offer an alternative to the viewpoint found in the texts of notaries, administrators, judges, and clerics, which are the documents typically used by historians.Analyzing the peasants' writings, Delleaux finds that their outlook differed from \"the one of the homo œconomicus\" (79). The first concern was for their households and communities. Members of rural society had a sense of dignity from which they evaluated, and decided whether to esteem, one another. Lenders, to maintain their dignity in the eyes of the community, did not expect the return of all, or even most, of what they granted. They accrued moral resources, which they knew might prove useful one day in their time of need.The concern of peasants—who were in charge of substantial farms and hence surpluses—about their reputation in the community dissuaded them from speculating on grain markets. Poor members of the community did not believe grain should be considered a commodity and source of profit. They saw it as the food needed to survive. This concern for reputation also led the peasant farm managers to hire laborers only from the community rather than on an open market, and to retain laborers on the farm when a solely economic interest would have led to layoffs. The peasants had to think about the laborers' standing in the village and the negative impression their departure would leave.Delleaux shows that the second concern shaping the peasant outlook was fear and prudence. The fear of lacking bread grains or farm animals due to severe weather or disease reinforced religious attitudes, which, in turn, strengthened community bonds. Peasants worked the fields in anguish about the possibility of inadequate or lost harvests. If they stocked grain, it was to preserve revenue, not to augment it. Jean-François Lucy (1751–1831), a peasant in charge of 180 hectares in Ognes, south of Paris, had to spend thousands of livres on wheat and oat seeds after hail destroyed part of his farm in 1788. These sorts of unforeseen calamities, a \"structural vulnerability,\" gave the peasants an \"aversion to risk\" (74). Peasants therefore, when presented with technical improvements or potentially superior varieties of plants, thought more about the danger of losses than about the possibility of gains. In 1808, Jean-Antoine Roulet, a farmer in Peseux, near Neuchâtel in Switzerland, wrote regarding a new type of vine that he preferred the existing grape harvest, however weak, to the hope for a more abundant, yet uncertain, one.Of course, these areas of France, Belgium, and Switzerland did not stagnate entirely. Delleaux showed in his early work Les censiers et les mutations des campagnes du Hainaut français (2012) that some tenant farmers and large landowners of northern France specialized their holdings in grasses for grazing, while others replaced fallow land with nitrogen-restoring fodder, textile plants, and oleaginous crops during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In Inquiétude dans les champs, Delleaux shows that improvements of this sort occurred thanks to innovative minorities. When groups of pioneering farmers exhibited strong conviction in the face of the dominant norms about the success of new methods, the majority could then come to see these methods as beneficial. The lure of gain could prove stronger than the fear of shortfall when the consistent behavior of neighbors proved convincing. When an innovation was guaranteed to produce benefits, the peasants felt the emotional security required to adopt it.Delleaux has made a major contribution to agricultural history. The contribution stands out more clearly when one delineates the peasant rationality not from \"homo œconomicus\" but from capitalist imperatives. Under capitalism, peasants must adopt the innovations of peers—to match the peers' competitive market prices—or else face bankruptcy and the loss of their lands. Delleaux explains, in contrast, how progress came about more slowly in a noncapitalist setting—through the example of improvements proven safe by a resolute minority of peasants.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural studies of the Mississippian peoples and the population center of Cahokia have focused heavily on the adoption and spread of maize. Gale J. Fritz seeks to shift this focus to other crops domesticated in mid-continent North America that predate the adoption of corn (maize) and that remained important staple crops. These crops helped make the development of the complex society of Cahokia possible. She also seeks to highlight the roles of farmers, primarily women, in the production and preparation of food, offering an alternative to the interpretation of farming as a low-status occupation paying tribute to a ruling elite. Additionally, Fritz strives to present the archaeological evidence in a way that is comprehensible to the general public.In Feeding Cahokia, Fritz challenges the zeacentric bias that dominates traditional and popular understandings of the development of agriculture in the American Bottom Region. This emphasis on corn, she argues, is based on outdated perspectives and skews our understanding of the development of agriculture and the development (and decline) of Cahokia. Instead, Fritz highlights the biologically diverse agricultural system that developed in the region.The first few chapters cover the domestication of various crops starting more than twelve thousand years ago with the first Native American colonization of the Eastern Woodlands. Fritz defines domestication \"as the process during which a plant or animal evolves in physical appearance and genetic makeup from being adapted to living totally in the wild to coexisting with people in human-created environmental patches or landscapes\" (16). Chapter 1 discusses the domestication of gourds and squashes and the landscape itself. Chapter 2 focuses on the domestication and use of sunflower and marsh elder crops in the Late Archaic period. Chapter 3 covers the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. During this era, domesticated chenopod and erect knotweed, and possibly maygrass and little barley, were added to the agriculture of the region. Chapter 4 explores the use of domesticated crops in trade and ceremony during the Middle Woodland period and the arrival of corn and tobacco in the American Bottom Region.Most of the rest of the book focuses on the development of the Mississippian period and the rise and decline of Cahokia. Chapter 5 discusses archaeological evidence of agriculture, including the spread of corn, throughout the Late Woodland and Emergent Mississippian periods. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with feasting, farming, and plant use in the greater Cahokia area. Chapter 8 challenges existing interpretations of red stone figurines excavated at Cahokia. Traditionally, the figurines were viewed as evidence of elite-dominated cults expropriating fertility symbols from earlier periods. Fritz, in contrast, suggests the figurines represent different sorts of communal rights performed by respected farmers, shifting the emphasis away from Green Corn ceremonialism. Chapter 9 creates estimates of crop yields and explains how archaeological practices were used to estimate dietary proportions, challenging older estimates that relied heavily on only corn. Chapter 10 discusses cultivation practices, challenging the popular belief in the reliance on slash-and-burn techniques and the social and spiritual dimensions of agriculture. Chapter 11 evaluates the probabilities of the three main hypotheses for the decline of Cahokia: human-caused environmental deterioration, nonhuman environmental causes, and political breakdown. The book closes with a discussion of the possible lessons that can be learned from the archaeological evidence from Cahokia.Fritz explains the archaeological practices and the methodology of collecting and testing samples in a way that makes it accessible to the general public. She also successfully leads readers through how the archaeology informs and helps develop the history we have of Cahokia. The book highlights the development of agriculture in mid-continent North America before the arrival of corn, which has been the focus of so many other studies. While the author occasionally writes about theories only to say later in the paragraph that dating and/or new tests disproved previous ideas, which can be confusing, overall the book discusses the archaeology of Cahokia in a straightforward, easily read style. Feeding Cahokia brings to public attention elements of North American and Cahokia history that most will not have encountered before. This book will interest scholars as well as the general public. Those interested in the domestication of plants and the development of agriculture will find Feeding Cahokia engaging and enlightening.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Russian provisional government and Bolshevik regime, in their respective efforts to address and resolve the food-supply crisis of 1917–19, sought to modernize state-village relations and mobilize peasant-citizens to contribute to the task according to their ability. Grain registration, an accounting of peasant grain stocks to find “surpluses,” was a continuation of a reformist trend within the state bureaucracy to replace customary means of allotting state obligations with an effort to base them on an assessment of household productive capacity. Evidence from Penza Province suggests that grain registration, both data gathering and interpretation, played a complex role in the evolution of grain procurement policy. The implementation of registration was impacted by local conditions and was embraced when and where it served local interests. Registration contributed to significant tensions within the state apparatus; it exacerbated the growth of the localism that undermined the authority of the hierarchical procurement apparatus. Grain registration revealed the adaptability of peasants and local officials in the face of top-down reform and prompted efforts to enhance state effectiveness. Ultimately, the persistent challenges posed by grain registration forced the regime to abandon registration and to reorganize the provincial apparatus to enhance oversight of local officials.",

    "abstract": "The economic and cultural globalization of wine in recent decades has made wine a newly attractive topic for scholars in the humanities and social sciences, joining the traditional research areas in grape and wine geography and science. Anglo-Saxon (as the French say) histories of wine are few compared to those produced in France and other European countries with long histories of cultivating wine grapes (Vitis vinifera). Even so, since the cultural turn a generation ago, some Anglophone historians have produced political and business histories, regional and environmental histories, and histories of institutions connected with wine. My own publications on wine growing and cultural imagining in colonial New South Wales argued that British imperial ambitions to create a wine industry arose from social and cultural aspirations to \"civilize\" colonized peoples and places, as well as from economic visions for colonization. Hence my enthusiasm for reading this suite of new books by Jennifer Regan-Lefebvre, Stephen Bittner, and Owen White on wine, imperialism, and colonization in Europe, Africa, and Oceania.Wine in these books, as with other wine histories, incorporates wine growing (viticulture, viniculture, or vitiviniculture), wine making, distribution, consumer economics, and the cultural habits of production and consumption observable in symbols, rituals, and socially stratified performances of identity. The cultural politics of wine as well as political economics of supply and demand for wine generates an interrelationship between production, trade, intermediation, representation, and consumption. States tend to be heavily involved in production subsidies and in trade and licensing regulations. Wine is also a luxury good with intensive and much-debated hierarchies of cultural taste, not least terroir, the French concept of characteristics of smell and taste connected with places, styles, and experiences. Each of these factors combine and collide in the different regional or national contexts explored by Regan-Lefebvre, Bittner, and White.Although V. vinifera cultivation has a long history, much recent scholarship has focused on its modern global history of mobility, acclimatization, colonization and dispossession, the phylloxera crisis and wine growers' response, and the development of rural tourism. Regan-Lefebvre, Bittner, and White in different ways explore wine and imperialism and/or colonization through themes of land and plant-stock acquisition, industry education and training, science (including battles with phylloxera and other more-than-human threats to the plant), as well as capital investment and labor.Regan-Lefebvre is a historian of nationalist networks within the British empire and an influential wine educator. Imperial Wine is the first study to encompass settler-colonial wine lands of the British Empire and the role of Britain as a wine importer. Regan-Lefebvre argues that wines from Britain's \"New World\" were (and are) the result of colonization. The term \"New World wines\" is commonly used in the wine business to distinguish the products of Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and the Americas from Old World (European) wines. Regan-Lefebvre aims to bring imperial and colonial historical context to this discursive world of marketing, education, and wine appreciation. Across nineteen chapters, Imperial Wine traces the entanglement of colonial wine growing followed by treatment of these countries' postimperial trade with Britain. The chapters are organized into four parts: \"Origins,\" \"Growth,\" \"Market,\" and \"Conquest.\"Regan-Lefebvre states that \"British settler colonialism looked to viticulture to demonstrate civilizational progress\" (xi). I anticipated that Imperial Wine might explore the colonial elements of wine and empire from the perspective of the colonies. Instead, the book tends to adopt the perspective of the empire looking out on the colonies. This perspective perhaps reflects research conducted from the Northern Hemisphere. For example, despite an extensive literature produced by Australian historians on New South Wales colonization—including my own publications cited elsewhere in Imperial Wine—the main reference on the establishment of the colony is a US thesis. Curious, too, is attention to a colonial character, George Barrington, known by Australian historians to be an unreliable (indeed fraudulent) witness to history. References on James Busby as a wine colonist are inaccurate and outdated, although they are corrected in the scholarship cited in the book. I learned a good deal from the section on the origins of the South African wine industry. Regan-Lefebvre adopts a relatively light touch, however, for histories of former British colonies where \"wine history\" is scant but historical study of colonization is deep and wide.Greater use of archives and historiographies in the former colonies might have strengthened the book's treatment of settler colonials and colonized peoples. This circumstance highlights the challenge of meeting the very broad scope of the book. While wine has moved more readily across international borders since the early 2000s, knowledge about it has remained siloed. Imperial Wine does, however, clearly signal that these barriers are dissolving, which is all to the good.In terms of agricultural focus, there is brief attention to grape phylloxera and powdery mildew and its effects on mainly Australian trade and British consumption, leading up to the \"conquest\" of the British market by 'New World' wines by the 1990s. The section titled \"Workers\" in chapter 9 might be expected to contain new work on labor in South Australia (the colony/state it appears to be based on). Labor is a topic of considerable potential about which not nearly enough research has been done in the Australian and other contexts, apart from Chelsea Davis (not cited by Regan-Lefebvre). Labor could have been a key mode of demonstrating the impact and after-effects of British imperialism in settler-colonial wine-producing countries. Yet there is little space given to research on workers—let alone Indigenous workers—for any of the colonies.Regan-Lefebvre concedes that the Anglo-Saxon wine appreciation world she is addressing remains a bastion of a privileged \"good life\" where talk of imperial/colonial violence and Indigenous dispossession might spoil the aura of refined luxury constructed around fine wine. Nevertheless, she knows her audience and has found a way to broach a testy topic to effect historically informed change in wine education. I have found that some Australian wine writers have changed their perspectives of gender imbalance and Indigenous participation in the wine industry through reading my work, and there is evidence in the UK wine world that Regan-Lefebvre's case for change is meeting with similar success. My concerns for the depth of the research aside, her prose is consistently elegant. Ultimately, for historians, Imperial Wine is strongest in correcting economists' assumptions about the timing of the popularity of wine from former colonies in Britain, using as evidence elite wine lists at certain institutions along with other documents and statistical data.Stephen Bittner is a specialist in Soviet history, and Whites and Reds extends across periods of Russian and Soviet history that are usually treated as separate. This is a great strength of the book. Bittner has uncovered a diverse range of primary source evidence on wine production, consumption, and (although he does not highlight it at first) trade. These sources act as a \"prism that refracts\" lines of inquiry across the Russian empire, the Soviet Revolution, Stalinism, the Cold War, and nationalism in the Soviet world (3).Although Russians did not produce wine in the early modern era, tsars and aristocrats stockpiled, consumed, and strategically served luxury western European wines as symbols of high cultural prestige and a refined \"good life.\" This means that when Russian forces took control of wine-producing regions in Georgia, Crimea, and Bessarabia (Moldova), tensions arose over which wines to treat as \"other\" and therefore inferior: either fetishized western European (mainly French) products or the former eastern European foreigners now due some imperialist loyalty. Indeed, Bittner contends, for Bolsheviks wine consumption became emblematic of the 1917 Revolution, and the socialist state demonstrated continued investment in maintaining wine production in its realm. Traditional wine-producing areas exerted influence on the habits and practices of Soviet leadership. It was not elite Russian Europhilia that became the hallmark of Soviet era wine culture but a Soviet wine nationalism.Whites and Reds unfolds across seven chapters themed around the topics of terroir, science, authenticity, commerce, hospitality, taste (sensory and cultural), and quality. The chapter on terroir contains fascinating detail on land values. I would have liked to also see attention to geographical indications, the international legal framework of intellectual property that underpins wine industry protections. In the authenticity chapter, too, some differentiation could have been made between the contemporary power of legitimacy, which is connected with vineyard spaces as intellectual property to guard against wine fraud. That may, however, have required a different source base.Otherwise, I found much of interest in Bittner's intricate but deftly staged narrative argument. He treats wine making with more attention than either Regan-Lefebvre or White. The chapter titled \"Taste\" is a masterful account of the Soviet travels of United States wine scientist Maynard Amerine, based on evidence in the Food and Wine Collections at the Shields Library, University of California, Davis. (Full disclosure: the Shields Library was my 2019 Fulbright Senior Scholar host institution, and its collections deserve closer research attention.) Bittner perceives that wine is linked in some parts of his history with civility and, as some other wine historians have done, frames this idea using Norbert Elias's theory of the civilizing process, in which Elias made scant reference to wine consumption. The heuristic is nonetheless useful to interpret stratified relations between colonizers and colonized people and places.As far as I am concerned, this book came out of left field. Some historians have tackled eastern European wine history in journal articles but not, to my knowledge, in book length studies. My passing understanding of Soviet/Russian history contained no knowledge of wine production, trade, or consumption in that part of the world, and therefore I do not claim to be assessing Bittner's historiographical acumen. I would say, however, that of the three books under review, Whites and Reds most effectively foregrounds changing identities and social stratification built around wine production and consumption. His skills in historical ethnography, knowledge of the relevant archives, and capacity for cross-cultural translation make this a canny account of political and business decision-making. In Bittner's hands historical actors, organizations, and institutions respond to and orchestrate wine industries connected by Russian and Soviet imperialism that challenge assumptions about what wine culture is if we only consider western Europe and the wine countries that emerged from western European imperialism.Owen White is a historian of France and empire. The Blood of the Colony is his response to the absence of studies of French Algeria's social history during, rather than only at the end of, the 130 years that French forces controlled Algerian land and people. White views wine production during French colonial rule through the frame of \"economic life,\" a theoretical framework that suits the economic and cultural intersections of wine history (6). While Algerian Muslims are not generally alcohol consumers due to religious doctrine, it is a strong point of The Blood of the Colony that, as White stipulates, \"in this book economic inequality rather than religious difference is of greatest significance\" (9).French forces invaded Algeria in 1830. The French military and settlers subsequently colonized the whole country and imposed a capitalist economy, largely through wine growing and export. This phenomenon in turn contributed to defining the economic hegemony of Euro-Algerians (White prefers this term to pied-noir to encompass settler colonials as French and other European émigrés and Algerian-born European citizens) over Algerians. Just because France was a leading wine producer and exporter did not predestine Algeria to be a wine country. Yet in the absence of other promising extractive industries in Algeria, the potential for wine growing arose early during the colonial era. Across seven gripping chapters, White tracks the emergence and continuity of the wine industry, followed by its rupture during and after Algerian independence and decolonization.The motor of self-interest (as opposed to sustainability) in capitalist production combined with colonization is evident in the shifting scenario whereby French authorities and French Algerians first collaborated in creating a wine industry that complemented the metropolitan economy. By the 1860s, however, \"settlers who now planted grapevines were not thinking imperially; instead they were acting colonially\" (37). By the 1880s wine grape growing had become the most important commodity of French Algeria.Algerians rarely owned vineyards and wineries, with wealthy exceptions noted by White. This is a crucial insight in wine history globally. Understanding the politics of land ownership and colonial resource extraction from ecologies previously managed differently by Indigenous peoples is at the core of contemporary relational historical responses to crises of environmental degradation and racialized social inequality in nations with histories of colonization. It is intriguing to see the oscillating influence of the French government, such as after World War I, when southern French wine growers suggested Euro-Algerians operated counter to the French spirit of wine growing that defined the French \"race.\" Euro-Algerian vinelords, as White calls them, meanwhile strove for exponential growth in the industry until overproduction beset the French mainland and Algeria in the 1930s. At the turn of the twentieth century, as French wine grape vineyards and communities collapsed due to the rapid spread of phylloxera, Algerian wine had sailed across the Mediterranean in larger and larger quantities to fill the breach in French wine bottles for working-class domestic use and some reexport. This made the northern African colony the world's fourth largest wine exporter.The Blood of the Colony has the most cogent structure of the three books, perhaps due in part to the comparatively streamlined geography of one colony. This is not to take away, however, from the manner in which White balances sources, scholarship, and analysis with impeccable dexterity. This excellence is exemplified in, for example, coverage of the arrival of phylloxera, disputes over types of treatment of the vine-feeding insect, and evidence of how phylloxera highlighted the fragility of the colonial project. White's account of the insect invasion is tied firmly to the book's overarching theme of wine growing as the \"lifeblood of the colony\" for Euro-Algerians (81).From the 1890s as vineyard land increasingly changed the Algerian landscape, Euro-Algerians filled managerial and technical roles with some Algerian support and Algerians (particularly Kabyle workers) carried out seasonal piecework such as pruning, spraying for mildew, and grape picking. In the 1930s the Euro-Algerians relied, too, on convict laborers. The very few Indigenous wine growers who did exist did not receive compensation for vines lost to phylloxera, underscoring the line of inquiry about social inequality.White's borrowed phrase of vineyards as a \"geometry of colonization\" (3) is one that I will cite often along with the powerful imagery that vines on plains were \"less picturesque than those of the slopes, yet in many ways offered an even more comprehensive portrait of colonization\" versus \"straggly paths taken by [Algerian] pastoralists and their livestock\" (65). The Blood of the Colony provides stark evidence of Algerians living in makeshift housing, lacking fresh water, and in the most straitened times, stealing from vineyards to survive. Nationalist attacks on vineyards targeted the core of the colonial economy. Then, as White shows, although Algerians expelled French colonists by 1962, vines that symbolized colonization neither offered postcolonial economic opportunities nor proved easy to remove.Wine history may appear to be superficial—fun and intoxicating like, well, wine. But what these three books evince is a concentration of research that marks a maturity in the field. Each volume is handsomely presented. Each is valuable for research and teaching at the intersection of commodities and capitalism with empires and colonization, wine nationalism, to some extent agriculture, and histories of food and drink.",

    "abstract": "Motor City Green explores the ways that Detroiters maintained green landscapes in the rapidly growing Motor City during the long twentieth century (between the late 1800s and early 2000s). Author Joseph Stanhope Cialdella identifies personal investment and public projects dedicated to retaining and creating gardens as the city experienced a growth spurt comparable to other industrial centers. Cialdella describes the result as \"a landscape in a perpetual state of ruin and repair\" (13). Motor City Green makes clear that both nature parks designed for recreation and utilitarian vegetable plots factored into the repair and that home gardens as well as horticultural and landscape gardening businesses count as urban agriculture and warrant attention as part of urban environmentalism.Cialdella has written an \"urban environmental history of parks and gardens\" covering the 139 square miles that make up Detroit (5). His work provides context to better understand the precedent for new agri-urban forms, as he calls them, that residents in the majority Black city have built as they revitalize the ruined and vacant (78 percent of Detroit residents are African American, based on the 2020 census). Detroit was, in fact, \"green, urban, and industrial\" throughout the twentieth century (9). Urban farming and gardening cohabitated with green spaces and parks. Cialdella lays the groundwork for his urban environmental history with designation of the seven-hundred-acre Belle Isle as a city park in 1881 and formation of Pingree's Potato Patches in 1893, a project of Mayor Hazen S. Pingree. Yet agriculture motivated colonizers, as the French long-lot survey system and mapping of the Park Lots and Ten Thousand Acre Tract by 1810, make clear. This area, not addressed by Cialdella, attracted small general farms and market gardens until urban expansion pushed the farmers further from the city during the 1870s and 1880s, coincident to Belle Isle's designation and facilitating the food crisis that Pingree's \"potato-patch plan\" to aid the poor and unemployed in the city attempted to address (29–30).Cialdella explores strategies that Black Detroiters pursued in and beyond the city to have gardens and green space. The Detroit Urban League (DUL) shaped an \"urban environmental ethic\" during the 1920s and 1930s through community and neighborhood parks, yards, and gardens (47). Black neighborhoods became the site of cleanup campaigns as well as ornamental plantings. Not all subscribed to the city beautiful movement, however, as some moved into sparsely populated areas like Eight Mile-Wyoming, believing that \"I'd like a better house, but I'd rather have something to eat\" (68). The DUL also invested in a recreational camp for youth, purchasing land outside of Detroit, near Jackson, Michigan. Their plan began in 1930, focused on teaching urban youth about the advantages of recreation, health, environmental quality, and racial justice through experiences at a lakeside camp, Green Pastures. The advantages of outdoor retreats for Black youth did not inform those expanding metropolitan parks after World War II. Instead, as Detroit's Black population increased, white planners concentrated park development outside the city boundaries. This \"suburban . . . environmentalism cultivated significant inequalities between Detroit and its growing suburbs\" with the suburbs gaining the advantages of environmental stewardship (107).Cialdella concludes Motor City Green with a chapter on the importance of nature and agriculture and community in Detroit's revitalization efforts, launched in earnest during the 1970s. No unified plan guided (or guides) these efforts, instead \"competing ideas and interests shaped the meaning behind making the motor city green\" (137). During his first term in office, Coleman A. Young, Detroit's first Black mayor, launched the Farm-A-Lot program in 1974. Residents could request a vacant city lot and advice on how to garden and join the effort to fight \"rising food prices and inner-city blight\" (139). Residents experienced in gardening became role models for both food gardens and ornamental plantings, but when USDA funding through the Urban Gardening Program ended in 1993, these efforts slowly faded, but they nonetheless laid the groundwork for ongoing green initiatives such as Keep Growing Detroit, the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network, and Greening of Detroit.Cialdella surveys a topic of particular interest to agricultural historians, but also of increasing interest to policymakers, environmental stewardship advocates, and urban farmers—the history of farming in one city. Sustainable food systems factor into city planning today, particularly for those environmentally conscious elected officials seeking to reduce carbon emissions. Histories of the ways that farming and food factored into city planning historically can resonate with them. The author limited his coverage to one long century. Cities invested in agriculture before the 1880s, as histories of urban markets make clear. More remains to be done to provide histories that can best inform today's decisions about sustainable food futures.",

Growers in postwar Norwegian horticulture were sometimes poisoned by nicotine sulfate, but many also smoked tobacco, and this was widely considered a way to ameliorate the negative effects. This might have made them ambivalent about the risks, even though they knew it could be hazardous in certain dosages. This article explores the ambiguity of the meaning of nicotine in Norwegian horticulture in the 1950s as well as how growers understood the risks tied to chemical components that potentially had other more mundane and culturally endorsed uses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores collective memories about lost farms in New York City's watershed. It argues that farms taken by eminent domain for two water supply reservoirs came to symbolize lost rural and agricultural lifeways in the twentieth century. In the 1950s and 1960s, New York City condemned over two hundred farms in Delaware County, New York, flooding two valleys for reservoirs, contributing to a pattern of farm closure, and dramatically changing social and economic life. Nonetheless, farms declined in this region more slowly than across the state and nation, suggesting that it was not the loss of farms but the specific way these agricultural valleys were flooded that became important for collective memories about this local history. Using transcripts from eminent domain proceedings and local newspapers, this article explores the making and mobilization of collective memories that blamed New York City for the loss of the county's “best” farms. Reading historical documents as cultural texts, this article brings together the insights of science and technology studies and memory studies to show how residents in the watershed localized a more general politics of rural-urban division by linking anxieties about changes in the region to New York City's water supply development history.",

    "abstract": "Abstract From its inception, US settler agriculture has used extractive and unsustainable practices. Farm bill agricultural conservation policy since the 1930s has been based on largely ineffective approaches unable to address the environmental problems caused by agriculture. Conservation policies have consistently had both income support and environmental purposes, and have been largely countercyclical: conservation funding decreases when crop and livestock prices are higher, as income support becomes less important. This happens even though higher prices typically cause environmental stressors to get worse, indicating that conservation is ancillary to productivist goals. This is also apparent from the repeated funding of production-enhancing practices under the guise of conservation. In parallel terms, environmental concerns were and remain peripheral to the “iron triangle” conceptualization. The still-marginal role that environmental issues play in agricultural policy is a huge problem, particularly as climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation become more crucial in the farm sector.",

The essay incorporates the broader concept of “power clusters” to more accurately reflect the shaping of farm policy and to better illustrate the premise that these influence structures might offer a viable pathway forward for a reorientation of farm policy. Focusing on congressional committee jurisdiction and executive branch implementation of policies, the essay provides examples of how power cluster interests groups have used both pathways to expand the range of debate and program coverage associated with agricultural policy, both within and outside the farm bill. Changes to tobacco policy, farm labor assistance, conservation on agricultural lands, and rural development have all been achieved through those pathways, suggesting that creative exploitation of the iron triangle or power clusters approach can offer a strategy for achieving farm bill reorientation goals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agricultural policy in the United States is made through a distinctive coalition of interests that come together every five years or so to craft the so-called farm bill. The core of this coalition is a tacit trade of subsidies for agricultural commodity growers in exchange for food and nutrition programs for the needy. How has this coalition proved so durable and adaptable over the years? Or has it, in fact, changed in fundamental ways? Will future policy that confronts agriculture's significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions take a different form? These questions motivate the forum's return to a venerable concept in agricultural history and social science: the “iron triangle,” which refers to a mutually supporting arrangement of legislators, bureaucrats, and special interests. This essay introduces and synthesizes contributors’ efforts to interrogate and apply the iron triangle concept, finding that it retains utility for understanding the challenges that will face a climate-oriented farm bill politics.",

Since 1964, public discourses about food stamps focus mainly on the legislation and those who carry it out or those who receive federal food assistance. But what about grocery store owners and retailers? Drawing on research from my book Food Power Politics, the essay takes up this question and analyzes a largely unknown March 1964 phone conversation about food stamp legislation between President Lyndon B. Johnson and Senator James O. Eastland of Mississippi. This conversation compels us to consider how racial dynamics and political motivations shaped congressional support of food stamps and look beyond the farm gate when thinking about agricultural and food legislation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract When milking machines were introduced on Swedish farms during the first half of the twentieth century, milking and taking care of cows had long been women's responsibility, and adult men seldom entered the cowshed. As dairying became a commercial operation and the number and yield of cows increased, farm wives, daughters, maidservants, and hired milkmaids continued to perform this work. By the end of World War I, however, so many young women had left the countryside that farmers had difficulty hiring enough milkmaids. When milking machinery became available, it promised to save labor and do the job more effectively than milking by hand. At the same time, adult men entered the cowshed and milked alongside women. But how were these simultaneous changes connected? This study analyzes advertisements for milking machinery in Sweden's most popular farm weekly. Manufacturers deliberately associated machine milking with images of masculinity. In the 1920s and 1930s, ads emphasized that both men and women could milk by machine. By the 1940s and 1950s, the ads depicted milking in an ungendered way, as a depersonalized technical process that was neither manly nor womanly.",

This methodological review exposes the value and limitations of natural archives such as tree rings (dendroclimatology), and it presents human records as a complementary and underutilized source of paleoclimatological data that historians are well positioned to develop. It demonstrates that climate history offers a useful and accessible lens for interpreting the past and contextualizing contemporary social and environmental issues. Finally, it encourages historians to actively consider the climate, and it provides suggestions and resources for getting started.",

Only farm interests sat at the table, politicians gained little by challenging the isolated process, and outsiders had no pull. This changed after the 1960s and 1970s, when the modern farm bill combined food assistance with the traditional commodity supports, and in a post-reform Congress, where power shifted from southern committee chairs toward party caucuses and leaders. New coalitions found openings and opportunities to advance programs and to exchange strategic support. While the fundamental directions of policy, research, and extension may never have shifted radically or fundamentally, it is not historically accurate to blame an iron triangle of simple and limited interests.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article recovers and analyzes the sophisticated corporate response to environmentalist concerns already in the 1960s about the radical disruption of the nitrogen cycle that governs life on the planet caused by intensified application of chemical fertilizers. In 1971, ecologist Barry Commoner petitioned the Illinois Pollution Control Board to curtail the use of nitrogen fertilizer. This was the first-ever effort to use new state environmental protections to mandate limits on intensive agricultural practices. After holding ten public forums, the board ruled against restrictions. This decision marked a critical inflection point in the intertwined histories of US environmental activism, agribusiness, and the chemical technologization of food production at just the moment when nitrogen fertilizer was going global. This article aims to restore Commoner's long-forgotten campaign against the nitrogen fertilizer industry to its rightful place in postwar US environmental history. It additionally details how that industry had preemptively used a Malthusian logic of resource scarcity to make a nearly unassailable case for itself as a savior of humankind from the threat of global hunger. The article examines this early exemplar of “greenwashing” and reconstructs an untold story in the history of nitrogen capitalism.",

Ideas of agricultural efficiency and productivity constitute the fil rouge linking the colonial past with the postcolonial condition. Using internal documentation of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and other unpublished sources, this article investigates the formative years of atomic agriculture in Pakistan. In so doing, it argues for the relevance of agriculture in a nuclear program centered on fuel cycle engineering; the importance of taking a long-term perspective on the relationships between atomic agriculture and agricultural research in general; and the significance of the concrete implementation of atomic agriculture from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Established in 1960 near Rome and supported by the US Atomic Energy Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Casaccia Center for Nuclear Studies played a fundamental role in transforming what became known as “mutation breeding” from an uncertain set of technologies into a robust area of research and development at both the national and international levels. At the time, there was a struggle for authority over plant breeding between the advocates of using nuclear energy and those advocating more cost-effective methods such as pedigree selection or hybridization. The Casaccia Center strategically implemented a research program based on two crucial elements: first, the use of the “gamma field,” a circular area with a retractable gamma-ray source in the middle, where growing plants could be exposed to chronic irradiation; and second, the launch of a broad mutation breeding program of durum wheat, typically used for pasta making. Drawing from a variety of archival sources, this article shows how both programs were instrumental in legitimizing and bolstering the use of the “peaceful atom” in agriculture on a national and global scale.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bitter melon is a popular gourd vegetable native to Okinawa in Japan. However, because of the melon fly, a very damaging pest on the quarantine list, bitter melon could not be sold in mainland Japan until the fly was eradicated from Okinawa Prefecture in 1993 by using the nuclear-derived sterile insect technique (SIT). This essay examines the SIT project in Okinawa that began in 1972 when the United States returned Okinawa to Japan. The twenty-year-long project required the irradiation and release of fifty-three billion melon flies. Its success helped Okinawa's troubled agricultural sector and made theoretical contributions to the SIT with sophisticated models to gauge the sexual competitiveness of sterile flies. Commemorative publications and scientific reports, however, are silent about Okinawa's status as a US military-base island. Rather than seeing the SIT as the solution to the pest problem, this article situates Okinawan agriculture and the SIT project in the deeper context of colonialism, overdependence on pesticides, and the nuclearization of Japan, by taking seriously the fact that the entomologist who led the project felt profound ambivalence toward “peaceful” atomic technology.",

    "abstract": "At three o'clock on Thanksgiving morning in 1933, Gladys Egeland, 33, was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver as walked across the First Avenue bridge from Moorhead, Minnesota, to Fargo, North Dakota. Egeland had moved to Fargo from Grandin, North Dakota, three years before, deserting her husband, farmer Arnold Jalbert, and her fourteen-year-old son, Lewis. Her time in Fargo had not been happy. She had been employed intermittently waiting tables, but had been out of work most of the time. The Fargo Forum's description of her as a comely young woman, and her residence at the Riverside Apartments, which was so vice-ridden that Cass County Relief refused to allow clients with children to stay there, suggest that might have resorted to casual prostitution. One of her neighbors at the Riverside, Gladys Hickens, found her crying in her room at night, and reported that she often suffered from despondency. Two arrests for drunkenness in Fall 1932 offer further evidence of a degraded, disordered and unhappy life.1 Gladys Egeland was one of hundreds of rural women who came to Fargo during the 1930s in search of work, excitement, refuge, or anonymity. Her story reads like a popular cliche of the age?a rural girl undone by city life. Clearly, her experience was not a positive one, but it was never bad enough to drive her back to the husband from whom was estranged.",

At no time since the Second World War have the American people been as united and convinced they were fighting the war to defeat what nearly everyone assumed to be an unmitigated evil. And just as the beginning of the signaled a dramatic period of transition from peace to wartime conditions, the end of the conflict meant another transition to a very different world, one that most Americans hoped would be unlike the 1930s. writer Erie Goldman captured some of that new spirit: The America of V-J was prosperous, more prosperous than the country had been in all its three centu? ries of zest for good living. boom rolled out in great fat waves, into every corner of the nation and up and down the social ladder.1",

    "abstract": "Many of the men who headed west to establish the open range ranching system on the northern Great Plains in the late nineteenth century failed to grasp stock for local and eastern markets, they found themselves struggling with an array of unforeseen obstacles. The worst of these ware natural predators, harsh winter weather, drought, the ability of the domesticated animals to wander over great distances on the unfenced plains, and their tendency to breed indiscriminately. This article provides a detailed explanation of how all these conditions cane together in the high-bred horse business on one very large ranch in southern Alberta. The author’s central argument is frontier ranching proved uneconomic in this case and thus in many others on both sides of the Canadian/American Border.",

Having written a Walter Webb-like disserta? tion on the Rockies, I called myself something most of my colleagues were not doubt confronting for the first time, an environmental historian.

Farm women and their families invested their limited financial and labor resources into household equipment and furnishings, knick-knacks and per? sonal adornment, land, and homes. They used the legal system to secure their property and convey it to heirs even as unscrupulous landlords conspired against them. But purchasing land could limit a family's mobility, disrupt kinship networks, and constrain their ability to purchase other products of the modern consumer age, most notably automobiles. Irrefutably, the white mid? dle class defined consumer culture and the characteristics of modernization in the rural South, not the black farm families, but rural African Americans still had to feed, clothe, and house their families. Their choices became the object of analysis and ridicule by reformers during the early twentieth century. By the 1930s the small homes that once housed aspiring families became the symbols of poverty even as rural reformers and the Progressive farmers they served celebrated a rural aesthetic that advocated recycling and thrifty management.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sugarcane emerged by 1884 as the most favored crop cultivated in the coastal lands of Eastern Australia between Cairns and Grafton. Initially, Australian canegrowers invested as little labor and capital as possible. Contemporary commentators, however, were very critical of the agricultural practices adopted by the country’s first canegrowers, noting a lack of careful cultivation and plowing, fertilizer use, drainage, and paddock design. Various reasons for the use of these \"inadequate techniques\" are discussed in this essay, with the conclusion being offered that the most important factor was a lack of scientific knowledge about farming under Australian conditions. By 1891 cane-growing techniques were reported to be \"on the upgrade,\" with improved cane and sugar yields. Such a transformation had commenced due to the introduction of some mechanization and the dissemination of research findings and technical information about scientific cultivation methods under Australian conditions. This detail had been assembled during the 1890s and 1900s mainly by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the Queensland government Sugar Experiment Stations, which had been established following pressure from canegrowers who increasingly sought advice on the correct farming methods.",

Although literary sources suggest otherwise, no one bought chocolate; but many people bought tea, tobacco, sugar, and salt, evidently at standard levels for contemporary British society. As time went by, a growing range of products appear among purchases, notably many drugs and medications. The evidence is also read for indications of what families made for themselves. Their choices, visible in everyday routine purchases, have implications for some of the main stories about material life, consumption, and market relationships in early settlement society. It is difficult, for example, to picture rural isolation from a capitalist world if ordinary farm families regularly purchased goods imported from the far side of the globe.",

The case of iceberg lettuce shows that the industrialization of agriculture was largely idiosyncratic, and the level of industrialization possible for any specific crop varied, depending equally on the nature of the commodity and the willingness of consumers to purchase it. The emergence of lettuce cultivation in the Salinas Valley during the inter-war period highlights how early growers harnessed organizational techniques, transportation infrastructures, and technological and scientific knowledge to transcend both the ephemeral nature of lettuce and consumer taste. Yet, these very same factors also limited the success of valley growers after World War II, despite the best efforts of growers and agricultural researchers to improve lettuce quality.",

In the early 1950s the evacuation of civilian populations from urban areas and military targets served as the basis for federal and state civil defense programs. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, however, as the dangers of fallout shaped the public discourse, rural areas were no longer considered safe from an attack. Throughout this period, the Federal Civil Defense Administration (FCDA), in conjunction with the USDA and State Cooperative Extension Services, launched campaigns to educate farmers on their roles as providers of food and as budding atomic scientists. The rhetoric of these programs reinforced the notion that rural Americans contributed not only food and raw materials to the American economy, but also served as the moral backbone of a democratic nation. Such language placed farmers and rural residents on the front lines of the Cold War.",

    "abstract": "Abstract At the start of the twenty-first century, California wineries entered a new vinti-business (vertical integration of grape farming, wine production, and wine distribution) era based on the needs of a global wine economy by adapting historic survival lessons learned from their past. This agricultural success story illuminates the entrepreneurial energy and able instincts of California farmers who replicated, with modern twists, the big business canons of Gilded Age agricultural capitalism. Whether it be the Phyloxera outbreak in the 1880s Los Angeles region of Southern California, World War I, Prohibition, the Great Depression, the Second World War, and finally neoprohibition, wine entrepreneurs rebuilt each time by returning to nineteenth-century capitalist tenets intrinsic in a market economy. Successful wineries found ways to achieve the most efficient economy-of-scale operations through their use of science, promotion of sustainable agriculture, aggressive marketing, protection of wine’s image from attacks by neoprohibitionists, and courtship of government agencies for money and favorable policies. After managing domestic production and sales, forward-thinking viticultural entrepreneurs then expanded their operations into the twenty-first century global market-place much like their predecessors from the century before.",

The rise of motion pictures during the 1910s and 1920s was a critical component of an emerging consumer culture in the United States that coincided with its broader transformation from a rural to an urban society. Because of this conjuncture, silent movies depicting agrarian life were instrumental in establishing new understandings of rural society for a modern, urban nation. They resonated with city audiences, particularly those who had been raised on the farm, as well as with rural and small-town moviegoers, and they helped to reconcile both groups to vexing social changes. Besides providing comfort in a time of transition, however, these films also facilitated the new order by subverting traditional understandings of agrarian life and distancing it from its previous position at the core of American culture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Imported grapes planted in El Paso del Norte around the middle of the seventeenth century grew to be substantial vineyards by the opening decades of the eighteenth century. Some growers had tens of thousands of vines under cultivation and produced wine and brandy that, according to contemporary accounts, rivaled the finest wines of Mexico or even Spain. As the century wore on, the fruits of the vine increased in importance in comparison with other agricultural products. In most years only maize competed with wine and brandy as the most valuable agricultural crop. So important were these commodities to the economy of El Paso that every year as many farmers grew grapes to produce wine and brandy as any other product. Traditionally, most of the annual production was consumed locally, although there was a brisk export trade south to Chihuahua and north to Albuquerque and Santa Fe. This trade continued until the annexation of Mexican territory north of the Rio Grande following the Mexican War in 1848. Wine continued to be produced on both sides of the river until the first decades of the twentieth century when the combination of population growth and salination of the soil ended an industry that had flourished for two and one half centuries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Early Spanish colonists in regions of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado sought locations where irrigation works could be constructed to make new settlements possible. Between 1867 and 1872 four Hispanic villages, based on an economy of irrigation, agriculture, and livestock grazing, were established in the middle Rio Puerco valley, northwest of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Within a decade, overgrazing in the larger Rio Puerco watershed initiated a process of erosion and entrenchment of the Rio Puerco that eventually led to the abandonment of three of the villages. The surviving village of San Luis has kept its sense of community alive despite environmental losses that brought an end to agriculture and severely limited the possibilities for raising livestock. San Luis’s institutions of agriculture once provided its unique connection to place.

    "abstract": "Abstract Although most Americans enjoy a plethora of food choices, as well as an abundance of foods throughout the year, most of this food is processed and travels a long way to our tables. In exchange for plentiful food, evidently, we have given up local and regional sources and supplies of food. Since about 1930, the trend toward centralization, standardization, and specialization has discouraged local production in food, as it has discouraged local and regional production in other industries. This essay considers how this process occurred in perhaps the most archetypical agricultural state--Iowa--to understand how national trends played out on a small stage, and how Iowans responded to these pressures. In the last few years, local and regional food producers have begun to rebound in reaction to these trends.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For nearly sixty years, roughly 1880 to 1950, before the affordability and wide-spread use of combines, grain production in the American and Canadian Great Plains was dependent on harvesting with binders. Binders cut the grain stalks and then tied them into bundles with twine that farmhands later would gather into shocks to await threshing. The majority of the twine used was made from fiber from agave plants (sisal and henequen) from Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. The dependency on this Mexican commodity is illustrated by the fact that for the first two decades of the twentieth century, the United States and Canada consumed an estimated 230,000 tons of the fiber a year for the production of binder twine. Thus, a double agricultural dependency developed between these regions that this essay seeks to explore. Along with this international dependency, corporate, social, and labor issues are integral aspects of the grain/twine story. International Harvester of Chicago came to dominate the twine industry in the United States, but faced stiff competition from American and Canadian penitentiaries that developed their own twine mills using low-wage inmate labor. And in Mexico, wealthy henequen estate owners enslaved Yaqui Indians from Sonora to work in their fields in the Yucatan. \"Dependent Harvests\" seeks to introduce these themes and to cast them into their proper transnational and agricultural history perspectives.",

Its two-decade-long attempt to identify appropriate plants and farming practices and thus to extend the agricultural frontier into this region was ambitious. It included an experimental garden, a greenhouse and nursery, an attempt to produce fertilizer locally, two major experimental/demonstration farms, and a number of other agricultural initiatives not usually associated with mining companies. This article reviews why Cleveland-Cliffs became deeply involved in promoting agriculture, the nature of its programs, why its activities were more comprehensive and longer lasting that those of most other companies (mostly timber and railroad) who attempted to promote agriculture in the Great Lakes cutover region, and why the attempt ultimately failed.",

Dominguez was a banker and large landowner who turned his haciendas into private agricultural experiment stations, conducting research on better methods of growing corn, cotton, wheat, and beans with the labor of his peones. He shared his results through lecture tours and published works in Mexico and traveled extensively in the United States, speaking to groups of farmers and agricultural scientists about his methods of dry farming and corn propagation. He exhibited at agricultural fairs and exhibitions, attended Farmers’s Institutes and conferences, and published a manual for use by average American farmers. Like many agricultural reformers in the United States, he addressed the problems of rural poverty and land concentration not with socialism, but with visions of a Mexico filled with small, capitalistic, home-owning farmers producing with scientific methods and business efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article is a contribution to the debate over Australia’s convict beginnings and the nature of the British colonization of New South Wales. The early agriculture of the convict colony is set in the maritime context of imperial rivalries and visions of empire in the Pacific Ocean. When the Port Jackson settlement is viewed from this maritime perspective, it is apparent that agriculture was an imperial imperative of the Pitt administration. The design and early function of the settlement as a port of shelter and refreshment ensured that, despite initial despondency and drought, a bountiful and secure agricultural hinterland was in the making. Within five years after the planting of New South Wales, convict settlers, mixed agriculture, and imperial designs had transformed \"a rude, wild country into a pleasant garden.\" As a planned, self-sufficient, maritime settlement, Port Jackson rapidly developed its capacity to produce a surplus of antiscorbutic seamen’s greens essential for a distant port and naval base to become an assured resource of refereshment, services, and supplies necessary for Britain to \"effectively occupy\" the oceanic territory of New South Wales and thereby integrate the development of a global empire.",

This development reflected many aspects of New Zealand farming at the time. Dairying was expanding rapidly, reducing the control of ragwort by grazing with sheep; large areas of land cleared in the post-war boom were reverting to weeds; farmers tended to look to the state to assist with their problems and the Department of Agriculture promoted the use of sodium chlorate; farmers were generally highly literate and were rapidly aware of new possibilities; and there was a continuing shortage of labor in farming. The latter reflected New Zealand’s generally restrictive immigration policies; higher wages and greater freedom in urban employment; changing demography and attitudes to child labor; attitudes to married women working out on the farm; and, perhaps most importantly, the widespread drive for independence from farm workers and neighbors. Sodium chlorate seemed to promise a solution to the control of ragwort without the high financial and personal cost of finding additional labor.",

    "abstract": "In 2009 a global effort finished mapping the genome of an eight-year-old Hereford cow. Since then, the effort has expanded to the cow's evolutionary ancestor, the aurochs, as well as using a nearly seven-thousand-year-old bone from the UK to map the genome of an ancient cattle breed. Though these efforts have yielded deep insights about the animal's natural history, they have also informed questions about human history—when and where cattle were domesticated, what neolithic agriculture looked like, and how domesticated animals were enmeshed in patterns of human migration and trade. The evolutionary history of cattle is also a deeply human story. No surprise, then, that telling the full story of the cow requires the insights of both scientists and humanists.The Cow: A Natural and Cultural History is a reference work on the cow as well as an introduction to its biology and place in world history. It covers natural history topics ranging from cattle ancestry and anatomy to cultural history themes like domestication and religious significance. The book is packed with photographs and diagrams that are both informational and beautiful. There is even a wonderful directory of cattle breeds complete with maps, key characteristics, and cattle portraits. It is a great way to both read about—and appreciate—the distinctive coat of the Guernsey, or the size and power of the Chianina, an Italian breed that is one of the oldest in the world. This is a book for academics across the disciplines. As a historian, I learned the most from chapters 1 and 2—covering evolution, development, anatomy, and biology—whereas I expect a biologist would have much to learn from the final portion of the book, which covers cattle and people.As with any introductory reference book, this volume has its limits. For one thing, there is a tension between accessibility and comprehensiveness. The book covers pretty much everything about the cow, but without footnotes. There is a bibliography, though admittedly it is stronger on the natural history of cattle than its cultural history. That said, a more comprehensive and more thoroughly cited reference guide would be far denser. For instance, one can certainly learn top-line information about serious cattle disease, but identifying said diseases, knowing their urgency, and distinguishing them from more benign but obscure ailments would require a much more detailed guide. One can find out almost anything about the cow from this book, but it provides more an excellent first step than a complete answer. On this point, what I really would have wanted in the book is an essay, perhaps attached to the bibliography, in which the author suggested where interested readers should look next on various subjects.There is another challenge that is more specific to a book of this kind on cattle. Cows, their bodies, and their lives are so intertwined with the human world that any treatment of the human-cow relationship reflects underlying assumptions about human society, economy, and politics. Despite presenting a historically and geographically varied set of perspectives on cattle, this book takes as its primary reference (perhaps unsurprisingly) intensive animal agriculture. Catrin Rutland addresses the challenges of this approach, but the treatment is brief, and the underlying assumption—that intensive cattle production is a necessary part of human agriculture—is never questioned. At a time when the human relationship with cattle raises some of the most difficult and long-standing questions about our relationship to the natural world, I would have liked a more thorough discussion, even if it risked making some of the book's readers uncomfortable. This thought, on the politics and ethics of our relationship with cattle, also raises another question: this is a book written by a scientist covering questions both biological and historical. What underlying assumptions and approaches would inform a similar book written by a humanist?Overall, though, The Cow is a fantastic introductory reference to the natural and human history of the cow. Beautifully presented, it was a pleasure to read. It is the kind of book I will consult when faced with a question about hooves or I become curious about an obscure breed. In terms of writing both a natural and a cultural history, the cow poses some of the greatest challenges of any animal. Catrin Rutland has done an admirable job.",

    "abstract": "I held the first meeting of my graduate seminar in environmental history last August and had planned what I hoped would be a big Socratic reveal at the end. The readings for the day included the usual suspects: Fernand Braudel's materialist Annales perspective through Roderick Nash's American studies–inflected deconstruction of the “wild” to Donald Worster's agroecological approach and William Cronon's disruptive “The Trouble with Wilderness.” R. G. Collingwood's 1946 unflinching claim that all true history is really the history of human thought and Richard White's 2004 case for “hybrid landscapes” served as rough historiographical bookends.To set up my “big picture” conclusions, I suggested my students place these articles on a crude spectrum ranging between the idealist/culturalist on one end and materialist/scientific on the other. They were good sports, and this somewhat rigid approach worked for a while. But by the second half of the three-hour seminar, the conversation was bogging badly. Finally, visibly frustrated even behind her COVID mask, one student bravely said what many others were probably thinking. “Well, isn't everything just a mix of the material and cultural?” she asked. “What's the point of just constantly repeating these ‘chicken or the egg’ debates about which came first?”I floundered out some sort of response that I (and probably everyone else) promptly forgot. It was only later—l'esprit d'escalier, Owl of Minerva, whatever—that I realized that her question had perfectly set up my Socratic moment, but I had stupidly failed to recognize it. What I wish I'd said was: “That's it exactly! We do need to get beyond these old material-versus-cultural debates. They're taking us nowhere because they're based on the mistaken belief that human culture is mostly about abstract ideas or discourse, when it's really inseparable from our material bodies and environments. What we need now is to develop a materialist and environmentally grounded cultural history, a sort of deep culture.”That response, had I made it, would have offered a pretty good step toward capturing what I consider to be the central goal of so-called New Materialism: to escape the traditional idea that we are mostly creatures of a disembodied and displaced mind or spirit and put humans and their cultures back into the material world.At some level, this basic point has been kicking around for quite a while. In 2005 the feminist material theorist Elizabeth Groz captured it nicely, observing that “nature and culture can no longer be construed as dichotomous or oppositional terms when nature is understood as the very field on which the cultural elaborates and develops itself.”1 Even earlier, the architects of actor network theory and “flat ontology” (Bruno Latour, Michael Callon, John Law, among others) had taken aim at the same target.2 The environmental historian Paul S. Sutter seemed to suggest something similar in his 2013 survey of the discipline when he concluded that the then-dominant Latourian concept of hybridity seemed provisional, a step toward something else whose nature was not yet clear.3With so many antecedents, it would seem presumptuous to claim that the New Materialism(s) is that “something else.” Moreover (as the previous parenthetical s not so subtly suggests), today the term itself covers such a wide range of often ill-fitting ideas and methods as to effectively defy definitive definition. My own preference has been to distinguish the more scientifically and environmentally grounded varieties of the New Materialism under the lower-caps umbrella of “neo-materialism.”4 The intent is not to dismiss other approaches but, rather, to suggest that the union of some key contemporary scientific insights with old humanistic questions offers the most exciting and productive path to new insights into the past or what I think of as “deep culture.”What might such a theory look like? For the sake of speed and space, I shoot out these three bullets as broadly diagnostic: That humans are inescapably material creatures, not just in the obvious sense that we are embedded in complex ecologies, but also because our thoughts, ideas, societies, and cultures emerge in significant part from our embodied engagement with a dynamic and vibrant material world;That this material environment is best understood not as a limiting factor on an abstract and solely human imagination but as a creative force that sparks and nurtures human (and nonhuman) thoughts, beliefs, cultures, and actions;And that previously justifiable fears of some sort of materialist determinism are in this new framing misplaced because they (1) presuppose a mistaken modernist dualism between the human and the environment, and (2) wrongly assume that the nonhuman material world is largely static rather than creative.The theory, however, is not where the real action is. At least in my view, what is most exciting about neo-materialism is the way these abstract ideas resonate powerfully with an array of new scientific insights. So rather than dwell on theory, let me use my remaining space to focus on some concrete examples of how contemporary science gives support to a “deep culture” approach.One relatively easy point of entry is the science of the human microbiome, the roughly 1.1 kilograms of bacteria and other nonhuman microorganisms we all carry around in our guts. While most historians today continue to assume that their human subjects are clearly unitary, bounded, and discrete subjects, today some students of the microbiome think of human beings as symbiotic “superorganisms” more akin to coral reefs than discrete actors. Superorganism is apt both physiologically and cognitively, as our microbial fellow travelers not only help to digest our food but also play a significant role in how we feel and act. They synthesize, for example, much of the mood-regulating hormone serotonin found in our bodies.5 The recent socioecological concept of human niche construction theory likewise undermines conventional distinctions between the brain, body, and environment, arguing that humans (like all organisms) create niches that in turn serve to create, sustain, and define them. In this view, the beaver—and by extension you're to think “human” here—does not just create its dam; rather, the beaver simply is its dam. Both beavers and humans cannot logically be understood apart from the novel environmental niches in which they live and develop.6 Similarly, the evolutionary biologist Kevin Laland proposes the concept of an extended evolutionary synthesis that incorporates niche construction, culture, and learned behaviors under the umbrella of evolution. In this framing, culture is not an abstract epiphenomenon layered on top of a slow process of evolutionary development. Rather, culture emerges as organisms engage with their constantly shifting material environment, built and otherwise—a process that plays out not only over the long spans of evolutionary time but also over the far briefer time periods historians typically study.7 A deep culture indeed.The contemporary ideas of epigenetics are also offering many useful points of collaboration between scientists and historians. One reason that anthropologists and humanists erected conceptual barriers between culture and matter in the first place was to avoid any repeat of the disastrous genetic determinism of the first half of the twentieth century. It was a necessary bulwark at the time. But today the novel science of epigenetics offers powerful evidence that the hoary old nature-versus-nurture and matter-versus-culture debates were simply wrongheaded. Both scientists and historians should understand human physiological and cognitive processes as the product of organismal development in their environment or niche rather than as a simplistic hard-wired product of genes. The genotype does not determine the phenotype; rather, environmental cues turn genes off and on during the course of our lives in response to a changing material environment. In this very concrete biological sense, the material world enters into human bodies and brains, shaping—without determining—how they might think and act.8A small but growing number of contemporary cognitive scientists and theorists now go so far as to argue that even our much-vaunted human intelligence—presumably the first source of what we typically think of as an abstract symbolic or discursive “culture”—must also be understood as a material phenomenon. By this they mean not merely the largely undisputed point that all thought and consciousness emerge from entirely physical biochemical processes. Rather, they argue that the human mind (versus the brain) is not confined to our skulls, or even our bodies, but is extensive with its surrounding environment. Andy Clark, the most prominent advocate of this “extended mind” thesis, suggests that human cognitive abilities are distributed in a network of external props and aids like notes, maps, and files, material aspects of our surroundings without which some fundamental part of what we consider to be our intelligence would vanish. In changing our physical environment (the parallel to niche construction seems productive), Clark suggests, we also reconfigure “our minds and our capacities of thought and reason.”9Some historians have already begun to incorporate these and related scientific insights. Daniel Lord Smail and other developers of “neurohistory” make convincing use of neuroscience to argue that the brain is highly plastic, capable of both shaping and being shaped by the environment. As humans use their intelligence and culture to change their material surroundings, neurohistory suggests that they evince new patterns of behavior that in turn “generate new neural configurations or alter brain-body states.”10 As Clark, Smail, and others suggest, our brains and minds are porous rather than bounded, plastic rather than fixed, and shaped by matter rather than merely a means of shaping it. Contemporary cognitive science and theory thus offers perhaps the most direct attack on the still-dominant Cartesian and postmodernist idea of an abstract human mind and culture that exist in isolation from their material environment.Finally, recent advances in the study of animal cognition offer a more oblique but equally powerful challenge to the longstanding immaterial anthropocentrism of humanistic studies. It has been several decades now since the western lowland gorilla Koko showed that she could understand spoken English and communicate using sign language. We also now know that the use of simple tools is not unique to humans, as with the New Caledonian crow Betty who was famously caught on tape bending a wire into a hook to snare some otherwise impossible-to-reach food. As the ethologist Frans de Waal argues in his latest book, Mama's Last Hug, it has also become increasingly difficult to deny that other animals experience feelings and emotions that were long believed to be solely human.11 Even the lowly little white lab rat can be empathetic and altruistic, postponing the immediate gratification of a chocolate treat to first rescue another rat from an unpleasant (though not life-threatening) swim. It is difficult to overstate the importance of these ethological insights for the humanistic and historical endeavor. If altruism, a sense of justice, or even an appreciation for beauty can be understood as shared with at least some other animals, albeit in an attenuated form, then it seems apparent that the material world itself must generate these traits through evolutionary, biological, and developmental processes.In sum, it seems that the older immaterial and ideational concept of culture, for all its virtues, holds a dangerous flaw at its core. Indeed, such an abstracted concept of humans and their sociocultural systems could probably have emerged only in the post–World War II era of material abundance when, for the first time, at least some humans could entertain the illusion that they were godlike creatures who created themselves and shaped a distinctly separate world as they willed. Ironically, an age of material abundance gave rise to what we might well term an age of immaterialism. Yet today, as we grapple with the hydra-headed threats of a warming planet, novel diseases, and other persistent material consequences of such misplaced human arrogance, it seems well past time to put these immaterialist illusions behind us and finally recognize and embrace the materiality of the human animal in all of its dimensions, the social and cultural as much as the physiological and environmental. That such a neo-materialist and deep cultural approach might finally begin to bridge the old divide between scientists and humanists would be a welcome, necessary, and long-overdue step forward as well.",

    "abstract": "When future scholars come to assess the humanities in our time, they will probably call it the age of buzzwords. Whereas previous generations of academics pledged allegiance to their intellectual heroes—Marx! Foucault!—that fervor seems to have shifted to catchy conceptual slogans. Anthropocene! Spatial Turn! New Materialism! Buzzwords dot conference papers and grant proposals, they ooze cognitive certainty, and those who chronicle our academic trajectory a few decades from now will surely wonder whether we really had a clear idea of what we were talking about. (Message to posterity: we were wondering about that, too.)Against this background, the guiding question of this roundtable is anything but tongue-in-cheek. The New Materialism is no longer a nascent intellectual current that has yet to reach conceptual maturity. We have a multitude of publications from a diverse and multidisciplinary group of scholars, and that provides us with fodder for a first assessment from the viewpoint of an empirically minded discipline. What are the approaches that matter for the historian's craft, and specifically for those who engage with the history of agriculture in one way or another? How does the New Materialism frame our understanding of topics, narratives, and intellectual goals? And what do we need to change in established readings, if anything? After all, agricultural history has never been nonmaterial because it's hard to imagine a nonmaterial agriculture—though a former Monsanto CEO once tried his best to suggest otherwise.The following interventions explore these questions with different case studies in mind and with different types of intellectual ambitions. Some scale the philosophical heights of the literature while others feel more comfortable with their feet on the ground (or, on a personal note, with their intellectual existence at sea). They engage with straw, ontology, and Robert Frost, among other things, and there is no obvious hierarchy. There is something unsettled and unrefined at the heart of the New Materialism debate, something that defies categorization and intellectual order. It is a bit like dealing with a monster that we thought was dormant for a long time—though monsters provide a poor metaphor owing to their inherent anthropomorphism. It would seem that, in engaging with the inherent power of the material, we are truly at the mercy of the elements.Going through these contributions and the literature that they survey, it seems that there is no obvious template for writing new materialist histories. There are a few paths that have been explored, there are recurring themes and challenges, but those who seek a checklist for their graduate seminars will come away disappointed. But maybe that is the entire point of engaging with the New Materialism? If matter really matters, we are reckoning with forces beyond our control, that lack a sense of human decency, and were around before the word. It is no small challenge to come to terms with forces of this kind. But if the following comments prove anything, it is that we need to try.This roundtable grew out of a session at the Agricultural History Society meeting in June 2021. Albert Way encouraged us to publish our views in the pages of Agricultural History and assured quick publication, though speed is a mixed blessing in academic endeavors and material flows alike. As you will see below, I had second thoughts about the circle of invitees when I penned my own comment. But even within the set boundaries, the following conversation may be inspiring and inconclusive in equal measure, and I trust that readers will find that an important insight in its own right. When it comes to the material, we are wrestling with a subversive force that will keep us on edge for the foreseeable future.",

From the initial stimulus of the American War of Independence to the boost created by the boll weevil outbreak in the 1920s, the fortunes of Australian cotton producers have been shaped by American history as much as their own nation's political and economic imperatives. Scientists and farmers relied on American experience, importing seed, knowledge, personnel, and technology. The global market reflected fluctuations in the US cotton industry and the demands of English cotton mills. Australia relied on the imports of the English cotton mills and an injection of funds by the British Cotton Growing Association (BCGA) in the 1920s to boost industry. While Australian politicians promoted cotton as a domestic economic and demographic stimulant, fulfilment of these nation-state objectives was deeply entangled with, and dependent on, those of America and England.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores how Swiss agronomists and farmers experienced, perceived, and interpreted the modernization of North American agriculture from the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries by examining a series of travel reports, correspondence, diaries, photographs, and film material that they produced about their study trips to the United States and Canada. These sources are an interesting point of departure for transnational perspectives in agricultural history; they reveal not only a great deal about the expectations, anxieties, perceptions, and prejudices that Swiss agriculturalists expressed in their encounter with agricultural institutions, economic mentalities, and farming practices on the other side of the Atlantic, but, in a much broader sense, also about the contested visions of agriculture in the age of industrial capitalism. The article examines how these visitors perceived and interpreted the patterns of agricultural modernization in the United States and Canada and how they comparatively embedded these observations in the epistemic paradigms shaped by their experiences at home. Furthermore, the article explores how the preoccupation with American agriculture and the transformation of knowledge, technology, and practices across the Atlantic shaped the patterns of change in agriculture in Switzerland.",

    "abstract": "Over the past several decades, efforts to move beyond nation-state- and metropole-centered narratives have generated a rich and diverse field of scholarship on borderlands and frontiers. At the height of globalization during the first two decades of this century, the trend in these studies was to dislodge the nation-state from its dominant position and highlight the persistence of borderlands as dynamic sites that expose the limits of the nation-state's reach and penetration into society.Yet in recent years, paralleling the resurgence of nationalism, the rise of neoliberal authoritarianism, and the increasing fixation on borders in reaction to waves of refugees fleeing war and social unrest, scholars working on borderlands have returned their gaze toward the metropole as a disappointingly enduring feature of life on both sides of the border. Studies on the Sino-Russian borderlands have used concepts such as Ed Pulford's Mirrorlands (2019) to discuss the historical remnants and mirages of cross-border continuities that have been disrupted by forces of national and imperial incorporation on opposing sides of the border.Sören Urbansky's elegantly written and magnificently researched study continues this trend. He argues, through nuanced analysis of interactions between local borderland communities and metropolitan state authorities, that the borderlands did indeed harden over time with the imposition on both sides of intensifying assimilative colonization, sedentary land use, collectivization, and nation-state surveillance and border control policies.Urbansky takes as his geographic focus the Argun region, where the borderlands of present-day Mongolia, Russia, and China meet. Looking back to the early modern period, Urbansky argues in chapter 1 that, as late as the first half of the nineteenth century, the “Sino-Russian border on the Argun was quite open: the river united the peoples on both shores rather than dividing them” (15). The official delineation of the border and cross-border trade in the so-called Kiakhta System restricted movement and trade in theory, but not on the ground. Moreover, despite the Russian state's immigration policies to Russify the frontier with ethnic Russian peasants and Cossacks (in contrast to Manchu policies that restricted Han Chinese immigration), the reality was that “Russian men and women were not colonizers in the sense of a national or civilizational mission. Instead, they had produced hybrid ethnic and cultural ‘quasi-indigenous’ affinities over time” (36).Even by the end of the nineteenth century, as Urbansky argues in chapter 2, the railroad-building projects intended for imperial penetration of the frontier largely failed to hinder or control movements of people and goods across the border, and in some cases they even had “a galvanizing effect” on the “contraband” circulation of goods such as alcohol and gold across the border (51–63). However, the author observes the gradual hardening of borders by the turn of the twentieth century, especially with more aggressive Qing efforts to incorporate Mongol pasturelands through economic policies and Han Chinese peasant settlement. He also uses the racialized response to the Manchurian epidemic in and around the border town of Manzhouli to describe the tensions between border openness and increasingly hardened imaginations of ethnic borders.In chapter 3, Urbansky makes skillful use of biographical case studies to highlight movements across the border and indigenous agency and resistance, facilitated by revolutions and the successive collapse of the Qing and Russian empires. He describes border towns like Manzhouli as “peculiar” places where competing radii of Russian, Chinese, and international extraterritorial sovereignty intersected, and he notes that the temporary impact of the Russian Revolution of 1917 “meant that commodities and people crossed the Sino-Russian border literally uncontrolled” (116–17).Yet, according to Urbansky's analysis in chapters 4 and 5, this cross-border fluidity was temporary. Soviet policies during the 1920s and 1930s were largely a continuation and intensification of czarist colonial ambitions in the region, with Soviet collectivization being “another name for forced resettlement, expulsion and denomadization of potentially disloyal people on the disappearing frontier” (143). Meanwhile, during the 1930s the constant threat of war between the Japanese state of Manchukuo and the Soviet Union triggered militarization of the border, including “the establishment of border zones, propaganda warfare, and ethnic as well as political cleansing campaigns,” which accelerated the transition of the region from frontier to borderland (151–52).In chapters 5 and 6, Urbansky argues that the political divide between the “honeymoon” period of Sino-Soviet friendship in the 1950s and the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s was not as evident when viewed from the borderland. In short, “relations between the metropoles warmed, whereas contacts in the borderlands chilled” (196–97). The further militarization, ethnic homogenization, and state incorporation of the borderland populations that took place during the 1960s were, from this perspective, an acceleration rather than disruption of ongoing trends in the hardening of borders.The author concludes with an acknowledgment of a new era of “informal cross-border contacts” and economic cooperation “zones created by local border people” that have accompanied the thawing of Sino-Soviet/Russian relations since the 1980s (252, 259–64). Yet he quells any overly optimistic view of these developments by noting the continuing importance of the border as a line of division restricting movement, exacerbated by emerging economic asymmetries between the two sides that are generating new borderland anxieties and suspicions.As nuanced as Urbansky's analysis is, and as attentive as he is to on-the-ground case studies that illuminate complex interactions between metropolitan state authorities and borderland people, the overall thrust and arc of his study tends to reinforce the narrative of open borderlands turning into closed nation-state borders that he purports to challenge and critique. This may simply reflect the disappointing historical reality that borderland mobilities did in fact become reduced and even eliminated by imperial and national states. One senses that Urbansky is trying to challenge a narrative of state supremacy and border hardening that his research findings affirm and reinforce.While his attention to detailed archival evidence and on-the-ground case studies is impressive and delightfully rich, more extensive and sustained conceptual engagement with the burgeoning field of scholarship on borderlands in general, and the Sino-Russian borderlands in particular, would have been helpful in sorting out and clarifying the significance of these complex tensions across different periods of time. Yet this study is a compelling intervention in the historical evolution of an important region that remains somewhat on the peripheries of scholarly attention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In 1937—one year after the Fascist “conquest” of Ethiopia—the Italian East African Empire was on the brink of an economic and food crisis. In order to feed the newborn empire's growing Italian population, Mussolini's regime launched a call for agricultural mobilization meant to rapidly make the empire self-sufficient in wheat, the main staple of the Italian population. This article analyzes the scientific foundations of the program of imperial “wheat autarky” and its materialization during the “wheat campaigns” between 1938 and 1941, particularly focusing on the introduction of and experimentation with hybrid wheat seeds in the Ethiopian highlands. The article shows the key role played by Italian agronomists and plant breeders in the framing and implementation of wheat autarky in the Fascist empire. Contrary to the historical emphasis of Fascist propaganda on the technological and human colonization of Ethiopia by Italian agriculture, the article also argues for the crucial position of indigenous farming within the colonial project of wheat development. Finally, Ethiopia's environments and its nonhuman actors became essential protagonists in the unfolding of these agricultural plans. The article makes the case for viewing wheat rust—a fungal plant disease—as a key component of the evolution and demise of the Italian occupation of Ethiopia.",

    "abstract": "Rural histories often explode onto city streets. In an excellent new book, K. Stephen Prince illustrates this phenomenon for the American South at the dawn of the twentieth century. The defiance of one rural migrant, a Black Mississippian named Robert Charles, convulsed New Orleans, Louisiana, and the New South's Jim Crow racial order in the summer of 1900. On July 23, Charles defended himself against members of the New Orleans Police Department who first attacked him with nightsticks and then attempted to arrest him. Over five days, Charles killed seven white men, including four policemen. In retaliation, white mobs indiscriminately killed at least six Black men and women, injuring countless more. White law enforcement proved indifferent to or incapable of protecting Black life and property despite the deputization of 1,500 citizen policemen.But Prince doesn't stop there. In admirably accessible prose suitable for graduate and undergraduate students, he has written “a book about the nature of historical inquiry” (9). The author waded into sources believing he could “write a concise, narrative history” of the New Orleans riot (7). He emerged from research less certain, deciding instead to focus on the construction of the event's historical record and legacy, the “silencing, forgetting, and erasure” at the heart of Jim Crow's archive (9). Prince signals a notable example in the book's title. In 1938, the jazz artist Jelly Roll Morton told Alan Lomax about the existence of a song about Robert Charles. “I once knew the Robert Charles song,” Morton says, “but I found it was best for me to forget it.” His reason? “This song was squashed very easily by the [police] department . . . due to the fact that it was a trouble breeder” (1). Even after Charles's death, Prince argues, the Jim Crow state imposed a “narrative inequality” by policing the memory of Black rebellion (9).Perhaps Prince's greatest innovation is the book's structure. After an introduction in which the author reviews relevant histories of Jim Crow, the carceral state, and Black life, comes a prologue where Prince sketches the New Orleans riot in its simplest terms. Five thematic chapters follow. In chapter 1, “Setting,” Prince recreates the spatial and racial geographies of Jim Crow New Orleans. “Silence,” chapter 2, focuses on the known and unknowable life of Robert Charles, from his agricultural roots to his paid position selling Black nationalist and African emigrationist literature amid the sounds of early jazz. Chapter 3, “Riot,” explores the mob disorder of July 1900 from three vantage points: “white rioters, black New Orleanians, and the city's political and economic elite” (89). Prince considers local and national meaning-making in the aftermath of the riot in chapter 4, “Reckoning,” before closing with chapter 5, “Remembrance.” Prince ends with an eight-page epilogue that reconsiders New Orleans's twentieth-century history of urban inequality and violence as a spectral memorial to the life and death of Robert Charles.Yet how urban was Robert Charles's New Orleans, anyway? Readers of Agricultural History might take special interest in Prince's interrogation of space. In chapter 1, we learn that unimproved swampland constituted much of today's Crescent City in 1900. Charles and other poor Black migrants alternately thrived and survived in the back of the town on the marshy periphery that became more important as racial segregation limited the mobility of Black residents through the so-called Metropolis of the South. Prince argues that Black New Orleans “served as the hub of a diasporic community, a way station in a cycle of internal migration . . . a migrant community” (47). This New Orleans was less cityscape than a constantly reconstituting shelter for refugees from the plantation regime.On the other hand, New Orleans's white elite imagined a capital of the industrial South. Like progressives elsewhere, they terraformed their city to marginalize the Black working classes necessary for the creation of white wealth. They deployed a police force to draw fictional lines between white and Black space. And on the night of July 23, 1900, Robert Charles was the reminder of segregation's folly. “The audacious act of being in the city,” Prince writes, “constituted . . . an affront to white supremacy” (53). The rural could be Black, not so the urban.Ultimately Prince urges us to scrutinize such hard boundaries: known/unknown, urban/rural, remembered/forgotten. His study of Robert Charles and the social upheaval attached to his name opens new directions for American and southern historians of police power and Black rebellion. He also offers a model of careful historical analysis of biography, place, and event. Readers will find few heroes or villains in his account, and fewer injunctions. Instead, The Ballad of Robert Charles seeks to understand the manifold violence necessary to maintain white supremacy in America.",

Out of these tensions emerged a field-based view of conservation that oscillated between hydrologists' teachings of rational management through irrigation and local dry farming practices that seemed to acknowledge the valley's limitations—all in a futile effort to make the land faithful to an agri-spiritual aesthetic that persuaded scientists and farmers alike to rebuild District No. 1 over and over again. From debates about whose expertise to follow to economic devastation from illicit dealings of dubious financiers and unruly environmental conditions, the saga of Cache County Water Conservation District No. 1 reveals an irrigated rural western landscape that was as unpredictable as it was inescapable.",

    "abstract": "Frederico Freitas's Nationalizing Nature is the first environmental history of Brazil and Argentina's adjacent Iguazu Falls national parks, which together preserve around 240,000 hectares of old-growth forest surrounding one of the world's most iconic waterfalls. The protected forestland is among the last stands of the Atlantic Forest, which has been almost entirely cleared by farmers, loggers, and urban developers; between the 1950s and 1980s, most of the forest surrounding the national parks became farmland and cities. The book's time frame begins with the creation of both national parks in the 1930s and ends in the 1980s, when both parks earned UNESCO World Heritage Site designation.The book's biggest contributions are to the environmental history literature on conservation and national parks in Latin America and elsewhere, and agriculture is not the book's principal focus. Nevertheless, agricultural historians may find value in reading about the preservation of a large tract of old-growth forest in a region that was otherwise completely transformed by farmers.The book is organized around three arguments. The first is that both the Argentinian and Brazilian governments created national parks at Iguazu Falls in the 1930s to stimulate a tourist economy that would bring people and resources to a contested borderland. In a time of heightened nationalism, both countries worried that an underpopulated border would be vulnerable to foreign influence and encroachment. The book's first two chapters address this argument, which is a novel addition to the list of reasons that governments in the Western Hemisphere have created national parks. Although both Brazil and Argentina were loosely inspired by the US example, both governments amended that model to create parks that would help populate the borderlands.Second, starting in the 1960s, both governments began to see their national parks as useful for environmental preservation, and they began emptying their Iguazu parks of the people who had, both legally and illegally, settled inside the parks in the preceding decades. Changes in both park administration leadership and the international consensus on national parks helped engender this reorientation in priorities.Chapters 3 through 5 address this argument, which adds further evidence to environmental historians' long-standing assertion that unpopulated wilderness areas are cultural constructions (and therefore not natural spaces after all) because they require continual efforts to keep people out. One notable distinction in Freitas's account is that most of those displaced during the depopulation of the Iguazu national parks were recent immigrants from elsewhere in Brazil and Argentina, and not Indigenous communities. In the 2000s and 2010s, anthropologists recorded interviews with local Guarani that confirmed that there were at least two small Indigenous settlements near Iguazu Falls when the parks were created (one was violently destroyed in the 1930s–1940s, the other in the 1960s), but Freitas otherwise found no textual or archaeological evidence of Indigenous people living in the area during the early twentieth century, though Indigenous people did live in the area in past centuries.The final argument, covered in the sixth chapter, is that both Iguazu national parks have successfully preserved one of the largest remaining tracts of the Atlantic forest against the onslaught of deforestation that swept through the region during the second half of the twentieth century. Thus, an unintended consequence of heightened nationalism and national security concerns at the borderland in the 1930s was the creation of two adjacent national parks that both the Brazilian and Argentinian governments later reinvigorated and used to protect the forest.Freitas supports these arguments with a strong source base, consulting more than forty libraries and archives throughout Brazil and Argentina, including the repositories of the government agencies in charge of the parks on both sides of the border. Freitas supplements the documentary evidence found in these collections with interviews with park administrators and other important figures, as well as satellite imagery.The book is written for audiences familiar with Brazilian and Argentinian history. It is missing important background information that would make its nuances more accessible to a broader readership with little prior knowledge on the subject. For example, when discussing the evictions in the Brazilian park in the 1970s, Freitas describes the authoritarian spirit of the era with a shorthand reference to one of the 1964–85 military regime's most repressive ordinances, but the act is not explained anywhere in the text. This shortcoming is minor, and the book has many strengths that offset it. The writing is otherwise solid, the subject is compelling, and the research is superb.One additional strength that scholars will appreciate is Freitas's effort to situate the story of these two adjacent national parks within its regional and global context. He does this best when discussing the global trend toward depopulated national parks in the 1960s and the relationship between Argentinian environmentalists and international forums on national parks. Freitas could do more still to elaborate on the global context (for example, Eurasia is mostly absent), though his footnotes provide ample references for readers curious about national parks elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "The Wizard and the Prophet explores the central question plaguing agriculture and conservation today: what should be humankind's role in sustaining both the planet and our own species? While considering how to feed tomorrow's world, Charles Mann provides historical scaffolding for understanding a suite of modern environmental crises by creating a spectrum for environmental solutions bound by the poles of techno-optimism and ecopessimism. Cleverly labeling these poles as the Wizard and the Prophet, Mann distinguishes how the Wizard relies on technological innovation to surpass environmental limits, whereas the Prophet prioritizes respecting ecological constraints. In doing so, Mann distills a multitude of complex issues into a simple framework while transcending the dichotomy of environmental despair and technocentric panaceas. The end product is an illustrative framework that applies nuanced lessons of history to inform solutions for tomorrow.The book is broadly organized into sections about the past, present, and future. To begin, Mann constructs the Wizard and Prophet framework by positioning the lives of Norman Borlaug and William Vogt as bookends of the continuum. Subsequently, their biographies play out within the modern context of global food production, drinking water, energy supply, and climate change crises. Vogt, the exemplar Prophet, was the founder of “apocalyptic environmentalism” whose influential first book, Road to Survival (1948), advocated reducing human impact to prevent global catastrophe (5, 85). By contrast, Borlaug, the archetypal Wizard, argued that human ingenuity could outpace environmental constraints and promoted Green Revolution methods that increased agricultural yields around the globe. Due to their divergent approaches, Wizards critiqued Vogt's Prophets as “Luddites” who found solutions in moving backward, while Borlaug's Wizards were criticized as deluded reductionist engineers. Despite their differences, Mann points out the aptness of the continuum by stating that both men “thought of themselves as environmentalists facing an environmental crisis” (6). To conclude, Mann revisits each of the four modern environmental crises and considers how Vogt and Borlaug might envision their potential solutions and any unintended consequences.In validating both the Wizard and Prophet perspectives, Mann underscores a prominent theme of the book: transcending dichotomy. Demonstrating his own nonbinary thinking, Mann avoids reducing either perspective to a monolithic villain or hero and acknowledges complex trade-offs in both approaches. An additional theme Mann employs is the imagery of the petri dish, which he uses to juxtapose the power of the human mind with the vulnerability of the human experience. He alludes to humanity's ability to drive the experiment in terms of science and engineering, writing of Borlaug and Vogt as “shouting from the edge of the petri dish” as they attempted to defy the natural laws of species survival and avoid human collapse (36). Conversely, he acknowledges humanity's struggle for survival by portraying humans as part of the experiment, referring to us as a “briefly successful species” akin to protozoa in a petri dish or fruit flies in a jar (27). By placing humans in the position of both experimenters and experiment, he emphasizes our precarious position on this planet. Embracing the duality of human value and futility is yet another way Mann helps the reader explore future uncertainties without resorting to binary thinking.Overall, Mann succeeds in crafting a narrative both particular and personal, yet universal. He writes a salient message framed by a pressing personal concern for his children and broader concern for the future of our planet. However, the book's main flaw is a conflation of Wizard technology with capitalist principles. For example, the Haber-Bosch process was used to manipulate the environment for economic gain without regard for ensuing externalities. This demonstrates how Wizard solutions tend to violate ecological limits when driven by capitalism. In contrast, when Vogt was tasked with maximizing Peruvian guano production, he opted to conserve a balanced avian population and respect the limits of the resource. By failing to illustrate how Wizard engineering could also comply with ecological bounds and evade capitalistic co-optation, Mann misses an important opportunity to present the possibility of an ecological Wizard in the middle of the continuum.In conclusion, Mann has crafted a narrative that reads as sage historical commentary on modern environmental crises. His writing spans the breadth of human futility and ingenuity, reaches the heights of engineering and depths of environmental grief, and considers the fate of a species so successful it may cause its own demise. Rejecting the false notion that we must choose between the Prophet's grief or the Wizard's hubris, Mann bravely asks what a synthesis of techno-optimism and ecopessimism might look like. In doing so, Mann surpasses the Wizard's “Can we?” and the Prophet's “Should we?” to explore the gray ethical territory of reaching beyond our limits and respecting our bounds. Mann initially stated that this is “a book about the future that makes no predictions” (12). While Mann offers no solutions, perhaps his commitment to a book without answers is in itself a solution: promoting a narrative that centers mutual understanding and creative discourse.",

    "abstract": "Mark Wetherington's entry in the Rowman and Littlefield American Ways series joins a growing list of titles by acknowledged experts introducing students and general readers to critical topics in American history that impinge on current issues of our day. That agriculture has been included alongside treatments of such high-visibility issues as racism, immigration, the radical Right, and environmental activism speaks volumes about the importance attached to farming and food by a broad swath of American society.Wetherington takes a comprehensive approach, tracing developments in American agriculture from the origins of Indigenous farming systems through twenty-first-century agricultural structures and their implications for the future. He unifies this long chronological sweep using the tripartite theme of “control, consolidation, and chemicals” to characterize the processes that have led to the current structure of American agriculture—the farm families to agribusiness transition described in the book's title.An introductory chapter lays out the overlapping angles encompassed by the three elements of his theme and how they apply to the progression documented in the book's eight chapters. Those chapters then build a narrative of Indigenous agriculture, antebellum European agriculture and its regional development in the North and South, the impacts of the Civil War and postwar national physical and market expansion, and the economic and technological transformation of agriculture through war, depression, and globalization in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In keeping with the intentions of the American Ways series, Wetherington brings attention to issues of diversity, and highlights the experiences of American farming among women, racial and ethnic minorities, small-scale producers, farm laborers, and others who often found themselves outsiders in the transformation to the dominant agribusiness model. He also focuses on the sectional diversity of American agriculture, demonstrating social, cultural, geographic, and agronomic differences and their intersections with political and economic developments in the nation's history.The presentation is a mix of narrative and essay that paints a very particular vision of US agricultural development; Wetherington makes no secret of his indictment of the current structure of US agriculture. Farming systems and farm policy have become subjects that evoke passionate views linked to agriculture's entanglement with Indigenous displacement, enslavement and other labor abuses, environmental damage and climate change, the rise of capitalism, and inequities in global food systems. Without question this litany of negatives reflects historical realities of US agriculture, realities that must be documented and understood, particularly where they reveal entrenched discrimination and exploitation.Yet the narrative also conveys a sense of conspiracy, suggesting a coordinated and linear effort by government and agricultural business interests to create the current conditions of American, and even global, agriculture. That perspective telescopes a breadth of political and economic change, particularly as the narrative moves into the mid-twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and erases the complex interplay of individual choices and events that can help readers contextualize the processes that have led to current conditions. It also juxtaposes ideas and events to imply links and motivations that on closer inspection would reveal complicated and even contradictory trends. For example, the occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge by activist ranchers in 2016 is presented as an action in support of local control of grazing rights without noting the connection between that position and the resistance to efforts by federal land agencies to reduce environmental damage through stricter grazing land management.Similarly, Wetherington constructs his presentation of agricultural and trade policy in the final chapters of the book to build a case for wholesale policy change and a return to smaller-scale agriculture in the twenty-first century. One need not disagree with that ideal to wish that the narrative included a more nuanced explanation of the Farm Bill and trade agreements, especially the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and their influence on structural change in American agriculture, as well as more clarity on the sources and interpretation of the many statistics employed to make that case.Wetherington's focus on the dispossessed in American agricultural development provides an important perspective for general readers and students, one that is welcome and not often given such comprehensive attention in a broad survey. But general readers, and those who wish to use the book with students, should plan on supplementing the latter chapters with additional sources on the agricultural policies of the last century and their influence on the transformation of American agriculture since the New Deal.",

    "abstract": "“Would the United States appear different if the nation's iconic animal was a chicken or sheep, rather than a cow? What would happen to the nation's cowboy image if that figure was, instead, a shepherd?” (238). It is not a surprise that Kathryn Cornell Dolan would end her latest exploration of American literature with this counterfactual thought experiment. Dolan has a penchant for deep readings and thick analyses of well-worn historical works. At the risk of anachronism, she challenges readers to extend the tradition of US critical food scholarship back to nineteenth- and early twentieth-century thinkers. Dolan's analysis may not change the historiography of American agriculture, but her inventive readings offer interpretive possibilities for historians interested in cultural meanings tied to food production and nation building.Dolan's ecocritical food studies perspective follows from her earlier work, Beyond the Fruited Plain (2014), which examined writings from the popular American canon, selecting works that explicitly criticized the spread of intensive agriculture during the nineteenth century. In Cattle Country she digs deeper into less agriculture-focused writings, many of which were not as popular as those in Beyond the Fruited Plain, to tease out less direct criticisms of increasingly industrialized food production. Dolan also extends her scope beyond the predominantly white male writers that took most of the space in her previous work. The addition of a critical race perspective lends itself to diverse cultural imaginations of the expansion of cattle grazing. By focusing on “the interaction of cattle, the U.S. farmer, the people of color who inhabit the land, and the land itself,” Dolan brings together a diverse collection of works from wide-ranging authors to help historicize concepts such as food justice and food sovereignty (12).Cattle Country is organized chronologically. Each chapter is generally dedicated to one author and focused on one or two of their works. Dolan leads off with Washington Irving's frontier boosterism, juxtaposing his personal accounts of 1830s Indian Country with a couple of James Fenimore Cooper's fictional Leatherstocking Tales in the next chapter. Cooper's stories, argues Dolan, are a denunciation of white squatters' rights to agricultural expansion. This comparison constructs a dialectical argument that holds together the book, namely that the Anglo-European culture of beef production and consumption stood in opposition to more sustainable, usually Indigenous, subsistence knowledge based on bison, small-scale production of chickens and pigs, and even, in the case of Henry David Thoreau's local food musings, giant clams.Both Irving's and Cooper's writings introduce a Native American thread running throughout Dolan's work wherein writers reflect and construct varying imaginations of the American Indian in relation to cattle production. For Thoreau, whose work is segued by Susan Fenimore Cooper's Rural Hours, which Dolan considers foundational for modern nature writers such as Aldo Leopold and Annie Dillard, local knowledge of foodways is explored and venerated with a Penobscot guide in Maine during a moose hunt where he uncharacteristically eats meat. Yet the juxtaposition of Thoreau's thickly described local food forays with a handful of mostly peripheral references to the effects of cattle on Cape Cod was not strongly convincing. The chapters on Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins and María Amparo Ruiz de Burton, on the other hand, offer compelling evidence for the place of cattle and Indigenous people in the American imagination.Winnemucca's Life among the Piutes explicitly blames the 1880s cattle boom for the destruction of her people's foodways, during which settler colonialism not only displaced her people, but destroyed their entire foodshed. As Dolan points out, one can draw a direct line between Winnemucca's historical writings of resistance and current Indigenous food sovereignty organizations. Indeed, of all the writers she explores, Winnemucca brings the most nuanced perspective of western cattle expansion and Dolan astutely connects her critical literature with “resistance culture” leaders of the late nineteenth century such as Wovoka and Sitting Bull.Whereas Winnemucca shows how cattle culture dehumanized the Paiutes, Burton's novel The Squatter and the Don valorizes the vaqueros. Although explicitly racist toward the Diegueño (Kumeyaay), Burton inadvertently describes possibly one of the most iconic representations of the American cowboy. Dolan also convincingly reads Burton as an early version of mestizaje transnational literature where Anglo-European settlers drove the Californio/a ranchers from their land.The inclusion of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and Winnifred Eaton's The Cattle also fits well into the oppositional framework of large-scale beef production against marginalized communities and other more sustainable methods (Sinclair's promotion of socialized, industrial agriculture is redeemed by his later “rice diet”). However, the chapter on Charles Chesnutt's Conjure Stories, which relies on oblique references to cattle, felt strained. This is unfortunate, leaving the reader wondering why the Black cowboy was conspicuously absent. Overall, though, Dolan's work gives American agricultural historians much to ponder when thinking about settler colonialism, race, gender, and the nonhuman world.This book would be a welcome addition to undergraduate general education courses on a wide range of subjects, from food history to philosophical ideas of nature and political concepts of nation building. Moreover, reading works like this encourages professional historians to take fresh and innovative looks at popular literature as important primary sources. I know Dolan broadened my own imaginations of the American West and the role of cattle, and I was encouraged to pick up some of these works and either read them with a new lens or discover them for the first time.",

    "abstract": "This is an extraordinary and timely study of both the history and contemporary circumstances concerning the African oil palm in Brazil, where enslaved Africans and their descendants applied ancestral knowledges of dendê (the Afro-Brazilian term for palm oil) to create Bahia's agroecologies of resistance, subsistence economies, and distinct cultures. In Palm Oil Diaspora, Case Watkins makes novel theoretical and empirical contributions to the rich historical scholarship on the circulation of plants, peoples, and African knowledge systems in the making of the Atlantic World. He demonstrates how the transatlantic transfer of African oil palm marked not simply the movement of an important crop across the Atlantic and the relocation of cultures, but also led to the growth of sustainable agroforest landscapes and a subaltern Afro-Brazilian dendê economy that still exists today.Watkins's innovative methodology draws on archival materials, ethnographic sources, geospatial mapping, and statistical data to analyze the complex relationships between Black communities, socio-environments, and power. He also bridges literatures on Black geographies, Afro-Brazilian and Atlantic studies, political ecology, and decolonial theory and praxis to examine the power and potential of Bahia's Afro-Brazilian dendê economy. The author interprets Brazilian landscapes to bring to light very human stories of Afro-descendant ingenuity and resilience. One of the most intriguing of these stories is that of Benta, a woman born into Brazilian slavery in the eighteenth century. By cultivating African oil palm with other food crops on provision grounds, Benta improved her conditions and participated in socioecological resistance or cultural-environmental change—that is, patterning polyculture landscapes to counter colonial monoculture plantations.As the title suggests, Watkins argues that the Bahian oil palm landscapes and economies are largely the result of Afro-Brazilian agency, creativity, and resistance. Enslaved Africans and their descendants are recognized here as environmental agents responsible for the proliferation of dendezeiros or African palm groves, contrary to the colonial canon that disparages the agricultural skills of Afro-descendants. For centuries, they transferred, adapted, and blended botanical species to create biodiverse palm groves, which were illegible to authorities. They also carved out an economy of subsistence—a complex system of cultural, ecological, and economic reproduction. Even in the 1960s, when the military dictatorship backed hybrid oil palm plantations that threatened to replace African oil palm landscapes and displace the dendê economy, Afro-Brazilian smallholders adopted new technologies to transform their production processes in ways that defied the predictions of state agronomists. They continued to produce dendê for the culinary and cultural markets, both of which became central to Afro-Bahian identities. Despite the economic potential of these markets, Watkins argues that governments have consistently refused to invest in the Afro-Brazilian dendê economy because they prefer plantation-style monocultures as the model for modern agricultural development and because of anti-Black racism that has long permeated state institutions.The book is clearly written, very well structured, and consists of seven chapters plus an epilogue. The introductory chapter outlines the book's arguments and positions them in relation to broad debates, before introducing key concepts and the Bahia case study. The rest of the chapters are arranged chronologically. In chapter 2 through chapter 4, Watkins analyzes the entangled history of landscapes, cultures, and economies linking Africa and its diaspora in Brazil. He traces palm oil from its emergence in western Africa to biodiverse groves and cultures in northeast Brazil. During the transition from slavery to legitimate trade, the Bahian capital Salvador became the Atlantic hub for the transshipments of African palm oil in the South Atlantic as chapter 5 lays out. Chapter 6 examines how those transatlantic exchanges intensified demand for domestically produced dendê and led to the expansion of dendezeiros in nineteenth-century Bahia. By the early twentieth century, the government had recognized the profitability of palm oil production and imposed a top-down modernist agroindustrial campaign. Chapter 7 is an insightful account of the public-private collaborative development of dendê monoculture plantations, resulting in the downgrading of the Afro-Brazilian dendê economy by the mid-twentieth century.One of the key strengths of Palm Oil Diaspora is how Watkins carefully interprets recent national agrarian censuses to illustrate the continuing invisibility of Afro-Brazilian dendê production. He argues that the exclusion of Bahia's small-scale dendê producers from official datasets is by design, denying their economic value and agricultural contributions. As long as they are invisible in public datasets, they are also barred from most forms of public support. However, a curious omission in the book is an account of the economic importance of the dendê economy to Afro-Bahian livelihoods and Black communities today. In the epilogue, Watkins suggests that dendê production is economically significant for these communities, but provides no data to support that position. This omission notwithstanding, Palm Oil Diaspora is a rich and rigorous study that offers fresh perspectives on how we understand dendê landscapes, the role of Afro-Brazilian agency, and agrarian development in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "Like many young North Dakotans, Sarah Vogel left her very rural home state in 1967 in search of new opportunities and the excitement of life in the big city. As Vogel points out, the “rather sad joke” was true: “North Dakota's greatest export was its young people” (19). And like a substantial portion of those human exports, after a few years of pursuing her dreams and climbing career ladders Vogel found herself returning to the Northern Plains, joining the family business, and even (briefly) moving into her parents' basement.But if most North Dakotans' family business was farming, the Vogel family business was fighting for farmers legally and politically. Sarah's grandfather, Frank A. Vogel, was a state tax commissioner, manager of the state-owned Bank of North Dakota (created in 1919 to increase access to credit in order to promote agriculture and commerce in the state), and chief political adviser to Governor William Langer. Her father, Robert Vogel, was a state's attorney during Sarah's childhood, and later served on the North Dakota Supreme Court. Sarah eagerly fled the very small world of North Dakota law and politics after graduating from the University of North Dakota in 1967, attending law school at New York University and launching a career at the Federal Trade Commission. But sympathy for the plight of struggling farmers ultimately brought her back to her home state. She sacrificed her home and career to save North Dakota farmers during the 1980s Farm Crisis. In her riveting memoir The Farmer's Lawyer, Vogel vividly recounts her efforts as a young, broke single mother to defend North Dakota farmers, which she ultimately transformed into a massive class action lawsuit that protected 240,000 family farms from foreclosure nationwide.The Farmer's Lawyer is structured like a legal thriller in the style of a John Grisham novel (indeed, Grisham commented on a draft of Vogel's manuscript).1 It recounts Vogel's legal battle to prevent the federal government from foreclosing on thousands of family farms in North Dakota at the height of the 1980s Farm Crisis. Like her clients, the young single mother found herself drowning in debt and facing foreclosure as she built a national class action lawsuit against the Ronald Reagan administration's Department of Justice. She describes the struggles of individual farmers facing the loss of their livelihoods and homes at the hands of the government agency created to help them in hard times. She shares her personal economic failings and her professional stumbles as she struggled to build her first case—a legal battle with profound implications for struggling family farmers across the country.Throughout her tale of fighting the power of the federal government on behalf of farmers, Vogel intersperses personal memories that reveal why she took on and persisted in this David versus Goliath effort. Vogel's father and grandfather raised her to be sympathetic to the plight of North Dakota farmers. Both men were die-hard Nonpartisan Leaguers—indeed, Vogel calls it her family's religion (17). She also interjects helpful brief histories of farm policy in North Dakota. The Nonpartisan League (NPL) was a progressive movement that sought to protect farmers' interests against the economic and political dominance of railroads, Minnesota millers, and other business interests. The NPL became a dominant force in the Northern Plains, and particularly North Dakota, during and following World War I. Under its influence, North Dakota established the nation's only state-owned flour mill (offered as an alternative to Minneapolis millers whom NPLers accused of undervaluing North Dakota wheat) and the state bank Vogel's grandfather managed. And as the Dust Bowl struck in the 1930s, NPLers fought to defend farmers against land foreclosures and embraced federal New Deal policies that aimed to help those farmers.Sarah Vogel recalls growing up surrounded by “the lessons of the 1930s,” believing that the government had a responsibility to defend farmers' land and other property from foreclosure, and “that lenders who cracked down on farmers during tough times were on the wrong side” (17). Those lessons would transform her professional and personal trajectory, drawing her away from a promising career in federal service in the nation's capital to enter private practice back in North Dakota in the midst of a new farm crisis in the early 1980s, representing farmers who couldn't afford to pay her.The farmers who sought Sarah Vogel's help faced losing land or livestock due to hardships compounded by the loan policies of the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA). FmHA's roots lay in the New Deal's Resettlement Administration (soon rebranded the Farm Security Administration). FmHA provided farm and housing loans to low-income farmers and rural residents who could not qualify for credit from private lenders. According to Vogel, the original loan programs in the 1930s provided hands-on supervision and advice to borrowers about effective management of their crops, livestock, and home production. County supervisors helped farmers develop farming and repayment plans. If a farmer became delinquent on loan repayment, the supervisor would examine the reasons for the delinquency. In cases of drought, flood, or other hardships, the supervisor could choose to carry the loan over until the next crop came in, or to rewrite the loan, folding the missed payments into a new loan. Vogel suggests that these county supervisors were inclined to be lenient toward farmers, working with them to help them get back on their feet (53–54).By the 1970s, Vogel argues, those paternalistic relations between county supervisor and borrowers had faded, but FmHA regulations and procedures persisted in granting county supervisors much broader powers over borrowers' finances than were typical in private commercial lending. As agricultural land prices skyrocketed in the 1970s, FmHA enabled young farmers to get started by providing low-interest loans. But the combination of paternalistic reach and supervisors' increasingly bureaucratic management styles proved dangerous to farmers when hardships struck in the early 1980s. Each year there were farmers who were late or overdue on payments, often due to poor weather. FmHA's delinquency rate rose as more and more farmers struggled in the early 1980s.Vogel argues that the Reagan administration contributed significantly to the growing Farm Crisis by instituting massive budget cuts to the US Department of Agriculture, including FmHA. In its August 1981 Administrative Notice 580, FmHA set goals for each state director to reduce their delinquencies by about 23 percent within seven months. Farmers who were behind on their loan payments could not produce more crops or livestock in winter 1982 to meet the March 31 deadline (62). Farmers had borrowed from FmHA because they faced high land prices, low sale prices, and natural disasters. They now found themselves unable to meet their financial obligations to FmHA—and many who managed to find resources to pay sped-up repayment schedules on their loans were left with no money for food and other essentials, contrary to FmHA policy. Facing threats of foreclosure from the lender of last resort, they had nowhere else to turn. They turned to Sarah Vogel.For example, young farmers Don and Diane McCabe borrowed money from FmHA in 1977 so that they could establish a farmstead near her aging father. FmHA allowed them funds to purchase 320 acres at the decade's high land prices, plus operating expenses such as seed and feed. But FmHA refused to lend them money to construct a pole barn to shelter their cows. As a result, seven froze in one night during their first winter. Natural disasters the next three years—hail in 1978 and drought in 1979 and 1980—prevented them from growing sufficient feed for their cattle. As their cows aged they produced less milk, but the FmHA county director would not let them buy younger cows nor keep heifer calves to raise to milking age. Their herd dropped from fifty-two to twenty-seven, leaving the McCabes unable to produce enough milk to repay their loans. FmHA took 50 percent of their dairy income, leaving them struggling to afford feed and electricity to milk their cows, and nothing for family living expenses. They took out a private bank loan to meet their basic expenses, which took the other half of their milk income. They did not know that they were entitled to prioritize family living expenses, nor that they were entitled to apply for a deferral in loan payments due to circumstances beyond their control. The FmHA office pressured them to sell their land and cows. The McCabes kept their herd alive by cutting grass in ditches and exchanging work with neighbors for hay, but they had nothing left to feed themselves, let alone pay a lawyer. Yet their courage inspired Vogel to persist through her own poverty.Throughout The Farmer's Lawyer Vogel explores tensions and challenges related to her unique status as both an insider and an outsider. She had grown up in North Dakota, and her family's roots in the state dated back to about 1909. But her father was an attorney and her grandfather a politician and bank manager; their family had lived in town. As Vogel observes about some of her first clients, “We spoke different languages. While they'd been learning about agriculture and self-reliance since they were young, I'd been studying political science, history, and English, and my family got all our food from the grocery store. I knew more about conditions for farmers during the 1930s than I did about what farmers were facing in the early '80s” (51). Vogel learned about agriculture from her clients; she taught herself legal bases for challenging the FmHA's foreclosures and loan accelerations through frantic legal research. The plight of her lead plaintiffs—whom the judge in her case dubbed the North Dakota Nine—stood in for 8,400 farmers in North Dakota, and eventually 240,000 nationwide in the lawsuit that became known as Coleman v. Block.Vogel's memoir offers important insights into the realities of the 1980s Farm Crisis. The Farmer's Lawyer paints an intimate portrait of the Farm Crisis by recounting in detail the struggles of farming families that became her clients. Through their stories, Vogel reveals the conjunction of factors contributing to that crisis: droughts, hailstorms, rising land and production costs, and falling agricultural prices. She details their individual strategies to survive in the face of the worst conditions since the Dust Bowl.Vogel clients Russel and Anna Mae Folmer had initially been a success story. FmHA loans enabled them to start out in the 1950s, and thanks to their hard work and high prices for agricultural products, they were able to move their growing family from a three-room shack into a “real” house and pay off their FmHA loans by the early 1970s. Russel even won a county Soil Conservation Award. But new loans taken in 1978 to modernize the dairy proved disastrous, because those modernization efforts were followed by three years of drought: “‘In '79, I didn't even take the combine out of the shed,’ Russel said” (106). Meanwhile, milk prices dropped. Their income decreased due to the cost-price squeeze all farmers faced in the late 1970s and early 1980s, leaving them unable to repay their debts. Meanwhile, ranching families in western North Dakota and Montana faced a similar collision of rising costs, falling prices, and natural disasters that destroyed their cattle or hogs. FmHA policies and procedures exacerbated these natural and economic disasters.Perhaps the greatest contribution The Farmer's Lawyer makes to scholarship on the Farm Crisis is what Vogel's cases reveal about the ways that government policies and practices helped transform the intersection of high costs, low prices, and weather challenges into a nationwide Farm Crisis. Vogel uncovers the disastrous effects of federal policies that aggravated those conditions and undermined farmers' survival strategies. Through the legal arguments and individual narratives she recounts in this book, Vogel makes a compelling case that the US Department of Agriculture's budget cuts and FmHA administrators' failure to fairly respond to farmers' struggles to repay loans amid mounting hardships substantially worsened those struggles. Indeed, The Farmer's Lawyer points to federal policy and state and local bureaucratic failures as key causes of the growing Farm Crisis. Vogel argues that Administrative Notice 580—the so-called Foreclosure Quota Memo, which directed state FmHA offices to significantly reduce the number of delinquent loans on their books in winter 1981–82—“triggered the '80s farm crisis in the same way the stock market crash in 1929 triggered the Great Depression” (63).Vogel also demonstrates that harmful and unfair FmHA practices at the state and county level made a bad situation even worse. County directors delayed disbursing funds, preventing dairy farmers from replacing elderly cows, as we have seen, and refusing to allow ranchers to purchase livestock in time to fatten them for slaughter during the summer months. County offices ignored FmHA policies that were supposed to prioritize family living expenses. “FmHA's playbook for getting farmers to ‘voluntarily liquidate’ was to first take away the farmer's means of earning a living by forcing the sale of livestock and machinery, and then—after the farmer was stripped of earning potential—to force a sale of the land” (177). They denied farmers due process through a “deeply flawed appeals system” (147) in which county supervisors both decided to accelerate debts and served as appeal officers if borrowers appealed their debt acceleration (266).Perhaps not surprisingly, Vogel's memoir focuses on the plight of white family farmers. Only late in the process of building those individual farmers' stories into a class-action lawsuit did Vogel recognize that Native American farmers also were falling victim to unfair FmHA practices and seek out a Native couple to serve as named plaintiffs. That Indigenous farmers did not reach out to Vogel as white farmers did highlights persistent racial divisions in the state and significant barriers to peoples of color seeking legal redress. Vogel eventually recognized that Native farmers were more likely to seek help from their tribal government than from a white lawyer. They were not members of the farm organizations nor did they frequent the coffee shops where word spread about Vogel's advocacy.Native people's limited role in Vogel's case and in her memoir highlights the persistent divisions between settler-descended and Indigenous North Dakotans. Vogel points out the racism of Odell Ottmar, the white FmHA district director responsible for lands of the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation who insisted on calling himself a district “chief” (119). She recounts compellingly the devastation wrought by the construction of Garrison Dam, which formed Lake Sakakawea and flooded one quarter of the Fort Berthold Reservation, destroying 94 percent of the fertile bottomlands and producing a legacy of unemployment, poverty, and health crises for the Three Affiliated Tribes—the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara, who had farmed those bottomlands for centuries (195–96). And she rightly calls out FmHA's North Dakota state director who insisted that his Norwegian homesteading ancestors succeeded through hard work and frugality while ignoring that they had received their land as a handout from the federal government. But Vogel could have done more to highlight that the federal government had taken those lands from Indigenous peoples—and then pressured Native Americans to adopt Euro-American farming practices on lands it deemed inadequate to support white farmers. Here and elsewhere she misses opportunities to explore more fully the legacies of settler colonialism that allowed and continue to allow white farmers to claim sections of the North Dakota landscape as theirs to lose. Her focus on attitudes toward and policies about federal largesse downplays the dispossession of Indigenous persons on which American farm culture was built.Vogel offers convincing evidence of her clients' hard work and good-willed efforts to do right by their livestock and their land. Her career since that 1984 lawsuit bears witness to her commitment to promoting greater government efforts to shore up family farms in the face of great hardships. Vogel frames her tale of the 1980s Farm Crisis with brief discussions of contemporary conditions for farming that, as she points out, bear striking resemblance to these earlier crises. In fact, she characterizes conditions today as even worse than those of the 1930s or 1980s, coexisting with climate change, food insecurity, and the COVID-19 pandemic. She argues that farmers like the North Dakota Nine would not have a prayer in today's economy, but that we need farmers like them to combat global warming, provide healthy food, and improve land and communities. Scholars such as Shane Hamilton, Monica Gisolfi, Margaret Weber, David Vail, and many others have demonstrated the devastating effects of agribusiness on the environment and rural communities. The Farmer's Lawyer makes an emotional case for better government policies and practices to protect American family farms for the good of us all.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture's Energy is Thomas Rogers's deeply researched and pathbreaking follow-up to his earlier book The Deepest Wounds: A Labor and Environmental History of Sugar in Northeastern Brazil (2009). Like The Deepest Wounds, Agriculture's Energy centers around labor and environment, but this book adds a new region (São Paulo) and a new set of protagonists to the northeastern landowners, agronomists, and workers featured in The Deepest Wounds. In Agriculture's Energy, we meet the policymakers and agribusiness(men), intellectuals, labor leaders, and environmentalists who advocated for, or fought against, the expansion of sugarcane plantings and ethanol production in Brazil from the end of World War I to the present. The book places into comparative international context Brazil's embrace of agricultural modernization and grounds Brazil's version of the Green Revolution in local, historical detail, complimenting wonderfully Jennifer Eaglin's new Sweet Fuel: A Political and Environmental History of Brazilian Ethanol (2022). While in other parts of the world, seed selection, fertilizers, and irrigation techniques ostensibly aimed to feed more people with corn, wheat, and rice, in the Brazilian case, proponents of the Green Revolution aimed to expand the production of a fuel—ethanol—derived from sugarcane.The first three narrative chapters demonstrate that as the Brazilian state became more robust—first, through the Great Depression and \"New State\" (1937–45) years, and then during the military dictatorships of 1964 to 1985—agricultural projects became increasingly ambitious, profoundly impacting Brazilian society and the environment. The last three chapters are organized thematically, highlighting the consequences that the Green Revolution's technological and chemical \"package\" had on labor relations, the environment, and hunger (73).Agriculture's Energy builds a series of counterpoints. The first contrasts those who celebrated agriculture as Brazil's calling with those who promoted industry as the key to development. The second contrasts the labor mobilizations of the early 1960s with the elite and military reaction of the 1960s–80s. The third contrasts the arguments of the people who defended the 1975–90 Próalcool ethanol program as \"nationalist, import-saving, and visionary\" with those who saw it as \"a profligate giveaway to entrenched interests that exacerbated rural and regional inequalities\" (12). Rogers remains as neutral as possible, noting Brazil's impressive agro-industrial achievements in expanding fuel and export production while underscoring the environmental degradation, land concentration, extreme inequalities, and \"widespread patterns of malnutrition\" that accompanied this expansion (207).Rogers draws on judicial archives, union publications, newspaper and magazine articles, and contemporary work by social scientists such as Verena Stolcke and Lygia Sigaud to demonstrate that labor mobilizations succeeded in creating formal rights for rural workers through the Rural Workers' Statute in 1963. But this created a paradoxical effect. Landowners and industrialists pushed workers from sharecropping relationships and housing in factory towns to evade responsibility, expanding reliance on a contract labor system. Looking back on the impact of the statute a decade after its passing, a São Paulo worker described it as the \"law about people no longer living on the plantations\" (118). By 1979 as much as one-third of Brazil's population was \"flying\" and \"clandestine,\" struggling to secure rights as they worked for subcontractors and faced life and death conditions getting to and from the fields. Here, as elsewhere, comparative context is provided as we learn about similar developments in 1970s Latin America, including in Chile and Guatemala.Rogers elegantly details the human impact of Brazil's development model. Chapter 4, \"How Brazil's National Alcohol Program Made a Meal of Rural Workers,\" shows that workers had to bring their children to complete their daily \"tasks\" after a group of São Paulo producers, seeking to save on labor and fuel costs, insisted that workers cut more rows of cane and move the cane by hand to a more distant centralized pickup spot for mechanized cane collectors. São Paulo workers eventually won a return to the original row number through an extensive strike in 1985, but they were less successful at winning land access for subsistence crops, payment for the time it took to get to fields, or access to safe transportation. Chapter 5 introduces victims of sugarcane's environmental impacts, from northeasterners complaining of fish dying and stinking water in 1884 to residents from Rio de Janeiro suffering from major floods and typhus almost a century later. The wastewater from washing cane for ethanol multiplied rapidly even as mercury-based pesticides became omnipresent, prompting Brazilian agronomists to call for a move toward agrarian reform and the democratization of agricultural policy in 1986. The \"Green\" model, they noted, was good for \"large landowners and industries, especially multinational producers of agricultural inputs,\" but the social outcome was disastrous, \"increasing the concentration of landholding, rural violence, and the poisoning of rural workers\" (166).The last section of Agriculture's Energy provides an important lesson on the \"food versus fuel\" debate that applies equally well to ethanol from Brazilian cane or US corn today. Sugarcane literally took the place of beans and other subsistence foods in many fields. But the problem was less spatial and more economic: the development model concentrated wealth for agribusinesses and created an army of exploited workers who simply could not afford to feed themselves and their families.",

    "abstract": "As I was preparing to write this review, I happened to pull from my shelf V. S. Naipaul's The Masques of Africa (2010), in which the author devotes a few paragraphs to discussing the place of animals in Nigeria. Naipaul reproduces the enduring stereotypes of white people as lovers and protectors of animals and of Africans as cruel and inhumane. Save one Nigerian Naipual met, only white people in the country (he claims) were concerned about alleviating the suffering of beasts. Into this flattened stereotype comes a fascinating new book by Saheed Aderinto, who presents a far more complex and nuanced account of the role of animals in Nigerian history, one that takes African perspectives seriously.Two aspects of the book ensure that it will be a seminal text in animal studies, in both African history and beyond. First, Aderinto incorporates an array of nonhuman animals and numerous approaches, in contrast to the still relatively small literature on the history of animals in Africa. Previous works have dealt with single species (for example, Robin Law's The Horse in West African History [1980] or Sandra Swart's Riding High: Horses, Humans, and History in South Africa [2016]) or a single focus (Edward I. Steinhart's Black Poachers, White Hunters: A Social History of Hunting in Colonial Kenya [2006]). By taking into consideration species running the gamut from beef cattle and hogs to domesticated canines, and topics from rabies control and polo to the use of animals in political cartoons, Aderinto expands our appreciation for all the ways animals contribute to human history.Second, scholars will need to attend to his core argument that \"colonialism was not just about humans; animals were also colonial subjects\" and thus, \"as with humans, laws and institutions of power governed animals' everyday life\" (3). As colonial subjects, animals were envisioned, (mis)treated, and ruled in many of the same ways as were humans, through similar colonial frames of modernity. Thus the colonial attempt to create \"modern\" urban areas—to enforce particular ideas of sanitation and of orderliness—meant some animals were defined as belonging to the forest or the farm and made illegal in the city. The colonial state expected dogs, like Africans, to behave in a \"civilized\" manner, which included being tied to a particular place, being identifiable and traceable, and being subject to health regulations and other kinds of observation. The colonial state, then, was attempting to enforce a regime both on animals and, via animals, on Africans. Africans chafed under and resisted this aspect of colonialism as they did many others.There are a couple of areas that Adernito might have addressed a bit more. First, he points to animals having agency rather than simply shaping human history through their value as food, companionship, or labor. While \"Western historical methodology\" centers human agency, \"neither indigenous African knowledge systems nor colonial archives . . . conceived of the past as an exclusively human realm, devoid of nonhuman agency\" (5). He argues that \"animals were political actors too.\" \"Scholars,\" he writes, \"may never agree on the extent of agency that animals wielded in the past, but it is undeniable that animals shaped the tenor of political and social processes, directly and indirectly.\" They have taken \"independent action\" by seeking food, water, and shelter, and they have \"resisted human encroachment of their domain [and] violated human-made laws that undermined their livelihood\" (6). These are provocative claims, and ones that I wish Aderinto had explored more fully. To be sure, a lion that enters a human settlement seeking food because its habitat has been denuded has instigated change, perhaps bringing poverty (through the loss of livestock) or sorrow (by killing a human). But are we to understand the lion to be acting as a historical agent the same way we think of humans as historical agents? If so, what are the implications? This is perhaps a greater philosophical (or biomedical) question than the author wishes to tackle. In broaching the topic in his introduction, however, he led me to wonder about the concept of agency throughout the book, but it is not something to which he returns.Second, the reader often loses sight of periodization. Aderinto organizes his book around topics—animals as meat, working animals, rabies, zoos, and so on—which makes sense and permits in-depth exploration of discrete arguments. However, periodization is lost between chapters, and at times within chapters. For example, in chapter 1, examples are drawn from as early as 1906 on through the 1960s, but not in a linear way. Other chapters are more chronologically focused, such as chapter 4 on the use of animals in political cartoons in the years leading up to independence. But a better sense of temporal change across the entire colonial period would have been helpful.With these caveats, this book will be useful for all scholars of Africa to consider anew the animals that regularly appear in the archives but to which we may not have given much thought, and for all historians to consider how forms of power are enacted on and through nonhuman animals.",

    "abstract": "Forty-some-odd years after the advent of New Western History, volume editor Brenden W. Rensink suggests it is time to refocus scholarly attention on the \"Modern West.\" He asserts that \"the twenty-first-century West straddles multiple modern frontiers, not the least of which is the temporal frontier between our unsettled past and uncertain future\" (xxxi). The thirteen chapters in this multidisciplinary work—most resulting from a 2019 seminar at the Charles Redd Center for Western Studies—ably examine this idea. Three of them focus specifically on matters relating to agriculture.In \"Vulnerable Harvests,\" historian David D. Vail explores the environmental hazards that confront agriculturists on the Great Plains in an era of \"larger climactic changes\" (31). While the threats of fire, drought, flood, and polluted aquifers are not new, the modern dilemma is that farmers and ranchers face \"more intense versions\" of such events than ever before (33). Vail argues that John Wesley Powell accurately described the West as a \"region of limits\" (34). While this message seems harsh, he goes on to suggest that the Great Plains Agricultural Council—an entity created during the New Deal—continues to explore problems and seek solutions in order maintain healthy agriculture throughout the region.In \"Agritourism as a Land-Saving Action in the New West,\" business analyst Jeffrey M. Widener focuses on entrepreneurial activities in the Grand Valley of Colorado's Western Slope. He suggests that agritourism—a new version of a nineteenth-century idea—offers \"educational experiences\" to an increasingly urban public; it also encourages water conservation and creates \"a boom for small-town economic development\" (170). In western Colorado, famous peaches, wineries, U-pick operations, farmers' markets, breweries, and distilleries all generate significant income for a largely rural region. Widener employs state and federal economic data to support agritourism's positive financial impact, and he uses state and local media to highlight the variety of activities this region offers visitors. Whether the Grand Valley experience offers a blueprint for other—perhaps less charismatic—regions is not part of this discussion.One of the more powerful essays in the volume is \"Toxins in the Fields.\" Historian Taylor Cozzens explores environmental justice for California farmworkers, and he makes the work of the California Rural Legal Assistance organization central to this discussion. He suggests that scholarship in this vein has focused primarily on Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers. While the United Farm Workers is important, that organization never stood alone. California Rural Legal Assistance was founded in 1966 as a \"private, nonprofit agency of lawyers and Spanish-speaking community workers\" (223). Its strategies included educating workers about risk, filing lawsuits, and prodding the Environmental Protection Agency to move faster on farmworker issues.Here, environmental justice and matters of race and ethnicity overlap. In an age of successful lawsuits against pesticide and herbicide manufacturers, Cozzens argues that Latino farmworkers have yet to receive the \"same level of attention\" that other groups appreciate, despite their constant proximity to such chemicals (220). Since the 1950s, these generally low-paid workers and their communities have faced enormous risks from the copious use of over sixteen thousand pesticides sprayed on the crops they pick. Effects of excessive chemical contact include high rates of cancer as well as sudden mass poisonings. In the twenty-first century, California Rural Legal Assistance is addressing other threats to Latino communities including the proximity of waste management facilities to farmworkers' neighborhoods.There is a lot to like about this volume, and it will certainly be a good addition to library holdings on college campuses. It includes a concise New West historiography penned by Rensink in the introduction, a foreword by Patricia Nelson Limerick, and an afterword by Frank Bergon. More importantly, there are ten other well-constructed essays that focus on environmental matters, Indigenous identity, Southwest Borderlands history, the urban West, and gender and politics. Additionally, the volume asks good questions about the state of western history in the curriculum. Generally, the nineteenth-century West and the twentieth-century West are explored in separate classes. The collective work of all the volume's contributors suggests it is a good time to recognize that the twenty-first century is already nearly a quarter century old. Because of its broad scope of topics and its consistent focus on the past, present, and future, this work may serve well as a reader to bring the regional discussion current.",

    "abstract": "Courtney Campbell's Region out of Place offers an engaging examination of the construction of regional identity in Brazil's Northeast that looks beyond the nation and the usual subjects of such accounts. From intellectual networks to World Cup football matches, Region out of Place shows that northeasterners looked to the world to cultivate a sense of belonging and identity while hedging against the inferior place assigned to them within Brazil's cast of regions, especially vis-à-vis economically ascendent São Paulo. In so doing, Campbell innovates relative to what is now a highly developed and mature historiography on regionalism in Brazil that has hitherto largely restricted itself within the nation's borders.Campbell achieves this by including new actors alongside fresh appraisals of more familiar faces across seven thematic and loosely chronological chapters. Intellectuals like Gilberto Freyre still figure prominently (chapter 2), for instance, but the focus shifts to the international circuits of fellow regionalists through which Freyre developed his ideas of region and nation and in turn, influenced incipient regionalisms elsewhere. Equally compelling, artists, fishermen, filmmakers, popular authors, and pageant contestants played important roles, demonstrating that popular culture broadly constituted a key arena in which regional identities were forged. In some cases, northeasterners looked at events abroad such as with the Miss Universe pageant in the United States (chapter 6) and film festivals (chapter 7). In others, they grappled with notions of foreignness within Brazil as in popular cordel literature about northeastern migrants and the region's periodic droughts (chap. 1). More often, the world came to the Northeast, including through Orson Welles's film on four northeastern fishermen (chapter 3), discourse on romantic partners of US soldiers stationed there in World War II (chapter 4), World Cup matches (chapter 5), and the Movimento de Cultura Popular, inspired by a French educational movement (chapter 7).The picture that emerges of northeastern identity is as ever-changing and fraught with internal tensions as ever, including in terms of race, a major focus of previous works on the subject. A particular highlight in this regard is Campbell's discussion of the ambiguous place of the city of Salvador, widely regarded as a center of Afro-Brazilian culture and identity, within the Northeast. Through press coverage of Miss Universe pageant contestants from the region, we see how some northeasterners regarded Salvador and coastal areas of Bahia as sometimes belonging and sometimes not to the Northeast. By considering the global, fractures within the subnational come into focus.The paradox that regionalism has had a profoundly global life cycle points to the emergence of a distinctive spatial imagination, one intimately concerned with questions of authenticity and modernity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Agricultural regions ranging from Oaxaca, the Scottish Highlands, southern Italy, and the US South, to name but a few examples cited by the author, functioned as both foils to more industrialized, ostensibly metropolitan counterparts and epitomes of national authenticity in a rapidly changing world. This account of Brazil's Northeast reconstructs this process from one of its peripheries, showing that regions and associated identities offer a \"framework for understanding our place in the nation and the world\" (11). Region out of Place should serve as a generative reference point for scholars of regional and national identity regardless of their nation or area of focus.",

    "abstract": "The study of the Great Plains has done much to help define the field of environmental history, especially in the United States. And because histories of \"dust, drought, and declension\" dominated studies of, and ways of thinking about, the Great Plains, the tension between competing linear narratives of progress and decline also became highly influential among environmental historians over the past three decades. In this new edited collection, Brian Frehner and Kathleen Brosnan bring together a diverse group of scholars from multiple disciplines to demonstrate that this long-standing approach to the study of Great Plains environmental history is changing in favor of \"adaptation, persistence, preservation, and sustainability\" (xv). Taken together, the sixteen essays that comprise the collection effectively capture the state of the field of Great Plains environmental history. There is much scholarship of significant value emerging from a variety of disciplines and approaches that challenge standard historiographical assumptions. Indeed, the field, like the collection itself, is so large and broad that it is difficult to explain coherently. The collection goes a long way in sketching out the scope of the field, and the editors have done important work in framing the contributions in a way that reflect the authors' various challenges to the region's dominant historiographical axiom of disaster and decline. The breadth of what is included in the collection, however, sometimes stretches the category of environmental history to the point that it begins to lose explanatory power. The editors do a good job of lending structure to the diversity of scholarship, but like the state of the field itself, they struggle to provide coherence to such a diverse array of new approaches to Great Plains environmental history.The breadth of topics here is large enough that it is clear the editors and contributors struggled to organize the essays thematically. In the introduction, Frehner and Brosnan write that technology and its role in human adaptation unites the individual essays in the collection, but they then present four additional themes—water, grasses, animals, and energy—that are supposed to be the book's main themes (xviii–xx). The editors then offer regionalism as an important concept with which the contributors engage in their essays, and then mobility, and then environmental decline caused by agriculture as well (xxii–xxiv). These themes and the structure they supposedly provide to unite the book are not clearly explained. Technology certainly accommodates and connects most of the essays, which focus on a diversity of topics from rawhide bags to account books, and from breakfast cereal to natural gas pipelines. But most other themes are not central to the essays as a whole. Animals and energy, for instance, receive their own sections of the book, but water and grass do not, nor does regionalism or mobility. Instead, the essays are arranged into four sections with four essays in each: \"Indigenous Grassland Adaptations over the Longue Durée,\" \"Animals on the Great Plains,\" \"Modern Agriculture and the Transformation of the Plains,\" and \"Energy Landscapes.\" The essays are of high quality, and each category holds its four essays together.Linking all sixteen essays together effectively under the umbrella of environmental history is tricky, because in fact not all of the essays are actually environmental histories. Some of the strongest contributions are written by scholars who identify as environmental historians. George Colpitts demonstrates that the qualitative descriptions from fur trader daybooks contributed to better bookkeeping records, which in turn facilitated the transformation of bison into commodities. Jacob Blackwell uses nuisance lawsuits and environmental regulations to examine the opportunities and constraints of large-scale feedlot operations. And Ryan Driskell Tate traces the failed efforts of ranchers to resist the slow violence of strip mining and its overburden. Interestingly, the essays that are most clearly environmental histories are also ones that detail stories of degradation, decline, or disaster. The essays that best frame their contributions around the complexity and nonlinearity that the editors insist characterize efforts to rethink Great Plains environmental history are not written by environmental historians. Anthropologist Leila Monaghan provides an excellent study of mobility and place-based knowledge of Cheyenne and Arapaho women's lived experience moving across vast distances. The chapter is awkwardly framed around the importance of travois, which undoubtedly mediated mobility and landscape knowledge over time but might have been stronger had it been focused on Monaghan's insights about the environmental knowledge embodied in painted rawhide bags and landscape names. Native American studies scholar Clint Carroll frames Indigenous epistemology and storytelling as central to understanding the persistence of animal kinship relationships among the Cherokee during and after colonization and dispossession. And geographers Jonathan Peyton and Matthew Dyce reveal that accommodation and ambiguity characterized the inconsistent consequences of oil development for one municipality in Manitoba. What this suggests is that stories of things getting worse still have a lot of influence among environmental historians, and that scholars working at the edges of the field in other disciplines often have important conceptual, theoretical, and methodological contributions to offer.What does help this collection rethink environmental histories of the Great Plains is the inclusion of nonhistorians. More than half of the contributors (eleven, or thirteen if we include the editors) are historians. The other ten include four anthropologists, three geographers, one archaeologist, one Native American studies scholar, and one media studies scholar. Frehner and Brosnan claim that this makes the collection \"an interdisciplinary forum\" (xx). Indeed, much environmental history is made stronger by taking an interdisciplinary approach. Drawing from other disciplines—or, better yet, working with scholars from other disciplines—to better understand past relationships between people and the nonhuman world is a central tenet of environmental history. But this collection is multidisciplinary rather than interdisciplinary. Of the sixteen essays, thirteen are sole-authored and only one was coauthored with a historian. The best environmental histories will always be written by historians. But some of the best interdisciplinary environmental histories are coauthored by historians working with scholars from other disciplines.The Greater Plains delivers on its promise in that it \"complicates earlier narratives of the plains as a region prone to ecological disaster\" (xvii). But environmental declensionism is still an important part of the field, especially if we are talking about the Great Plains. Rethinking the region's environmental histories appears to have just begun, and the contributors to this broad collection provide important indications about where the field is headed.",

    "abstract": "Over recent decades, Scotland's involvement in colonialism has become increasingly prominent in scholarly and nonscholarly deliberations about Scottish history. Conversations about the Scottish contribution to expanding and buttressing the British Empire—and the manifestations of colonialism that linger in Scottish society today—took on increased urgency in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020. The nation's historical connections to enslavement in the Caribbean and its enduring legacies have become a central aspect of the historiography of modern Scotland. In 2015, Scotland's most prominent historian T. M. Devine put the question succinctly: Did slavery make Scotia great?Devine's question is not entirely new. Decades earlier, Eric Williams examined the links between economic development in Britain and capital accumulation in the Caribbean. For Williams, there was a discernible link between the proceeds of enslavement and the emergence of industrial capitalism. Stephen Mullen's The Glasgow Sugar Aristocracy is one of the recent—and ongoing—responses to Williams's work. Placing Glasgow's West India merchants at the heart of its analysis, Mullen demonstrates this group's facilitative role in Scotland's economic development. The book's primary historiographical contribution is testing this aspect of the Williams thesis in a Scottish context.The \"sugar aristocracy\" on whom Mullen focuses belonged to the elite tier of Glasgow's mercantile community. In chapter 1, Mullen provides an overview of this group's formation. Drawn from both the middling ranks and the lower gentry, they formed connections through marriage and financial relationships. Chapter 2 underscores the importance of family ties, borrowing and lending to the development of the sugar aristocracy. Drawing on sources of credit in Scotland allowed these merchants to undertake business ventures in the Caribbean. The capital that Glasgow's West India merchants repatriated—derived from enslaved people's labor—catapulted them to the upper echelons of Scottish society.Thousands of Scots made their way to the Caribbean between 1750 and 1834. In chapter 4, Mullen provides a new estimate of the scale of Scottish immigration to the Caribbean. Between 1750 and 1834, somewhere between thirty-six thousand and forty-seven thousand Scots arrived in the West Indies. This group comprised primarily young men. They included artisans, merchants, and medics. The lure of relatively high wages enticed agricultural workers to the Caribbean; their skills were valuable on plantations and the cattle pens that supported sugar monoculture.Chapters 5, 6, and 7 offer case studies that detail Scots' activities in Jamaica, Grenada, and Trinidad, respectively. In these chapters, Mullen problematizes the scholarly consensus concerning the seemingly temporary nature of Scottish migration to the Caribbean. While the archetypal Scot in the West Indies may have been a temporary migrant—or so-called sojourner—Mullen offers examples of Scots who remained in the Caribbean for prolonged periods. Moreover, he emphasizes that success was far from assured for the thousands of Scots who vied for financial and social advancement. The cohort of Scots who achieved considerable financial success through their involvement in the plantation economy—undergirded by enslaved people's labor—were not as likely to invest in burgeoning industries as their Glasgow-based mercantile associates.Mullen uses chapter 8 to synthesize conclusions from his various case studies. Most significantly, he argues that Glasgow's West India merchants made a discernible contribution to the process of industrialization in Scotland. Furthermore, this chapter offers valuable insights for scholars interested in Scotland's agricultural history. Half of the merchants Mullen examined in his study owned landed estates, mostly smaller parcels of land in the West of Scotland (although many produced significant rental incomes). Although some West India merchants Mullen analyzed inherited their landed estates from relatives, most bought them directly. Capital accumulated before the abolition of enslavement in 1834 rather than the compensation received by enslavers after this juncture appears to have facilitated the bulk of these land purchases. Moreover, it was only after 1800 that rural areas felt the effects of improvement schemes connected to capital linked to enslavement.This well-researched and carefully argued book represents a significant milestone in the historiography of modern Scotland. Its findings about the nature and extent of slavery-derived capital's influence on industrialization have important implications for Scottish economic history. By clarifying the scale of the impact that the proceeds of enslavement had on economic and social developments in Scotland, Mullen provides a revision of the more general understanding of Scotland's past. This book is required reading for anyone interested in Scotland's past links to enslavement in the Caribbean and how these connections have shaped the nation into the present day.",

    "abstract": "One might expect that a book focused on a dam's foundations, as indicated by its title, would be about engineering, geology, or even the legislative history of the structure's creation. Not so in Erika Marie Bsumek's history concerning the 710-foot-tall dam completed in 1966 as part of the Colorado River Storage Project. Instead, The Foundations of Glen Canyon Dam probes deeper to examine the layered history of the land on which the barrier rests and which its reservoir, Lake Powell, touches and drowns.Reaching back to 1840, the infrastructures that Bsumek describes as leading to dispossession are both social and physical. She focuses on the multiple conceptual layers overlain on Indigenous lands and peoples resulting in their losing possession of and access to homelands and sacred sites. As such, this book is a bridge between canonical texts on western water history and recently written studies of Native American dispossession. Bsumek extends and adds a new angle to the plentiful Glen Canyon Dam and Colorado River history books, as well as the growing literature examining Indigenous dispossession.Bsumek explains the dispossession of Navajos, Paiutes, and Utes of their lands on the Colorado Plateau by describing the history of colonial settlement there through a chronological approach broken into chapters by theme. Three of the five chapters precede the conception of the dam, as Bsumek lays the groundwork for an understanding of who was doing what in the area. In the 1840s, members of the Latter-Day Saints settled in the region, beginning the exploitation of the land and people already there, then government scientists explored the land, often with Indigenous guides, to gain a better understanding of it. By the 1920s, engineers began conceiving plans for massive water infrastructure projects. Bsumek presents evidence through case studies that Native American knowledge and place names were overwritten, appropriated, or ignored in these quests.The final two chapters address the politics surrounding the dam as well as the immediate aftermath of its construction as court cases played out. Here, Bsumek carefully navigates Navajo leaders' varied attitudes and actions toward the dam, at times in alignment and supportive and later diverging. She concludes the book with an epilogue highlighting the current issues of the Colorado River and Colorado Plateau and stressing the importance of understanding the history of Native American dispossession, in part as a means of clarifying the choices for the future of the West.These selected case studies of instances where the clash of two incompatible worldviews resulted in turning points to the benefit of some and the harm of others through loss of their lands and sacred spaces provide much needed robust context to the western water story. One issue readers will want to watch out for is that the isolated case studies can seem to be a continuous story, each building deliberately on the other. Bsumek inserts the conciliatory phrase \"while not exactly coordinated\" in her strong conclusion (190).For her evidence of how ignoring important parts of history can do harm, Bsumek mined numerous archival collections and made extensive use of endnotes to thoroughly cite sources. The book includes nearly twenty historical photographs as well as a color gallery section with a map of Bears Ears National Monument. Readers could have benefited from additional maps of the Colorado Plateau locating the places described in the book.The major contribution of the book to western water history is the shift in focus to considering how the land and its native residents factor into the story, not just in the beginning but across the decades. Additionally, the thorough information about the 1950s federal policies of termination and reclamation being connected via western Mormon politicians is enlightening.Glen Canyon Dam and its Lake Powell have long been a place of controversy that at present evidences a dramatically changed western environment. With books like Bsumek's paving the way for an improved understanding of the lands and peoples at the heart of western water issues, we can better appreciate the complexity involved in today's decision-making. Some readers may find the work unsettling, but that is one of the goals.",

    "abstract": "In this new book, Seth Garfield demonstrates his vast knowledge of Brazil, moving gracefully through the different political, environmental, and economic contexts that shaped the history of the guarana plant (Paullinia cupana) from the colonial period to recent times. In an engaging way, Garfield shows how guarana, the main ingredient in a popular Brazilian soft drink, became much more than a fruit with stimulating properties. It is also a vibrant ingredient in the country's complex historical relationship between people and the natural environment.Garfield's book highlights the interests of traders, techniques of scientists, stratagems of marketers, and the behaviors and tastes of consumers who popularized new forms and uses of the stimulant. The author, using a broad methodological framework, introduces the production of knowledge on, and the circulation of the fruit in, distinct historical periods and situations. To build his argument, Garfield examines an amalgam of primary sources, Indigenous myths, photos, maps, advertisements, legislation, newspapers, academic journals, and many other sources. The vast bibliography that he consults enables our understanding of how knowledge, goods, and power have materialized and circulated through the fruit and its uses.Garfield complements his research by consulting a wide range of fields of knowledge. He looks, for example, to studies of the plant itself and its properties to discover what has encouraged its use among different social groups and how knowledge of its nutritional properties has stimulated interest in the berry or its processed forms. Guarana, the most caffeine-rich plant on earth, is a species of flowering shrubs that belongs to the Sapindaceae, or soapberry, family, and it is native only to the Mawés region of the lower Amazon and the Orinoco River of Venezuela. This region has been occupied by the Sateré-Mawé peoples, who were responsible for the plant's domestication. Despite scant sources—due largely to the fact that Brazilian Indigenous cultures were exclusively oral—Garfield effectively explores the different meanings and roles that these groups gave to the plant. Beyond the fruit's role in diet, it was woven into legend and sacred meaning. Today, they recognize the plant as a form of resistance. Guarana extraction, and its sustainable cultivation, has become part of their struggle to preserve traditional knowledge.Garfield's book also covers the role of advertising and commercial interests in expanding the cultivation and consumption of guarana. There is a long list of products that have undergone consumption booms, coming onstage through complex relations to historical opportunities or to material scarcity. Yet changes in eating habits are not always positive and have even been at the root of both eating and environmental disorders. In advanced industrial nations, the expansion of the food system was based on incorporating new markets for commodities and applying technologies to improve agriculture for mass production. Garfield employs this perspective when he considers issues of gender, race, class, and age and their connection to the popularization of the Guaraná soft drink in Brazil. Amid Brazil's expanding urban centers, industrial development, and changing family patterns, an Amazonian berry reinvented as an industrial flavor became an emblem of modern life.The guarana plant has made its way through different worlds, and Garfield's book casts light on its pathways. His approach lines up with other recent scholarship in global environmental history, applying microscopic and macroscopic lenses to map the plant's route over the course of the centuries from Indigenous cultivation to colonial era missionary concerns and, later, as a commodity for international trade. Garfield shows how, not unlike other endemic species in Brazil, guarana went from object of Western scientific study and classification to Anglo-American pharmaceutical novelty. In Brazil, the berry has served as a contribution to Brazilian development and national identity.Of undeniable theoretical and methodological importance, this book guarantees a thought-provoking and pleasurable read. It will undoubtedly become a widely cited source, welcomed by scholars from many different fields.",

    "abstract": "Yu Tokunaga's book, Transborder Los Angeles: An Unknown Transpacific History of Japanese-Mexican Relations, is a tremendous addition to the historiography of transnational Japanese American history and interethnic labor history. With clear prose researched from multiple angles and driven by details, Tokunaga's work brings into conversation not only the complexity of the Japanese American farming community's networks in Los Angeles prior to World War II but also the transborder relations of that community as they farmed across the Mexican border. Against the backdrop of major immigration legislation affecting migration from Japan such as the Gentlemen's Agreement, the Alien Land Law, and the 1924 Immigration Act, Tokunaga takes the reader through the effects of the Mexican Revolution, the Great Depression, several key labor strikes, contemporary ideas about eugenics and growing nationalism, and the lead-up to the World War II–era incarceration of the Japanese American community.Tokunaga expands upon the historiography of transnational Japanese American history and Mexican American history. He weaves together the relationships of Japanese tenant farmers (who leased farmland from white landowners), and their proximity to the Mexican farmworkers whose labor was, and continues to be, indispensable to California's agriculture. Interethnic cooperation and conflict were inevitable. Japanese farmers learned how to communicate in Spanish, illustrating their willingness to form close relationships with Mexicans who worked on their farms on either side of the border. The US-Mexico border region has always reflected cultural and linguistic fluidity. Tokunaga demonstrates how that fluidity included businesses, capital, and the lesser-known but influential political pressure of Japanese farmers in Baja California, Mexico, who encouraged their compatriots in the United States to negotiate labor conflicts during the El Monte Berry Strike of 1933 and the Venice Celery Strike of 1936. Transborder Los Angeles reveals unexpected alliances across the border.Tokunaga asserts how the trinational relationship waxed and waned, especially during the racial shifts of the first half of the twentieth century. The anti-Asian movement led to legislation in 1908, 1913, 1921, and 1924 that restricted Japanese immigrants and shaped the boundaries of Japanese laborers and their business ventures. The tone of American nativism changed in 1924 from the \"'Japanese problem' to the 'Mexican problem'\" (53). During the growth of the Japanese empire in the 1930s that coincided with a prolabor and anti-Asian New Deal era, Japanese tenant farmers relied on non-white labor, namely Mexican and Filipino migrant workers. The Mexicali Japanese community was caught between increased Mexican nationalism, anti-Japanese sentiment in Mexico, and the international news of Japan's growing Asian empire. Rather than take on the ideals of white supremacy in the United States, Japanese immigrant nationalism served as a basis for interethnic accommodation.The existing Japanese American scholarship on the World War II incarceration centers the removal of the Japanese American community and the subsequent injustices of the breach of civil rights and civil liberties. In Transborder Los Angeles, Tokunaga expands upon that scholarship within the context of agricultural labor history by acknowledging the Japanese American incarceration as an \"agricultural labor crisis\" (9). Justified by national security (but fueled by racism and wartime hysteria), Japanese and Japanese American removal proceeded swiftly in 1942. Even the threat of economic loss in California agriculture from the incarceration did not reduce anti-Japanese sentiment (150). Americans needed food during the war, and without Japanese American farms to produce and distribute it, the manufactured crisis was of the government's own making. The government resolved the labor vacuum created by the absence of the West Coast Japanese American community by importing Mexican laborers via the Bracero Program to meet the demands of wartime food production. The war revealed the priorities of labor, racial hierarchies, and the negotiation of the Japanese community's departure and the subsequent arrival of Mexicans in the Bracero Program. The removal and incarceration of the Japanese American community reshuffled the power, businesses, and leadership in the postwar period.Transborder Los Angeles is thoroughly researched using archival sources in Japanese, Spanish, and English. The maps, newspaper articles, and images showcased the best of the archives. The book is accessible to the reader and highlights the delicate relationship between transborder communities, Japanese immigrant farmers, Mexican laborers, and how they competed for power. It includes pithy micro-level details and how events at the international level transformed these communities. It is a powerful history of a transpacific workplace, showcasing how those involved continued to interact together well into the 1970s. Transborder Los Angeles will most certainly have a very long shelf life.",

    "abstract": "Since the 1990s, historians have devoted intensive study to the economic activities of enslaved people in the American South. How people owned as property bought and sold goods, and for what purposes, reaches to the heart of questions about the conditions of slavery, relations between masters and slaves, and slaves' ability to ameliorate the conditions of their servitude. Justine Hill Edwards's Unfree Markets is the first major study to consider the internal or informal economy of slavery in relation the history of capitalism. Examining South Carolina from the early colonial period to the Civil War, Edwards finds widespread evidence of slaves' participation in market activities. Enslaved men and women sold produce at markets and staples such as rice and cotton to storekeepers. They hired themselves out for odd jobs, earning income that they used to purchase goods and, in a few exceptional cases, their own freedom. Market involvement, however, did not equal freedom. Hill argues that slaves' entrepreneurial activities strengthened the institution of slavery, even as they provided \"a modicum of independence\" and \"a material and psychological buffer\" against slavery's harshest effects (15). Edwards's study is thoroughly researched and moves debate about slaves' market activities in new directions. Although some readers may disagree with some of her conclusions, Unfree Markets is an important contribution to the fast-growing literature on slavery and capitalism in the American South.According to Edwards, during the early colonial period, slaves began producing and trading commodities out of necessity. Slaveowners failed to provide adequate subsistence and necessities such as shoes and clothing, so slaves raised crops and sold produce to survive. Over time, enslaved peoples' economic activities increased. Slaveowners did not attempt to constrain slaves' market activities but often suspected slaves of theft and waste, leading to conflict. Still, slaveowners did not limit slaves' entrepreneurship since they benefited from it.In the mid-eighteenth century, slave hiring became more common. After the revolution, it sparked conflict with poor whites. In Charleston, skilled white workers competed with slaves for employment and feared the loss of their livelihoods. Complaints to city officials led to a series of ordinances aimed at regulating and policing slave hiring. These instituted a system of slave badges and fines for illegal trading with slaves but did little to curtail slave hiring and slaves' market participation. As Edwards notes, enslavers and slaves \"ignored the laws completely\" (53). In later years, continuing conflict over slave hiring and slaves' market involvement undermined white solidarity, but not enough to prompt authorities to take stronger action.The rise of short-staple cotton production in inland areas sparked further expansion of slaves' economic activities. According to Edwards, slaves' market participation became more visible and closely tied to the economic activities of storekeepers and poor whites. Slaveowners used the market shocks of 1819 and 1837 to force slaves to produce more of their own provisions. This led to greater conflict since, as Edwards writes, \"for many bondspeople, trade and theft were inextricably interlinked\" (96). Slaves stole foodstuffs to counter depravation and obtain goods to sell and trade. Still, the system held. Despite omnipresent tensions, slaves found ways to better their circumstances, while masters limited the costs of maintaining their human property. Edwards argues that this relationship took on new dimensions in the 1840s and 1850s. Slaves recognized they could not earn enough to buy their freedom but continued to engage in market activities as a means of survival. Slaveowners turned to increasingly predatory behavior, \"extracting as much labor and profit from enslaved people as possible\" while also undermining the economic interests of poor whites (158–59).Edwards's arguments are provocative and insightful. In contrast to scholars such as Loren Schweninger and Kathleen Hillard, Edwards finds slaves' market activities to have been visible and public, tolerated and fundamental to the society and economy of South Carolina. Edwards has mined the historical record thoroughly. Her account relies on a broad range of sources, including the account books of merchants and planters, court records, legislative petitions, and narratives of runaway slaves.For all of the strengths of Unfree Markets, however, the book is not without its shortcomings. One is a failure to distinguish adequately between slaves' experiences in upland areas devoted to short-staple cotton and the low country's rice and sea island cotton districts. Scholars familiar with the historiography of South Carolina will recognize that the labor regimens and conditions of slavery differed significantly between these regions. Edwards is well aware of these differences yet argues that the short-staple cotton boom transformed the lives of slaves throughout the state. She may be right, but the bulk of the evidence she presents comes from upland areas. The question of whether the intensification of slaves' economic activities varied across time and space deserves further scrutiny.A second problem lies in the limits of the evidence. Despite Edwards's judicious research, the body of sources on which some of her arguments rest is limited. Edwards provides excellent context for many of the episodes she relates and mines her sources thoroughly, telling illuminating stories in the process. Still, readers cannot help but wonder if some of the examples are more exceptional than representative. In part, this reflects the nature of the sources, which, as Edwards notes, are fragmentary and mainly reflect white perspectives. At the same time, readers would be right to wonder if the activities Edwards describes were as widespread as she suggests. This is another question that begs for further investigation.Despite these criticisms, Edwards has written an important book. Unfree Markets casts slaves' economic activities in a fresh light. Although scholars have long recognized that slave labor fueled the rise of American capitalism, Edwards calls attention to the way enslaved people's desire to survive drew them into economic relations that strengthened the system responsible for their exploitation, even as it offered fleeting moments of respite.",

    "abstract": "Workers in a modern pork processing plant's gestation division cannot make eye contact with pregnant sows and absolutely should never accidently brush against them. Human eye contact and touch risks upsetting the animals and kicking off a chain reaction that results in a complete loss of thousands of pregnancies. The tightly packed sows each have so many fetuses that they will miscarry if agitated, and their confinement makes them unfamiliar with human bodies. Thus, no eye contact or touch. This is how Alex Blanchette opens his book.To say that Porkopolis is a difficult book to review is an understatement. It demands the reader take an unflinching view (recalling the sows in the birthing cages) at the totalizing nature of industrial processing. The book is filled with intimate stories and insightful analysis that upend the staid and standard historical accounts of industrial meat production that drain the visceral elements from the accounts. But this is not a work of history. It is an \"ethnography of that industrial pig\" around whom the industry bends (4). As a work of ethnography and not history, Porkopolis takes us to the biological processes and the animals that are the core of capital-intensive production systems. This unsettling scholarship argues that we all serve the industrial pig, resulting in a totalizing \"pigification\" of life under capitalism (243). Pork is not just a commodity; it is us.How does Blanchette reach that conclusion? It starts with reframing the old story of industrial meat production as a story of human innovation and the total conquest of nature. The book illustrates how the hog itself is the center of the process that turns millions of pigs into millions of pounds of meat and a thousand other commodities that find usage in just about everything from concrete to paper, to medicine, to humans themselves. For Blanchette, there is an \"animality\" at the center of this process. Because corporations cannot sever the pig from their bodies and their bodies from their biology, pork remains tied to pigs and the limits of their bodies. Turning porcine bodies into economically usable products also requires turning human bodies into a means for producing and reproducing the industrial pig, thus the irreducible animality of the pig demands that human labor and capital serve the industrial pig. In his telling, all humans are in some way lashed to the machine that churns out pork and the other more profitable commodities that we consume (to the point where meat is an afterthought). The factory laborers experience this more than any other people, but the managers and corporate leaders who are responsible for this process are pigified as well. His book is a story of a totalizing industrial economy that has us all serving the needs of the factory farm as standardized life smooths out production speeds and grows profits. In short, the more that life is standardized and mechanized, the more that humans are entangled.From 2009 to 2014, Blanchette conducted research at \"Dover Foods\" and worked at every sector of the processing plant. He also interviewed workers and managers about their experiences in a city that he calls \"Dixon.\" This is anthropology, and, as such, his main sources are interviews with people and participation in the work. He takes us through the steps of birth, rearing, slaughter, disassembly, and then follows where the body parts go after disassembly. Pigification emerges as he takes the reader through the steps of the production process, which is how the book is organized. In this way, the book itself is pigified by the animality of the hog. Since his research occurred on-site and through interviews, his analysis provides an intimate picture of reproduction and production.Worth noting are the excellent and vibrant photographs that Sean Sprague took during two separate trips with Blanchette. While the company restricted what could be photographed, the pictures help show elements of the process that words alone could not completely capture and even offer alternative ways of seeing the processing. In the end, there is a lot to say about this book, with this review only having enough space to skim the surface. You should pick up this book, and if this review causes you to skip it, then I have done you a great disservice. In summary, historians should read Porkopolis and meditate on its insights.",

    "abstract": "In Plunder for Profit: A Socio-environmental History of Tobacco Farming in Southern Rhodesia and Zimbabwe, Elijah Doro examines the effects of tobacco farming on rural physical and social landscapes. He draws on the experiences of tobacco stakeholders across the colonial-postcolonial divide to frame \"farming landscapes as socio-environmental sites of struggle on which human and nature interact to produce not only new ecosystems and environment change but also new relations of society\" (13). More broadly, the book speaks to the burgeoning scholarship on commodities and their place in global and local socioeconomic and environmental entanglements over time and space. Thus, by wading into the hitherto largely understudied environmental dimension of tobacco farming in Zimbabwe, Doro sheds light on the intersection of global and local commodity historical experiences and discourses.In addition to the introduction and conclusion, the book consists of six substantive chapters organized thematically and chronologically. The first chapter traces the global and local contexts within which white settler tobacco commercial farming was introduced in Southern Rhodesia. However, with so much having been written on pioneering white settler tobacco farmers, little can be gained from rehashing this story. The second chapter casts new light onto conservationism on Southern Rhodesian tobacco farms, complementing my own recently published work, Politics, Profits, and Protection: Zimbabwe's Tobacco Industry since 1947 (2022), which, despite its focus on postwar global tobacco trade dynamics and their local implications during the same period, omits this important dimension.Postwar tobacco farmer experiences covered in this chapter shine new light on the old debate about the politics and pace of conservationism within colonial Zimbabwe's white settler community. Unlike previously, when planters \"mined\" the soil, the dynamic of capital, exorbitant land prices, and generally high farm production costs, Doro argues, forced farmers to shift from extensive to intensive farming as well as to adopt mechanical and biological soil conservation initiatives, beyond the exhortations of state policy. However, it must be pointed out that without a pronounced \"economic\" element, tobacco's environment cannot be properly understood. Markets and prices shaped production decisions and practices to a very significant degree, and, for that reason, Doro's environmental history should be read together with works on the politics and economics of tobacco farming.Chapter 3, which covers the period 1945–80, extends the environmental theme by charting the political economy of pesticide use in Southern Rhodesian tobacco farms against the backdrop of contemporary global faith in the scientific control of nature. The chapter uses African workers' experiences with pesticides on tobacco farms to critique contemporary global discourses on environmentalism that failed to take into account that in settler colonies like Southern Rhodesia, environmentalism \"operated unevenly along lines of race and class . . . impacting black Africans and whites in distinctly different ways\" (151). In doing so, the chapter captures another dimension of the social violence, plunder, and exploitation to which Black workers on tobacco farms were subjected.In chapter 4, Doro takes us back to 1900 to introduce African tobacco farmers' experiences in Southern Rhodesia up to 1980. Part of the aim is to \"discuss cash crop and commodity asymmetries within the colonial economy as structural constraints on peasant agency\" (167). However, with respect to tobacco, this is well established in Zimbabwean historiography. Building on existing literature on African peasant tobacco during early colonial contact to focus more on their postwar experiences, during which period settler policy toward African cash crop production changed, would have been a more rewarding exercise.Taking us back to 1960, chapter 5 revisits the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) period and its buildup by adding the refreshingly unexplored environmental dimension, thereby transcending existing socioeconomic and political historiographies on UDI and its implications. The chapter's coverage of how sanctions-inspired diversification from tobacco to other crops increased pressure on tobacco landscapes is insightful and sets it apart from the existing literature. This helps in the reconstruction of a fuller history of the multidimensional impact of Rhodesia's UDI.Chapter 6, which straddles the colonial and postcolonial eras to trace the intersection of tobacco control and public health discourses, examines how tobacco capital influenced national tobacco policy from 1953 to 2020. However, the section on independent Zimbabwe reads more like a survey or an epilogue than a stand-alone chapter. Seeking to cover such complex issues over such a long time span was certain to pose evidentiary and structural challenges.While the period and the diversity of themes covered are clearly ambitious, the adoption of a blended thematic and chronological approach resulted in repetition that disrupts the flow of the book. Not least problematic is the title of the book, which refers to \"Southern Rhodesia\" and \"Zimbabwe\" as if these are two different countries, a claim made by ex-Rhodesians scattered across the globe who have refused to accept the reality of the territory's majority rule since April 18, 1980, under the name Zimbabwe. The author cannot use the need for historical accuracy to justify the use of \"Southern Rhodesia\" and \"Zimbabwe\" in the book title because the country changed from \"Southern Rhodesia\" to \"Rhodesia\" to \"Zimbabwe-Rhodesia\" and, finally, to \"Zimbabwe\" during the period he covers. The author's characterization of the 1966–79 war as a \"bush war\" despite acknowledging that calling it a \"bush\" war or \"liberation\" war was political, is problematic (178). Other minor factual errors include calling both Frank Clements and Edward Harben tobacco farmers, when Harben was the farmer and Clements a journalist.That aside, Doro commendably weaves an insightful story that reinserts an understudied environmental dimension into Zimbabwe's tobacco historiography. In doing so, he lays a firm foundation for detailed future conversations on public health, tobacco control, and public policy in tobacco-dependent countries in the context of the global anti-tobacco lobby and climate change discourses. Such conversations may lead to the search for answers to Doro's impassioned plea—captured in the book's angry and agitated conclusion—to stop environmental and social plunder on tobacco landscapes. Undoubtedly, commodity and environmental historians, climate activists, governments and global and local public health practitioners will, in different ways, find this book useful for their respective causes.",

    "abstract": "In the produce section of every American chain grocery—from Maine to Florida, and down to the southwestern border—consumers will find a bounty of glossy, colorful Washington apples tempting their eyes. But this was not always the case. A century ago, apple eaters in the eastern cities would have found most of the apples available for sale had more regional origins. In Amanda Van Lanen's The Washington Apple: Orchards and the Development of Industrial Agriculture, we learn that 69 percent of the apples produced in the United States in 2020 came from Washington State. How did apples from the northwestern corner of the country come to be so ubiquitous across the nation? That is the question Van Lanen seeks to answer in this fascinating account.Large-scale commercial apple production did not take off in Washington State until the early twentieth century. By that time New York, New England, Virginia, and the Midwest had a robust and mature apple industry that provided enough apples to meet consumer demands across the eastern half of the country, as well as a surplus that found markets in Europe. The obstacles to success for Washington's early commercial growers were not insubstantial. There was abundant land in the high deserts east of the Cascades for the planting of trees. The soils and the annual temperature ranges were more than adequate for apple growing, but rainfall was scarce. Expensive irrigation projects were necessary to water this desert, and road and railroad expansion was required to get the apples to distant markets. \"Washington apples cost more to produce than eastern apples,\" Van Lanen tells us. \"Irrigation and transportation to urban markets over three thousand miles away added to the cost of production. Why should a consumer pay three times as much for a Washington apple, when local apples could be purchased for a fraction of the price?\" (4) Despite these barriers, the state's apple growers found success, and \"today, Washington is synonymous with apples, just as Idaho is with potatoes, and Georgia with peaches\" (4).Chapter 1 surveys the introduction and earliest plantings of apples in the state and the first starts at commercial production during the last decades of the nineteenth century. The boom-and-bust cycle of the regional mining industry meant sharp spikes in the demand for apples were followed by equally dramatic drops when mines were not operating. It was an unsteady market from which to build a sustainable industry. Chapter 2 addresses the complicated relationships among railroads, private irrigation companies, and real-estate developers as they sought to develop the Yakima and Wenatchee valleys, and their mixed success in creating a landscape where orchards might succeed. Chapter 3 examines the struggles novice apple growers faced in developing the orchard management practices necessary for success. The growing problem of pest management was among the most vexing challenges. Chapter 4 explores the challenges of picking, packing, and shipping necessary to get the fruit to market, including the problem of labor and the innovation of the softwood apple crate, which set the state's fruit apart from the barreled apples of the East. Chapters 5 and 6 examine marketing and the economic challenges depression and war imposed. A final chapter provides a brief survey of developments since the 1950s, an era that Van Lanen describes as one of \"hyperindustrialization,\" characterized by consolidation, new chemical inputs, and new dwarfing rootstocks, among other innovations. Yet more work needs to be done on this important period in the history of the apple, which deserves a full-length study of its own, as changes in labor practices and storage technologies, increasing consumer interest in organic alternatives, and the integration into global apple markets dramatically transformed the Washington apple industry in these years. Throughout these chapters, Van Lanen introduces the stories of specific Washington growers and industry advocates, which helps to ground the larger changes she describes in personal experience.The Washington Apple is an important contribution to the history of orchard agriculture in America, a subject that has received much less attention than the history of grains and other annual crops. This book is useful to historians of agriculture, business, and the environment, and it would also be a suitable work to include in undergraduate and graduate classes in these fields.",

It did so by breeding flies in factories, sterilizing them with radiation, and scattering them from the air. Based on original multisite archival research, this article examines the overlooked role of Mexico in what was a flagship application of the “sterile male technique.” It argues that three main factors shaped this role: Mexico's long-term projects of agricultural and atomic modernization; diplomatic leverage provided by a shared border; and an earlier tradition of bilateral cooperation and conflict over animal disease that stretched back to the 1940s. The analysis deepens our understanding of how Mexico shaped science and agriculture at home and abroad. It also helps explain why this particular project of atomic agriculture succeeded on the scale it did.",

These analyses have endeavored to show how farmers were ultimately persuaded by the scientifico-progressivist logic ofthe Department of Agriculture and accepted the productionist messages of agricultural scientists relayed through county extension and Farm Bureau agents. Farmers who at first resisted the organizing efforts ofthe fed? eral government came to prefer the ideals of production agriculture over so? cial activism as a response to unsatisfactory economic circumstances. Prior research has focused on the way Progressive doctrine was wedded to farmers so that they came to be incorporated as citizens ofthe nation.1 While the changing roles and behaviors of farmers are examined, the way that space, place, and mobility interact within a shifting rural-urban milieu is sometimes lost. The ideological content of movement and migration can acquire a multiplicity of meanings, from brave pioneer to shiftless vagrant.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Native Americans and white ranchers/farmers in eastern Montana and western South Dakota have often been in conflict over natural resources, such as water and grazing lands. But in the 1970s, the two groups began to develop a common interest in protecting the rural environment from large-scale development. Since the 1980s, they developed a series of interethnic environmental alliances that successfully opposed coal and uranium mines, bombing ranges, and other \"outside\" threats to their lands and cultures. A common defense of the local place provided a path out of historic natural resources conflicts. Alliances tended to be initiated by traditionalist and activist Native Americans who strongly asserted their tribal identity at the same time as they built bridges to white neighbors around common environmental concerns. This approach simultaneously strengthened a recognition of difference and similarities between Native and non-Native communities. The grassroots alliances promoted a territorially based, multiethnic \"place membership\" to build cooperation across racial lines, rather than state-sponsored \"reconciliation\" programs. Continuing cultural and economic differences made individual alliances difficult to sustain, although the series of alliances progressively improved relations between certain local communities.",

    "abstract": "This paper compares the levels of violence and law breaking on the cattle frontiers of the northern Great Plains of North America and the Northern Territory of Australia during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It argues that various conditions peculiar to frontiers such as sparse settlement, gender imbalance, the absence of infrastructure, the weakness of traditional Old World institutions, and racism lowered respect for authority and made law enforcement extremely difficult. The author suggests that the truth of the latter thesis is bolstered by the fact that at the same moment in history the people in these two societies discarded conventional rules and values as they built their pastoral industry—literally a world apart.",

Between the years 1871 and 1877, Treaties 1 through 7 were signed in the Northwest Territories, or what are now the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. E. H. Meredith, the deputy minister ofthe new Department ofthe Interior, became responsible for drafting policy on matters concerning Indian affairs in Canada. Never having visited the West, and having no knowledge ofthe cultures his policies would affect, Meredith turned to his acquaintances to provide the advice that would directly determine the future of Canada's Plains aboriginal cultures. Among his advisors was Alfred Selwyn, director ofthe Geological Survey of Canada and one-time visitor to the West. Selwyn suggested that a hardy race of domestic cattle be introduced in areas in which the buffalo were already absent.. .because the Plains people cared well for the horses they raised, there was good possibility that they could become content pastoral people, the change being the natural gradation from the hunter to the agriculturalist.1 Treaties 1 and 2, signed in 1871, however, made no mention of imple? ments or farm animals necessary to establish an agriculture-based commu? nity where none previously existed. In 1871 the Cree chief Sweet Grass addressed Adam Archibald, the lieutenant governor of Manitoba, and requested cattle, tools, agricultural implements, and assistance in everything when we come to settle?our country is no longer able to support us.2",

With an emphasis on easily accessible sources, this article examines Wisconsin’s state seal, designed in 1851. The article places Wisconsin’s seal in the context of all the antebellum state seals to better interpret its symbolism. In so doing it uncovers an intriguing sectional difference between northern and southern seals—an absence of working white men as symbols in nearly all southern seals adopted after 1790. In this context, the Wisconsin seal stands as an example of the free white democracy’s values. The article concludes with a brief discussion of ways these symbols can be used in the classroom and by scholars to examine broader themes, including a comparison to the commemorative state quarters issued at the turn of the millennium.",

Between 1880 and 1930, Wichita Falls entrepreneur Joseph Kemp dreamed of an agrarian Eden on the Texas rolling plains. Kemp promoted reclamation and conservation and envisioned the Big Wichita River Valley as the \"Irrigated Valley.\" But the process of bringing dams and irrigation ditches to the Big Wichita River ignored knowledge of the river and local environment, which ultimately was key to making these complex systems work. The boosters faced serious ecological limitations and political obstacles in their efforts to conquer water, accomplishing only parts of the grandiose vision. Ultimately, salty waters and poor drainage doomed the project. While the livestock industry survived and the oil business thrived in the subsequent decades, the dream of idyllic irrigated farmsteads slowly disappeared.",

    "abstract": "The focus of this paper is upon the economic benefits and costs of the Colum? bia Basin Project in the Pacific Northwest. The purpose is to compare earlier perceptions about these benefits and costs with more recent views. Contempo? rary assessments reflect changing values and hindsight. In the case of the Co? lumbia Basin Project, the reclamation benefits originally were viewed as the most valuable. In some early proposals, the value of electricity was viewed as unimportant, or as a secondary, less valuable benefit because of the low de? mand at that time. The anticipated value of other benefits such as flood control, navigation, recreation, and downstream benefits varied.1 In hindsight, many environmental costs were ignored or unforeseen, and the value of recreational benefits, underestimated. This article attempts to assess whether, and to what extent, the Columbia Basin Project met earlier expectations, and how later views differed from earlier perceptions. Quantification of these benefits and costs, especially benefits, has been imprecise in much of the literature. Need? less to say, changing societal values complicate the picture.",

The portrayal of the range-cattle industry in nineteenth-century Wyoming reinforced this image. Cattlemen eliminated rustlers, even hired killers such as Tom Horn, and fought sheepmen for control of the range, then turned their aggression against farmer/settlers. In the classic western, Shane, for example, the setting is central Wyoming where Jack Schaefer's protagonist confronts the grasping rancher, Ryker, and his hired gunslinger, Wilson. It sharply draws the line between good and evil, the civilized farmer and the primitive rancher. The sod-busters are no match for Ryker's power and strong-arm tactics, as Wilson proves when he murders one of the farmers. Shane confronts Wilson and Ryker in the local saloon, and says to Ryker, Your kinda days are over. After Shane's revenge by gunning down Wilson and Ryker, Shane rides off into the mountains taking his aura of violence with him, and one assumes that the vindicated farmers will prosper unmolested by the cattlemen.1",

At about 9:30 in the morning, before the farmers and irrigators started their work, Elder Orson Pratt of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles made few introductory remarks. Then he returned thanks, . . . consecrated and dedicated the land to the Lord; & entreated his blessings on the seeds about to be planted; & on our labors in this valley.1 Pratt and Willard Richards organized committees to carry out the various tasks. A committee of five selected land; a committee of three superintended the stock, plows, and drags; another committee of three rigged up scythes to cut the grass; and Stephen Markham managed the stock.

    "abstract": "pattern evolved rapidly during the last few decades, its roots extend well into the past. Twentieth-century scholars have generated a rich literature on the evolution of fully owned farms and on tenant farmers who own none of their land. These scholars have had much less to say, however, about the rise of the part-owner. In 1900, the Federal Census of Agriculture revealed for the first time the incidence of part-owners. In Michigan, for example, part-owner was the smallest of the three major tenure categories. Just under 8 percent of farm operators were part-owners in 1900, while 74 percent were full-owners and 16 percent were tenants. That tenure structure remained virtually unchanged for some time; in the Michigan of 1940, 71 percent of the farm operators were full-owners and 11 percent were part-owners. Since World War II, however, the farm scene has been transformed and land tenure is no exception. The 1992 Agricultural Census reported that 35",

Les changements qui ont touche Hancock County sont exemplaires de l'integration rapide du Midwest dans une economie industrielle controlee par un capitalisme de monopole, boulversant les relations socioeconomiques traditionnelles. Le processus de civilisation qui a accompagne cette integration des regions rurales a l'economie et la culture nationales a modifie profondement les modes d'autorite. L'emergence d'un espace social conflictuel marque par la construction de nouvelles ideologies de classes et de genres est revelateur d'une societe rurale en changement et d'une transition des modes de regulation des conflits, de l'autorite communautaire (basee sur la famille, l'Eglise et l'ecole) vers l'autorite civile de l'Etat. Ces ideologies emergentes correspondent en fait aux ideaux de propriete de la classe moyenne et aux modeles de comportement et de relation intersexe de la bourgeoisie.",

    "abstract": "The Progressive Era saw tremendous growth in the Midwest. Immigration, migration, and economic development resulted in urban areas along the Missouri River like Sioux City; Omaha; St. Joseph; Kansas City, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; and St. Louis. Gathering water from states as diverse as Montana and Missouri, the Missouri River watershed carried wastes from a diverse economy that included agriculture, packing plants, milling, and manufacturing. The Missouri and its tributaries not only flushed waste but also provided the drinking water for this fast-growing population. During the Progressive Era, pollution pressures on the river reached critical mass, prompting concern among citizens, sanitarians, and public health officials. Two definitions of the Missouri River emerged in the Progressive Era: I call them the Economic River and the Healthy River. These definitions never materialized, but the visions were significant. Historians have given the Eco? nomic River substantial attention; the Healthy River has received less notice. By looking at three progressive organizations?the Kansas City Commercial Club, the Missouri River Sanitary Conference, and the Missouri Valley Pub? lic Health Association?the Missouri River and public health issues will be used to examine regionalism. In an 1885 speech given at the Missouri River Convention held in Kansas City, Missouri, a navigation supporter boastfully proclaimed that the Mis? souri River held the healthiest water in the world. As the river tumbled and rolled from the mountains, filled with sand and gold dust, he reasoned that its",

L'A. montre comment ce programme, concu par l'elite affairiste exclusivement blanche et masculine de Longview, fut incapable d'assurer une cooperation effective et efficace a travers les acteurs essentiels de cette relation que furent les Blancs pauvres, les Noirs, et les femmes. La depression rurale et l'inefficacite du programme Co-operation furent le resultat non seulement des faiblesses structurelles generales, mais egalement des inegalites locales marquees par les prejuges raciaux, sociaux et de genre de la classe economique de Longview, dont la Chambre de Commerce n'a jamais envisage de cooperer reellement avec les Afro-americains ou les femmes. Le programme Co-operation fut purement opportuniste et dirige vers les interets de la classe dominante de Longview, leur interet pour l'economie locale s'evaporant des la decouverte de petrole en 1930.",

    "abstract": "To investigate link between water and rural community in American West leads step by step to federal reclamation. In vast arid regions of West, question of agricultural settlement?of who farmed land?was irrevocably linked with question of who had and continued to have access to irrigation water. To answer one was to answer other. At same time, during relatively recent historical era spanning twentieth cen? tury, federal reclamation was most viable, and in many cases, only viable source of irrigation water. Who secured, and retained, access to federal irrigation water, and as a consequence ability to farm, had a profound ef? fect, therefore, on make-up of agricultural settlement and by extension, on character of rural community in West. From earliest days of federal reclamation, its proponents often east it as a tool to be used in cause of social reform. These supporters of reclamation argued that it furthered agrarian values, epitomized by family farm, in clash with capitalist ethos driving agribusiness. On other hand, historians of agricultural settlement in arid American West, among them Donald Pisani, have argued that federal reclamation, though touted as a revolutionary tool for social change, was, in fact the ally of large-scale, corporate agriculture rather than family farm. At same time, how? ever, Pisani has cautioned environmental historians that adopting a black-",

Instead, the schools had to pay fifteen cents per 1,000 gallons of clean water. The St. Joe offered no public explanation, but even the Newsy a reliably pro-business paper in the neighboring town of Farmington, vociferously criticizedthis action.1 The timing of this choice on the part of the mining company is curious. Water in southeast Missouri certainly was plentiful. In fact, the water that the St. Joe and other mining companies provided to local communities constantly had to be pumped out of the mines to prevent flooding. Furthermore, the decision to cut free water service to the public schools came at a high point of industry expansion and prestige. The first three decades of the twen? tieth century were a boom time for the lead-mining industry in southeast Mis? souri. One newspaper called St. Francois County, the heart of Missouri's old",

It argues that scholars must continue to struggle with the issue of which stories to tell publicly and which to keep private. The author discusses her own experience telling stories about rural women in the 1970s and the need to give voice to the heritage of rural women, especially of groups that have feared revealing their experiences. She offers examples of historians of rural women who have successfully worked with formerly silenced populations and urges historians to continue to tell stories about these lives, to reevaluate what has been already learned, to ask new questions, and to discuss which secrets need to be shared.",

    "abstract": "This article uses Barra do Piraí as a case study of rural land tenure, production, consumption, and labor in Brazil's Middle Paraíba Valley during the half century following abolition of slavery in 1888. Dairy farming and railroad development distinguished Barra do Piraí from other coffee-producing areas that suffered from ecological devastation. By 1900 the land's loss of fertility precluded further plantation agriculture in Barra do Piraí, leading to the transition from lucrative coffee cultivation to dairy farming based on meager capital inputs. Compared to the earlier coffee culture, dairy farms produced only modest wealth for landlords and required fewer laborers, compelling impoverished tenants to migrate in search of employment. Since Barra do Piraí was an important railroad junction, many rural laborers ended up in the locale after using the railroad as a migratory path. At the same time, the railroad and proto-industries that it stimulated provided alternative employment for rural laborers, thereby partially mitigating the leverage landlords had over the abundant labor force. The availability of industrial and proto-industrial employment created occupational diversity among rural tenants and introduced them to work routines that would become commonplace when the region more fully industrialized after 1940.",

California growers argued they needed access to a flexible and cheap labor supply during the “managed crisis” of the harvest. At the same time, they aggressively pursued business strategies that would regularize production and marketing. However, the commercialization of agriculture made them more vulnerable to boycotts by the United Farm Workers Union, which forced California growers to deal with unionism during the late 1960s. Growers temporarily embraced collective bargaining legislation as a way of derailing farm unionism and regaining control over their managerial and marketing prerogatives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A new thirst for paint and color in cities made extensive flax production profitable in the northern Great Plains and Prairies and contributed to the cultivation of the most fragile grassland ecosystems. The production of flax seed for linseed oil became an early spin-off of the Prairie wheat economy but, unlike wheat, flax vanished from old land after one or two rotations and reappeared in districts with the most new breaking. Officials explained the migrant crop as preparing native grasslands for cultivation or exhausting soil in old land, but farmers brought flax to their new breaking for other reasons. Producers would only put flax on any land when a range of economic and environmental conditions were in place. It was never sown without promise of adequately high prices or in the absence of affordable seed and other inputs. When price allowed, it usually appeared on new breaking because it could be planted later and transported further without upsetting the balance of other activities and without farmers learning many new techniques. Scientists discovered that diseased soil drove flax off old land, not soil exhaustion. Circumventing the disease was possible but costly, and farmers simply replaced flax with the next most lucrative commodity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study follows the thread of gender divisions in dairying in Denmark and the American Midwest in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Gender organization of dairying shifted at this time in diverse European and North American contexts. As agriculture mechanized and production scale increased, access to advanced education and international markets became critical. Women, who had been in the forefront of the development of dairying, ceded their leadership to men as these changes occurred. While some scholars see this shift as a strategic loss for women, this study finds that variables of class, marital status, rural demographics, and alternative occupations mediated the rural women’s experience of change. Not all women experienced the change as a loss. The question of which women were invested in dairying is critical to understanding the course of change. Increasingly, middle-class farm women were turning away from the hard work of dairying and investing themselves in new ways in the upward mobility of their family farms. Rural life shaped distinct gender patterns in European and American history, and the rural experience shaped the larger trajectory of women’s economic and political evolution, even though few rural women were involved in the organized women’s movement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Five historians who have used oral history to study the rural South assess the ways that oral history methodology and content have complicated our understanding of the region’s agricultural past. They explore two major themes: first, the ways that the information gathered in oral history interviews revealed the diversity and complexity of the rural South and second, how the dialectical process of the interview—the give and take between interviewer and informant—shaped their interpretation of that rural past. Sharpless and Jones examine new content gained through interviews with German Americans and plantation managers, who have been excluded from most studies. Through their personal experiences, Petty and Schultz consider the ways in which relationships between interviewer and interviewee shape the narrative, often obviating differences of class and particularly race. Walker frames the discussion from her experiences in interviewing a variety of rural Southerners.",

It argues that scholars must continue to struggle with the issue of which stories to tell publicly and which to keep private. The author discusses her own experience telling stories about rural women in the 1970s and the need to give voice to the heritage of rural women, especially of groups that have feared revealing their experiences. She offers examples of historians of rural women who have successfully worked with formerly silenced populations and urges historians to continue to tell stories about these lives, to reevaluate what has been already learned, to ask new questions, and to discuss which secrets need to be shared.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Both missionaries and government policymakers in colonial Zimbabwe consciously identified agriculture as an important avenue in establishing broader paradigms of explanation. Missionary promotion of new farming practices inevitably challenged the existing spiritual landscape by insisting that rationalized individual labor could overcome powerful natural forces. This article examines various facets of the American-based Methodist Episcopal Church’s agricultural evangelism in a period of growing state intervention. Despite careful missionary attempts to manage the outcomes, individuals with their own agendas absorbed and transformed these policies. Local farmers utilized imported agricultural knowledge for their own purposes and did not conform to the experiences or expectations of American-trained agricultural missionaries. Within these mission communities, converts successfully blended new forms of worship with existing social priorities and also adapted aspects of imported farming techniques to actively create innovative strategies for negotiating life under colonial rule.",

To this end, Truman created the high profile President’s Commission on Migratory Labor in American agriculture in 1950. In its report, the commission recommended extending a variety of social legislation and economic protections to domestic farm labor, and it further recommended slowing or ending the importation of foreign, particularly Mexican, workers. The Truman administration energetically worked to convince Congress to act on those recommendations, even enlisting the support of the Mexican government. However, the power of growers’ interests and the conservative bloc in Congress halted any significant reform. Instead, the Bracero Program was further institutionalized in the form of Public Law 78 and remained in effect for more than a decade thereafter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Having been evicted from their farms because of incentives created by the New Deal’s Agricultural Adjustment Act, sharecroppers in Arkansas formed the bir acial Southern Tenant Farmers’ Union (STFU) in 1934. Led by socialists and radicals, the organization ultimately claimed upward of thirty thousand members and constituted an assault on the social, economic, and racial status quo of the South. Historians have celebrated the STFU, especially its commitment to biracial cooperation and equality. This article digs beneath this carefully constructed image of the union to scrutinize the internal dynamics of the movement. It revises a number of interpretations surrounding the STFU Although the greatest obstacles to the union’s success were external, it also faced internal divisions that diminished its efficacy. The STFU’s decentralized structure did not foster strong connections between leadership and membership, resulting in misunderstandings. But most importantly, the union struggled to live up to its creed of biracialism and equal treatment of African Americans. Ultimately, the STFU was less an aberration that tirelessly confronted the social and racial ills of the South and more an organization that reflected some of those ills even as it grappled with them.",

In California, AES aided agribusiness in its efforts to create a \"harmonious hierarchy\" that included a non-white laboring class. Records show that AES personnel contributed by helping to separate Native Americans from their land and water resources, prevent competition from immigrants from Asia, and Americanize non-whites.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper examines how the rise and fall of Polish agriculture affected the larger political and economic relationships among Poland and three key members of the western alliance--the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Federal Republic of Germany--in the first decade of the Cold War. This period is revealing precisely because the reversal of fortunes in the Polish agricultural economy required the Polish government and some western counterparts to maneuver through periods of both agricultural advantage and disadvantage. Agricultural strategies as means and ends motivated the Polish, British, West German, and American governments to actions that bent, stretched, and limited some well-established practices in Cold War relations across divided Europe. By explicating the political consequences of changing flows of agricultural exports and imports in one specific context, this essay serves as case study of the role of agriculture in the global context of the Cold War.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the second half of the nineteenth century, lumbermen logged the virgin pine forests of northern Michigan. The assumption was that the u plow would follow the axe, \"and agriculture would dominate the region as it did in the southern half of the state. When farming did not quickly take root, William James Beai and Liberty Hyde Bailey led an expedition of scientists and journalists on a trip across northern Michigan in June 1888 to collect botanical samples, to find a site for a state forest reserve, and to recommend appropriate farming enterprises. This essay contends that without a key reforestation advocate in Charles Garfield the explorers focused too much on the questions related to botany and agriculture. While agriculture would ultimately thrive in some parts of the cutover, much of the region was unsuitable for intensive farming. The failure of the scientists to convey these limits adequately in newspaper articles and subsequent reports allowed for their work to be used by agricultural boosters throughout the region. The result was a cycle of erosion, fire, and farm abandonment that proved to be a political problem in Michigan for the first three decades of the twentieth century.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the Great Depression, with conditions grim, entertainment scarce, and educational opportunities limited, many South Dakota farm women relied on reading to fill emotional, social, and informational needs. To read to any degree, these rural women had to overcome multiple obstacles. Extensive reading (whether books, farm journals, or newspapers) was limited to those who had access to publications and could make time to read. The South Dakota Free Library Commission was valuable in circulating reading materials to the state’s rural population. In the 1930s the commission collaborated with the USDA ’ s Extension Service in a popular reading project geared toward South Dakota farm women. This \"Reading in the Home\" program greatly increased reading opportunities and motivations. Of particular interest to rural women were tales of pioneer life featuring strong protagonists.Through these stories, farm women found validation and encouragement to persevere. Reading also broadened horizons and challenged assumptions. For the depression-era farm woman, reading books and other materials provided recreation, instruction, and inspiration in a discouraging time.",

Initially, members participated in appropriately ’’ feminine\" activities including Pork Queen contests, lard-baking contests, consultations with high school home economics instructors, and the distribution of promotional materials. By the late 1970s, however, members began to employ a new rhetoric shaped by their labor on the farm to claim an important stake in the production and marketing of commodities. They took responsibility for large-scale advertising campaigns, managed a growing budget, and became leaders within the IPPA.

    "abstract": "Abstract This article uses Barra do Piraí as a case study of rural land tenure, production, consumption, and labor in Brazil’s Middle Paraíba Valley during the half century following abolition of slavery in 1888. Dairy farming and railroad development distinguished Barra do Piraífrom other coffee-producing areas that suffered from ecological devastation. By 1900 the land’s loss of fertility precluded further plantation agriculture in Barra do Pir aí, leading to the transition from lucrative coffee cultivation to dairy farming based on meager capital inputs. Compared to the earlier coffee culture, dairy farms produced only modest wealth for landlords and required fewer laborers, compelling impoverished tenants to migrate in search of employment. Since Barra do Piraí was an important railroad junction, many rural laborers ended up in the locale after using the railroad as a migratory path. At the same time, the railroad and proto-industries that it stimulated provided alternative employment for rural laborers, thereby partially mitigating the leverage landlords had over the abundant labor force. The availability of industrial and proto-industrial employment created occupational diversity among rural tenants and introduced them to work routines that would become commonplace when the region more fully industrialized after 1940.",

Focusing on the processes of negotiation between women and men in farming families and rural communities, Íeth illuminated the relationship between women’s work and their power. Tracing the dense networks that connected farm families, she also showed how cooperation in work generated and sustained radical farm movements.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the proliferation of agricultural schools in Greece from 1922 to 1932 from a social, economic, and cultural perspective. It examines the role of the Greek vernacular language-demotic-and vernacular edu cation as tools for national and social integration. It investigates the links between the establishment of agricultural schools, the teaching of demotic in elementary school, and the integration in the labor market not only of thousands of unemployed Greek citizens, but also of approximately 1.2 million Asia Minor refugees who fled to Greece after 1922. The article examines whether limiting the Greek vernacular language to primary schools, with the continuation of both the dominant classical model of education and the use of purist (katharevousa) Greek in secondary edu cation, created the prerequisites for upward mobility through education or reproduced the existing social and financial inequalities in Greek society. EDUCATION POLICY REMAINS ONE OF the key variables in the way state governments respond to social or economic changes. After 1922 Greek society experienced an unprecedented proliferation of agricultural schools as well as dramatic social and economic changes. During the subsequent decade, the Greek nation dealt with the considerable pres sure of integrating massive waves of Asia Minor refugees into its social, national, and financial fabric. After 1922, using the exclusive criterion of religion, these people were forcibly exchanged with the extant Muslim GEORGE KRITIKOS received his BA in history and archaeology from Athens Univer sity.

This article differs from previous works by focusing on Fannie Cook and Marcus Al Murphy and their interactions with the sharecroppers. Cook, an affluent Jewish woman, and Murphy, an African-American member of the Com munist Party, both participated in the St. Louis Committee for the Reha bilitation of the Sharecroppers. After state officials removed the demonstra tors from the highways, Cook traveled to the Bootheel to observe conditions there and wrote a novel about what she saw. She also helped support the Sharecroppers' Camp, or Cropperville, a privately funded refuge for dis placed farmworkers. Murphy came to St. Louis in the mid-1930s to teach farmworkers how to organize. When the demonstrators went out onto the roadsides, he worked with labor organizations to collect and deliver sup plies. Ultimately, the connections between these urban supporters and rural protesters were personal, not ideological, reminding us that history is not about abstractions, but people.",

This well-known book, central to Finnish historiography and important for later studies on rural history, dealt with swidden agriculture in the Finnish interior. The article focuses on the intertwining of societal ideals, landscapes, and masculinity and shows the intersection of nationalist, class-based, and racial concep tions of the peasantry. Through this interpretation stressing manly ideals, Voionmaa ascribed the Finnish swidden society, traditionally regarded as primitive, a more recognized place in the nation's history.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the early twentieth century, American railroad companies faced new challenges. The railroad network had developed fully, broad political opposition was gaining teeth in new, enforceable federal legislation, and financial markets--first established to support railroad expansion--had begun to move beyond railroads. Railroad companies answered with a wide range of new managerial and scientific practices. Recent scholarship that goes beyond the traditional disciplinary separation of technological, political, managerial, economic, and scientific concerns has enabled historians to recognize that agricultural research pursued in concert with other institutions empowered railroads to address all of these challenges in the period between 1900 and 1930.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For over thirty years (1653-1685), Thomas Minor kept a diary recording his activities as a farmer in Stonington, Connecticut. This article uses Minor’s diary, the only extant document of its kind for the seventeenth century, to reconstruct key features of the colonial New England agrarian experience. Arguing that work played as significant a role as religion in shaping early New Englanders’ lives, the article examines not only how farming contributed to the Minors’ economic prosperity and independence, but also how its physical demands and seasonal rhythms shaped Thomas Minor’s world-view more generally. Agriculture provided an important context for Minor’s relations with his wife and sons, with nature, and even with a sense of his own mortality. Minor emerges as someone less interested in calculating profit and loss on his farm than in accomplishing a hard day’s work as a steward of the land that he hoped would support his family for generations to come.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Scholars have paid a great deal of attention to the Sharecroppers’ Roadside Demonstration by evicted farmworkers, who camped out along rural highways in Missouri’s southeastern Bootheel in January 1939. This article differs from previous works by focusing on Fannie Cook and Marcus \"Al\" Murphy and their interactions with the sharecroppers. Cook, an affluent Jewish woman, and Murphy, an African-American member of the Communist Party, both participated in the St. Louis Committee for the Rehabilitation of the Sharecroppers. After state officials removed the demonstrators from the highways, Cook traveled to the Bootheel to observe conditions there and wrote a novel about what she saw. She also helped support the Sharecroppers’ Camp, or Cropperville, a privately funded refuge for displaced farmworkers. Murphy came to St. Louis in the mid-1930s to teach farmworkers how to organize. When the demonstrators went out onto the roadsides, he worked with labor organizations to collect and deliver supplies. Ultimately, the connections between these urban supporters and rural protesters were personal, not ideological, reminding us that history is not about abstractions, but people.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article investigates the links between market-oriented activities and subsistence production among peasant farmers in the Thyolo and Mzimba districts in Malawi from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s. The two districts were chosen because of their differences in terms of land-labor ratios, quality of soils, and structure of market engagement. Exploring the different paths of agrarian change in these two districts demonstrates that they were dependent on the structure of market engagement and its effects on the supply and flexibility of labor. African agricultural history is best understood when agricultural systems are viewed in connection to the overall economic activities of rural households. More simply put, the dynamics of agrarian change in rural Africa cannot be understood without linking such changes to the wider economy and their impact on local labor processes.",

It considers the role and value of government science first in attempting to solve a problem that continues to affect New Zealand farmers, killing according to one estimate between 10 and 15 percent of their stock annually. Second, it addresses a related problem that has a much longer history of human poisoning, but that turned out to have quite unexpected causes in New Zealand. From this analysis, the historic bases on which present-day science funding policies were \"reformed\" in the 1990s are questioned.",

Using triangulation surveys, engineer Charles Southworth produced a series of maps that abetted the enactment of the Florence-Casa Grande Project of 1916. Using a combination of Pima voices and modern GIS analysis substantiates that the Pima were versatile in responding to severe water deprivation a century ago and adapted by scaling back the amount of land they cultivated, eliminating the least productive lands from cultivation, and relocating or abandoning villages. More critically, the Pima shifted their agrarian practices from waterintensive crops to less crops, such as small grains. Letting Pima voices speak for themselves gives credence to an indigenous perspective of these traumatic events. Thus, combining a Pima voice and modern technology illustrates the depth of hardship facing the Pima a century ago",

It aims to show how early twentieth-century Finnish historical studies articulated manly ideals, mainly by looking at \"The History of Karelian\" Tribe in Finland published in 1915 by Väinö Voionmaa. This well-known book, central to Finnish historiography and important for later studies on rural history, dealt with swidden agriculture in the Finnish interior. The article focuses on the intertwining of societal ideals, landscapes, and masculinity and shows the intersection of nationalist, class-based, and racial conceptions of the peasantry. Through this interpretation stressing manly ideals, Voionmaa ascribed the Finnish swidden society, traditionally regarded as primitive, a more recognized place in the nation’s history.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In Southern California, regional and national myths of agrarian life as pastoral became entwined with paternalistic policy and racialized visions of the Mexican laborer. Re-worked in the context of the New Deal and increasing strike activity across California after 1928, these rural myths and policies shaped plans for the resettlement of Mexican-American workers in self-sustaining villages within Los Angeles County. Under the direction of government officials, reformers, and employers, these plans articulated diverse ideologies and agendas: the New Dealer’s commitment to reform and rehabilitation through planning and paternalism, and the employer’s drive to segregate and racialize labor under a pastoral ideal. Yet the village schemes foundered; weakened by employers’ lack of commitment to worker welfare and fears of rural sedition, by the inconsistencies of the New Deal rehabilitation policy, and by an inability to manipulate the realities of agribusiness. This failure bore testimony to the mythic nature of an agrarian tradition in California.",

It examines the role of the Greek vernacular language—demotic—and vernacular education as tools for national and social integration. It investigates the links between the establishment of agricultural schools, the teaching of demotic in elementary school, and the integration in the labor market not only of thousands of unemployed Greek citizens, but also of approximately 1.2 million Asia Minor refugees who fled to Greece after 1922. The article examines whether limiting the Greek vernacular language to primary schools, with the continuation of both the dominant classical model of education and the use of \"purist\" (katharevousa) Greek in secondary education, created the prerequisites for upward mobility through education or reproduced the existing social and financial inequalities in Greek society.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article compares two episodes of technology transfer in the 1890s: the movement of bright tobacco production technology to south-central Africa with the spread of the crop to eastern North Carolina and South Carolina. It finds similarities in the people who introduced the crop, but significant differences in the methods used to produce it. This is troubling because the type is defined by the cultivation and especially the curing techniques used to produce it; it is also often described in the historical literature as \"Virginia tobacco,\" even when grown elsewhere. The technological differences are the product of different environments, which include not only the climate but also many elements of the technological system beyond immediate human control: the availability and organization of labor, differences in market structures and marketing institutions, and the government incentives provided to buyers. Therefore, this essay takes as its subject the paradox inherent in the official classification of tobacco types regulated by the USDA and argues that varietal types represent a form of market regulation disguised as botanical taxonomy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Accompanying the expansion of modern beef production in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were technologies and methods that proponents assumed were applicable to all ecosystems. Successes in Europe, the United States, and Argentina convinced ranchers, investors, and animal scientists that these could be applied in the tropical Americas with ease. This assumption contributed to a wave of foreign ranching investment in semi-tropical Mato Grosso, Brazil, beginning in the early twentieth century. However, such a view failed to consider the specific characteristics of such environments and led to difficulties for several ventures and a re-evaluation of the relationship between ecosystems and the type of ranching appropriate to them. Ultimately, local Brazilian practice and experimentation proved more successful in tropical and semi-tropical Brazil, forcing foreign ranching concerns to adapt their techniques. Following the logic of earlier decades, more recently cattle-raising practices developed in Mato Grosso and similar regions have been applied in the tropical Amazon, resulting in widespread ecological devastation.

    "abstract": "Rodeo: An Animal History deftly chronicles the development of rodeo as both a sport and a symbolic reenactment of struggling against the land from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day. Focusing on the animal participants exposes the inherent contradictions of adapting this supposedly quintessentially western sport to modern times. In a region long defined by entrenched nostalgia crashing into changing realities, “tradition” has served as a comforting and familiar means of justifying the persistence of that which leaves open wounds on animals, people, and even the land itself. Nance's nuanced examinations of how events like bronc and bull riding developed into their modern iterations are revealing and unsettling. Sure, there are interesting stories of individual animals who left imprints on the sport. But the bigger contribution of the book is much deeper and far darker, exposing the problematic and often tenuous connections to the past that rodeo is supposed to represent. It is a blunt but needed critique of the idea that this “heritage” does no harm. Before I opened this book, I already knew from personal experience that ranch life was harder than material shortcomings and routine injury, and that rodeo was not the reality of ranch work. Perhaps no single book has brought so vividly home the idea that living something and knowing its history are two different things.The first time I spurred a horse around three barrels in front of a crowd, I was nine (fig. 1). It was a small, local event held every summer at the ranch just down the single-lane, only recently paved road from the one where three generations of my father's family lived. My vague and perhaps flawed memory is that I had recently seen Charmayne James at the Cow Palace. I treasured a set of trading cards that featured top Pro Rodeo contestants of the early 1990s, including James, the first “million-dollar cowgirl” of the decade, and her horse, Scamper. The problem with trying to become a great barrel racer on a working ranch was that there was no time for such things. There were cows to milk, fences to mend, grain sacks to sew, chickens to pluck, hay to stack, canning to do. Time to practice barrel racing was a luxury I didn't get to call “work” or sport.Most of the 1,200 acres of our ranch were hillsides. The fields that were flat enough to run a horse on were planted with pumpkins or hay. Steel oil drums were never where I needed them. Between harvest and planting I made courses by stacking half-eaten green and orange pumpkin rinds in three piles and rode patterns around them. My little horse, Belle, knew more about it than I did, having been professionally trained in the life she had before she was mine. She was also trained in cutting—separating a cow from a herd and dashing in any direction necessary to keep it there. In a contest between moving around stationary objects in a pattern or chasing after a cow that crossed her line of vision, the latter almost always won. That was how a lot of our “practice sessions” ended. So I competed in only a handful of rodeos but always, in ways I couldn't quite articulate, believed they were teaching me something that was supposed to make life growing up on a ranch more comprehensible.Our lives were hardscrabble, scraping-by work, with seemingly little reward. Just a few miles from the tech-boom of Silicon Valley and the modernity of San Francisco, we lived without heat or consistent running water, never mind television or other modern amenities. We worked in ways, I was told, people had worked during the decades and centuries before us, because we were trying to hold onto something—something threatened by the little groups of protestors who gathered outside the rodeo grounds wearing their PETA and Greenpeace T-shirts, holding their signs, expressing their anger. “It's not fun for the animals” is what I remember being screamed at me most often, through the open window of the beat-up truck that pulled a decrepit two-horse trailer. They knew nothing about my life just up the road.Becoming a historian of the West forced me to wrestle with uncomfortable questions about the truths of my childhood, shaped often by the very real hardships of the life my parents and grandparents chose. At some level I always understood the West to be a mythic place; at the same time, it was also my formative reality. It is harder to untangle the legend from the reified when they reinforce each other. The memorial poster of Lane Frost riding Red Rock tacked on my bedroom wall was as real as the arena dust that covered my boots or the tears that stung my eyes when I was injured.Rodeo: An Animal History offers vivid insight to the complexities of this history, even—or perhaps especially—for someone who grew up on the defensive for having lived it. Others will no doubt sing its much-deserved praises as a thoughtful, carefully researched exploration of the intersections between struggling against the land as much as for it, and the ways rural political identities have formed against gender, social, and economic mores. Nance lays bare the impacts of generational traumas set against these real and imagined landscapes, played out in ways that are often profoundly disconnected from their origins. Recognizing that the West is “a place existing both in the past and the present” gives us a way to understand these intersections (7). I expected all of that, academically speaking. I was not quite so prepared to see myself in these pages.“For those seeking self-reliance in the West, life on the land was defined by hard work and suffering,” Nance explains, “which differentiated the real cowboys and cowgirls from city people and tourists” (11). Rodeo has always been a performative ideology, “a way to tell stories for local and distant audiences about western history and myth” (7). The defining line between myth and reality blurs when those knowingly performing one understand it as the other—when the stories are as much about the mythic frontier of the 1890s as the idea of it that persisted in the 1990s. Reified nostalgias inform identity politics that play out in disparate arenas—rodeo and political—across the country, obscuring the ways both people and animals were ideally of the land but increasingly alienated from it. While “rodeo . . . traded on the ideal of western self-sufficiency and intimate knowledge of the land and its animals,” by the early twentieth century “these relationships were increasingly defined by pavement” (102). The same was true for the ranchers who battled against changing times and external forces.Nance exposes some of the myriad ways in which industrialization, so long viewed as the antithesis of western heritage, has been long a part of it. In the shadow of the growth of corporate farming and animal production, family operations suffered real hardships. Rodeo mirrored familiar conflicts between the ideal of self-reliant frontier individualism and the reality of modern capitalism. At points when the realities of rodeo might have threatened to expose such disjuncture—urban-born cowboy stars who traveled by airplane, livestock used in ways never required by ranch work—rodeo promoters wrapped it in the aura of an imagined past, giving it “a patina of tradition and altruism” that made it seem familiar, no matter how far removed from the realities of actual ranch life (127). Simultaneously, shifting political climates surrounding animal and environmental issues contributed to a growing “siege mentality” (155). This is perhaps most clearly articulated in two of rodeo's extremes: bull riding, at one end of the spectrum, popular because of its overt danger, and, at the other, ostensibly benign events featuring roping calves and “babies of the rodeo.”Bull riding did not exist in the nineteenth century, for good reason—it served no purpose. It developed in response to the modern pressures of the twentieth century, implying that a “bull rider's ethic could be seen as an extreme articulation of the broader western myth of resilience, bravery, and individual responsibility by and for young men” out to prove themselves (159). Without the supposed “western” heritage bona fides of bronc riding, it would have been unsustainable in the face of withering criticism and high rates of injury to both men and animals if not for the selective, intentional breeding of bulls that could be marketed as willing participants and individually identifiable animal athletes. Breeding larger, more consistent bucking stock fueled the elaborate myth that some animals could have intentionally “rejected life as an anonymous commodity suffered by most beef cattle” or wild horses (169).But not all rodeo animals can be accounted for by this “myth of consent” (165). While roping calves had perhaps the strongest link to family-run cattle operations, they expose another side of “the growing and serious environmental consequences of industrial animal agriculture” (179). Nance contends that pausing to acknowledge the reality of rodeo's most ostensibly tame events such as roping, in which rodeo people are rarely injured, exposes this double standard. “Babies of the rodeo” are almost never individualized; therefore their injuries are rarely noticed or remembered. The reality that the most innocent animal participants are treated as nameless commodities “forces us to contemplate not simply the roping but also the calf and the systems of animal and environmental interaction that lie beyond the local rodeo, in which we are all implicated” (179). Such arena events are represented as heritage, but current ranching practices make most roping unnecessary. It is just as far removed from the modern realities of cattle raising as bull riding has ever been.As a self-identified ranch kid, “rodeo person,” and professional historian of western myth, even I was caught somewhat off guard by the reality laid bare in this book. We ran several hundred head of cattle on my family ranch. I rounded up, sorted, castrated, branded, vaccinated, and auctioned. I never once swung a rope. I was never asked to. And it never occurred to me to question why—to acknowledge the contradiction between what, in reality, was and what, according to rodeo narrative, was supposed to be.Even as an adult long since gone from the ranch, I experienced a nostalgia verging on desperation at the thought of something lost when I imagined what rodeo claimed to represent—a time when ranching families like mine might have thrived instead of suffering because there was a piece of land that bore our generational imprint. I was surprised to have a book about rodeo animals lay so bare the simple brutal truth: those days were not just long-gone by the time I came along—they had never existed in such simplicity.As a historian, I knew I had lived some of this history without really learning it. Reading Rodeo: An Animal History was surreal, something of an out of body experience. It made me think not only of my first rodeo but my last, which was also held not far from my family ranch, though on a wider and more traveled road. I barrel raced on a Mustang bought from a Bureau of Land Management roundup auction (not knowing, then or until I read the book, that these wild horses had once composed a vast majority of rough stock in rodeos until poverty-stricken westerners rounded up so many of them it led to shortages). Before events began, the out-of-town rodeo organizer pulled contestants aside to explain what “looking western” meant to spectators. The fact that I belonged to the land nearby was not relevant, only my willingness to wear the right costume. I see that younger version of myself with different eyes now, looking down from my academic position and subsequent life experience. I see how she was shaped and also hurt by forces so much bigger than the land.Nance concludes that “we are all implicated in the history of rodeo and its contradictions,” including the inordinate power we still ascribe to myths of the American frontier (216). I know this is true, because these contradictions are my own. I left the ranch a long time ago, but somewhere in my closet is a pair of old boots still caked with the dirt of that past. Both the book and the realizations about how rodeo has played a part in propagating myths about heritage are unsettling and worth exploring for much the same reason: it didn't have to be this way.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines how Chilean nitrate fertilizer producers and their international marketing agents persuaded farmers in the US South to use nitrogen-rich mineral fertilizers mined from the Atacama Desert, even as cheaper synthetic fertilizers flooded agricultural markets in the early decades of the twentieth century. At the same time, it explores how agricultural experts working in the United States on behalf of Chile's nitrate industry (and increasingly the Chilean government itself) articulated not just connections between nitrogen and soil vitality but also underscored the importance of other mineral “impurities” to healthy plant development. Working in the US Cotton Belt in particular, many of these agents promoted a vision of pan-American ecological and economic interdependence, and through their racialized depictions of agricultural knowledge, they sought to convince US farmers of the unique “all-natural” attributes of Chilean nitrates. In reconstructing this history, the article reveals the far-reaching impact that Chilean fertilizers had on the modernization of US agriculture and advocates for a transnational approach to understanding that process in the early twentieth century. It also traces how the exchange of agricultural commodities and knowledge between Chile and the United States contributed to the emergence of intensive agriculture and what observers would later call the “green revolution.”",

    "abstract": "Miguel Ángel González-Quiroga's War and Peace on the Rio Grande Frontier, 1830–1880 is an important work of synthesis and original research concerning Anglo-American, European immigrant, and Mexican relationships on the US-Mexico borderlands. African Americans and Native Americans are also included in the study; however, the former receives limited attention and the latter are depicted as villains in the way of economic progress.González-Quiroga inserts his work within the historiographical debate over whether the Anglo-American and Mexican relationship was mainly one of conflict or cooperation. David Montejano's Anglos and Mexicans in the Making of Texas, 1836–1986 (1987) is the standard for grappling with this question. Montejano used an economic paradigm to understand shifting race relations over time and geography. Ranching economies led to more harmonious relationships and farming led to harsher ones. Eventually, a merchant and consumer economy helped end Juan Crow segregation. For González-Quiroga, binational trade and unity in subduing Native Americans through “cooperative violence” led to pragmatic relations that were ruptured at times by Anglo-American racist violence against Mexicans. Cooperative violence also occurred during rebellions and foreign invasions. Eventually, by 1880, both nation-states gained further control over the border regions, which allowed for binational economic integration and led to greater harmony between both groups.Gonzáles-Quiroga untangles the socioeconomic, political, and racial history of the borderlands through nine chapters using both a chronological and thematic approach. He follows a standard Texas history chronology, following the Texas Secession Movement, the Republic of Texas Era and War of North American Aggression of 1846–48, 1850s statehood, the US Civil War and French Intervention, and the defeat of Native Americans by 1880.Chapters 1 and 2 examine the tumultuous period of 1830–48, with the related conflicts of the Texas rebellion and the United States invasion of Mexico. Through diligent investigation, Gonzáles-Quiroga finds many examples of political and economic cooperation between Anglos and Mexicans that contrast with studies that solely focus on conflict. Chapters 2 and 3 examine strengthening ties between both groups during the 1850s, and chapters 4 and 5 look at how both the Civil War and the French Intervention led to cooperative violence in both conflicts as well as the cross-border economic opportunities that arose from the conflicts.The last three thematic chapters focus on the period of 1868–80. In “A Most Violent Decade,” González-Quiroga examines both state-sanctioned and extralegal violence to describe the period of the 1870s. He centers his description as an economic competition for land and cattle between Anglos, Mexicans, and Native Americans. He rightly notes labeling Mexicans as cattle thieves was a trope to justify violence and theft against them as noted by the Comisión Pesquisidora. González-Quiroga's use of the commission's research and findings is an important corrective to the historiographical distortion of the Cattle War / Skinning War trope that discursively hides the state-sanctioned violence against Mexicans in the Nueces Strip. As Armando Alonzo's Tejano Legacy (1998) has shown, statistical data concerning Mexican economic dominance bears out that most of the wealth in the late nineteenth century was held by Mexicans. Despite the violence, migration to the border region increased as González-Quiroga describes in “Between Hate and Harmony,” with population growth of US citizens in Mexico and Mexicans nationals in Texas. The final chapter, “Pacification and Economic Integration,” describes Porfirio Díaz's recognition of the United States after the Revolution of Tuxtepec (1876), a military defeat of Native Americans that led to the development of a transnational railroad network connecting both nations’ expanding economies.As noted in the introduction, the main weakness of González-Quiroga's work is his depiction of Native Americans as obstacles to economic progress because they are never afforded the same complex analysis given to Anglo-Americans, European immigrants, and Mexicans. Nonetheless, this book provides a nuanced examination of conflict and cooperation between Anglo-Americans and Mexicans that is often missing in other works.",

    "abstract": "During the peak of interest in botany and plant collecting in Britain from 1760 and 1820, a garden, in Clare Hickman's telling, could be many different things at once: farm, ornament, research center, social space, and menagerie. Productivity provided a common thread. The period under consideration in The Doctor's Garden was also one of imperial expansion that saw the ascendency of an ideology of improvement whereby human beings could, and should, bend nature to better their own lot. Attentive to these larger contexts, Hickman emphasizes the “world beyond the garden gate” to embed British gardens within the economic realities of the time, whether enclosure at home or resource extraction abroad, as well as within the social and cultural trends that motivated their cultivators (1).At the book's core lies a group of medical practitioners, including prominent surgeons, apothecaries, and physicians, who by establishing gardens that blended the functions mentioned above joined a transoceanic “medico-botanic network” at a busy moment in British history and the history of science (2). Such a perspective decenters Kew Gardens, which has occupied much work on late Georgian botany, in favor of gardens operated by professionals outside of the gentry or state bureaucracy that nonetheless contributed to knowledge production and exchange. Given the resources, time, and connections required to construct such spaces, the medical practitioners involved were typically wealthy and possessed institutional support, in contrast to the numerous irregular practitioners who also populated Britain's medical marketplace at the time. John Coakley Lettsom's estate at Grove Hill attracts considerable attention in the text, as do the lesser-studied gardens of John Fothergill, William Pitcairn, John Hunter, and Edward Jenner. In Hickman's eloquent narrative, these men embody the tension visible in their gardens between offering amusement and creating “an economic botany powerhouse, which could be financially valuable for the nation and the wider imperial project” (63). Often what emerged from this tension was a combination of polite and useful knowledge, especially visible in the example of Jenner's Temple of Vaccinia at his garden in Gloucestershire.Readers of this journal will find much to interest them in chapter 5, for example, where Hickman challenges distinctions between botany and agriculture as well as between farm and garden. In the author's view, eighteenth-century medical practitioners were “well placed to take . . . an essential scientific approach to agricultural improvement,” in large part due to their training, which included courses in chemistry, botany, and comparative anatomy (134). Edward Jenner and Humphry Davy, both well known within the medical realm, applied their skills to soil quality and fertilizer during their careers. Such experimentation could help grow medicinally useful plants such as rhubarb, but it also offered the prospect of solving the related problems of unemployment, wealth distribution, and trade deficit that afflicted the health of the nation metaphorically. Gardens offered spaces where these medical practitioners could attempt to devise practical responses to what they witnessed firsthand in their practices, such as the poverty that Lettsom observed in London's East End.Other chapters consider a range of topics rooted in the garden's multifunctional possibilities that nevertheless will appeal to scholars working outside of garden history. An emphasis on the role of the senses in botanical knowledge dissemination illustrates the garden as a teaching and research center intimately connected to the human body. The ways that owners constructed these gardens and allowed visitors required systems of management that, in turn, prompted new forms of labor and “class-based discrimination” as the number of visitors increased (80). How such gardens were presented to the public and cataloged in print also reflected the changing status and expectations of the medical profession by the early nineteenth century, as physicians like Lettsom sought to consolidate their newfound status as polite landowners. An epilogue connects this garden history to the heritage sector today and the future of the discipline of garden history.In addition to reading a variety of sources and the gardens themselves, Hickman pays attention to the archive, including who has been left out of it, as she leads readers through a rich medicinal and ornamental landscape over the book's six chapters. The available sources, however, only offer glimpses of the invisible labor inherent in these landscapes. Likewise, the British state appears obliquely in the account despite its support of so many of the networks discussed here. These open questions of labor and government illustrate some of the ways that The Doctor's Garden draws on the histories of medicine, science, environment, and empire to both advance garden history and contribute a more applied interpretation of gardens to those fields. Historians can expect to see gardens in a new light, as domestic spaces between the field and the laboratory significant for the “development of scientific ideas and practices in the early modern period” and closely tied to larger economic, cultural, and imperial processes (re)shaping Britain in the second half of the eighteenth century (11).",

    "abstract": "To publish a book titled The Real Agricultural Revolution at a time when scientists and policy makers are declaring the world to be on the cusp of a fourth agricultural revolution, might appear deliberately provocative. After all, historians are still debating the nature and existence of the first three agricultural revolutions and interrogating commentators’ motivations for declaring any event to be “revolutionary.” However, the authors of this volume are not interested in such debates and developments. Rather, their prime objective is to describe and explain the “real” and “unprecedented” increase in agricultural output that characterized the period 1939–85 in England.The authors openly acknowledge that they are not the first to grapple with this issue. Agricultural economists, scientists, and historians have already produced top-down accounts highlighting the effects of a supportive policy environment that channeled funds into scientific research, capital grants, agricultural education and extension services. Analyzing the situation more from below, historians of science and technology have examined the development of particular technologies and farming systems and how they shaped and were shaped by scientific agendas, farming practices, and human-animal relationships. Awarding primacy to technological change as the driver of output increases, The Real Agricultural Revolution attempts to bridge these perspectives.The authors develop their approach through the use of formerly unexamined historical source materials: the field books produced by Investigation Officers of the Farm Management Survey (FMS), a voluntary initiative that began in 1936 and continues to this day. Surviving fortuitously in a basement at the University of Exeter, the field books contain extensive statistical data relating to farms in South West England that were selected as typical for their size or type. The authors analyze this data in conjunction with farming publications, government papers, and gray literature to reveal farmers’ changing fortunes, enterprises, capital investments, and uses of labor and machinery. Excerpts from twenty-five oral history interviews conducted with survey participants are used to provide personal perspectives on these changes and to highlight the heterogeneity that is typically obscured by statistical records. Chapters are organized thematically to address particular aspects of the change process over the period 1939–85: the organization of agricultural science, the dissemination of its findings, the policy environment, changes in land and capital, the use of labor and machinery, and specialization and expansion. Dairy farming receives dedicated attention on account of its relevance to the region and importance to the nation as a whole. The decline of pigs and poultry as sideline activities is also examined.As a work of analysis, the volume falls short of realizing the authors’ aspirations to produce a history that is “a sociological one as much as it is an economic one” (12). The reality it purports to describe is defined in economic terms as increased agricultural output. The social reality of farmers’ lived experiences is far less apparent and rests on a very restricted source base of memories elicited by closed questioning about technological changes that the authors had already identified as important in raising output. Descriptions of technological innovation are also rooted in traditional economic approaches that privilege the act of adopting a new technology over how it was actually used. Historians of technology have demonstrated repeatedly that users often embraced different socio-technical imaginaries to those held by scientific, technical, and policy experts. Users could interpret, adapt, and maintain the same technology in quite different ways, and could sometimes deploy new innovations alongside older methods in ways that experts had not envisaged. It was the use of technology that determined changes in agricultural output, not the simple act of its adoption. Yet such uses, and what they reveal about the nonlinear nature of technological change and farmers’ agency to shape it, are not considered. Consequently the authors do not realize their ambitions to transcend traditional, top-down historical perspectives on postwar agricultural change.As a work of synthesis, however, The Real Agricultural Revolution is extremely successful. Its detailed description of the productionist heyday of British farming represents the most significant historiographical contribution since John Martin's The Development of Modern British Agriculture: British Farming since 1931 (2000). While its focus on South West England means that certain enterprises are omitted—notably arable farming, beef, and sheep production—the thematic organization of material, the authors’ accessible writing style, and their light-touch references to relevant theoretical approaches make chapters eminently useful. Individually and collectively, they offer an excellent entry point for students and interested members of the public, and a solid jumping-off point for future academic inquiry.",

    "abstract": "In the decades leading to the Civil War, Maryland's Southern proclivities and sympathies were strongest in the rural Eastern Shore, where some of the oldest and wealthiest families owned plantations fueled by slavery. In The People of Rose Hill: Black and White Life on a Maryland Plantation, Lucy Maddox details everyday life, individual biographies, and the interpersonal relationships on Rose Hill, an Upper South plantation on Sassafras Neck, through the 1840s. Maddox's study is unusual because it benefits from a woman's diary. Few such diaries remain from antebellum-era, midsize, mixed-farming plantations in a “middle state” like Maryland. As a result, The People of Rose Hill contributes an important and significant place-based perspective on a turbulent era in the nation's history.Maddox first establishes the poignancy of the antebellum era by casting forward to discuss the Emancipation Proclamation, the border states, and the Civil War. She then turns back in time to establish the history, setting, and characters of Rose Hill. The people enslaved to Thomas Forman, the owner of Rose Hill, lived during a critical historical moment “in which men like Forman acted on their belief that the future prospects of the country required a continuation not only of their energy, their skills, their legitimate desire to improve the lives of Americans, but also of the slave culture they had done so much to shape” (5). The people enslaved at Rose Hill, and those who interacted with them, of course, shouldered the implementation of Forman's ethos. The main characters include Forman (Revolutionary War hero, businessman, cad), Martha Ogle (reluctant bride, disappointed wife, attentive household manager), hired overseers and servants, and enslaved persons. Martha's diary is a treasure: her record of everyday life, in combination with family records and letters and archival records, aids in developing biographical portraits of real people who would otherwise be lost to history. Maddox reads between the lines in order to glean people's attitudes and interpersonal relationships, which is useful for understanding the motivations and strategies for behaviors and events discussed by Martha. In addition, Maddox addresses gaps in historical knowledge about Rose Hill by exploring broader practices through comparative material from other Eastern Shore plantations in Maryland.By recording daily activities and perceptions, Martha inadvertently insured that the people enslaved at Rose Hill would not be forgotten. Maddox draws on Martha's diary to reconstruct as much as she can about each enslaved person, especially their family relationships and where and when they worked at the plantation. Martha notes summoning doctors to attend to difficult births or ailing people, the talent of some individuals for certain tasks, and the ongoing laborious work facing her and the people she supervised. These provide a sense of what a day, a season, or a year was like at Rose Hill. There are also portraits of men, women, and children. For example, Martha described Rachel Allen Antigua in glowing terms, a “perfect” servant whom she moved from the fields into the house. She performed precisely as Martha wished and was adored for it. But the enslaved, however favored, were also their own people. Samuel Gilmore, a favorite of Thomas's who was trained to manage horses and accompanied him to races, executed a “French exit,” and despite Martha's belief that he would return, he never did.Maddox's study complements current literature that aims to restore agency to enslaved people. Closing the introduction, Maddox notes that “in spite of our best efforts . . . no matter how intensely we may examine an enslaved life, when we are done, we can still only wonder how close we have managed to come to the truth” (21). The critical irony, however, is that the source material makes it impossible not to return to Thomas and Martha as reference points. I was thus surprised that Maddox drew from the history, but not the archaeology, of Wye Plantation and related sites, which has added considerable primary source information about the lives of enslaved people. I also wondered about the integrity of the plantation home and its potential to yield information about life at Rose Hill. Maddox notes, however, that the plantation house has been remodeled several times and is now a private home. Since Rose Hill is not a museum, its story would be inaccessible to the public without Maddox's study. As a result, in The People of Rose Hill, Maddox provides not only an academic contribution but a public service in writing an accessible, fascinating study about real people living in challenging times.",

    "abstract": "Cultivating Community is a fascinating exploration of an understudied area of Canadian history. Nurse masterfully utilizes a plethora of archival and private materials in order to tell the century-long story of women's participation in local agricultural fairs in southern Ontario. This book offers an engaging interplay of macro and micro history, telling a broader history of women's movements and nationalism in Canada, while also offering colorful snapshots of many individual women's stories. The example of a woman cheating in the honey jarring competition by dyeing kerosene to look like the purest honey represents the type of colorful anecdote that brings this history to life. Nurse's work inspires the reader to look into their own local and familial past, for the ways in which women have made their mark through baking, handicrafts, and other pursuits.On the surface the idea of studying baked goods and produce might seem daunting. But Nurse creatively uses sources such as newspaper clippings and competition records to reconstruct women's participation in Ontario's agricultural fairs. Nurse writes lush descriptions of the fairs' events—from judging criteria to contestant presentation to the packaging and staging of organic materials—so that the reader can imagine themselves as participants, judges, and audience members. These narratives also provide detailed information about the social context within which this history takes place. For example, women were initially prohibited from participating in riding shows, but it became increasingly more common for women to demonstrate their horsemanship as they pushed more and more into the “public sphere.” The importance of rural reform, and women as the centers of rural family life, are repeated themes throughout the book. Nurse demonstrates how reformers utilized fairs to teach women about new homemaking technologies and encourage these women to compete for prizes and prestige for their prowess in fields that were seen as “women's expertise.” Winning competitions in these areas demonstrated how much of a “good” woman, wife, mother, and community member you were.In Cultivating Community Nurse goes beyond the typical written archival sources on which historians tend to rely. Many beautiful photographs of fairgoers, competitors, and handicrafts alike grace the pages of this book and enrich the reader's understanding of the fairs' material culture. These images display, for instance, the intricacies of a hand-darned sock and handmade lace and quilts, demonstrating evidence of skills with which the modern reader likely is unfamiliar. A quilt made with poorly cut fabric and messy stitching compared to one that was meticulously sewn with even stitching is very obvious when looking at comparison photos. In her analysis, Nurse brings a real appreciation of these skills and the work that these women produced, reminding the reader of the many ways that women's cooking, gardening, and handicraft skills benefited their families and households. Before fabric was easily commercially available, homespun fabric was valued in these fairs, but only a few short years later, with the availability of cheap fabric in stores, this skill ceased to be exhibited. These stories exemplify how women adapted their household skills to the changing technology and economic needs of the time.In the book's introduction, Nurse acknowledges the limitations of her analysis, and she reminds the reader throughout that this is just the start of a conversation on women and agricultural fairs. She has little space to devote to deep racial analysis or the intersections of gender, class, and ethnicity in this book. These rural people were all individuals with unique and nuanced life experiences, some of which are unexplored in this study. Nurse encourages others to take up this mantle and further explore agricultural fairs as microcosms of Canadian society that can teach us about changing values and mores of rural communities.",

    "abstract": "By focusing on Dublin's nonhuman inhabitants in the nineteenth century, Juliana Adelman offers a new and fascinating perspective on the city that also speaks to wider histories of human-animal relationships and development in the nineteenth century. What began as a book about “zoology in Dublin,” grew into five deeply researched and diverse chapters that explore many layers of Dublin's nineteenth-century human and animal life. “Historians of Dublin have ignored the city's beasts and in doing so they have missed much about urban life during the nineteenth century,” she writes (1). In Adelman's hands, the history of Dublin's nineteenth-century animal city is very much alive (and sometimes very much dead).There are parts of Dublin's animal history that are familiar across other urban animal histories in Europe and the United States in the nineteenth century: the establishment of Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; growing restrictions on livestock and animal industries downtown; and the development of zoos and domestic pet culture. Yet Adelman's Dublin also provides historians with distinction and nuance in thinking about urban change in nineteenth-century Europe and America.Civilised by Beasts is an expansive social history that engages with urban, political, environmental, and cultural history. In early chapters, the reader encounters the contemporaneous development of two prominent animal institutions: the Dublin Zoological Society (established in 1830) and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (DSPCA) (established in 1840). The Zoological Society thrived with its popular gardens, but the DSPCA struggled to gain a following. Here, Dublin seems to have a somewhat distinct place in the transnational Humane Movement, as many Dubliners saw the DSPCA as Anglo-Protestant and anti-Catholic, and therefore resisted its influence.In later sections, Adelman explores the class meanings of pig keeping and interconnected efforts at social control through the city's porcine residents. “Middle-class reformers used animals to help them identify what it was to be truly human and applied these ideas to efforts to reform the lives of the urban poor,” writes Adelman (64). Though many Dubliners had “rational economic reasons” for keeping pigs, the practice often became “an indictment of a person's moral and intellectual character” (78). Here Adelman expands on Catherine McNeur's “swinish multitudes” of Manhattan to suggest “a prejudice across Western societies against the character of the pig,” and the people who kept them (77). As in New York, reformers were successful; by the 1850s, Dublin authorities had significantly reduced urban pig populations.In later chapters, Adelman turns her attention to the Dublin Cattle Market and policing animals in the second half of the 1800s. A center of live cattle production and trade, Dublin faced growing reform efforts shaped by “hardening middle-class attitudes to the dangers of meat production” (95). Here again Dublin seems somewhat distinctive as a city that did not eliminate or conceal the cattle industry from the urban environment. Cattle and the Cattle Market were part of the city's identity, and “Dublin embraced its status as an urban cowtown, Ireland's market metropolis” (93). The city did institute new rules on livestock and slaughter (licenses and inspectors, for example) and new means of enforcement and inspection. But authorities did not profoundly reorder livestock space as we see in other cities at the same time. Adelman argues that the “net result” of these reforms was “conservative,” as “slaughterhouses tended to stay in the neighbourhoods where they had always been” (103). In Dublin, nineteenth-century reforms “did not inevitably result in the concealment of animal exploitation,” and in fact some reforms made cattle “more permanently embedded in the urban landscape” (119).Adelman's history of Dublin now joins a spate of single-city studies of animals and nineteenth-century urban environments, which includes compelling cases of Seattle, New York, London, and more. What happens when we assemble these histories into one frame? There is notable overlap and coincidence but also distinction and room for contrasts across American and European cities. How do we explain these areas of convergence and distinction? Adelman's valuable contribution helps address these questions and affirms that we can no longer write urban histories without paying attention to nonhuman inhabitants.Civilised by Beasts is quite spatial and geographic, and the book would have benefited from additional maps and visualizations. (There would certainly be excellent visual material for a companion website.) Adelman introduces the reader to the booming demand for pet portraits, for instance, but the reader does not have the enjoyment of seeing these images. “I want to give readers a fuller sense of what it was like to live in nineteenth-century Dublin and who its residents were,” Adelman writes (11). On that point—and many others—she has succeeded.",

    "abstract": "This book, dedicated “to all who have mixed their hands with the soil,” is the latest publication in the University of California Press series Critical Environments, which explores “the political forms of life and ecologies that emerge from histories of capitalism, militarism, racism, colonialism, and more.” Romero explains that he had originally wanted to study toxicology as an environmental scientist, to help regulate agricultural pollutants for farm workers. “I tell you this because I want you to know that when I picked up the first volume of the Journal of Economic Entomology,” the flagship journal on pest control, “I did so not just as a geographer or a historian in need of a new project, but as someone who has always been keen to figure out why agriculture in the United States is so dependent on poisonous chemicals” (2). Romero leafed through the entire set of the Journal of Economic Entomology and realized what ultimately became the thesis of his book. His argument, succinctly captured in each chapter, is “that the transition to chemical agriculture was as much a story about trying to get rid of industrial waste as it was about using chemicals to mass produce food” (3). So, rather than frame industrial waste as an economic externality, this history of capitalism illustrates how industrial by-products led to entirely new agricultural applications. (A close comparison, of course, is the meatpacking industry.) Romero argues that economic poisons displaced the problems of industrial waste by broadcasting them on the farm.The book opens with a retrospective letter to Rachel Carson. The epistolary preface recaps the environmental movement that she helped initiate. He praises her message, yet informs Ms. Carson that her critique could have gone further. She was not opposed to the discriminate use of pesticides, but Romero is. The author touches on the deaths caused by industrial poisons and expresses distrust for the stories and policies that justify their continued promotion. Romero sees the chemicalization of American agriculture as being quite different from the need to produce food. This basic message resonates throughout the book. As his letter asserts: “We have the right to know that despite some laboratory testing, we are the real guinea pigs” when it comes to ubiquitous pesticide use and residues (xiii).Chapter 1 follows arsenic waste from the copper smelters in the United Kingdom to developments in the American West. The chapter begins by stating that, as a toxic chemical for pest control, arsenic usage peaked in the mid-1940s. The chapter then goes back in time to explain the engineering of copper smelting in Cornish mines in the eighteenth century and the nineteenth-century development of white arsenic, being separated from copper in the manufacturing process. The deadly powder became popular in American agriculture in the 1860s as the copper-arsenic-based compound Paris Green, principally used to combat the potato beetle. Romero transitions to the copper deposits in Michigan and then Montana, as the American West became the “world's largest producer of arsenic waste” (29). Again, Romero shows how the arsenic supply resulted from the copper production process and not from demand for more arsenic. Legal edicts in the United States forced companies to install scrub stacks to recover arsenic from the flues of copper-roasting ovens. What to do with the growing piles of toxic pollution? Spread it on the crops! By the 1920s, arsenic dusts laced the apple groves of the western United States as a cheap pesticide for codling moths. The chapter diverges into the development of an insoluble version of the poisonous spray and concludes with the fall of the US copper industry after World War II. All in all, the chapter offers a wide-ranging education on mining and engineering, topics often neglected by agricultural historians drawn more to crops than to industrial chemistry.In chapter 2, Romero turns to cyanide fumigation, arguing that chemical pest control is an act of war. Here he recalls the work of Edmund Russell, yet only to “push beyond the coevolution of war and agriculture” or their shared infrastructure (52). Romero uses the language of warfare literally, asking if the chemical war on pests is a just war—a line of reasoning that takes the intent of insects into account. As recurs throughout Economic Poisoning, the chapter focuses on California and the development of its commercial orange groves. Entomologists looked to address the damage caused by white scale, a widespread infestation on citrus trees by the 1880s. The US Department of Agriculture experimented with fumigation tents—an apparatus placed over the entire tree—to gas the scale and their eggs with cyanide. Romero shows how nocturnal cyanide fumigation became standard practice and the subject of an invalidated patent. Fruit from fumigated groves brought higher market prices with less post-harvest processing. Fumigation also brought more pests. “With the control of one pest,” Romero explains, “others realigned their life histories to fill the abruptly vacant niches that chemical war continuously brought to the industrial citrus ecosystem” (64). This serial substitution of pests is essentially how toxic chemicals became conventional practice in American agriculture. Romero concludes by asking why we continue to poison crops and if the response is justified even in times of war. The chapter holds up as a good stand-alone read, especially for historians versed in the citrus literature.Chapter 3 covers the development and deployment of oil-based sprays, also in California citrus groves. “Despite the proven efficacy of cyanide fumigation, some citrus growers had turned to oil because it was so incredibly cheap” in the 1910s, Romero explains (76). The chapter focuses on Hunter Volck, a graduate from the University of California, Berkeley (as is Romero), who took a job at the UC experiment station and was sent to investigate the commercial groves of Southern California. Citrus growers used oil-based sprays to control those populations of scale not killed by fumigation but also to counter the associated spread of red spider mites. Volck realized that spraying refinery wastes on citrus trees had erratic results, given the uncertain toxicology of fuel oil from which it was derived. In 1907, Volck and a partner started the company Cal-Spray to manufacture the Ortho brand of on-farm chemical treatments. The chapter highlights the growth of Cal-Spray and the use of the patent system to profit from public research money. Within a few decades, oil sprays became complementary to other pesticides, and Cal-Spray went into debt, only to be bought by Standard Oil during the Great Depression. “What these companies began to recognize was that all parts of oil could be put to use if only a use for them could be found,” Romero writes (96). Agriculture became a convenient sector in which to find uses for patented products from petrochemical waste.Chapter 4 continues a theme from the previous chapter—the private capture of public funds—through a case study of the Crop Protection Institute (CPI). Unusual for its time, the CPI aimed to coordinate private funding for pesticide research at state agricultural experiment stations. Romero insists that CPI's biggest impact was the development of R&D infrastructure that “helped make toxicity-based repair the solution to agriculture's pest problems” (99). The chapter returns to World War I and the formation of the National Research Council (NRC) as a governmental hub of scientific activity. Romero describes how the wartime spirit for scientific progress found a way to strengthen the cooperative fight on American farmlands. Lack of standardized toxicological data was a problem for the agricultural chemical industry because poisons required standardized laboratory procedures for commercialization. “By the 1920s the CPI was evolving into an organization at which individual companies could get their poisons tested without having to give up propriety rights,” a shift that Romero contrasts with NRC contract policy (111). The institutional history focuses on two early projects of the CPI: first, the development of DN-Dust, a pesticide by the Dow Chemical Company in the late 1930s, and second, the first synthetic herbicide used in the United States in the early 1940s. Consequently, the CPI seemed to have served its purpose of coordinating public-private partnerships, one that, as summarized by Romero—with echoes of Jim Hightower and Jack Kloppenburg—“allowed chemical companies to benefit from publicly subsidized research” (121).1Readers might be familiar with the content of chapter 5 because Romero published an earlier version in Agricultural History.2 Within the context of the book, the story of a toxic fumigant being injected into the topsoil of a declining California crop field is a brilliant presentation of the overall argument. The soil fumigant DD, named after two novel chlorinated chemicals from Shell's petroleum waste, killed nematodes in the soil. Romero shows how the synthetic disinfectant restored crop yields; in this case, the continuous production of a single crop without rotation would not be possible” otherwise (136). The chapter also explains how Shell mechanized the application of DD through parallel developments with ammonia fertilizer. Romero provides a succinct history of industrial nitrogen fixation and the Haber-Bosch process, a history that feeds into Shell's patented technology for delivering fertilizer via irrigation water and, subsequently, directly into the subsoil through an injection method. The chemical fumigant and anhydrous ammonia were combined into a single application in 1944, epitomizing to Romero an “underground chemical warfare that revolutionized agriculture” by extending monocultures in time (137).Romero's central thesis that agriculture became a burial site for dissipating piles of cheap poisonous by-products should have a major impact on how historians discuss the topic. If crop abundance was a problem, as it often was with American agriculture in the decades before World War II, the systematic adoption of chemicals to achieve greater yields requires an explanation other than food sufficiency. Romero offers a compelling explanation. How farmers' own accounts relate to this history of chemicalization, however, is not captured by the book's institutional emphasis. As for alternative solutions, Romero worries that “we have gotten farther and farther away from the possibility of an agricultural system not built on the assumption of widespread chemical control” (142). Although it was not inevitable during the first half of the twentieth century, he wonders if it is inevitable today. Systematic change at this point would require an end to the insecticidal war.The text itself is substantiated by a heavy dose of references. The endnotes begin on page 145, yet the final pagination is 251. This speaks to one of the strengths of the monograph. In making the argument that chemical pest control was an offshoot of industrial waste, Romero has to explain many aspects of industrial manufacturing—each time with each chemical in each chapter. He meets the challenge. Every chapter has fewer notes than the previous one. Oddly, the book lacks a list of abbreviations, which would be helpful for a book chockablock with chemical compounds and administrative bodies. The date ranges covered per chapter are also difficult to find. Economic Poisoning sometimes reads like a thematic series of historical case studies. This compositional structure could be construed as a weakness or could indicate a problem of narrative coherence, but I find that the collection-of-essays approach fits with contemporary reading habits. The book asks each chapter to stand on its own merits with original content that supports a bigger argument, which Romero altogether delivers.",

    "abstract": "In Fruit, Fiber, and Fire, William Carleton explores the interconnectedness of industrial production, environment, labor, and identity in the making of New Mexico's modern agricultural landscapes. The author's work is transnational in nature, weaving together a borderlands synthesis of how plants, migrant labor, and commercial agricultural practices ebbed and flowed across a permeable southwestern border. This study, divided into three thematic sections each comprising two chapters, investigates the successive development of New Mexico's commercial apple, cotton, and chili pepper industries between 1870 and 2000. Carleton crafts a multidisciplinary narrative that does an uncommonly fine job of cautioning the reader to avoid viewing modernity as unwaveringly linear, while positioning commercial agriculture in New Mexico at the center of important questions concerning settler colonialism, ecological imperialism, and the making of modern identity in the southwestern borderlands.Supported by outside capital, settler colonialism, and local Hispanic and Native American labor, apple orchards flourished for a time in the Pecos and San Juan valleys, creating an irrigated Eden for white settlement. The codling moth, soil salinization, and market competition stymied commercial orcharding prior to World War II but not the significance of the apple in shaping New Mexico's cultural landscapes. Protecting the old Spanish orchard in Manzano, New Mexico, for tourism also reinforced the public perception of the superiority of modern American agricultural production over older Hispanic agricultural landscapes, while James Young's invention of the Champagne apple perpetuated American myths of the white yeoman farmer. During the 1960s, as orchard production shifted to Hispanic and Native American districts in northern New Mexico, the author elucidates how apple cooperatives became centers of conflict over culture, labor, government policy, and differing conceptions of local sustainable agricultural production.By the 1920s cotton replaced orchards and alfalfa in New Mexico's irrigated valleys, bringing unprecedented environmental and demographic change and new collaboration between universities, state agencies, and agriculture in the region. An influx of white southerners brought cultural nostalgia for the Old South, farm tenancy or sharecropping, and a monocrop agricultural regime dependent upon migrant labor from Mexico, the South, and the southern plains. Cotton farming, made possible by the introduction of Acala cotton found on diversified farms in Mexico, was commercialized north of the border and then reintroduced into Mexico, where it eventually displaced traditional farming. Carleton, however, devotes an entire chapter to Stahmann Farms, which incorporated crop diversification and company paternalism to become one of New Mexico's most successful agricultural enterprises between 1926 and 1970. This chapter supports one of the author's main arguments that modern agricultural regimes often borrowed heavily from the past.Over the first half of the twentieth century, Dr. Fabián García transformed the chili pepper from a regional crop to one of national significance. García, director of the agricultural experiment station at the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, developed the number 9, a chili bred from older local Hispanic varieties traditionally planted for home use but with a skin more amenable to the canning industry. As a result, he created a pepper that “crossed geopolitical, seasonal, and cultural borders” (136). After World War II, state boosters endeavored to make the chile pepper culturally New Mexican in origin by backdating García's work to the 1890s and downplaying the significance of Mexican varieties in the development of the original number 9. Animosity developed between industrial and native or local growers in New Mexico as the chile pepper gained national recognition and the state began to intervene to control how chiles were marketed by the early 2000s.Carleton's study presents the reader with an excellent history of how the interconnections of national markets, local environmental conditions, plants, labor, and universities or government agencies shaped the industrial agricultural landscapes of modern New Mexico. More significantly, the author integrates these themes within broader discussions of race and cultural identity in the southwestern borderlands. Carleton's study reminds us that while modern industrial agricultural regimes often obfuscate older traditional agricultural practices, it is often predicated upon the appropriation of seeds, labor, and knowledge from the landscapes it erases. In Fruit, Fiber, and Fire, the author finds that industrial agricultural in New Mexico does not take a linear trajectory toward ever increasing yields and efficiency but instead borrows heavily from the past, while at the same time creating new myths and reimagining old stories about the people who worked the land.",

    "abstract": "In Razing Kids, Jeffrey C. Sanders aptly demonstrates how adults used rhetoric about children and the environment to express concerns about America's future. Using specific case studies centered in the West, Sanders cleverly organizes the book chronologically by events that follow both the growth of environmental problems and baby boom kids from birth to adulthood.Focusing first on concerns about young children, Sanders examines the development of World War II–era housing by industrialist Henry Kaiser in Richmond, Virginia, and Vanport, Oregon. Adults expressed concern about keeping children healthy and safely contained, ideas inherent in the architecture of the spaces they designed. Moving into the 1950s and 1960s, Sanders shifts his analysis to Arizona and New Mexico, where he probes growing fears about radiation from nuclear testing and its impact on children's health. This case study moves from the local level with rural, poor, often Indigenous “downwinders” attempting to force information from the government to the national level as activists, particularly women, worked on milk boycotts to avoid radioactive fallout. As western children grew into teenagers, Sanders follows them into urban areas. He examines greater youth autonomy in Los Angeles, leading to increasing attempts to control “juvenile delinquency” through labor on Youth Conservation Camps. For the later 1960s, Sanders turns to the People's Park in San Francisco, where politicians and reformers struggled to deal with the huge influx of runaway teenagers. The final case study deals with baby boomers as parents expressing concern over food safety for children in the wake of ubiquitous pesticide use. Like the concerns over radiation testing, concerns about pesticides shifted from local to national, but they also shifted away from concerns over children-as-farm-laborers toward children-as-consumers.Sanders deftly weaves multiple themes through the narrative, including children, race, and the rural-urban divide. He notes that adults often frame concerns about the present or future with rhetoric centered around children. In addition, these concerns often say more about the policy-makers than children, with adults pressing for policies that control young people's behavior under the guise of their “protection.” Sanders's case studies in the early chapters detail adults using policy—industrial, urban, or regulatory—to control children. By the later chapters, the police state becomes more visible, cracking down on youth on the streets and in poor neighborhoods in more aggressive ways. As Sanders notes, these environmentally centered policies also reflect the rise of the carceral state during the 1960s.Two case studies by Sanders focus on the rural-urban divide. In chapter 3, he details the strong anti-urban bias that led adults to develop Youth Conservation Camps, modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corps. Seeing nature as a “cure” for troubled urban youth, reformers placed young Black men in isolated, primitive camps, where they worked on conservation projects. Far from being “cured” of the ills of the city, young workers faced severe dislocation, health problems, and racial conflicts with neighboring towns. In the last chapter, Sanders confronts health concerns over pesticides during the late twentieth century. Sanders surveys early food and anti-pesticide activism, focusing on farm labor activists in the Pacific Northwest, who expressed considerable concern about the effects of chemicals on children working in the fields with their families. While these activists enjoyed some success through the 1960s and 1970s grape boycott, the conversation soon shifted focus. Rather than working toward the safety of children-as-laborers, middle-class whites chose to focus on the dangers of pesticides on children-as-consumers, which marginalized the Latinx population in the area.To his credit, Sanders has crafted a story rich in diversity. His case studies illuminate the effects of racism in environmental policies on African Americans, Latinx, and Indigenous populations. He also clearly delineates changes in ideas about gender (sticking to cis women and men) from the case studies. Importantly, although the focus is on adults, children's voices appear as well, discussing their own experiences and views during the time period.Overall, Razing Kids is a meticulous, compelling work on environmental policies about children in postwar western America that should become a pivotal work in the field. Sanders employs highly readable prose and ample context, making it accessible to students of all levels. Scholars of post–World War II America, the environment, childhood, rural/urban relations, food history, race, and the police state should find it useful. His work also demonstrates a compelling need for more scholars to add to the ongoing efforts to combine the history of childhood with environmental history.",

    "abstract": "Acquired Tastes may be an edited collection, but it makes a single, convincing argument—the modern US food system is a product of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, not of the last seventy years, as so many food writers (e.g., Michael Pollan) have argued. The volume's editors and authors effectively trace to this earlier period many aspects we think of as integral to “modern” food, including celebrity endorsements, plant-based meat, transnational distribution, and the labeling of mass-produced foods as “natural.” Acquired Tastes is a fun collection of well-written pieces that will be useful for scholars, viable for the classroom, and entertaining for foodies.The collection is divided into three sections. The first concerns the constriction of time and space that made modern food possible. The second concerns contests over trust—in both industrialized food products and in the system that provides this food. The third and final section considers the scientific advances that made “modern” food possible—and how people sold those advances to consumers.The editors are (perhaps rightly) loose in their definition of “modern” food; hence, the topics covered by this collection are myriad and fascinating. Readers will learn about the replacement of “real” sugar by corn syrup, the selling of bananas through both sex and race, and the importance of urban food carts, which reduced the likelihood that transported fruits would decay. Authors introduce mysteries that readers might not have considered. Want to know why the United States fails to feature many Filipino restaurants or how European beer styles were invented? Readers will find intriguing answers in this volume. Despite the pieces' variety, many themes run through the collection, including the importance of light versus dark foods, the growing use of food science, and the significance of food justice before we had a name for it.The volume, of course, does not cover every aspect of modern food. The book focuses largely on the United States, with some attention to other locations, most of which are in Europe. Some of the authors discuss the growing and raising of food. For instance, we hear about the role of 4-H in bringing nutritional science to rural areas and about the “ghost acres” created when California's Central Valley became a wheat producer, but the book's authors place more of an emphasis on the roles played by industrial packaging, laboratory work, and advertisers than on farms and agricultural labor.This reader is a sucker for edited volumes—there is something wonderful about a shared intellectual project. Such collections do, of course, face common pitfalls, most of which this collection artfully avoids. One common issue for edited volumes concerns the often uneven quality of contributions, particularly of the writing. However, the editors of this book cared deeply about the craft of writing. The acknowledgments section explains that the editors held a workshop about nonfiction writing with many of the contributors. They even asked a writing coach to provide guidance! The result is a collection written mostly by academics (and hence with their attention to citations, historical context, and the research process), but its brief pieces read more like magazine essays than like scholarly articles. Acquired Tastes, therefore, provides an engaging set of snippets from exciting recent and forthcoming projects. It deserves wide readership.",

    "abstract": "Kelly Houston Jones invites readers into the little-studied worlds of enslaved people and their Arkansas enslavers in her eminently engaging and nuanced A Weary Land. Jones demonstrates the potential of a landscape-focused history of slavery, taking quite seriously and literally the clichéd phrase history on the ground. For her, an appreciation of the ruggedness of Arkansas's natural landscapes illuminates how the many decisions made by enslaved individuals and their enslavers reflected their personal—and sometimes fantastical—understandings of an ever-evolving and contested Arkansas ground. Mid-nineteenth-century Arkansas agricultural development was thus an outgrowth of both violent enslaver machinations and enslaved placemaking. “Because slavery coerced intimate engagement with cultivated land, perhaps it should have been alienating for enslaved farmers,” Jones muses, “but as the system crumbled, African American Arkansans identified as farmers, as Arkansans, as country people” (7).Jones's study opens with a discussion of early Euro-American efforts to tame what she terms the “morass” of Arkansas—the swampy, treacherous regions of Arkansas that would become, by the eighteenth century, a borderland of French, African, Osage, and Quapaw communities (11). Like most borderlands, the morass rendered the dictates of high government officials rather weak, if not obsolete, but various Euro-Americans remained committed to establishing their colonial presence in the region, eventually investing heavily in enslaved African labor by the opening decades of the nineteenth century, especially after the Louisiana Purchase and the rise of a globalized cotton economy. As Jones points out, however, the landscapes of Arkansas—along with the constant disruptions of Indigenous displacement and population flows—offered enslaved people unique opportunities to “undermine white mastery on the territorial cotton frontier.” In particular, Jones highlights the power of Black flight in framing the Euro-American quest to conquer the “wilderness,” an astute point that resonates throughout the book.The middle chapters creatively—and quite effectively—re-create the day-to-day lives of enslaved people and their enslavers throughout the middle decades of the nineteenth century. Here A Weary Land is most enlightening, as she situates Arkansas individuals and communities within their very specific, variegated domains of power, environment, and work. Enslaved people, she notes, were mostly responsible for transforming the morass of Arkansas into the ordered fantasy of Euro-American settlers, by draining swamps, clearing trees, erecting buildings, and planting crops. Notably, Jones argues that previous scholars have exaggerated the low-country-up-country slaveholding dichotomy in Arkansas; her close study of four Arkansas counties (Hempstead, Conway, Pope, and Independence) reveals that slaveholding density had less to do with low-country status and (nearly) everything to do with access to Arkansas's vast river systems. “Arkansas's waterways concentrated slavery,” Jones argues (79). The alluvial landscapes derived from the Mississippi and Arkansas rivers sustained slavery in Arkansas.But despite enslavers' collective efforts to impose their visions of environmental transformation upon their enslaved land cultivators and laborers, “when enslaved people looked around, they viewed a different landscape than did whites, with different sets of significant points interconnected by their pipelines of information of both the social and subversive kind” (64). As Jones details, the alluvial landscapes of Arkansas may have held promises of fortune and power for enslavers, but for the enslaved they also bore the potential for degrees of autonomy, personal reward, and liberation. Although enslaved people “endured a coerced intimacy with Arkansas's land,” that groundedness provided the exploited Black population of Arkansas, which numbered some 110,000 by 1860, with unique access to natural resources, clandestine networks, and local wisdom (104). Ultimately, Black embrace of mobility—whether within communities or outside of them—proved to be the most effective counter to the carceral, “implacement” practices of enslaver society, even as bondspeople sought their own sense of rootedness through friends, family, material accumulation, and environmental transformation (67). As Jones explains in her final chapter, this was no more apparent than during the Civil War, when Black flight “pull[ed] the rug out from under slavers' economy and war effort” (185).Drawing from slave testimonies, court filings, personal correspondence, diaries, tax rolls, and other government records, Jones's A Weary Land overall offers an excellent account of slavery's expansion into Arkansas, from multiple perspectives and with a keen eye toward human relationships to space, place, and natural environments. Readers will be hard-pressed to find a more meticulous re-creation of the material lives of enslaved people and their enslavers. If anything, A Weary Land pushes scholars to continue examining how enslaved people interpreted their (coerced) role in conquering western landscapes, even as many sought to subvert it.",

Many organizational questions about types of relief, distribution networks, and roles of relief workers, among others, became points of discussion and an open confrontation ensued among different organizations. This article analyzes competing visions of US famine relief to Soviet Russia during the devastating Volga famine of 1921–23. Unofficially presided over by Herbert Hoover, the American Relief Administration sent food, clothing, and medicine to the Soviets, while the so-called radical relief groups demanded a more “permanent rehabilitation” of Soviet agriculture and sought to ship technologies and agricultural specialists. These visions were guided by more than humanitarian ideals. Economic rivalry, class solidarity, anti-communism, and a belief in the power of technology shaped the US famine relief to Soviet Russia.",

    "abstract": "Mats morell, a swedish economic historian whose work on agriculture and rural life since 1750 made essential contributions to our field, died in May 2022, just before the conference of the European Rural History Organisation (EURHO) in Uppsala. Historians based in the United States and Canada became acquainted with Mats through his participation in the Agricultural History Society, which began in 2012 when he presented a paper at the conference in Manhattan, Kansas. From then on, he attended our conferences whenever he could, sharing his work-in-progress on a wide range of subjects. His warmth, generosity, and endless curiosity sparked wonderful conversations. At the same time, in 2012–13, Morell cofounded EURHO with his longtime collaborators across the continent. The two organizations soon developed close ties, as Mats invited North Americans to present papers and panels at EURHO conferences, which met every other year, and organized panels of Europeans to share their work at the Agricultural History Society annual meetings. In Uppsala, several panels included participants from both sides of the Atlantic addressing common themes. Mats exemplified the collegiality he facilitated among the rest of us.This international interchange has been transformative for many participants and for journals in the field. Those who study the United States and Canada were encouraged to situate their findings in relation to developments in diverse parts of Europe, illuminating debates about questions such as the position of farmers in the transition to capitalism, which had previously been considered by only a handful of scholars in North America. Those who study Europe were encouraged to comprehend the special dynamics of settler societies and consider the significance of race and gender in relation to property and power. Convergences and divergences in the causes, timing, and consequences of trends toward mechanization, increases in scale and specialization, state promotion of productivist agriculture, and the subsequent and simultaneous yet contradictory turns toward neoliberal policies and sustainable farming practices have been illuminated through international comparisons and transnational studies.Mats Morell's research, as well as his reflections on the development of our field, shed new light on the past fifty years of scholarship in agricultural and rural history. Like many who study rural societies, Mats described himself as a “country boy living in the city.” Growing up and attending school in vanishingly tiny villages and small towns in Västmanland, a rural county west of Stockholm with a mix of large farms on the plains, smallholdings in the woodlands, and scattered industrial plants, informed his understanding of the complexity of rural societies. He came to Uppsala University in 1975 and decided to study economic history. The field was then influenced by young Marxists whose sympathies lay with the Social Democratic Party, which had united the industrial working class, family farmers, and rural laborers since the 1930s. Significantly, Morell's last major research project focused on changes in the productivity of agriculture in relation to enclosures between 1750 and 1920 in both his native province and Uppland, the richer province east of Västmanland whose center is Uppsala.Even as an undergraduate, Mats was interested in social stratification as it occurred over time among the agricultural population. His PhD dissertation, completed in 1989, examined Swedish food consumption from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, linking standards of living to farming over three centuries of change. The creative combination of statistical analyses of historical data with qualitative sources and theoretically informed frameworks that is notable throughout Mats's work was visible from the beginning. Equally significant were his close friendships with a new generation of economic historians, who connected economic history with social history, politics, and policy. Many became his lifelong collaborators, not only on joint research projects but also on textbooks that presented entirely new accounts of Sweden's development from a relatively impoverished, predominantly rural society at the turn of the twentieth century to an affluent, urbanized industrial society with a robust welfare state in the postwar period.As a postdoctoral researcher and faculty member in economic history at Uppsala, Mats embarked on the broad investigation of the history of Swedish agriculture in the early modern and modern periods that informed the rest of his career. Peasant farmers, landholding, mechanization, markets, and the state were at the center of his inquiries. He became a leading member of a generation of economic and social historians who emphasized the rising proportion of propertyless rural workers, the stratification between large-scale farmers and smallholders, and the persistence of family farming within a capitalist system that controlled the purchase of inputs and the processing and sale of products. These historians highlighted the agency of farmers themselves in these developments, as they cleared new land for cultivation, shifted from a one-sided focus on grain or livestock to convertible husbandry, and reaped enough income to adopt technological innovations that increased the productivity of their labor and land. Old models of diffusion from large estates to middling farmers and from commercial centers to peripheries were overturned by empirical studies of the bottom-up processes of change in specific regions.In the mid-1990s, Mats began a long-term collaboration with the newly established program in agrarian history at the Swedish Agricultural University, located on the edge of Uppsala. This lively intellectual milieu, which was marked by international and interdisciplinary perspectives on continuities and changes from the ancient period to the present, generated the five-volume Swedish Agricultural History, which was spearheaded by Janken Myrdal. Mats Morell was a core member of this group from the start, and he wrote volume 4, Agriculture in Industrial Society, 1870–1945, which synthesized a large body of new work. These richly illustrated books, which draw on literature, artifacts, and visual sources as well as graphs, maps, and photographs to tell the stories of farming and rural communities over deep time, have been strikingly popular among ordinary Swedes, many of whom know where their ancestors lived in the countryside. The authors' concern for the rural landscape, environmental issues, and sustainable farming ensured that the series spoke to this moment on the cusp of change.Morell and Myrdal then coedited the one-volume English-language version, The Agrarian History of Sweden, which includes abridged versions of the volume by Carl-Johan Gadd, The Agricultural Revolution, 1700–1870, and the one by Maths Isacson and Iréne A. Flygare, Agriculture in Welfare Society, 1945–2000. The chapters in this eminently readable book will feel simultaneously familiar and strange to historians who have studied these periods in other places. The material culture and technologies of farming were widely shared across Europe and North America, but the ideologies and social dynamics of farmers' movements and their political alliances with liberals and social democrats are sometimes startlingly different. So are the changing contours of settlement: a momentous shift from open-field villages with vast commons and to dispersed farmsteads with contiguous fields and meadows.While the gender division of labor, land ownership, and authority in rural Sweden seems deceptively similar to that found elsewhere, the differences soon leap out. Not only was women's labor essential during haying and harvest, but on smallholdings, where the men were often absent to earn money in lumbering, transport, or construction, women often carried on the farm operations by themselves. On family farms, women took care of the cows, did the milking, and processed butter and cheese, as they did elsewhere, but in Sweden they were employed in and managed centralized butter and cheese dairies well into the interwar period. From 1845 on, daughters and sons were entitled to inherit equal shares of their parents' land, and until the early twentieth century, husbands and wives each held land inherited from their parents as separate property. Women's access to land and the recognized value of their labor made a difference in marital and intergenerational relationships, differing from the female dependence that was the norm in urban bourgeois families and, as Lena Sommestad has suggested, laying the basis for the two-breadwinner model in the Swedish welfare state.Mats not only supervised the PhD research of feminist historians investigating women and gender but also conducted a fascinating study of representations of masculinity and femininity in advertisements for milking machinery in the early twentieth century. In Sweden, men's movement into the cowshed coincided with mechanization, and the ads both assured farmers that milking machines were light enough for women to carry from stall to stall and associated men with milking through their supposed affinity with machinery. But the decisive factor in this shift in the division of labor, Morell concluded, was the marked decline in the relative number of adult women living on farms. He interpreted women's disproportionate exodus from the countryside not simply as a response to the contraction in opportunities to get started in farming but also as a rejection of unmarried women's subordinate position in rural society. While women who became joint owner-operators of family farms organized to improve farm incomes and their own conditions of life and labor, others refused to work as milkmaids and servants and instead sought jobs in towns and cities that offered them a greater degree of personal independence.Although Morell's history of Swedish agriculture places the country's economic and social development in its international context, his perspective was much more deeply informed by international collaborations with other Europeans than is apparent in his English-language publications during the 1990s and 2000s. During the early 1980s, he and a few other Swedes attended European conferences organized by economic historians and sociologists on themes such as living standards and the past and future of rural communities, and during the 1900s they presented and discussed their own and others' work at the international congresses of economic historians. These conversations bore fruit in long-term comparative work.Mats's most important, lifelong collaboration was with Ildikó Asztalos Morell, a sociologist who was studying agricultural cooperatives and family farms through the transition to and from socialism in her native Hungary for a PhD in Canada. They married in 1986, after they met at a UNESCO-sponsored workshop on ethnographic observations and interviews with members of rural cooperatives in western Hungary. “That changed the direction of my research,” Mats reflected. Ildikó and Mats continued to study the reorganization of agriculture in post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe through 1999. Relatedly, in 2004–10 Mats, Ildikó, Iréne Flygare, and other colleagues combined methods from history, sociology, and ethnography to study generational change and the transfer of resources in agriculture since 1870 in Sweden, Estonia, and Hungary.The other major collaborative project in which Morell engaged from 2006 through 2009 was a series of international workshops sponsored by the Program for the Comparative Study of Rural History in Europe (COST Action 35 PROGRESSORE), with researchers from twenty countries. The workshops culminated in a set of edited volumes featuring systematic comparisons of rural development in the Nordic countries and on the Continent. The Rural History of the North Sea Area network produced a series of these volumes, which are published by Brepols. Morell was a major contributor to two: Property Rights, Land Markets, and Economic Growth in the European Countryside and Rural Societies and Environments at Risk: Ecology, Property Rights and Social Organisation in Fragile Areas. At the same time, he published chapters in edited volumes on these themes. Property Rights in Land had a global scope, while Integrated Peasant Economy in a Comparative Perspective examined pluriactivity and the careful use of niche resources in areas whose elevation and northern locations created special conditions for agriculture. In contrast to many economic historians, Morell integrated Sweden's colonization of the north and its repeated encroachments on the land and culture of Sami people into the national story.Growing concern with climate change, food insecurity, and the long-term consequences of productivist agriculture for biodiversity and rural environments inspired Morell's next major collaborative project. This methodologically innovative research analyzed farmers' diaries to see how they coped with extreme weather, such as drought, excess rainfall, and unusual spells of heat and cold, and what enabled them to be resilient through periods of harvest failure. Biological and environmental scientists from the Swedish Agricultural University played a key role in the analysis. The group found that diversified farming and staying out of debt were equally important in enabling farms to survive crises. They also initiated comparative discussions of famines and the socioeconomic relations that resulted in or prevented high rates of death and emigration with scholars elsewhere in Europe. Of special interest to US-based rural historians is Iréne Flygare and Marja Erikson's study of the religious and economic unrest that led a group of utopians to leave Sweden and found Bishop Hill, a cooperative community on the prairie in southern Illinois.Morell's last book, Agricultural Revolution: Agricultural Production in Uppsala and Västmanland Counties, 1750–1920, has implications that extend far beyond Sweden. Methodologically, it demonstrates how the analysis of diverse materials including manuscript maps, land records, tax records, and government statistics of agriculture for judiciously selected regions and localities enables historians to ask and answer fundamental questions regarding the process of long-term change. Substantively, it offers a major reinterpretation of the agricultural revolution. Morell shows that the most significant increases in productivity resulted from practices that were introduced by farmers themselves rather than imposed through state policies or recommended by experts. Moreover, it differentiates between the initial growth that resulted from changes initiated by farmers and the later, less robust increases in productivity that depended on farmers' purchase of chemical fertilizer, concentrated feed, fossil fuels, pesticides, and herbicides from agribusiness corporations, which led to a vicious circle in which costs rose but the prices paid to farmers for their products did not. The adoption of complementary crop rotations and animal husbandry suited to local and regional conditions on diversified farms points to a way forward for the future, as it did in the past.Mats Morell left a legacy and a lesson for all of us. He never lost sight of the big questions we ask about the past: What did the agricultural revolution mean for farmers and rural society? How did the positions of women and men who lived and worked on farms change throughout this transformation? And what can we learn about the dynamics of change in the past that can guide us as we address the challenges facing the food supply and rural environment in a period of neoliberal policy amidst the global climate emergency? The lesson is one that Americans, in particular, need to put into practice as the circumstances of our work in academe become more constrained. In order to summon the wide range of skills and perspectives that enables our research and writing to make a difference, we must expand our collaboration across the obsolete borders of disciplines, nation-states, and continents.",

    "abstract": "Perhaps no subject in early American history has undergone as thorough an interpretive overhaul recently as the colonization movement. Once mostly derided as the self-serving ruse of proslavery southerners and the chimerical fantasy of white American racists, a bevy of studies have now taken colonization seriously, providing a multidimensional understanding of the many and long-standing efforts to remove Black Americans from the land of their birth—a goal that, at its core, remains inscrutable to our modern sensibilities.Into this increasingly crowded field steps Sebastian Page, whose Black Resettlement and the American Civil War provides readers with an encyclopedic analysis of the “embarrassment of projects aimed at removing African Americans from the United States” (12). To cast his interpretive net as widely as possible, Page employs the term “resettlement” rather than colonization—the designation normally assigned to white-guided initiatives of Black repatriation to Africa—or emigration—the word used for the periodic, Black-led undertakings to urge at least some of their compatriots to leave the United States. Using resettlement as his lens allows Page to adopt a kaleidoscopic view that is inclusive of a host of removal schemes: from the more conventionally studied destination of Liberia to the far less scrutinized proposal to relocate freed people on territory within the former Confederacy that remained in Union hands in the aftermath of the Civil War.Page's book covers much more ground than its title implies; it begins in the antebellum era and ends with President Ulysses S. Grant's bid at pairing Black emigration with the annexation of the Dominican Republic. The first two chapters contextualize the birth and growth of Black resettlement and include a nuanced and incisive account of several Black-initiated emigration programs prior to the 1860s. But it is really in chapter 3 that the crux of this monograph begins to emerge. Page chronicles the rise of African American resettlement to, as he sees it, a central place on the Republican Party's agenda. Throughout succeeding chapters Page shows the enduring quest to relocate Black Americans outside the bounds of the American republic during the Civil War and immediate postwar years. From Latin America to the British West Indies to the American South, he illustrates how a motley group of reformers, adventurers, charlatans, visionaries, and prominent politicians—including, as Page painstakingly demonstrates, Abraham Lincoln himself—held on far longer and more sincerely to Black resettlement than historians have heretofore recognized. Even amid one of the United States' most celebrated hours of racial progressivism—when the Emancipation Proclamation recast the republic as a nation of universal human liberty and people of color fought by the thousands to preserve the Union—there remained endeavors to expatriate African Americans.Prodigiously researched and written in lively and clever prose, Black Resettlement and the American Civil War achieves the author's objective to “chronicle the full geographic and institutional range of the drive for black resettlement” (1). This book is now the fullest account we have of the persistent efforts to resettle Black Americans during the Civil War era.But Page is less successful in establishing the greater import of the impressive research he has compiled for the history of race, liberty, and African American rights in the nineteenth century. He conflates the staying power of Black resettlement plans with their significance. And he overreaches several times in the text by making claims about colonization's relevance that outstrip his evidence. For example, a handful of Republican advocates of Black resettlement, who hardly represented the mainstream position of their own party on African American citizenship, are, for Page, indicative of the views of “white Americans” as a whole. Ultimately, there is an expansive difference between the endurance of colonization and resettlement proposals, on the one hand, and their centrality, or even relative importance, to the larger national debate over Black freedom, race, and rights, on the other.By nearly the same time period that Black Resettlement and the American Civil War ends its narrative, a critical mass of the white American electorate had endorsed the abolition of slavery, approved of the incorporation of African Americans into the republic as citizens, and signed off on the constitutional right of Black men to suffrage. We all know how the retreat from Reconstruction and the nationalization of white supremacy made a mockery of much of these accomplishments by the Jim Crow years. And yet during the Civil War era they still seem more noteworthy facts than the fanciful and abortive racially exclusionary schemes of a relatively small number of individuals.",

    "abstract": "George Matthews was struggling. An ex-Confederate medical doctor from Alabama, Matthews and his family fled the “Yankee oppression” of the Reconstruction South for the interior of São Paulo State, Brazil, hoping to grow cotton in the “pleasing” familiarity of a patriarchal, slaveholding society (156). What Matthews found was not what he expected. As cotton prices fell and he struggled to make ends meet, he was appalled to find himself the social inferior of a wealthy African-descended coffee planter, who generously offered him the opportunity to serve as his personal doctor. More distressingly, he arrived just in time to witness “a new birth of capitalism” in the state, one based not on slavery but on its abolition, which ultimately created an “agroindustrial order that no slave society had ever matched” (252, 258). The experience of Matthews, with its ironic twists of expectation and reality, is typical of Roberto Saba's fascinating American Mirror.Saba's book explores the cultural, political, and economic connections between the Western Hemisphere's largest slaveholding powers, the United States and the Empire of Brazil, during their complicated transitions from slavery to freedom. In short, Saba argues for the importance of transnational networks of American and Brazilian antislavery reformers—engineers, scientists, journalists, and entrepreneurs—to the hemispheric triumph of modern capitalism, in which the “backward and irrational” system of slavery was replaced by a system of free labor (3). As Saba makes clear, these reformers were not motivated by egalitarian concerns but by a conviction that free labor was a more efficient motor for economic development.The argument is ambitious, but Saba unfolds his case meticulously. The first three chapters are based in Brazil's imperial capital of Rio de Janeiro and chart the reception there of US diplomats, entrepreneurs, and scientists. The haughty rhetoric and filibustering ambitions of Southern statesmen did more to alienate Brazilian politicians than to unite the slaveholding powers. Northern capitalists, on the other hand, endeared themselves to Rio's elites by providing capital and expertise to build up the city's infrastructure, while abolitionist intellectuals befriended and publicly defended Brazil's emperor, convinced that his promises of gradual emancipation were sincere. The remaining three chapters turn their attention to the coffee-growing interior of São Paulo State and its dramatic transformation into an economic powerhouse. Regional elites saw free labor and mechanization as the path to prosperity and invited American capital and European landless laborers into their state, while they sent engineers, journalists, and sons of the elite to the US North, eager to witness its industrial growth firsthand.A book about the historical relationship between slavery and capitalism, American Mirror will inevitably be read in light of an already crowded field of contemporary scholarship that portrays slaveholders as “hemispheric hegemons” that were a vital part of capitalist modernization (7). But Saba's questions and concerns are provocatively different. Politically, he shows that many Brazilian elites viewed the US South not as a natural ally but as a developmental dead end, looking instead to create transnational connections with Northern capitalists, even abolitionists. And economically, he casts doubt on the entire framework of a “second slavery”—that is, that “the adoption of industrial technology and modern management techniques” could or did restore economic vitality to nineteenth-century slavery—arguing instead that these attempts were “never long-lived” and “eventually crushed by the forces they sought to control” (346). His argument gains in forcefulness as the book progresses, from its more measured presentation in the introduction to the phenomenal sixth chapter, in which the threads of his narrative come together as São Paulo State's coffee growing elite “welcomed emancipation” and ushered in a “brave new world” of industrial agriculture built on proletarianization and immiseration rather than slavery (258).The source base he uses to mount his argument is remarkable, joining private correspondence, regional political sources, and national newspapers from archives in both the United States and Brazil. And his prose is excellent throughout, with an easy-to-follow narrative that is peppered with evocative description and pithy aphorisms. Given its scope, readability, and strong presentation of a provocative position, I recommend it to anyone—nonacademics and students included—interested in the histories of slavery, capitalism, or the nineteenth-century United States and Brazil more broadly. My complaints are minor: although it suits his argument to emphasize that proslavery Brazilian planters and politicians were marginal, I found their almost total absence from the narrative to be a detriment. The reader would better understand Saba's antislavery protagonists with a clearer picture of whom they opposed. And, selfishly, I would have preferred fewer quotations from the subjects of his narrative: rather than exemplifying his points, I found they often only drew attention away from Saba's superb writing.",

    "abstract": "The simplest and strongest evaluation that I can offer of Heartland River is that it inspired in me the profound desire to experience firsthand the region it chronicles. This reaction, while potentially dismissed as not scholarly informed, is a testament to the volume's scholarly intent to evoke and describe the myriad facets of the Big Sioux River Valley.One of the significant strengths of the edited collection as a whole is the disparate nature of the contributions; each of the chapters offers a markedly different vision of the region. In so doing, however, the work also exhibits a great deal of cohesiveness. The result is that the reader cannot help but feel as though they understand the area as a “place” distinct from its wider context(s) and as a product of its historical and geographic idiosyncrasies.Running the gamut from its introductory section “Natural History and Indigenous Peoples” to the last two essays in its final section, entitled “Personal Reflections,” the collection manages to blend together cohesively a diverse array of scientific and historical voices and couple them with humanistic impressions of the region. In between there are sections entitled “Explorers, Settlers, Outlaws, and War,” “Writers, Scholars, and Artists,” “Politics,” and “Water Quality,” each of which expands the narrative of the Big Sioux River Valley in one or several ways.There are many highlights to be found in the individual chapters, and, while each chapter effectively contributes to the overall purpose of the text, the reader undoubtedly will find that some of them resonate more than others. Since I have not the space here to reflect upon each essay, I will highlight how several of them resonated with me.In part 1, “Natural History and Indigenous Peoples,” chapter 1, “A River through Time: Early Culture on the Big Sioux River,” lays important groundwork in terms of the human occupation and use of the area over the last eleven thousand years. Chapter 2, “From Pipes to Pistols,” introduces an appreciation of the dramatic change precipitated among Native Americans by European contact in the region.Part 2, “Explorers, Settlers, Outlaws, and War,” shifts the emphasis to European colonization of Siouxland. Chapters 7 and 8 stand out for their chronicling of seminal “frontier” events—the James/Unger Gang bank robbery in Northfield, Minnesota, and the “massacre” and kidnapping of settlers during the conflicts of the 1850s, respectively—each of which allow the authors to reflect upon the ambiguity of historical narratives.Part 3, “Writers, Scholars, and Artists,” offer memoirs of specific creators whose works bear the imprint of their connections to the Big Sioux River Valley. Perhaps the most fascinating of these contributions is chapter 10, which chronicles the origins of the term “Siouxland” in the work of author Frederick Manfred. This term, erroneously described by Wallace Stegner as a reference to the Indigenous peoples of the area, was actually an environmental/geographic/social amalgamation meant by Manfred to encompass and invoke the lands and lifestyles of the Big Sioux River Valley and surrounding areas.The two chapters of part 4, “Politics,” describe the electoral politics (chapter 14) and the politics of water (chapter 15). The latter provides an effective point of connection with the topic of part 5, “Water Quality.” Part 6, “Personal Reflections,” which concludes the volume with two heartfelt and insightful essays on the quality and nature of life in the Big Sioux River Valley.By way of conclusion, I will offer one final note of appreciation for this contribution by expressing my hope that other scholars and institutions will take this work as a template and produce similar works describing overlooked (or even not so overlooked) river basins across the American West and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Scholars have argued for the importance of industrial accidents and urban precarity in laying the groundwork for the European welfare state in nineteenth-century France. Given the central role that farming played in French economic, political, and cultural life, however, agricultural insurance was among the first and most frequently debated aspects of nineteenth-century attempts to apply insurance to the “social question.” This article explores what François Ewald has termed the “insurantial imaginary” of agricultural insurance by examining debates about which threats could or should be insured and who should insure them. Despite widespread consensus on the virtues of expanding insurance into the countryside, there remained huge areas of disagreement: What counted as an insurable risk in agriculture? How should that risk be assessed? And whose responsibility was it to insure such risks—that of private individuals or the French state? This article argues that the repeated failures of the various proposals designed to protect peasants against the vagaries of nature had as much to do with practical impediments as they did with ideas about the “naturalness” of certain dangers. This perception of the “natural” would inform the construction of the French welfare state.",

    "abstract": "This book is part of an expanding literature on agriculture in Japan from the perspective of political science. This work is firmly rooted in comparative arguments, utilizing richly detailed qualitative interviews, archival sources, and comprehensive fieldwork. The author's main argument is that Japan's agricultural policy framework should be viewed as a “macro-institution” shaped foremost by its positionality at the interface between formal rules and larger social network ties (9). This argument speaks to the agent/structure debate that emerged in political science in the 1980s and 1990s between those focused on large institutions such as governments and those who acknowledged the agency of individual actors, social groups, movements, and social forces.The book uses neoinstitutionalist theory, an iteration of structural theories that emphasize stability and gradual change. Jentzsch argues that neoinstitutionalism has a weak spot noted by comparative political economists—namely, understanding institutional change especially when those changes are internal and gradual. Neoinstitutionalism's focus on formal structures also oftentimes neglects local, informal institutions and the power of local actors to interpret, innovate, and shape responses to national shifts that may have the ability to control the degree of impact made by national legislative efforts. This monograph fills in a theoretical gap in neoinstitutionalism by focusing on change from within institutions by local actors, who Jentzsch argues have the power to shift formal rules by translating them into local practices. As a middle-ground comparative study, the work falls firmly within theoretical approaches calling for an expansion of the state and society interface (despite its use of neoinstitutionalism).The book is divided into five sections: part 1 is mostly theoretical and part 2 is historical, while the meat of the qualitative research is divided between parts 3 and 4, with conclusions presented in part 5. The primary comparison is between two very different agricultural areas in Japan, the villages of Hikawa and Kōfu. Hikawa's agricultural crop is mainly rice, while grapes are the primary one in the Kōfu basin. The town of Hikawa developed a novel approach to national policy goals of consolidating small rice paddy fields to create larger ones using hamlet-based collective farms, called the Kōsha system. Using a cooperative approach between the local Japan Agriculture farmer's union, the Kōsha formed a bulwark against the acquisition of local land by agribusinesses or foreign corporations. The ability of Hikawa to respond in this way resulted from its resistance to earlier efforts to merge with another municipality, thereby maintaining the structure of its existing cooperative system.Once the Kōsha system was in place and many farmers had yielded their rights to the union's management, the merger's potential to subvert local control over farmland was significantly diminished. In the Kōfu basin, however, shifts in the national cooperative structure allowed grape farmers to loosen themselves from Japan Agriculture's control and to innovate entrepreneurial business models.Using these two cases along with additional micro cases, Jentzsch finds that agricultural change in Japan was shaped by the larger context of shifting social and political boundaries—specifically, the municipal mergers and the restructuring of the all-powerful Japan Agriculture cooperative. Jentzsch suggests a negative outlook for Japanese farming, resulting from the gap between national policy directives calling for a sixth industrialization in agriculture amid collapsing local abilities to implement them. Importantly, Jentzsch notes that age-old practices don't just fall away; they remain along with and beside alternative “scripts for behavior—and local actors can revive and/or reinterpret ‘muted’ eroding norms” when it is in their interest do so (191).These processes shouldn't be dismissed as the shadow of bigger ones. They matter to how we understand boundaries, the relationship between formal and informal institutions as well as national and local-level policy implementation. Although the author reveals that he has “opened the black box of institutional arrangements being negotiated,” it is a rather small black box that coexists along with hundreds of others across Japan (190). While we have yet to understand the full impact of national-level policy changes and cooperative reform across the entirety of Japan, this book is an important contribution to this endeavor. The text reveals, with discerning though at times jargon-heavy prose, the power of the common paddy farmer, grape grower, and country villager. The strategies used here should be studied by those who care about the local control of agriculture, as they suggest alternative frames of reference and a potential for agency which can be overlooked.",

The book traces Ellis's activities during a time of significant agricultural change in England. Drawing attention to Ellis's many accomplishments in his analysis, Thick argues that Ellis is worthy of far more historical attention than he has yet received, on the strength of his significant contributions to eighteenth-century agricultural literature.The book is organized topically into chapters that consider different aspects of Ellis's life and work. Chapter 1 introduces the book's contention that Ellis deserves greater attention from historians, while chapter 2 traces his early life, family, and work as a brewer in London. Chapter 3 is a thorough analysis of Ellis's agricultural writings and perspectives on questions such as soil fertility, while chapter 4 explores Ellis's business ventures, including his advertising techniques and sale of agricultural instruments. Chapter 5 considers Ellis's perspectives on food and drink and his collation of rural cooking and preserving methods, while chapter 6 examines Ellis's involvement in his adopted hometown of Little Gaddesden, where he was a churchwarden. Chapter 7 considers other elements of Ellis's life uncovered by Thick's research, including his engineering initiatives, his place within the larger improvement movement of the eighteenth century, and his posthumous reputation. Chapter 8 concludes briefly by pointing to the wealth of information available on multiple facets of Ellis's life. Also included is an appendix giving examples of Ellis's flyers advertising agricultural goods and services, as well as an annotated bibliography of Ellis's published works. The latter is one of the most useful aspects of Thick's work, even though Ellis's frequent republishing of his own writing and the multiple editions (some unauthorized) of his work makes creating a comprehensive bibliography quite complicated. Fourteen black-and-white figures offer useful illustrations of relevant agricultural methods, maps, and frontispieces of several of Ellis's works.Thick, an independent researcher and Fellow of the Royal Society who has published copiously on early modern English agriculture and gardening, wrote this book over the course of the lockdowns in 2020–21, spending what must have been an exhaustive amount of time poring over Ellis's complete published works. What results is an incredibly detailed close reading of Ellis's attitudes toward different agricultural methods, rural lifeways, and food production. The frequent use of block quotes from Ellis's works provides the reader with a sense of Ellis's style without detracting from Thick's analysis. Additional research into contemporary agricultural works by Ellis's peers and of other accounts of Ellis, such as Pehr Kalm's oft-cited recounting of his visit to Ellis's farm, are also employed, often as a foil to Ellis's views.Although Thick's close focus on Ellis's works is one of the book's strengths, such a perspective sometimes obscures the significance of his argument that Ellis's prolific writings make him worthy of more attention from historians. The unintended consequence of such a detailed treatment is that the reader is left wondering about the broader significance of this prolific, talented writer and businessman living and working during a period of profound agricultural and social change. Yet research into Ellis's broader world does not figure as prominently in the book. Allusions to colonialism, to broader improvement trends, and to other eighteenth-century matters that could augment our understanding of Ellis's work and period more broadly are scant, leaving the reader with a detailed understanding of Ellis himself but less of a picture of his role in eighteenth-century British agriculture writ large. Scholars working outside of Ellis's place and period may be frustrated that the significance of Ellis's writing to agricultural change in other locations and contexts receives minimal attention. Because Thick focuses so closely on Ellis, he touches only moderately on the central debates in early modern English agricultural history. Some editorial choices and sparse footnotes occasionally detract from an otherwise accessible work. Beyond Thick's admirable work, space remains for scholars to connect the life and work of William Ellis to other themes in agricultural history, including global, transregional, or other comparative perspectives.Such connections between Ellis and broader themes in the history of agriculture and improvement are made more possible by Thick's work, the most accessible and engaging portrait of Ellis yet. The book shines especially in its close readings of Ellis's equally detailed accounts of cultivation and food preparation methods, where Thick's delight in his subject matter is most apparent. Thick has penned a valuable reference work for specialists, yet his enthusiasm and rich analysis also has the potential to captivate nonspecialist readers. This study creates ample opportunities for scholars of agricultural history to connect Ellis's life and work to emerging themes in the field.",

    "abstract": "Since Peter Kolchin's landmark comparison of Russian serfdom and American slavery, works by Alessandro Stanziani and others have approached the topic of bound labor from a comparative perspective. Although Kolchin has also attempted to situate emancipation in the US South globally, the topic of emancipation has received far less attention from a comparative perspective than bonded labor itself. This state of affairs in the field makes Bellows's well-researched monograph as timely as it is compelling.The legacies of Russian serfdom and American slavery haunt us to this day. In the case of American slavery, this legacy is a matter of daily debate in the courts, in the press, and in the streets. This book reminds us that these legacies are, in addition to material factors, constructed imaginings of the past and contemporary life. Making use of an untapped reservoir of sources hiding in plain sight, Bellows tells the story of how societies that were remarkably different in many ways experienced the transition from servile to free labor in similar ways. In both societies the visual and literary arts, as well as other types of visual culture like advertisements, reflected and shaped attitudes toward the servile institutions of the past and the position of the emancipated in the present. In narrating this comparative history, the book offers an explanation of how history is rewritten in the popular mind, of the role played in this construction of collective memory by artists, authors, and advertisers, and of how these constructed memories were used as tools to explain and manage the social and economic changes taking place around them.There are striking similarities in the ways that Russian and American artists and their audiences produced and consumed cultural archetypes reflective of elite perceptions of the servile past. In both cases, nostalgic portrayals of the past provided an instrument that former owners could use to resist further diminution of their power and status by Washington or Saint Petersburg. Cultural productions portrayed the serf estate and the slave plantation as benevolent places where owners kept the unpredictable, potentially violent, and backward characteristics of their property in check. Emancipation, from this nostalgic perspective, had given such features of the peasant and the enslaved person free rein. One didn't have to go to a gallery or read a book to encounter these images, as the expansion of ad-driven consumer capitalism conveyed the same images and messages in periodicals and on placards. The discussion of such advertisements and ephemera in chapter 5 is one of the highlights of the book. Whatever the media, the powerful role of these imagined pasts solidified elite attitudes, justified their attempts to turn back the clock to an imagined golden age, and shaped policy.Through comparison, the book also highlights two key differences between these post-emancipation societies. The first difference is the place of race in the white American psyche, including the particular fear evoked by Reconstruction legislation guaranteeing Black equality. This resulted in racially motivated violence and attempts to reduce formerly enslaved people to their previous condition in all but name. Cultural works proved particularly adept at fixing images of African American racial inferiority in ways that justified white violence and oppression. The second difference is the ambivalent position of the Russian peasant (in contrast to the formerly enslaved) in Russian elites' own self-conceptions of identity. Emancipated serfs received their freedom and a land allotment, but their legal inferiority remained. At the same time, the peasantry, for all its backwardness, still represented the soul of Russia. The peasant was thus inferior on some levels but, unlike the African American, could not be condemned entirely by elites without denying some part of their own identity.No two entities would seem to defy comparison more than the United States and the Russian Empire, if for no other reason than that politicians, ideologues, and historians have invested a lot of time in demonstrating their exceptionalism, manifest destinies, and divinely ordained missions. Yet Amanda Bellows's demonstration of the role played by literature and visual culture in shaping both societies' post-emancipation worlds indicates that similarities between the two were at least as important as the differences.",

    "abstract": "R. Douglas Hurt provides an expansive synthesis of the literature that evaluates the impact of the Green Revolution in different regions of the Global South since the 1950s, sketching a “transnational snapshot of its history” (5). Hurt defines the Green Revolution as “substantially increased food production on traditional farmlands due to improved seed varieties that are nourished with heavy applications of fertilizer and water, the latter provided by irrigation” (1). As Hurt points out, this increase in food grain production—primarily wheat, rice, and maize—“did not depend on agricultural science alone but also on government support in the form of grain price supports, subsidies for fertilizers, and the development of irrigation systems, as well as research” (3). The book chapters are organized geographically, tracing the history of agricultural modernization in Latin America, South Asia, East and Southeast Asia, China, and sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on a few countries in each region.Hurt constructs a complicated narrative that outlines the positions of advocates and critics of the Green Revolution. The overarching thesis is that the Green Revolution was a success in terms of its stated goal of increasing food production for a growing population but that it came with “unintended consequences,” as indicated in the title of the book. The narrow conception of success, measured in terms of increased yield productivity of a few varieties of monoculturally produced cereal crops, remains unquestioned in the analysis. It is worth noting that recent scholarship has also questioned the claims of increased yield productivity of cereals and its attribution to Green Revolution hybrid varieties.1The “unintended consequences” identified by Hurt include a wide range of concerns pointed out by critics of the Green Revolution, such as deepening class and regional inequality, the persistence of hunger and malnutrition, water pollution, aquifer depletion, and loss of genetic diversity. In Hurt's narrative, the social and ecological consequences illustrate a lack of long-term planning by agricultural scientists. Unequal distribution and access to food as well as to Green Revolution inputs by smallholders are attributed to political and institutional conditions.The economic crises facing farmers who were at the forefront of adopting Green Revolution technologies, such as debt traps and overproduction, are mentioned but receive less attention in the analysis. In Southeast Asia, by the 1990s “poor, small-scale farmers who invested in the Green Revolution technologies often fell deeply into debts” (95). In Ethiopia “the Green Revolution collapsed due to overproduction, which brought famine. Ethiopian farmers produced more grain with Green Revolution technologies than domestic consumers could eat or competitively sell on the world market” (152). The concluding reflections of the book do not draw out the implications of such economic crises, which were structurally inherent to the Green Revolution model and produced specific forms of inequalities.2 Hurt suggests that Green Revolution science was productive but had uneven social and economic consequences that were not necessarily “detrimental” (195).Hurt attributes the failure of Green Revolution technologies to increase food production in certain countries and regions to inadequate support from governments, weak infrastructure, and lack of supporting policies and institutional frameworks, especially subsidies and marketing to incentivize the uptake of Green Revolution technologies. This is highlighted, in particular, in the chapter on sub-Saharan Africa. Hurt's argument frames regional inequalities as an unintended consequence even as he points out that the package of high-yielding varieties was by design targeted at irrigated regions and required capital-intensive inputs. For example, crop-breeding research in India neglected dryland regions. Two implicit and problematic assumptions embedded in the book's analysis are that “politics” lies outside the domain of science and that the Green Revolution singularly exemplified science-based agriculture, contrasted with the monolithic category of “traditional farming.” A binary repeatedly invoked in the book is that of agricultural scientists as advocates of the Green Revolution versus social scientists as critics guided by ideology.Several recent histories and ethnographies have gone beyond the long-standing debates focused on yield productivity, impacts on rural incomes and employment to unpack the logics and politics of knowledge production that underpin the agricultural modernization paradigm of the Green Revolution. Works such as Nick Cullather's The Hungry World (2010), Sigrid Schmalzer's Red Revolution, Green Revolution (2016), Benjamin Robert Siegel’s Hungry Nation (2018), Ryan Nehring's “The Brazilian Green Revolution” (2022), and a 2017 roundtable discussion in Agricultural History have drawn attention to how Cold War geopolitics and Malthusian narratives of hunger shaped the trajectory of agricultural modernization, highlighted the political contestations within the scientific community about ecologically and socially appropriate agronomic practices, and traced the complex genealogies of transnational exchanges between actors and institutions in the Global North and the Global South in shaping the politics of Green Revolution. The book cites some of this scholarship, but it does not engage with many of the substantive arguments and, to a large extent, reproduces the assumptions and logics of modernization that they challenge.The final chapter on the more recent debates on genetically modified crops, the so-called Gene Revolution, departs from that framing to some extent and shows the entanglements between politics and agricultural science. In China, for instance, Hurt discusses how shifts in agricultural policy toward the development and commercialization of GM crops have been shaped by competing pressures and interests, by the politics of cultural nationalism, by the goals of national self-sufficiency, and by competitiveness in international trade.The book is a useful compendium that comprehensively maps the debates on the impacts of the Green Revolution in different regions of the Global South. While Hurt frames social inequalities and ecological degradation as stories of unintended consequences within countries, recent historical scholarship as well as contemporary food sovereignty movements are articulating a fundamental critique of the globally structured direction of agricultural transformation inaugurated by the Green Revolution that foreclosed other socially just and ecologically appropriate regional paths of agrarian and rural development.3 Emerging scholarship also demonstrates the transnational geopolitics of expertise that systemically shaped the Green Revolution model, tracing circulations and continuities across regions that show how the adverse consequences of monocultural, agrochemical- and water-intensive agriculture were recognized and contested from the early years.4 Such comparative analyses and global histories upend the entrenched narrative of the Green Revolution as the only possible pathway for postcolonial development and draw attention to erasures and the marginalization of alternative trajectories, expanding the space for rethinking the possibilities for socially just and sustainable agroecological forms of agrarian development.",

    "abstract": "From 1911 onward Unilever set about constructing a plantation empire in what was then Belgian Congo, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Working with the colonial authorities, the company was allowed to choose 750,000 hectares of land within five circles, each with a sixty-kilometer radius. The concession rights that came with the land included practically exclusive rights to purchase palm products from the local population and establish palm plantations. By 1959 Huileries du Congo Belge (HCB), the Unilever subsidiary that handled its business in Belgium and Congo, was responsible for 9.2 percent of the world trade in palm oil and ranked among the largest plantation projects in the world. After independence the company repeatedly changed names and owners, but four of the five plantations remain operational to this day.Henriet's study focuses on the Lusanga/Leverville circle. Initially designated as one of the most promising locations by HCB, it was the one concession that was unable to make the transition from natural palm groves (semiwild stands of trees where the locals would collect the palm fruits and sell them to the company) to plantation palms. However, the reader soon realizes that this microstudy is less an exercise in history than a vehicle for presenting Henriet's concept of colonial impotence.One book-length historical study of the HCB was previously published by Jules Marchal in 2001 (L'histoire du Congo, 1910–1945: Travail forcé pour l'huile de palme de Lord Leverhulme). At first glance the two books appear similar. They share the same cover photo, cover practically the same period, and use much of the same archival deposits—in fact, the very same boxes and files. It is therefore peculiar that Henriet never refers to Marchal's study—neither in the text, nor the footnotes, nor the bibliography. This lack of engagement is regrettable. One would have thought that several themes picked up by Marchal could have been further developed by Henriet, including the relationship between HCB and the other important concessionary company in the area, the Compagnie du Kasai.While Henriet does explain the well-known Kilamba incident that sparked the Pende revolt and in which both companies were involved, he does not explore other questions. For instance—and considering that both companies recruited workers in the same region—were they rivals, or did they cooperate? Did they present a united front vis-à-vis the administration? Could Africans play the two companies against each other to their benefit? These questions are of more than just historical interest; they speak directly to the plausibility of Leverhulme's paternalistic ambitions in Congo, and thus to Henriet's hypothesis. A discussion of the available archival source material—how much was the author able to consult, how much remains unused—would also have been useful for other researchers interested in the subject. Unilever's other concessions in Congo and throughout Africa, and their history beyond 1945, are not examined in this book.Henriet's hypothesis of “colonial impotence” links the inability of the colonial state and companies like Unilever to impose their will on the ground to sexual impotence. Moving through six thematic chapters, the author surely and steadily builds his arguments. The fundamental tension between Lord Leverhulme's “benevolent” paternalistic vision and a for-profit company are laid out in the first chapter, where Henriet ably points out the similarities between the modus operandi of HCB and that of the blood rubber companies of the Congo Free State. The following chapter deals with the inability of agents, both colonial administrators and company men, to impose their will on the Congolese, and the agents' disregard for the laws and regulations of the colony and the company. Chapters 3 and 4 study the various responses, both physical and spiritual, of the Congolese to the arrival of the company and the violence inflicted by HCB and its agents. The last two chapters look at the all-encompassing influence of the concession on the daily lives of the Congolese—rations, forced Western health care, clothing—and the difficulty for the company of bending the natural environment around Leverville to its will.Each chapter feeds into the book's overall argument, which the author summarizes in the following terms: “Colonial impotence speaks of the gap between the virtuous and the violent guises of the Leverville project; of the refusal of Europeans in the field to conform to the behaviours and attitudes demanded from them; of the agency of indigenous communities which hampered HCB's project; and of the impossibility for the company to bend the Kwilu's environment to its designs” (169). While this reviewer can understand this conceptualization of colonial ineffectiveness, the sexual dimension of Henriet's theory is more difficult to comprehend. “Like colonialism,” he writes, “impotence is inherently relational; it manifested itself through an ‘improper’ performance during intercourse. When actors of colonialism failed to conform to expected rules, guidelines and attitudes, they displayed metaphorical forms of impotence” (69). There is no doubt that sexual contact and, more importantly, widespread sexual violence were key parts of the colonial occupation of Africa. But that is not what Henriet engages with in his book; instead, he takes that well-known fact and superimposes it on a situation where its relevance is open to doubt. To this reviewer, at least, the additional conceptual understanding gained by comparing a company agent unwilling to carry out his duties to erectile dysfunction is not immediately obvious.",

    "abstract": "This remarkable book is a comparative study of Mennonite communities in seven disparate locations: Friesland in the Netherlands; Washington County in Iowa in the United States; the Rhineland municipality in Manitoba, Canada; Apollonovka district in southwest Siberia in Russia; the village of Margorejo on the island of Java in Indonesia; Matopo Mission in Matabeleland in Zimbabwe; and Riva Palacio colony in the Santa Cruz department in Bolivia. The successive chapters examine the historical origins of each community, their experiences with and in some cases resistance to agricultural modernization in the twentieth century, the differing attitudes toward religion and agriculture, the status and role of women, their knowledge of and attitudes toward a changing climate, and the varying international and global connections of each community.This book is the result of years of research by a team led by Loewen at the University of Winnipeg. It relies on a wide range of sources, from recent theoretical approaches to local publications, archives, diaries and memoirs, and periodicals. The study also uses numerous oral history interviews conducted by Loewen's students and colleagues in each region, based on a standard set of interview questions listed in the book's appendix.Loewen emphasizes that agriculture is based on local environmental conditions, but he also emphasizes the role of culture and “lived religion” in people's relationships to those environmental conditions (265). In his descriptions and analyses of these communities and their agricultural, religious, social, and political experiences, these different components carry different weights, based on their agricultural, economic, social, and political contexts.The Mennonite farmers in Iowa and Manitoba, for example, were much more willing to accept and apply modern mechanized and chemicalized farming techniques than the other communities. They were hesitant in the early decades of the twentieth century, but World War II, the competition of neighbors, and the increasing effectiveness of new technologies led most of them to modernize. They acknowledged Mennonite religious doctrines that emphasized simplicity and traditionalism, but by the 1970s traditional knowledge had become “nostalgia” and “cause for amusement” (82). By contrast, farmers in Riva Palacio tried much harder to hold onto traditional practices until these began to cause serious problems. For example, one of their traditions required them to use steel-wheeled tractors and reject rubber tires, until it became clear that steel wheels compacted the soil and reduced production.Attitudes about climate change also varied considerably. In Matabeleland and Riva Palacio the farmers were very aware of increasingly frequent and severe droughts and had a long tradition of remembering climate conditions that proved to them that their climate was changing for the worse. They attributed these changes in part, and in some cases assigned blame, to “greedy” outsiders who eliminated trees and extracted resources, but many of them understood at least in a basic way the global patterns. By contrast, farmers in Iowa and Manitoba were less affected, and while some recognized the problem, others minimized or denied the existence of climate change, viewing weather patterns as no different from the past and often as the result of divine interventions.The character and intensity of religious attitudes varied considerably. In northern communities, farmers maintained their religious beliefs but interpreted them in ways that rationalized their reliance on science and modern technologies. In Siberia, however, because of a history of harsh state repression of religion, arrests and removal of many men from their communities during the 1930s, World War II, and to a lesser extent during the post-Stalin period, the community's religious beliefs were quite intense even when they used modern farming practices. In Matabeleland and Margorejo, by contrast, Mennonite religion was syncretic and included traditional attitudes and practices from preexisting religious cultures, and their beliefs reassured them in dealing with changing weather, the introduction of modern farming, and social and political conflicts.The status and roles of women in these communities was particularly varied and often served as a greater challenge to religious doctrine. In all of these communities, religious doctrine tended to subordinate women and confine them to the household and peripheral activities. Yet in all of them women often resisted these constraints, taking on larger economic and social roles in their communities, especially in Siberia because the Communist government removed so many men. In Margorejo, women had considerable autonomy and class was a more important social division than gender; in Matabeleland, women had to struggle against traditional male domination and social and political conflicts.The communities also varied in their connections to the outside world. Iowa and Manitoba farmers, like their neighbors, early on were producing for international markets, and some of them went to Riva Palacios to help their fellow Mennonites modernize their work. Frisian farmers were incorporated along with other Dutch farmers in the European Union and subjected to its regulations. Riva Palacios farmers, as they came around to accepting modern techniques, sent representatives north to obtain more modern equipment as well as chemicals and seed. Post-Soviet Apollonovka became a capitalist farm and for the first time began receiving foreign visitors and advisers. Matabeleland farmers were increasingly impoverished and often viewed outsiders as vestiges of former colonial powers, although they also received financial and technical support from fellow Mennonites. Margorejo farmers were incorporated into the growing international Green Revolution and generally accepted it.Overall, this study presents vignettes of the evolution of farming in several of the main world agricultural regions. They show that these “Mennonite” farmers, regardless of their varying religious views, are fully part of their farming regions. Their religious-agricultural views, particularly their emphases on simplicity and traditional methods, were overwhelmed by new technologies such as mechanization, fertilizers, pesticides, and antidisease measures for livestock, and by environmental transformations, especially climate change. Most of these farmers had to accept and rely on such nontraditional measures because of increasing agricultural difficulties and a need for high production for their growing communities and markets.This book provides vivid grassroots views of these farmers' experiences in the process of modernization. It could be a very useful book for courses on regional and world agricultural history, for undergraduate students to expose them to farming in different parts of the world, and for graduate students as background and inspiration for their own research.",

    "abstract": "In a feat that would be remarkable under normal circumstances, it is especially impressive that historian Christian Pinnen managed to shepherd not one but two books to publication during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic: Colonial Mississippi: A Borrowed Land (with Charles Weeks, University Press of Mississippi) and this book, Complexion of Empire in Natchez. The latter work explores a changing Natchez, where over the span of about one hundred years, four different outside powers ruled with varying degrees of success. The French, Spanish, British, and Americans each inflicted systems that relied on stratification based on concepts of complexion. In each instance, Pinnen's exhaustive research reveals Native and African negotiations of the imposed hierarchies. Ultimately, the regime tied to cotton became the most successful and rigid scheme.Pinnen begins his analytical narrative with the French, who envisioned a lucrative agricultural empire built on a subjugated labor force. As with other European powers, their evolving concepts of Blackness provided convenient justification for the regime and a sense of order in colonial society, implemented via the code noir. Pinnen emphasizes that Africans, however, complicated French attempts to manage their empire by mounting legal challenges. Understanding that the French hierarchy of complexion not only clashed with their traditions of captivity but also degraded their own status, the Natchez Indians, in turn, rejected the French hierarchy of complexion. According to Pinnen, the Natchez also interpreted the stratification of complexion in a way that made them natural allies with Africans, with whom they ultimately united to prevent the French from establishing a successful tobacco enterprise in the area. In 1729, as the French stood on the verge of realizing profits in tobacco, the Natchez Revolt obliterated the plantation economy. The involvement of African escapees in this insurrection would for years haunt colonizers with the reminder of the catastrophic potential of Black and Brown people banding together against their oppressors.The British who followed also viewed Natchez as a potentially profitable tobacco plantation region, an extension of their Atlantic plantation economy based on unfree African labor. Pinnen reiterates that “settling Natchez was as much about race as it was about imperial control” (59). Concepts of skin color, culture, and heathenism merged to create a British brand of hierarchy based on complexion. British codification of race and slavery in Natchez began in the 1760s, only tightening over time. Pinnen points out that in a significant departure from the French model, the English system assumed Black people as enslaved by default. Pinnen argues that despite the regime's reliance on enslaved African labor as “the backbone of any agricultural endeavor in Natchez,” enslaved people pressed against the system to the best of their ability (50). However, the restrictions of English law meant that running away offered a better chance of gaining freedom than did most legal suits. Because the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Creek did not view themselves to be in concert with Africans according to the hierarchy of complexion, Africans were unable to join Indigenous societies to the extent that they did elsewhere with other Native nations, like the Seminole.Gaining control of Natchez in 1779, the Spanish also proved intent on using African descent to justify slavery and drew distinctions of complexion by officially prohibiting colonists from enslaving Native Americans. While the Spanish regime differed from the French and English, Pinnen shows that two pillars continued to uphold the colonial foundation: profit and complexion. The model of slave-grown tobacco grew (despite some logistic challenges) thanks to royal tobacco subsidies and tariff-free slave importation. Despite their subjugation due to complexion, nonwhite people in this Spanish colonial structure enjoyed greater access to courts than they had under English law. The hierarchy of complexion subjected African people to slavery but also recognized them as subjects of the Crown and souls for the Catholic Church. Africans in Natchez understood and negotiated this system. In their wrangling for some self-determination or outright freedom, enslaved and free women of color, for example, carefully selected the godparents of their newly baptized children from among powerful whites, establishing advantageous fictive kinship networks.Finally, the United States' acquisition of Natchez via the 1795 Treaty of San Lorenzo accelerated the growth of the cotton economy and ushered in new complexion rules. As Pinnen explains, under US law “phenotype became a total, all-encompassing marker” in Natchez for the first time (184). Although enslaved people did not cease to challenge the system, they increasingly worked within that system as individuals and in their claims to freedom acknowledged the legitimacy of slavery based on complexion. Readers will be more familiar with this last part of the story—the development of cotton capitalism—which has received renewed interest by many historians in the last ten years or so. Complexions of Empire contributes an exploration of one locale before and early on in this transformation without taking it as a given.Besides the book's mastery of a wide breadth of sources to provide a rich narrative of so many different actors, the highlight of the work is Pinnen's emphasis on African (and Native) people's resistance to and shaping of each colonial system imposed on them. Their successes did not disprove the strength of hierarchies of complexion but did demonstrate the flexibility and liminality of colonial projects. Although there are portions of the work in which concepts of complexion could be a bit more tightly connected to the events described, the book offers a rich history of how Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans shaped the manifestation of race, slavery, and empire.",

Barba concludes, “Slavery in the Texas borderlands was never a static institution or system of practices; it was, rather, part of a web of ever-changing processes” (10).Seven chapters arranged into three main parts, an introduction and epilogue, seven maps and two tables, and a full seventy-five pages of endnotes support Barba's main claim: “Slavery's forms emerged not necessarily from some essential set of core cultural attributes (i.e., ownership rights over others, legal institutions of subjugation, and structural racism) but from the nexus of various, ever-changing human networks, prerogatives, and decisions” (11). Part 1 of this book highlights the ways in which the history of slavery in Texas transcended the borders of the modern-day US state (21). Part 2 emphasizes how understandings of kinship served as catalysts for violence against enslaved people (132). Part 3 underscores how Anglo-American violence rooted in anti-Blackness operated in tandem with other forms of violence against enslaved people in the Texas borderlands (226).Country of the Cursed and the Driven contributes to the historiography on slavery when it successfully argues that kin-making often served as a form of subjugation across Comanche, Spanish, and Anglo-American systems of slavery. Rather than categorize systems of slavery into “better” adoptive systems of slavery that treated enslaved people as members of an extended family and “worse” systems of slavery that valued anti-Blackness and chattel slavery, Barba demonstrates how slavers' understandings of kin-making contributed to exploitation and violence. Enslaved women forced to become wives for Comanche men, particularly when coupled with the physical and psychological traumas of rape and forced parenthood, for instance, certainly did not live better enslaved lives (167–68). As Barba concedes, “Family and slavery were not diametrically opposed. In many ways, they could be two sides of the same coin” (15–16). Barba acknowledges marked differences between Comanche, Spanish, and Anglo-American systems of slavery, but, more importantly, cautions readers against interpreting kin-making within slavery as a sign of more benign forms of slavery (135).Country of the Cursed and the Driven discusses intersections between Texas borderlands systems of slavery through the lens of agricultural expansion, a topic that may be of particular interest for readers of Agricultural History. Barba pinpoints Indigenous efforts to curb Anglo-American proslavery, primarily agricultural expansionism in the mid-nineteenth century, as a topic for future research and identifies Spanish and Anglo-American agricultural expansionism as major turning points in Indigenous, Spanish, and Anglo-American systems of slavery (158, 303). He posits that Comanches may not have fully understood the extent of Black subjugation within Anglo-American systems of slavery in Texas; however, they recognized Black enslaved people forced to work in agricultural spaces as crucial aspects of Anglo colonialism (314).The sheer range of historical voices in this volume constitutes one of the book's main strengths. Drawing on the advice of Saidiya Hartman's Scenes of Subjection (1997), Barba prioritizes the often difficult and untold stories of individuals who lived slavery's “web of ever-changing processes.” Barba frames his work, including the book's title, in response to Cherokee Elijah Hicks's 1840s observations about the interconnectivity of slavery systems through Comanchería (3–4, 317). Barba emphasizes the experiences of María Gertrudis de la Peña, an enslaved woman in Spanish society (169). He highlights Betty Powers, an enslaved woman of African descent who shared her recollections of the constant threat of sexual and whipping violence against women (251). Throughout this work, Barba deftly balances deeply personal, micro-level stories with large-scale historical significances and processes.Country of the Cursed and the Driven stands as a meticulously researched narrative of human stories of violence and resistance. It reframes familiar stories in unfamiliar ways and identifies sites of future research. Students and experienced scholars will find much to consider in this work of Texas history, transcultural and borderlands history, and slavery history.",

    "abstract": "In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the American fast-food chain McDonald's withdrew from the Russian market. McDonald's had operated in Russia since 1990, and the chain was popular with Russian consumers. Analysts predicted that Russians, deprived of their Big Macs, would revolt and place additional pressure on President Vladimir Putin to end the war. But such hopes fizzled. Though McDonald's sold its stores in Russia, the rebranded restaurants, known as “Vkusno i tochka” (“Tasty and That's It”), were able to produce and sell meals that approximated what Russian consumers had grown accustomed to before the invasion.Suzanne Wengle's book was released in March 2022, too late to include coverage of the war. But the book is nonetheless a timely addition to the literature. It includes a wealth of observations that help us understand Russia's ability to weather Western sanctions and continue to project its influence around the globe. The fact that the Russian chain Vkusno i tochka could quickly produce meals that taste like McDonald's has a longer history, Wengle reveals. Putin, far more than his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, “held out a greater degree of food commodity autarky as a desirable policy goal” (71–72). This project accelerated after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Then, Putin embargoed a range of Western agricultural products and sought to strengthen domestic producers. It was under his leadership, too, that Russia became the world's largest wheat exporter, supplying the commodity to the Middle East and Africa.In light of current events, the author's discussion of agriculture during the Putin years is perhaps the most striking aspect of Black Earth, White Bread. But the book is much broader, offering an analysis of agriculture and food production in Russia over the last hundred years, a period that includes Soviet rule (1917–91). Arguing that “politics and technologies together drive change in food systems,” Wengle, a political scientist, uses the framework of “technopolitics” to analyze this history (8). She defines “technopolitics” as “the support of and reliance on agricultural technologies—from tractors to CRISPR techniques—in policy regimes that seek to realize particular political goals and utopias” (8). The value of a technopolitical approach, Wengle argues, lies in its ability to reveal “crucial relationships between diverse and changing groups of actors in the four realms of food systems—politics, production, consumption, and nature” (17). Along the way, the author also highlights global connections embedded within these themes, persuasively fighting back against the tendency to see the development of Russian agriculture as aberrant and disconnected from the West.In the author's view, these four realms are interconnected. To understand the transformation of food systems, it is important to analyze them all. Wengle critiques the discipline of political science for neglecting the spheres of nature and consumption in particular, and the book's title, Black Earth, White Bread, highlights this. The term “black earth” refers to the fertile black soils in parts of Russia that at times helped planners achieve grain production goals. “White bread” gestures to the hopes of some Soviet officials that white bread, which they associated with higher living standards, would replace black bread in the diet of Russian peasants.The book is composed of four chapters, one devoted to each realm. Though this makes for some repetition, particularly in the first two chapters, “Governance” and “Production,” it also serves to underscore the value of a multifaceted approach. I was particularly taken by some of the author's observations about consumption. The author argues that the discipline of political science has tended to focus narrowly on actions, like voting and protests, neglecting other aspects of citizens' behavior, including consumption. In the conclusion, Wengle identifies vulnerabilities of Russia's current food system and speculates that such weaknesses may feature in a “future struggle between the opposition and the Putin regime” (225). Clearly, such observations hold particular relevance in light of the war in Ukraine.The book is not a work of primary source research. Rather, it synthesizes the existing secondary literature to highlight the author's technopolitical approach across a hundred years of Russian food and agricultural history. In a subject this vast, not every topic can be covered in depth. Even so, there are themes that deserved greater scrutiny. First, alcohol. Mikhail Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaigns in the 1980s became a flash point for Russian consumers, and there is a significant scholarly literature on the subject of vodka in Russian history. However, the author only touches upon the theme in passing. Another missing issue is ethnicity. I was never quite certain of the region under study, whether it is “Russia” in its incarnations as the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Soviet period) followed by the Russian Federation in 1991, or, alternately, whether the author intended to scrutinize the entire territory of the Soviet Union followed by a narrower focus on the Russian Federation after the collapse. The book's title would seem to indicate that the book is just about “Russia.” But at times the author uses statistics from the Soviet Union as a whole or evidence from non-Russian republics to support her points, which left me confused. Whatever the geographic focus, the theme deserved greater attention, particularly as so much of the food that Russians came to enjoy during the Soviet period was produced in the non-Russian periphery. Today, the Russian Federation is a major food exporter to former Soviet republics like Belarus and Kazakhstan, illustrating the continuing salience of ties developed under Soviet rule.",

    "abstract": "Few people would think of communism at the mention of rural “red states,” yet left-wing radicalism had an outsized influence in northern plains farm organizations, especially in Montana, the Dakotas, and Nebraska in the first half of the twentieth century. William C. Pratt, professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska Omaha, uncovers the role of rural radicals from multiple angles and within the broader context of the left-liberal alliance. Left-wing radicals, according to Pratt, either identified as socialists or communists or “sought major changes in the existing economic order beyond what the mainstream of historic progressivism or the New Deal attempted” (5). In After Populism, Pratt examines the relationship between left-wing radicals and left-of-center farm groups and their breakup at the onset of the Cold War.After Populism appears to be a monograph but is essentially a collection of articles Pratt published between 1985 and 2014. All but two of the fourteen chapters previously appeared in academic journals but have been “adapted” for the book. As a result, After Populism seems disconnected in the middle. The first seven chapters share a common methodology, thematic focus, and periodization, distinct from the later chapters, which generally have their own unity. The book could avert confusion if separated into two sections with a brief explanation linking them together.In the first several chapters, Pratt narrates the travails and joys of grassroots research. Searching for scraps of information, he traversed long dirt roads, conducted oral interviews, combed through small courthouse records, and visited forgotten graveyards. Under the Freedom of Information Act, Pratt acquired Federal Bureau of Investigation records that provided surveillance information on some of his subjects. Research at the Russian State Archives in Moscow connected communist activities in the region to the Comintern.The first half of After Populism focuses on the period from 1900 to the 1930s. Pratt illustrates the strength of the Socialist Party but cautions that most people who voted socialist mainly did so as a means to express dissatisfaction with the status quo rather than because of a commitment to its ideology. After World War I, the Socialist Party all but died out as members opted for the Nonpartisan League or one of several communist parties. Pratt views the 1924 elections as a major blow to radicalism on the northern plains because Progressive Party candidate Robert LaFollette distanced himself from the budding farmer-labor movement. Next, he examines the farm revolt of the early 1930s, highlighting the interaction between the United Farmers League—a communist front group—and the Farmers' Holiday Association. In some counties the United Farmers League dominated the farm revolt, while in others it worked alongside the Farmers' Holiday Association. In addition to the popularity of New Deal programs, Pratt finds that factionalism played a significant role in the collapse of radicalism in the early 1930s. He also chronicles the activities of three local women farm revolt leaders and explores the creation of left-leaning third parties in the prairie provinces of Canada as compared with those in the US plains.Picking up after World War II, the later chapters consider the National Farmers Union (NFU) leadership, especially highlighting the role of North Dakota Farmers Union president Glenn Talbott, as it tried to maintain a popular front alliance in the late 1940s. Pratt analyzes the relationship between the NFU leadership and Henry Wallace during his bid for president in 1948 and notes that although NFU leaders privately endorsed him, they declined to do so publicly in part because it would open their organization to charges of communism. A brief chapter documents the extensive FBI surveillance of real and suspected communists in the upper Midwest before detailing the NFU's move to the political center and the attacks on it by Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy, the Farm Bureau, and others on the right. Pratt concludes with a comparison of the 1980s farm crisis to the farm revolt of the 1930s.Scholars unfamiliar with Pratt's work will appreciate the grassroots level treatment of radicalism on the northern plains. Pratt adds a level of complexity by showing the diversity of background and opinion in some counties and towns in multiple states. He also extends the timeline of the decline of the radical rural Left into the 1950s.Though most of the findings in After Populism are already a part of the scholarly record, this volume brings together decades of work that helps explain the demise of the agrarian left in the northern plains and the many factors involved in farmers' political and economic calculus.",

    "abstract": "In January 2021, in a Toronto winter, as I was getting ready to teach a course on the history of food, environment, and labor in South Asia, my thoughts strayed often to the borders of Delhi, India, several continents away from my desk. Since August 2020, groups of Indian farmers, most from Punjab, had been organizing themselves, coming together to protest new neoliberal farm laws proposed by Narendra Modi's government. These laws were ostensibly intended to free agricultural markets from government regulation but would certainly open them up to the control of large corporate buyers setting prices. Just outside Delhi, along highways linking the capital to surrounding agricultural and industrial districts and the rest of the country, farmer organizations had set up campsites, libraries, performance and oratorial spaces, kitchens, and even small makeshift farms. Thousands of farmers (over the months millions) were there to make their discontent with the new laws palpable, their voices heard, and their labor and solidarity globally visible.As I worked on the syllabus, I very tentatively considered bringing the farmers and their protest into my classroom. My historical training has made me wary of falling into presentism, to make connections between the past and a present that may often be structurally determined differently, though this is one of the easiest ways students relate and respond to historical scholarship. Equally important, I wasn't sure how to maintain a balance between high emotions over an issue that was creating such political waves in India and its diaspora and the kind of careful reading, discussion, and writing that were the aims of the course. As a migrant graduate student in Canada with Indian citizenship, I felt my own vulnerability and that of undergraduate students, who were often migrants too. Hindu nationalist organizations in India and the diaspora have been quick to target events and spaces involving critical discussion of the Modi government, its policies, and the Hindu nationalist movement that it politically represents, denouncing such criticisms as perceived attacks on the nation and religion; critics have been faced with trolling, doxing, other forms of harassment, and in some cases criminal proceedings and jail.1 Despite these misgivings, over two iterations of the course, it became clear that the pedagogical had to be political and that presenting this contemporary people's movement through the course materials was a highly generative pedagogical act. Learning about agricultural history alongside the agricultural present could be a way to make a fractured world of pandemic and climate crisis layered on capitalism and colonialism feel challenging and alive rather than alienating.Over the last century, much of South Asia's wheat has come from Punjab, on either side of a national border between India and Pakistan. Punjabi migration in the early twentieth century was also intimately intertwined with histories of North American settler colonial states, their agricultural development, and immigration regimes. More recent waves of migration and a large South Asian population in the Greater Toronto Area meant that in my online classroom hosted by the University of Toronto, at least some of the students were likely to be South Asian or even Punjabi in origin, and Punjab loomed large in the imagination of South Asia from here. Accordingly, the syllabus included two academic readings that engaged with this history. A book chapter about the establishment of Punjab's canal colonies discussed planned settlements on former scrublands around canals in Punjab, built to further the British colonial government's intention of bringing more land under cultivation and irrigation and improving agriculture in the region.2 Another reading opened up questions around how histories of contested Punjabi arrival could be later subsumed into the settler colonial narrative of good laboring migrants contributing to the aims of the colonial state.3 Lecture materials covered other topics in Punjab's agricultural history, such as the consequences of the partition of Punjab for the control and use of water and the canal system of the region, dam building in postcolonial India, and the impact of the Green Revolution.In the first iteration of the course, I included a journalistic overview by Sharanya Deepak of the farmer protests as something of an afterthought.4 In the second iteration, I added two more: an article by Aniket Aga discussing the protested neoliberal farm laws as the final death toll of the Green Revolution and the inequities it produced, and an ethnography of the protest sites by Sarover Zaidi.5 Both Deepak's and Aga's pieces, though not historical in perspective, briefly discuss the history of agricultural Punjab before the protests; Zaidi allows her readers to step with her into a contingent present. I chose these pieces in the hope that they would allow students to think about change over time and contingencies of history.Given the ongoing pandemic, all discussion happened online in Zoom meetings. I did not always see the faces of my students, but their responses and thoughts lingered powerfully through their participation in discussion and their writing. On the whole, student responses were deeply critical of neoliberal governance and identified sympathetic figures in these narratives around Punjab, historical and contemporary. Thinking about settler colonialism and our entanglements with it in Canada as well as how land itself was reorganized and parceled out to settlers in Punjab's canal colonies brought up profound questions on these systems of agriculture and land use. One student discussed culpability and responsibility in regard to a settler colonial extractive state that they had migrated to in search of a better life. Others were struck by how learning the history of settlement in colonial canal colonies made visible land acquisition processes; for several Punjabi students, this revealed the trajectories of their own ancestors and families, involved in acquisition processes they had not previously probed historically. This kind of self-reflection allowed students to think with sympathy and solidarity about the situation of farmers in a capitalist system that both gives to and exploits them and to ask questions about their own entanglements in capitalist and colonial agricultural systems. Some students with backgrounds in economics wrote analytically about questions of power and economic growth in the agricultural sector, discussing related examples from other non–South Asian contexts and thinking about development and sustainability. The emotional heft of this history and of the protests were however never far from students' analysis; for instance, one student, Harjas Singh, prefaced a discussion of creeping neoliberalism in India's agricultural policies over the last decade with the comment, “As a Punjabi Sikh and someone who has family still living in Punjab, this is an issue that hits close to home. I have friends and family who have protested here in Canada, as well as my family having donated to relief efforts for those protesting back in India.”This engagement with systemic power was coupled with a consideration of what dissent meant in the narratives of Punjabi agriculture and farm labor that we looked at. Most notable was perhaps one tutorial discussion during which some students argued that the state's authoritarian approach was necessary for development; others responded by asking whether the state could ask constituencies to make sacrifices for the common good and in the name of growth and development, who should decide what that growth and development should look like, and which constituencies could be asked to make such sacrifices. This led to a discussion of the place of dissent and opposition within political systems and protest as a means of representation in democracies. I was struck by the enthusiasm students displayed for this political activity by farmers; through their discussion, I could see how examining the issues propelling the farmer protests led many to the idea that people's movements would be increasingly crucial going forward as climate emergency changes many of the rhythms and rules of agriculture. Zaidi's ethnography in particular invited students to imaginatively visit the site of protest and think about its possibilities, and they commented on the immediacy of this reading experience. The discussion questioned the religious and caste politics of farmer organizations too; some students recognized that there was still work to be done for solidarity.In retrospect, this reading and discussion experience could have worked well with invited guests who were engaged with the protests and could speak about them with greater facility than I, the teaching assistants, or any of the students could. But that would have been a very different kind of engagement, with perhaps greater deference and more of a compulsion to take notes than to express ideas. Our more exploratory reading and discussion sessions, in fact, successfully provided a focus for questions and ideas that many students had been dealing with outside of the classroom, as videos and images from the farmer protests flooded Instagram and TikTok feeds and, more generally, we all contended with pandemic-related food supply issues and price rises. On November 19, 2021, when the Modi government announced that the farm laws would be repealed and millions of farmers celebrated the victory of months of sustained protest, I received an email from Mannat Boparai, one of the students in the ongoing course, congratulating me on what she called “our victory.” Attached were three images and a video from one of the major protest sites on Delhi's Tikri border; she had taken these that very morning. In a time of online teaching and engagement, the classroom and the protests were actually very close to each other, and students were taking the history they learned to their own activism.",

    "abstract": "When I lived in Nebraska, I met a white poet who explained to me in her slight southern twang that her family was “native” to the plains, “as old as the dirt.” I struggled to reconcile her familial placemaking with her erasure of Indigeneity—until now. This woman's claim to settler longevity in the 2010s is part of a legacy of generations of frontier narratives grown in what Molly Rozum calls the “gumbo” of transnationalism (xiv). The intensity with which grasslands-grown generations experienced their surroundings created a passionate sense of place inseparable from a larger regional identity, one that ignored national borders in favor of the environment. As Rozum argues, ecological and cultural change were intertwined (120).Rozum's book follows a chronology of the first immigrant and citizen settlers in the heart of the grasslands in the late nineteenth century through their adolescence and into adulthood. Through diaries and letters, she charmingly reassembles the sounds and smells of the “small world” experience of first-generation grasslands children. Their keen observation of animals, the land, plants, and weather translated into early exposure to archaeology, biology, botany, ecology, hydrology, meteorology, and paleontology. Rozum never lets us forget, however, that their cultivated childhood experiences came at the disadvantage of the region's Indigenous peoples, and that settler colonialism is the driving force behind her study.Parallel stories across the US-Canada border are all that situates the transnationalism in the childhood chapters. It becomes much more pronounced as Rozum follows the children into adolescence and early adulthood. She explains that as their education became more formalized, it also became more national and global—two narratives that served settler colonialism better than regionalism. These adolescents' geographies expanded too as they began to travel greater distances and transition into gendered work life, often in larger towns or regional cities. Yet even in these new environs, these young adults applied their small-world observation skills to bigger places.Many of Rozum's characters begin to lose their charm as they age fully into adulthood. Gone are the youthful days of wandering the prairie and rolling down the hills. They are replaced with first-time encounters with Indigenous peoples (predominately in settler spaces) alongside cultural and intellectual appropriation of Native lifeways and food science. Deviating from her close readings of diaries and letters, Rozum shifts briefly to analyzing creative works as mechanisms for regional placemaking that centered immigrant and citizen stories and erased Native peoples off the landscape. These works rarely broke into national markets but formed a popular region-defining genre of “settler fiction” (254) that, by the early 1900s, had professionalized and exceeded its predecessor: the pioneer novel.By the mid-twentieth century, the grasslands-grown generations had converted their precious region into grainlands. Agricultural innovation followed the establishment of higher education institutions, but, in essence, these researchers formalized the small-world science of their youths. The literary lamentations over industrialized progress following World War I and changes in farming technology manifested in real-world strife following the droughts of the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1940s, they shifted their focus to preservation efforts.While some of the early chapters can be rather encyclopedic, this book is a must-read for anyone with an interest in what is now known as the Northern Great Plains. Though not explicitly about gender, Rozum's careful analysis subtly reveals the divergent gender roles from childhood through adulthood. She weaves in narratives from Icelandic immigrants alongside African American homesteaders, adding to the chorus of voices emerging from the grasslands. Her book is a meditation on the body as much as it is on the land as she tells the story both generationally and seasonally.The poet who raised my hackles with her generational amnesia also once convinced me to lie down beneath the dried canopy of 850 acres of original, unplowed tallgrass and listen to sounds of the Nebraskan prairie. Reading Rozum's book kept my head beneath the rustle of the tallgrass, conjuring memories of a small-world soundscape of tiny critters, my own breath, and a surprising, peaceful silence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract From 300 CE to 1800 CE, Indigenous North Americans initiated a great material and cosmological transformation. Indigenous peoples moved away from their more nomadic lifestyles by mastering hydrology to manage crop cycles, engineering building systems to house their growing populations and food stores, and developing innovative political confederacies to harness the transformative and spiritual power of the Three Sisters. Through an examination of traditional ecological knowledge—what Gregory Cajete calls the “original instructions for how to care for and relate to the land”—this essay argues that the cultivation and spread of corn, beans, and squash radically remade Indigenous North America into a world bound by a set of relationships and reciprocal responsibilities between humans and plants. These plants were far more than commodities. They were kin—or, as plant ecologist Robin Wall Kimmerer says, “sovereign persons.” As Indigenous women spread the Three Sisters across the continent, these plants and the attendant corn cosmologies provided narratives to explain human ancestry and evolution. Such creation stories attracted Indigenous immigrants to Cahokia, Indigenous traders to the Mandan and Hidatsa rendezvous, and helped precipitate the rise of the Wendat, Haudenosaunee, and Powhatan confederacies.",

    "abstract": "Writing and teaching using global history is by no means a novel concept. Students in both K–12 and postsecondary education systems have been exposed to them to varying degrees since the 1990s. Despite having clear connections to world history, agricultural history has largely been taught through national and or regional lenses. Recently, agricultural education specialists have identified the integration of “a more globalized approach” to teaching agriculture to be a priority for the future.1 As such, we are left to answer the question of how history instructors can develop effective assignments to encourage undergraduate students to think more globally about agriculture. Moreover, how can these assignments be accessible to classrooms that do not have the budget, time, or access to fieldwork and or civic engagement components? These were the two guiding questions that I asked myself when designing assignments for a course titled Food, Science, and Technology during the Interwar Period. My approach was to go digital. Though still imperfect in several ways, the digital assignment (discussed below) inspired students to engage and reflect on global narratives within agricultural history.One unit of this course focused on how World War I reshaped the global agricultural market by disrupting food supply networks. The result was widespread hunger and even famine conditions in many European countries. In some cases, disturbances caused by food deprivation led to revolutionary events and even the collapse of empires (Russia). To consider the global effects of the war and connect them with the issues of food access, I designed an assignment that asked students to trace the outbreak of food riots from 1914 to 1919. In outlining the goals for the assignment, I sought to make it a collaborative in-class experience that focused on developing the following skills: (1) improving historical research skills, including formulating a research question, obtaining data, evaluating it, and placing it in a global historical context; (2) developing knowledge and mastery of digital technologies; and (3) working in collaboration with others.For this assignment, students worked in groups of four to six people during the period of one ninety-minute class. Each group was assigned a year and was asked to find articles in newspaper databases (e.g., the New York Times) using several specific keywords, such as “food riot,” “food revolt,” “food disturbances,” and so on. After finding relevant articles that reported news about food riots in different cities across the world, students put this data into an Excel spreadsheet (fig. 1). Each group had its sheet in the joint Excel spreadsheet in which they recorded the date, city, country, participants, cause, and resolution. Over the course of this assignment, these groups collected and analyzed between ten and twenty newspaper articles. The rest of the class time was devoted to transferring the collected data using Google Maps onto a single map that had layers for each year (fig. 2). Each layer was identified with a different color to make it easier to track the development of food insecurity during and after World War I after the map was completed. Students spent approximately thirty minutes creating the map by putting colored pins and writing short descriptions of events based on the information from newspaper articles. After the map was completed, students examined the map layers that their colleagues created and discussed their findings in small groups and then as a large group.As a result, I observed a more engaged and productive conversation about global connections in agricultural history. Students commented on the global impact of World War I on food production and food access, as well as social and racial inequality. Students connected key course themes outlined in lectures and secondary readings with their analysis of primary sources. Further, the map helped not only to visualize the number of food riots but also to demonstrate the growth and then the eventual decline of food riots in different countries. The dynamic nature of digital technologies presents students with another way of looking at the “change over time” concept. Second, this assignment helped students to “live” a life of a professional historian. Students obtained hands-on experience in asking a research question, identifying keywords for their search, and then working through the database with an immense amount of information. In the process, they used critical thinking skills to evaluate information and choose what articles fit their search criteria. Moreover, by working with the database, they realized that not all articles contained the same amount of information, and they were able to identify historical gaps that could only be filled with the help of other sources. Finally, the assignment dismantled stereotypes of agricultural history as a dry and insignificant subspecialty by demonstrating its deep connections to political, economic, and cultural history. In the end, mapping out historical events and processes by using newspaper archives proved an effective way to visualize the agricultural history and food history of the twentieth century.I believe that the assignment can be modified to adapt to different teaching contexts. For larger classes, the assignment can be a take-home group project where students meet outside of the classroom. For virtual environments, students can work in breakout rooms. To shorten the time spent on the assignment in and beyond the classroom, an instructor might choose articles ahead of time and focus students' efforts on analyzing the assigned material and transferring acquired information on a map in Google Maps. The assignment can be adapted to the analysis of other historical events and processes that are not connected to famines and food riots. Mapping the Green Revolution comes to mind.Despite the positive outcomes, the assignment still had some drawbacks. One obstacle for those engaged in premodern, marginalized, or Indigenous histories is access to sources. However, even those who focus on the modern era will have productive conversations about the limitations of newspapers and whose perspectives they provide. Another obstacle was the utilization of English-language newspapers that reported on domestic and foreign riots. While the records of riots were valuable, it was important to recognize whose voice students were hearing in those accounts. Nevertheless, the assignment achieves two crucial goals. It demonstrates how the global military conflict impacted agricultural production and food access in urban and rural areas not only in Europe but also in other places all over the world.",

    "abstract": "For decades, the tours of many historic plantation sites have focused on the plantation mansion. Charting the Plantation Landscape from Natchez to New Orleans challenges the prominence of the “big house” and the cultural mythology that has made it, in popular memory, the most significant feature of the plantation. Each of the volume's seven essays uses a unique disciplinary lens and focuses on a different thematic aspect of the nineteenth-century plantation to displace the mansion as the focal point of the plantation landscape. Drawing on approaches used by architectural historians Dell Upton and John Michael Vlach, this volume illustrates how the mansion-dominated plantation landscape experienced by visitors today is a fragmentary remnant of a larger historical reality.Arranged chronologically by editor and Oak Alley Foundation curator Laura Kilcer VanHuss, these essays move briskly through a wide range of topics that broadly explore how the built environment of plantations in the lower Mississippi River valley and visitors' perception of them have changed over time. Marie Adrien Persac's 1858 Norman's Chart of the Lower Mississippi River serves as a collective foil, which allows each author to establish a path leading to new vantage points of the plantation landscape. The divergent paths outlined by contributing scholars challenge Persac's highly aesthetic and celebratory depiction of the region's plantations and offers a perspective that defines the plantation landscape historically beyond the mansions that occupied it.Charting the Plantation Landscape begins with architectural historian Laura Blokker's essay “Construction and Construct,” which examines the abundance of architectural styles used in constructing ancillary buildings like the neighborhoods of slave quarters, kitchens, sugarhouses, barns, and hospitals that enabled slaveholders’ intensive agricultural pursuits. The collection's second essay, Suzanne Turner's “The Plantation Landscape,” focuses on the ways in which European colonizers exploited and remade the “wilderness” they found along the Lower Mississippi River. Wading into the swamps to explore how the region’s landscape was transformed into manicured European-style gardens and African swept yards, Turner, like Blokker, minimizes the big house's prominence by emphasizing the construction and changing uses of other aspects of its built environment.Three subsequent essays focus on the plantation from slavery to emancipation. Two of these essays describe the plantation landscape in familiar terms. In “Severed Heads to Statehouse,” Charles D. Chamberlain III examines the violent rise and fall of Creole sugar planter power throughout the nineteenth century. Chamberlain contends that sugar production played an important role in defining the plantation landscape as it appeared on Persac's map. According to William Horne's essay, “Landscapes of Emancipation,” freedpeople redefined this plantation landscape on their own terms during the postwar period. Horne argues that freedpeople transformed plantations into sites of radical grassroots resistance in their “rejection of the established political topography” (131).Christopher Willoughby's standout essay, “Plantations as Landscapes of Medicine,” explores antebellum physicians' role upholding the region's slave system. According to Willoughby, plantation physicians played a critical role in planters' efforts to modernize agricultural systems by ensuring enslaved men's labor productivity and enslaved women's reproductive capacity. Through their claims that slavery was healthy for enslaved men and women, these doctors contributed to the construction of racial science and shaped the “racial imaginary” of the plantation by putting the health of the plantation over that of African Americans.The collection's final two essays analyze changes in the ways artists visually represented plantations during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Christopher Morris and art historian Jochen Wierich both also consider how these representations helped construct and popularize a cultural myth of the plantation focused around its aesthetics. In “After Persac,” Wierich examines how the visual culture of the plantation landscape evolved between 1860 and 1940. Detailed antebellum depictions of planter power like Persac's evolved into romanticized paintings and photographs that blended time and space and distorted the historical reality of the plantation. According to Wierich, the combined forces of heritage tourism, historic preservation, and modern photography in the twentieth century produced the image of the plantation lodged in popular historical memory.In “The Rise and Fall of Uncle Sam Plantation,” Morris further explores how the ghostly photographs of abandoned plantations captured by Farm Security Administration photographers in the 1930s influenced the public's imagination. These images reinforced a cultural narrative that connected the destruction of abandoned plantation structure with the “myth of lost southern glory.” Morris contends that the centralized modern state also used this romantic narrative to justify the destruction of “relics” of the Old South in the name of progress and reclaiming the productivity of abandoned landscapes. By focusing on the environmental transformations and the human and ecological costs associated with the flood control and levee construction necessary to sustain agricultural production, Morris redefines the lower Mississippi River valley plantation landscape by viewing the land and water as active participants in its construction.Some essays, like Willoughby and Morris's, do more than others to chart plantation landscape beyond the mansions that adorn it. Nonetheless, academic audiences will find much to admire and reflect upon as they follow along the paths each author traces. This volume also seems particularly well suited for undergraduate courses. The various definitions of the plantation landscape in this volume offer numerous opportunities to generate discussion among students. More important, perhaps, this volume excels at its self-assigned task by providing the public with an accessible introduction to the complex historical reality of the plantation landscape.",

    "abstract": "I first came to Duke Campus Farm in winter, for an interview, hoping to become the site's inaugural full-time farm manager. The ground was frozen and the soil tight-lipped, revealing little. Returning in the spring to start work, I found to my chagrin a red clay so fine as to be almost greasy, which seemed to speak only in horse nettle and fire ants. Before arriving in Durham, my most recent farming experience had been on the Central California coast, where the soils are young, rich, and deep. As a grower, the old, tired, Southern Piedmont soils originally struck me as a cataclysm, a shambles.As I've settled into North Carolina and started teaching with the farm, through hands-on work in sustainable agriculture and also in the environmental humanities, I now see the same landscape more clearly, as an incredibly rich environment for a campus farm. With less production pressure and an educational mission, we have the time to really pay attention to our soils, and to care for them and about them. In struggling with the paucity of the land we farm, the effort it takes to make it yield and to restore its basic functions, we understand in a different way what has already been taken from it.1 Our “native” soils are the result of geological weathering, yes, but also an all-too-human combination of two hundred years of extractive agriculture and a century of chattel slavery.Our site offers a space to step into the complex systems of small-scale agroecological farming and the demands of a student-powered, seventy-member CSA. Our land is a catalyst for reflection on the wider systems of processing and transport, consumption and waste, food culture and foodways. Our soils, like so many others, also carry the legacies of extermination and enslavement, of displacement and migration, of abundance and resilience in American agriculture. As I work with this soil in both farm and classroom, I'm learning to better hear its stories. Through the actual work with soil, our contact with it—through broadforking, digging, pricking out, raking, shaping, cover cropping, composting—we can experience in a more direct way all that the farm's denuded soils represent, what this land has seen and what its future might hold.Through the archival work of Duke Forest and several intrepid students, we know that our farm was part of a three-hundred-acre parcel granted to Mr. Thomas Couch in 1754.2 Over the next two centuries, the Couch family and the people they enslaved and hired built a plantation that at its height reached several thousand acres, working it continuously until 1947. We know the names of thirty-six people that they enslaved, but we assume from the extent of their operations that they enslaved many, many more.3What happened before the Couch family's arrival is visible mostly through the soil. Much of what we know about the agriculture of North Carolina's Native peoples comes from the 1585 account of Thomas Hariot and John White. These English explorers spent roughly a year in coastal North Carolina with Algonquian-speaking peoples. But their attempts at establishing a colony were famously unsteady and soon failed.4 As they noted, disease spread rapidly through all of the Indigenous communities that they visited, and the settled agriculture that they initially encountered quickly unraveled as local populations sharply declined.5 By the time a subsequent expedition arrived a few years later, the lifeways Hariot and White first encountered were already fractured. And by the time John Lawson recorded a voyage on foot through the interior of what is now North Carolina in 1700, he encountered “a small people, having lost much of their former Numbers . . . most by the Small-pox, which hath often visited them, sweeping away whole Towns.”6The land's more recent history as a farm project launched by undergraduates in 2010 builds on these legacies of loss. What I am learning, both through work with our soil and work with colleagues such as Dr. Dan Richter, a critical zone scientist, is that the soil that we encounter is not a given but is in an important sense a human artifact, a juncture of bio-hydrogeologic pedologies and also human ones. In visiting our farm in 2018, Vivette Jeffries-Logan, a citizen of the Occaneechi Band of the Saponi, told us: “What you're farming on is the dust of the bones of my ancestors.” The style of farming that we practice on our intensively cultivated acre necessitates deep contact with our soils, with this dust and these bones. When we invite students and members of the general public to join in the work of civic agriculture, when we talk of regenerative agriculture and the work of repair, we are also inviting them into contact with these histories and all that is both broken and resilient within them. We recognize that embodied contact with these histories has the potential to disturb, even to traumatize, as well as to heal.How, then, to tell these stories? The temptation to ignore them—to lean into a more pastoral vision of young people at an elite university growing organic vegetables for their communities—can be strong. What are the ethics of a more anti-pastoral kind of storytelling? Who has the right to share these stories, and in what context can they be shared?7 These are live questions that we are still navigating as educators. One strategy that has worked for us is to allow the soil, and the plants themselves, to bear witness.8 In our Cackalacky Heritage Garden, for example, we grow crops that were significant to those who cultivated this land before us: seed sunflowers, green and brown colored cottons, Bright Leaf tobacco, indigo, heirloom okras, cow peas, sorghums, and benne.9 These crops become a tangible, living testimony to the wisdom and technologies of communities and their seeds. They also serve as conversation starters that help students reflect on their own place within, and the ongoing legacy of, plantation systems. As members of the Duke community, we are active participants in an institution founded on tobacco and its economies. As staff and faculty at Duke, we are also, of course, implicated in this legacy.10We also have a ten-foot-deep soil pit at the Duke Campus Farm, dug with an excavator. With this we can “read” each soil layer or horizon, as a dendrochronologist might read the rings of a tree. To a soil scientist like my colleague Dr. Dan Richter, the profiles voice the stories of carbon cycles deep below the earth's surface, of the Piedmont ultisol's weathered history. What is compelling about the pit is also what is not there, the three to four feet of soil above the surface of the pit (as estimated by Richter) that eroded soon after white settlement in the Carolinas.11 The soil horizons missing from the Duke Campus Farm's topography can be read, among other things, as an invisible record of the many thousands of lives—of Indigenous and enslaved peoples—ground down and seemingly vanished, and the profound environmental as well as human loss that this absence represents.As of this writing, fifty-nine student interns, thousands of volunteers, and billions of soil microorganisms have made substantial progress in bringing the soil back to life. Through our soils and the intimate connection with them that our way of farming necessitates, we are able to teach both the deep time of geology and offer a case study for the Plantationocene, making visible and tangible connections between our ransacked soils and their human histories.12 The ecological dead zones that were the majority of DCF's native soils have become a way to think with our farm as an unfolding of geological time, as a site of mourning and enslavement and as an opportunity for partnering with the more-than-human world—fungi, bacteria, actinomycetes, earthworms, pollinators, plants, and countless others—to bring these soils back to life.While we grow thousands of pounds of organic produce each year, our chief output is ultimately, therefore, not produce but students with a renewed sense of self-efficacy and an understanding of the vastness of the food system and the human histories at its roots. We are contravening the Anthropocene cycle described by Anna Tsing as “promise and ruin,” of extraction and abandonment of land and communities, to return to the wreckage and offer it a muscular kind of love, the work of repair.13 We do this despite the fact that very few of us who work at the farm are from this place, and none of us will ever own it. Moving forward, I hope our soils will have new vitality and more generative, and regenerative, histories to share.",

    "abstract": "My research suggests that reembedding in a human-scale economy can help individuals connect to fundamental values: meaningful work, belonging in community, and connection to nature. Scaling down economies to the local or bioregional scale will help us to mitigate some of the worst risks of climate change, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and social unrest. Small-scale production is something anyone can take part in and has the potential to form the basis of entirely new economic and political networks that can blossom into the world to come. Teaching these agricultural history concepts through experiential learning has the potential to transform the perspective of students to what is possible in terms of a sustainable future.1Based on these research findings, I founded Rizoma Field School in Uruguay, where American university students participate in immersive, place-based volunteer learning. They engage with community members in a mutual process of learning about and practicing sustainability. Students collaborate with community partners on sustainability projects. In the projects, students observe ongoing community efforts in areas such as sustainable agriculture while also supporting new initiatives. Students work especially in the realm of sustainable agricultural production, focusing on projects such as agroecological food production and bioconstruction. Students do tasks such as tree planting, sowing and reaping crops, or hand-making buildings of bamboo, mud, and straw. After working on the projects, students and instructors reflect on their experience and connect it to broader issues related to consumption and production.With my training in environmental sociology, I act as an accompanying instructor to the students' experiences. I work to connect the fieldwork with discussions of topics related to sustainable consumption, such as agroecology, cultural diversity, engineering, and social dimensions of nature-culture dynamics. Students are asked in nightly reflections to highlight some of their observations of sustainable production practices in this context. They are then encouraged to consider how they might apply some lessons from Uruguayan sustainable livelihoods into their own lives. In combination, applied learning and more conceptual, content-focused discussions mutually reinforce each other, encouraging students to reflect on their own values, perspectives, and behaviors. This is strengthened by volunteering in projects with local community members as students come to see how sustainability is influenced by people's livelihoods, culture, and context.Student groups have worked with community partners to build small farm structures using methods of natural building (see figs. 1, 2, and 3). The natural building process is low skill but labor intensive. Therefore, community partners have used the donated volunteer time to build simple structures on their land. In most cases, students have constructed storage sheds for farm tools and food harvest preservation.The natural building process involves mixing together ratios of materials like earthen clay, sand, water, and straw. Mixing can be done with a concrete mixer, or by hand (or foot!). Structures are usually built out of felled tree trunks and bamboo, and then a clay/sand/water/straw mixture is applied on this bamboo scaffolding to make the walls. Students are split into groups for the various tasks and given a short demonstration by community members, who then provide ongoing instruction during the building process.At the end of each volunteer session, students ask questions to community members to understand things like: Why do you build with natural materials?What are the benefits of this style of building?How did you come to learn about natural building?At the end of the experience, students have built a functioning structure for community members, and students leave the experience with hands-on skills and a philosophical understanding of the natural building approach.At the end of each workday, in the evening, I attend students' reflection sessions. I offer a sociological lens to questions about culture, sustainability, and the built environment. In this particular example, I explain to students how natural building is a traditional technology that is financially accessible to most people in the world. It has the benefit of being a sustainable, not extractive, mode of building. I also try to highlight that there are natural building practitioners around the world, including in Europe and North America, to highlight the fundamental ways in which students can bring these experiences and lessons back into their own lives at the end of the trip.The field school can give students hands-on experience at implementing sustainable livelihoods and provide new perspectives on what sustainability solutions can look like in unfamiliar contexts. Students come to understand the necessary human scale of sustainable systems of production and to consider the advantages and disadvantages of common technological approaches to sustainability solutions.The experience highlights the amount of effort that goes into agricultural production processes, illustrating tensions with easily available and cheap consumption opportunities in Global North economies. The pedagogical approach centers the agroecological farmer as expert, upending the normal power structures where information flows from Global North to Global South. Building these new perspectives helps to illuminate the problematic pattern of consumption patterns in the developed world, such as industrial agriculture, that create detrimental impacts for individuals who make their livelihood through relatively sustainable actions. In this way, experiential learning can be leveraged to compel students to think critically about systemic structures of production and consumption, the negative outcomes that these structures operationalize, and the students' role in responding to these challenges.Working from the idea that the most transformative learning must take place in context, Rizoma Field School seeks to pair ideas with experiences in order to facilitate meaningful long-term changes in thinking and behaviors for our students. The ultimate goal is that students leave Rizoma with an intellectual and experiential toolkit with which to take to their part of the world and their life's work.Assessments after the period abroad confirm the transformational quality of the experience: I want others to grow in the same ways I have and to have this motivating experience. I needed a trip like this to give me the ability to feel the importance of my everyday choices regarding the environment, as well as my interactions with people. (Ohio State University Student, Buck-I-SERV 2019)This trip changed my life. I feel more equipped to live a life with my values after learning from everyone here. I am so thrilled to go home and share what I learned. (Ohio State University Student, Buck-I-SERV 2019)On this trip, I learned that service is more easily accessible than I thought. If I see a problem or want to help a cause, I realize that I can find the people that can get me involved. I will also actively promote good and sustainable ideas since I got to learn about them in Uruguay and want to share with my friends and family (University of Idaho Student, ASB Winter 2018)The world that we live in seems as if it is growing smaller and smaller and the way people notice this is through cultural diversity. People notice different mannerisms, customs, foods, language, clothing etc. These things are very interesting to me and I love learning about them and how they came about. (University of Idaho Student, ASB Winter 2018)I wanted to tell you guys just how much I appreciated this opportunity and all I have learned from your family and way of life. I raved to my parents and all my friends about how much I loved Uruguay and all the people we got to help. I feel so lucky to have gotten to go on this trip and meet all of you. Currently in the process of setting up a recycling initiative in my sorority (baby steps) and composting all our left over food to the back yard area, to hopefully start a small garden! Moscow is cold, windy and I have yet to see the sun. I could really use an afternoon at the beach and eating some of Pablo Jordan's delicious food. I am so grateful for your hospitality and wish you guys all the best! (University of Idaho Student, ASB Winter 2018)The model of Rizoma Field School describes efforts to promote sustainable consumption through experiential learning in Colonia, Uruguay. However, the approaches could be translated to a variety of settings by maintaining an emphasis on collaboration with community partners on a range of hands-on, sustainable production-oriented projects. These experiences, whether abroad or closer to home, facilitate intimate learning opportunities that make sustainability tangible. Teaching agricultural history and sociology through experiential learning with agroecological producers, if it were a model adopted globally, has the potential to transform education.",

    "abstract": "Some years ago, like many recent graduates starting visiting teaching positions, I was in the unenviable position of creating new courses a few weeks before the semester started. As I constructed my syllabus for a history of science in the United States course at the University of California, Berkeley, a land-grant university (LGU), I realized that covering the history of land-grant universities was an ideal way to incorporate agricultural history and local history into the class while touching on many major themes and events in American history. Since then, I have continued to use local agricultural history and history of the LGU system to explore issues such as gender, segregation, dispossession, knowledge creation and dissemination, human and nonhuman animal relationships, and theory of bodies, health, and the environment in a wide range of courses from first-year US history surveys to graduate student history of medicine seminars at Cal, Michigan State University, and Oklahoma State University. I have designed several activities that can be adapted for different courses, content, and locations. Collaborating with the university archives and local historical associations allowed me to tailor these lessons and activities for each university and class. Discussing local agricultural education and history with students provides them with an opportunity to directly connect their college experiences with past events and actions and gain insight into how their education and institution is part of American society and history. They also learn how agricultural teaching, knowledge, and practices shaped their university and communities. In this article, I will share my current lesson plan and strategies for adapting it for different courses and skill levels.When I began my current position at Oklahoma State University, I dove into Oklahoma history to update my material on land-grant universities and make it relevant to students in my US history since the Civil War survey. As I prepared for the course, I realized Oklahoma is the only state with 1862, 1890, and 1994 Morrill Act institutions and that creating a lesson centered on these three LGUs would provide me with a platform to discuss gender, race, segregation, and land. These topics were introduced before this lesson both in the textbook and lecture, and we continued to discuss them throughout the rest of the class. Covering them in the context of agricultural education and land-grant institutions allowed students to understand how these issues shaped Oklahoma State University and connected them to their own lives and experiences.I set aside two class sessions for this lesson plan and started by sharing a photograph of the first class of Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College (1862 Morrill Act) students. I asked my students who were the students attending what is now Oklahoma State University at its founding. Many in the course were surprised to see that about half of the initial student body were women, but they were not surprised by the fact that the founding class was all white. This activity segued into a brief overview of how and why land-grant universities developed and why there were three separate Morrill Acts over 132 years.After the content about the Morrill Acts, I returned to OSU for an activity about gender, higher education, and career opportunities. Using information from old course catalogs available in the university archives, I listed the seven course options that were available for first-year students in the 1901 spring semester (Etymology and Structure, German or Latin, Algebra, Geometry, Hygiene, Cooking, and Woodworking or Stockjudging) and assigned groups of students to represent seven actual students (women majoring in general science, English literature, home economics education, and zoology, and men majoring in plant agriculture, math, and engineering). The groups then selected what five courses they thought were most relevant to their major and shared their decisions with the class. After that, I revealed that some of these courses were gender-restricted (Hygiene and Cooking for women and Woodworking or Stockjudging for men).After this reveal, I shared additional content about the gendering of majors and courses at land-grant universities and started discussion with another photo analysis prompt. This image was of six students (four women and two men) in an 1896 Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College dissection course. I asked the students why they thought women would be in an anatomy course, which then led to a larger discussion about how agriculture and science educational and career opportunities were gendered at the time. We kept returning to this point throughout the course as we talked about the changing roles of women in the workplace and wage disparities during the twentieth century.From there, I moved away from OSU and to Langston University, the only historically Black college or university founded in Oklahoma under the 1890 Morrill Act. This gave me an opportunity to cover segregation in Oklahoma and to provide local examples that complemented the textbook content on the issue. I shared with the students that the 1890 Morrill Act specified that the split of funds provided to the state for LGUs had to be “just and equitable” and provided an example from the archives that the split was $22,500 for OSU to $2,500 for Langston in 1900. We then discussed what “just and equitable” means and who determines that. We returned to this point the following week when talking about Plessy v. Ferguson and the concept of “separate but equal” and later in the semester when covering Brown v. Board of Education.Finally, the first class session ended with an introduction to the Land-Grab Universities project and the land dispossession that built and funded these institutions.1 Oklahoma was not covered as part of the reporting project, but by sharing the website with students, they saw the larger pattern and picture of how Native American land and natural resources were taken to build the land-grant university system. The students read about the Dawes Act and land rushes in the textbook that week, so when we talked about the “donated” land that white farmers gave to establish what is now the OSU campus, they connected the dots of how land rushes played a role in transferring this space from Native control to the university.In between the two class sessions, the students read an excerpt of Laura C. Kellogg's writing, available in the American Yawp Reader, for their weekly primary source assignment, and in addition they were asked to watch a thirty-minute documentary on the legacy of Chilocco Indian Agricultural School, an American Indian boarding school and the only one that specialized in agriculture.2 They then wrote short journal responses with their initial thoughts and questions and brought those notes to the next class.I started the second session with a brief overview on the history of Native American boarding schools and a short clip from the documentary. I used a photo analysis prompt, this one of students in front of a building at Chilocco surrounded by two fences, to spur discussion about the differences between the aims of Oklahoma's land-grant universities and Chilocco, including the differences in the educational experiences, and how the boarding school sought to replace Indigenous agricultural knowledge and practices as part of forced assimilation. To continue the conversation about forced assimilation, the students broke up into small groups to share their thoughts on Kellogg's writing, and then we talked about it as a class. We returned to this discussion weeks later when covering Native American communities during the New Deal and then again when learning about the Red Power movement and Native activism in the late twentieth century.Next, I introduced students to a new type of primary source that they had not encountered yet in the course, oral histories. First, I informed them what an oral history is and why they are of value to historians. Second, I showed them the Chilocco Indian Agricultural School Oral History Project as an example of how oral histories can be used to capture the experiences of people whose voices might not be heard or included in other sources.3 Then, I shared a segment from Claudine King's (Chickasaw) oral history interview.4 As an alum and former employee of the school, she offered a unique perspective on the transition of the institution from federal control to Native American control. We did a photo analysis prompt using an image of 1957 Chilocco Princess Marie Brown (Osage) and 1957 Chilocco Brave Gordon Roy (Ponca) to discuss the move away from forced assimilation policy at the school. I then wrapped up our discussion of Chilocco by covering the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 and the College of the Muscogee Nation (1994 Morrill Act) and introducing the concept of self-determination and sovereignty that we returned to when covering the Red Power movement later in the semester.The last question for this lesson was a takeaway question for students to consider on their own. I asked “Why are there still three separate land-grant universities in Oklahoma?” and “Do they address the original LGU mission of benefiting the agriculture and the mechanical arts?” I reminded them to think about the intent of the institutions to serve communities in Oklahoma as they pondered the question over the weekend. We returned to this question again at the end of the semester as we discussed multiculturalism, free speech, who controls and dictates education requirements, and other current issues at universities in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.Since there are land-grant universities in every state and most universities have robust institutional archives, this lesson can be adapted to any location and modified for different courses. By working with the archives at your local land-grant universities and historical societies, you can find course catalogs, photographs, student papers, diaries, letters, and oral histories that can be used in class as primary sources and to provide local content for this lesson. While Oklahoma is the only state with all three types of LGUs, the topics of gender, race, and dispossession can be covered even if there are no local 1890 or 1994 Morrill Act institutions. Focusing on historical and current admission policies and rates at your state's land-grant university or universities, including how this may vary at each individual campus in a larger system like the University of California system, and how and why those campuses were built in those locations, can provide students with insight into these issues.5This lesson can also be modified and adapted in any number of ways for upper-division students and courses. For example, when I covered this subject in an upper-division science and society course at Michigan State University, we spent more time exploring primary sources including photographs from the early years of the university. I split the students into groups of four or five; each group had a different photo that they analyzed, and then they shared their findings with the class. Another option would be to allow the students to do the research. For this lesson, I found the old course catalog and university pictures in the archives and relied on an existing oral history project housed in the library for content. In an undergraduate capstone course or a graduate course, students could conduct this research instead and share their findings not only in class but through public history projects such as a podcast or short documentary, digital maps, or specialized tours of campus.Exploring the creation and early days of agricultural education at Oklahoma State University, Langston University, and Chilocco Indian Agricultural School provided me with an opportunity to use local examples and archival resources to teach students about sexism, segregation, and forced assimilation and directly connect it to their university experiences. It also demonstrates to students how agriculture shaped education and educational institutions in the state. For historians of agriculture, this lesson can provide an opportunity to teach about the intersection of education and agriculture and how the long history of issues that campuses and students currently grapple with can be understood through this lens.",

    "abstract": "Recent scholarly and media attention on palm oil has documented widespread negative social and environmental consequences of its production. In this book, anthropologists Tania Li and Pujo Semedi, in collaboration with a team of Indonesian and Canadian graduate and undergraduate students, draw attention to the increasing presence of both state-owned and private oil palm plantation companies in a specific community in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. They demonstrate how corporate influence has dramatically transformed the lives of residents who remain reliant on land for their livelihoods and survival. Using both political technology and political economy as analytical lenses, they show how plantation companies (Natco and Priva) have been able to structure economic, cultural, and political lifeworlds in ways that prevent meaningful agroecological alternatives from being imaginable, let alone realized. By focusing on the productive effects of developmentalist discourses, corporate promises, cultural and nationalist narratives, as well as legal and state infrastructures, the book highlights formal and informal mechanisms and practices that seek to legitimize highly inequitable relations of dependence.Over five chapters, the book successfully shows how the entrenched forms of social, economic, and cultural hierarchy characteristic of contemporary Indonesian agrarian capitalism stem neither from the absence of state regulation nor solely from the deployment of overt violence and coercion. Rather, the authors suggest that the persistence of unequal distributional outcomes resulting from oil palm production relies on active state institutions at all scales to privilege corporate plantation interests, especially in terms of land access. It also requires various individuals to be either “willingly” co-opted into the expansion of the crop's production or complicit in “stealing” monetarily and materially from an infrastructure that ultimately, despite its seeming totalizing character, is not led by state or private elites able to know all, see all, and control all. The book's insights regarding not only the petty involvement of even the most impoverished or marginalized in the “mafia system,” sometimes for the purposes of basic subsistence, but also its elaboration of the myth of the autonomous “independent” outgrower, point to the difficulty of identifying clear victims and villains.The authors' ethnography articulates the heterogeneity of views, fates, and perspectives among different state officials, outgrowers, brokers, foremen, harvesters, laborers, and “locals,” allowing readers to appreciate the complexity of structural realities and situated contingencies faced by different actors as they respond to discourses, incentives, and risks linked to oil palm development specifically and economic development more generally. Such analytical moves demonstrate the need to question dichotomies of state-market, consent-coercion, legal-illegal, and ethical-corrupt as ways to adequately describe or judge the actions and decisions of those implicated in the realities the book discusses.In this regard, the book offers excellent insights into the predicaments faced by those who gain little or lose out from the expansion of oil palm. The authors valuably criticize existing vocabularies and approaches espoused by human rights organizations and environmental initiatives to make plantation oil palm more just and sustainable. More broadly, they convincingly argue for ambivalence toward liberal reformist frameworks, based on more “accurate” maps and land use classifications and “better” implementation of laws and regulations. For example, the heterogeneity of positions of different state officials would suggest that vague invocations of “good governance” would not be very effective in contributing to substantive change in economic and political arrangements. Relatedly, their elaboration of the contentious relationships between “local” Dayak and Malay communities and transmigrant laborers/farmers from other Indonesian provinces would suggest the difficulty of realizing alternative land tenure arrangements primarily based on indigeneity or custom.These complexities do not mean that the authors believe that genuine alternative moral economies are not thinkable or possible. Importantly, they are not inherently against cash crop production. They recognize that the region has had a long history of livelihood strategies that in part involved market-oriented agriculture. Rather, the authors emphasize a qualitative shift beginning in the 1980s when Natco and Priva began to establish themselves as corporate occupiers of the region, catalyzed in part by concomitant shifts in land and labor regimes. In addition, the authors repeatedly link the inability of collective action to act as a countervailing force to the continued vilification of organized left politics in Indonesia, especially of unions that were robust up until the 1960s. As such, the book's attention to the lingering specter of authoritarian and paternalistic rule during President Suharto's rule during 1966–98 is especially notable.The book should be of interest to agricultural historians, especially those grappling with how to periodize plantation histories in the Global South and understand resistances to its persistence from the colonial era onward. Especially with its multiple references to Ann Stoler's theoretical work on “imperial debris” and her historical anthropology of Sumatran plantations, the book's argument that plantation histories in their continuities and ruptures are simultaneously political histories of a heterogeneous Indonesian state is one that can also apply in various other contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article uses the concept of purity to explore the thinking of purebred animal breeders and that of eugenicists in Britain and North America between 1880 and 1920. It begins with an explanation of why such a study is important and continues with the historical background of purity's role in animal breeding over the nineteenth century and an assessment of the theoretical foundations of Francis Galton's eugenics. The article argues that the shared concern with pedigree keeping, which characterized both purebred breeding and eugenics, made it easy for historians to assume that the two fields were more connected than they actually were. In fact, the basis for purity in animal breeding—namely, inbreeding and marketability—could not migrate to eugenics. Pedigree use in animal breeding (inbreeding, consistency, and marketability) actually had little in common with pedigree use in eugenics (evidence of inheritance via statistical quantification). Unpacking this historic connection between animal breeding and eugenics has significance today for such disciplines as animal breeding itself, genetics, politics, and ethics.",

    "abstract": "Field Trip! Many first encounter museums during a school visit. The best of such trips tend to feature close inspection of historic artifacts or opportunities to put the hand to the plow and learn by doing. These two approaches—“reading” an artifact as higher-level thinking or performing a historic task as kinesthetic learning—affirm the primary function of a museum, which is to create knowledge through interpretation of historic artifacts and archival material. Students can learn about agricultural land use and its environmental context by analyzing living collections (flora and fauna) and cultural landscapes. Through engagement with collections and interpreters, they can explore subjects as wide-ranging as social justice and civil rights, food security and human health, the social construction of technology (both mechanical and biotechnical), geopolitics of trade, and animal, seed, and soil science, to name a few.The book Interpreting Agriculture at Museums and Historic Sites (2017) explores the many ways that collections support knowledge creation focused on these agricultural subjects.1 Care must be taken with any teaching opportunity to balance the positive lessons with the complex realities of the past, negative or positive. Museums that interpret agriculture have received their share of criticism for being out of touch with guest interests. Living history, generally, has been criticized for emphasizing white perspectives and providing a romantic view of a past by avoiding discussion of conflict. Instead, those who use museums to teach through agriculture can set a new standard. Artifacts become the best examples of technological change over time and can help us learn about humans and landscapes, about cultural systems focused on crops and livestock, and about conflict at the heart of food security. Ultimately, using museums to teach through agriculture engages the student in the highest level of thinking. The student turns the material and immaterial culture they have studied into their own interpretation of a plow or a plot of land or a pot of stew simmering on a stove in an agricultural museum or living history farm near you.The process of knowledge acquisition in museums often begins with archival collections. These two-dimensional resources can take many forms, such as personal correspondence or articles in historic farm journals. Among the most useful for teaching are educational stereographs sold by the tens of thousands to teachers as formal curriculum materials. For example, Underwood and Underwood, the largest stereograph publisher in the early twentieth century, released its instructional guide, The United States of America through the Stereoscope: One Hundred Outlooks from Successive Standpoints in Different Parts of the World's Greatest Republic in 1904. It focused on national productivity including cattle, cotton, rice, and tobacco, among other agricultural products. Keystone View Company began its education division in 1905 and published Visual Education as a teacher's guide to its “600 Set” in 1906. Experts wrote the background information for these visual instructional materials. Another resource is the work of Frank M. McMurry, a professor at Columbia University, who, with twenty-four other educators, compiled The World Visualized for the Classroom: One Thousand Travel Studies through the Stereoscope and in Lantern Slides, Classified and Cross Referenced for Twenty-Five Different School Subjects.2 Agriculture, the second of the classification schemes in the book, addressed soil formation and drainage, crop cultivation, livestock care, and product management. Homer C. Price, dean of agriculture at Ohio State University, compiled 272 subject entries, stressing connections between agriculture and nine other subject headings including geology, industries, transportation, and physical geography among others.The stereographs described in the instructional manuals often included leading questions that teachers could use to guide class discussion. The text on the back of “A Home Garden” stereograph included a warm-up activity—“Have you ever had a garden of your own? What did you plant in it?” Then it encouraged students to create a list of plants the family raised in their garden and to discuss it in a Think-Pair-Share scenario. After more thinking and discussion of the vegetables and flowers raised, and of the garden plan, it asked students to apply what they learned to draw a plan of their garden and to put their plan into action by creating their own school garden.The stereograph began as a teaching tool. After being accessioned into a museum collection it becomes an artifact useful in teaching about historic education practices, including how schools engaged students in home-scale agricultural practices. The school garden, when implemented, became a tool to teach agriculture broadly defined. Today, schools are recommitting to campus gardens as part of a larger Edible Education initiative.3 Museums could do the same.Engaging youth with hands-on opportunities to work in soil, raise a garden crop, and prepare it for a meal can translate into lessons in soil and crop science, seed viability, and human health and nutrition, among other subjects. Museums can expand on these lessons with tools that gardeners used, little changed over the centuries, with historic seed display boxes and seed packets and with market wagons and market structures that supported sales to populations unable to raise their own fruits and vegetables.Museums teaching through agriculture provide hands-on and minds-on engagement. While digital resources may enhance understanding, they cannot compare to the act of stepping into a farming landscape. Living history farms, a type of agricultural museum, offer this unique experience. The artifacts that guests encounter at these cultural institutions can be as small as an open-pollinated seed saved from the last growing season for planting the next season. That could lead to conversations about seed-saving techniques, culturally distinctive seed repositories like Native Seeds Search, and seed research collections operated by the US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service and curated by plant geneticists. There are twenty of these USDA-ARS repositories in the United States, the oldest in Ames, Iowa, founded in 1947.A seed or plant could lead a student into a research project focused on one crop or livestock breed, or other mechanical technology. Such projects should draw on three-dimensional evidence (as museums exist to collect, preserve, and interpret such evidence). Museums stress the benefits of close reading of real artifacts, but many have also embraced opportunities to digitize archival and artifact holdings to increase access and use. Funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the National Endowment for the Humanities support digitization projects at land-grant universities and museums. These translate into publicly accessible resources such as the “Farm, Field, and Fireside” digital newspaper archive at the University of Illinois, or “Core Historical Literature of Agriculture” and “HEARTH—Home Economics Archive: Research, Tradition, History” at Cornell University.4 Museums often have collection portals on their web pages. These virtual collections enrich source identification, data analysis, and higher levels of thinking expressed through research projects. Results can take the form of a blog, virtual exhibit, podcast, or other online delivery (as well as a more traditional research paper), focused on a region, time period, or specific farm. The finished product can combine historic horticulture and plant science lessons with cultural practice and even contemporary perspectives on such popular perishables as celery, strawberries, or pumpkins, for instance.5The largest artifact is the landscape, including historic structures, farm fields, fences, orchards, and ecosystems. As student interests increase about historic claims to land, environmental degradation, and regenerative agriculture, this largest cultural artifact becomes essential to teaching through agriculture. The past survives in the landscape. Cultural geographers and architectural historians have studied these spaces and written eloquently about the methods to read this evidence. Organizations dedicated to agricultural museums, including the International Association of Agricultural Museums and the Association for Living History, Farm and Agricultural Museums, support those working in these distinctive cultural institutions.6 Much overlap exists with others dedicated to environmental education or nature center interpretation. As a result, a rich literature exists to learn more about reading and interpreting historic and contemporary agricultural landscapes.7Between the seeds and the landscapes exist many other artifacts that support teaching through agriculture. A grain sickle, a common hand tool, can document cultural practices of grain harvest, stoop labor essential for food security, and artisanal talents of both woodworking and blacksmithing, or it can be a launchpad to talk about technological change over space and time and crop culture. Applying the social construction of technology framework to such study ensures that numerous perspectives inform exploration of the artifact(s). Yet all too often students may summarize the lesson as one of improvement. This tendency is one of the most difficult to challenge. I have participated in weeklong teacher institutes on industrialization and urged participants to apply the social construction of technology to interpret a range of harvesting technology. When asked to engage students in lessons about a sickle, a reaper, a Massey-Harris no. 30 combine, and a New Holland TR-70 combine with corn head, all teachers stressed improvement using evidence documented through statistics that confirmed savings in labor needs and faster harvest. It is difficult to move beyond these lessons that equate innovation with progress, repeated in history textbooks. Museums teaching through agriculture can complicate this history, linking certain crops to certain implements that had certain effects on people, landscapes, and the environment as well as on labor systems and the local, regional, and global food and fiber supply.Archives and artifacts cannot teach these lessons alone. The scholarship that agricultural historians generate provides the baseline. Multisensory lessons in agriculture can make new understanding created through museum collections more memorable. Holding well-worn plow handles, smelling freshly mown grass curing in the sun, hearing wheels on implements turn, seeing draft animals push into their yokes or harnesses, and tasting a meal made from a fresh harvest make quite an impression. Learning through agricultural archives, artifacts, and immersion experiences also helps students see themselves in agricultural production systems. It helps them realize the ways that agriculture influences their lives and the ways that their choices can influence agriculture.",

    "abstract": "When feeling especially buoyant, I like to imagine a future in which busloads of students arrive in Upper Deerfield Township, New Jersey, where the agribusiness Seabrook Farms once operated. By the end of World War II, Seabrook Farms was unrivaled as a producer of canned, dehydrated, and frozen vegetables. At peak production, it employed nearly seven thousand laborers in its fields, plants, and trucking fleets. In 1947, the company directly cultivated eighteen thousand acres of land in southern New Jersey and bought produce from another six hundred small farmers to whom it also served as a creditor.1 A company town, Seabrook Farms ran cafeterias and commissaries and built and leased housing to its workforce.Most of this has not existed for decades, but in my imagination funding has been secured to reconstruct a dwelling typical of those occupied by Black migrant farmworkers from the South during the early years of World War II. Traveling up the Atlantic Seaboard, migrants arrived in South Jersey beginning in April and remained until late fall, when the last spinach was harvested. The Orchard Center Camp, which Seabrook Farms rented out, exemplified the dismal accommodations Black migrant families encountered. At Orchard Center, migrant families lived in tents or prefabricated wooden “Pemberton” homes that were sixteen by sixteen feet and usually housed between eight and twelve people. The camp had no indoor plumbing, and only four washtubs for more than 250 residents. Orchard Center was home to forty children who, too young to work, fended for themselves while their parents were on the job. White area residents fiercely resisted opening public schools to Black migrant children.2 In 1942, the federal Farm Security Administration built a seasonal camp on Seabrook Farms' property, the Big Oak camp, which accommodated a thousand people. In contrast to privately run camps, it offered workers health care, schools, and affordable housing that was not contingent on employment with a particular grower.3 In 1943, however, the arrival of Jamaican guest workers—who were guaranteed Farm Security Administration housing—led to a shortage of beds. Many Black American migrants were forced to move to Orchard Center instead.On my imagined tour, visitors to the restored quarters are introduced to individual perspectives and stories that complicate how mid-century migrant farmworkers were usually portrayed by growers—as anonymous instruments of production. Visitors hear from Joe Brown, who in the 1930s journeyed back and forth between Fort Lauderdale and South Jersey, working at the Heinz tomato processing plant in Salem and at Seabrook Farms. In 1942, Brown traveled north in a caravan of three trucks and nineteen cars after a Florida recruiter employed by Seabrook Farms put word out that the company was looking for three thousand field hands for the mid-June snap bean harvest. Migrants often arrived penniless, so timing was everything, but the recruiter assured Brown that early arrivals could work cutting asparagus. Farmworkers in New Jersey could earn considerably more than they did in Florida.4 This economic reality led white growers to use violence to try and “freeze” workers in place in the South.5Tours then enter the Seabrook Educational and Cultural Center (SECC), which, in this imaginative exercise, is no longer a basement room in a municipal building with minimal visiting hours but instead a freestanding institution actively engaging the community. Through exhibits, visitors learn the different legal and racial contexts that shaped relations of production at Seabrook Farms. Even though the company's unmet wartime labor needs strained its productive capacity, it resisted hiring Black migrants to permanent positions. Eventually, an alternative emerged. By the end of 1945, Seabrook Farms received more than seventeen hundred incarcerated Japanese Americans, who were resettled in New Jersey by the War Relocation Authority.6The SECC has traditionally told the story of Japanese Americans’ resettlement as one in which a beneficent company provided refuge to displaced citizens wrongly detained by the federal government. In my imagined museum, the narrative instead explains how Seabrook Farms practiced a form of capitalism where management sought to exploit groups of workers separated by race and connects agricultural history to intersectional Black and Asian American labor histories. C. F. Seabrook, the company's founder, opined to his lawyer in 1943 that Black men were not as “good at factory work as white women,” and that they were “happier outside in the fields and in the sunshine.”7 Attitudes at Seabrook Farms conformed to local white supremacist attitudes. In May 1944, the president of the city council in nearby Bridgeton indicated to War Relocation Authority officials that white residents would prefer “investigated American Japanese citizens”—a reference to the so-called loyalty test that incarcerated Japanese Americans had to take to be eligible for resettlement—to “undesirable southern Negro labor.”8In the museum of my imagination, the critical reckoning with racialized capitalism and industrialized agriculture continues. Visitors learn about a 1934 strike at the company where C. F. Seabrook deputized local members of the Ku Klux Klan to attack Black and Italian picketers, and about efforts in the late 1940s to sponsor Estonian displaced persons from camps in Germany in order to provide another reserve of white labor. Difficult questions are posed and answered.Sharing my dreams here is a welcome and generative flight from the often challenging work that goes into trying to realize new public histories for Seabrook Farms in practice. This work involves hours of organizing, collaboration, and stakeholder engagement. In 2019, the SECC was awarded a small grant by the New Jersey Council for the Humanities, and I was hired to organize two public meetings with stakeholders. The meetings' focus was on how new narratives and audiences for Seabrook Farms' histories might be developed.9 Delayed by COVID-19, the meetings took place in spring 2021 and were powerful events. Gloria Kates, whose family came to Seabrook Farms from Georgia in 1945, articulated what she and other Black locals felt after visiting the SECC: “Where are we?”10Students from Rutgers attended those community meetings. My pedagogical approach, more broadly speaking, has been to involve undergraduate and graduate students in conferences, exhibits, and programming related to my public history work on Seabrook Farms. I curated with undergraduate students an online exhibition for the New Jersey Digital Highway and organized with students a 2018 conference on the history of Seabrook Farms, which involved representatives from the New Jersey-based El Comité de Apoyo para Trabajadores Agrícolas and the Florida-based Coalition of Immokalee Workers discussing their organizing work with migrant farmworkers and how wage theft, deportation, and substandard housing persist as threats to migrant farmworkers.11 With John Seabrook, a New Yorker staff writer and C. F. Seabrook's grandson, I have been conducting oral histories and soliciting “memory maps” from descendants of Black workers—including one that Kates contributed to—which we hope to one day use in a digital exhibition.Teaching agricultural history should include efforts to train students to research and develop public narratives that capture the experiences of workers. In local museums and at living history farms, migrant farmworkers' stories rarely appear, even though small farms were dependent on seasonal laborers as well. The work being done to reinterpret antebellum plantations in ways that foreground the stories of enslaved agricultural workers is a relevant reframing to learn from.12 In the context of wage labor, if Seabrook Farms can similarly inspire as a public history site one day, I will rest easier.",

    "abstract": "The popular interpretation of the western economy is that of a seemingly natural boom-and-bust cycle. That story of inevitable failure curiously contradicts the equally popular progressive narrative of Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis, in which American ideals of independence, self-reliance, freedom, and opportunity attracted newcomers to the region. In Pushed Out, sociologist Ryanne Pilgeram both complicates and reconciles those narratives, recognizing that since the mid-nineteenth century and the dispossession of Native lands, corporations often developed the physical and economic infrastructure for settler towns, profiting even after the nation no longer depended on the rural West for its natural resources—lumber, copper, coal, crops—to fuel industrial America.Pilgeram argues that the history of the rural West continues to guide future development decisions, as locals have, over time, come to accept the power of outside investors who cater to “amenity migration.” Nonextractive amenities cater to and attract outsiders—whether tourists, retirees, or the creative classes—to rural western places, effectively destroying the systems that provide locals with a historic sense of place. Such “gentrification” undermines the authenticity that comes from retaining or rehabilitating tangible remnants of past development and social relationships. Pilgeram historicizes the rural gentrification phenomenon as part of the boom-and-bust cycle common throughout the American West and its history, but she believes that it is a pattern that communities can break.She does this by applying sociological theory to historical patterns to understand recent commercial development in the rural West. Pilgeram develops a single case study of one Idaho town, with a local, community history perspective and archival research. Much as the timber barons extracted the region's forest and other natural resources, Pilgeram extracts a lot from her case study (and hometown) in Dover, Idaho, and specifically the battle over the controversial Mill Lake development. She has applied David Harvey's theory of the “spatial fix” to understand rural gentrification through the fickle nature of a capitalist system triggering a Marxian class struggle over places tied to local resources to explain the boom-and-bust cycle, periodically reinventing places through economic and social systems as much as actual building, to make it once again profitable.Pilgeram relegates Dover's history primarily to the first chapter, titled “A Brief History of the Last 62 Million Years,” which covers the displacement of the Kalispel people and the arrival of Europeans, until we quickly get to the establishment of Dover by the timber barons from the mid-nineteenth century through the prosperous period just after World War II, when the mill sustained its workers, who in turn built their own communities. Pilgeram emphasizes how swiftly lands passed from the government to the railroad to the barons, creating places owned by people who did not live in them and setting up unsustainable social and economic systems. Chapters 2 and 3 discuss the economic downturn in the 1980s and 1990s, along with the decaying infrastructure, not unlike in a peripheral urban neighborhood. Those in power allowed “demolition by neglect,” to borrow the preservationist's phrase, in order to rebuild the physical, economic, and social infrastructure to benefit themselves. Chapters 4 and 5 explain local attempts to resist developers by either villainizing developers or cooperating with those in power. Local residents failed to account for the systematic scaffolding of ordinances and zoning that would influence new development.Pilgeram's research is based on a local history conducted through interviews and local archives, presumably applicable to other rural western places, but the sociological approach does not engage the broader historiography of the rural American West, including Frederic Luebke's evaluation of the rural immigrant communities, Hal Rothman's Devil's Bargains, and R. Douglas Hurt's The Rural West since World War II. The “spatial fix” theory, which seems tied to the colonization process, undervalues many examples of local agency and power, but the analysis has significant value to understanding the postwar rural West.In Pushed Out, Pilgeram persuasively challenges several narratives of the rural West: the independent settler, the boom-and-bust cycle, and even that of the paternalistic company town. She argues that gentrification is not inevitable but “the product of a capitalist system reorganizing its exploitation of human and natural resources” for continued profit (164). Perhaps recognizing and understanding the authenticity inherent in a community's sense of place will allow the type of economic sustainability that actually defies the historic boom-and-bust cycle so attributed to the myth of “natural market cycles.”",

    "abstract": "Many of us reading this journal have taught agricultural history in some form. The roles of animals, crops, soil, diseases, gardens, and tractors, to only name a few, are key ingredients in understanding numerous parts of our individual and collective pasts. As a result, the venues of learning can be just as diverse as the topics' influential reach. Many of the stories we tell in our university survey classes, highly specialized graduate courses, or with students in K–12 classes include agricultural history, sometimes in quite unexpected ways for both the learner and the lecturer. Agricultural history stretches across disciplinary fields and spaces of learning, and it manifests inside formalized classrooms and outside across informal ones, often in literal fields.A key lesson, then, is that to teach agricultural history is to connect learners in visceral ways just as much as intellectual ones. Feeling freshly tilled soil or smelling a recent rain across alfalfa fields matters just as much as reading primary sources. Experiential learning plays a significant part of our agricultural history pedagogy, with the “doing” of agriculture taking various forms from reading records to reading the landscape. The authors in this forum speak to these many possibilities and the uniqueness of agriculture in its capacity to connect seemingly disparate students, researchers, disciplines, and practices.“Teaching through Agriculture” is the beginning of a much longer conversation about the processes and values of teaching the agricultural past. It is also the continuation and braiding of various recent threads of inquiry in the field, including the recent roundtable in this journal, “Why Does Agricultural History Matter?”1 Each contributor offers keen insights about how they combine intellectual and experiential learning in their classrooms and, in other cases, into their local communities. You will read about successful instruction techniques in more conventional forms, the diverse kinds of primary sources these instructors use to engage learners, and perhaps unexpected ways to integrate the past and present.Teaching has long been foundational to the mission of agricultural history. The Agricultural History Society was founded by an interdisciplinary group of historians, scientists, and economists as a space for learning, with the first members including extension agents asking how history could help anchor the relevance of traditional and new agricultural practices for their farmer-audiences.2 Over the society's history, scholarship from members has included pedagogical essays that reflect on the importance of agricultural topics in the classroom, teacher-mentors, the importance of theoretical and interdisciplinary thinking in teaching, and the use of the visceral, material elements of agriculture to ignite curiosity in learners.3 The James C. Giesen Teaching Excellence Award is just one formal recognition of the society that marks this much longer dedication to teaching in the field.The beginnings of this particular forum started at two academic conferences. The first spark came at the National Council on Public History in 2017. In that meeting, David presented on the history of agricultural science and the use of archival material in instructing STEM students and then bringing those lessons to a general public. Conversations about pedagogy continued into the 2019 Agricultural History Society meeting, where David presented work with Neil Oatsvall, Jenny Barker-Devine, Pamela Riney-Kehrberg, and Margaret Weber in “The Place of Agricultural History in the History Curriculum: A Roundtable.” The scholar-teachers on this panel expanded the discussion on every educational level and encouraged us to keep carving out a space where others could join the conversation, workshop their ideas, and share teaching strategies. Nicole sat in the audience that day and later connected with David about organizing a forum for publication focused on teaching.Then COVID-19 hit. Teaching all online posed significant challenges, especially in pedagogy. We felt that this kind of forum was needed more than ever, and our next steps included issuing a call for papers for an agricultural history pedagogy workshop. Three clear interests of the group emerged: (1) the role of agricultural primary sources in framing and designing courses; (2) the use of agricultural topics in public history and community-engaged work; and (3) how the materiality of agriculture might lend itself to innovative pedagogical approaches that can take place outside, in the dirt. From there, we decided to host an online workshop in January 2022.Our call for proposals emphasized a forum for a pedagogy of agricultural history across fields. Part of this thinking had to do with the 2020–21 academic year, where many of us had to rethink our teaching in the transition to masked, outdoor, or completely virtual spaces. Effective, adaptable, engaging, inclusive teaching takes time, research, and replicability. As such, it is important to have ongoing conversations about pedagogy rooted in the future of teaching. “Teaching through Agriculture” aimed to create a virtual and textual forum about teaching in history and related interdisciplinary fields that addressed topics linked broadly to agriculture, science, or the environment.The goal of the workshop was to gather a diverse range of research, case studies, and reflections about teaching in the ever-developing field of agricultural history. And as this forum illustrates, it is ever developing. The virtual workshop included time to discuss pedagogy candidly with colleagues around the world. We also built space into the workshop to draft the pieces that would be included in this forum. The call for proposals invited participants to address teaching in any aspect of agriculture or agricultural history, including, but not limited to, experiences (whole courses or parts of classes/workshops) in archaeology and anthropology, histories of science, technology, and medicine, environmental history, animal studies, food studies, agriculture and rural life, primary school education, or FFA/4-H instruction. We especially encouraged submissions that highlighted the work and teaching of early career and/or contingent faculty, nontraditional researchers, and underrepresented scholars. We also originally focused on three central categories for analysis and discussion—activities, assessments, and assigned media—with hopes of compiling a collection of cases and tools to be used by future instructors across disciplines and educational levels. The final cohort included fourteen instructors who would contribute thirteen pieces in total.Workshop participants voiced a hunger to talk about teaching: What was working? What wasn't? What were the pressing issues of the time? How could agriculture serve as a creative connector? It was clear that agriculture was uniquely positioned to cultivate engaging, inclusive classrooms, no matter the format. Agriculture connected people across geographic and temporal scales, perhaps for the sheer reason that, as Peter Coclanis has argued many times before, food is the anchor of our history and livelihood.4 Food studies certainly lends itself to creative teaching strategies, as illustrated by leading scholar-teachers in the field experimenting with unessays, recipe archives, and in-class exercises with food.5 Such strategies needed to be retooled and reimagined in online and asynchronous spaces during the pandemic, and the “how” of these (and other) methods struck a chord with the thoughtful teachers of the “Teaching through Agriculture” workshop. How do we articulate the essence of an assignment? How do we assess its success? And how might we adopt multiple approaches—online and outdoors—into different classroom communities? It was clear that agricultural history brought different opportunities and opened numerous pedagogical possibilities.We divided the written results of this forum into three conversational sections: “Classroom Engagements,” “Fields Work,” and “Public History and Beyond.” Each takes on a different dimension of what teaching agriculture or agricultural history can look like across different kinds of classrooms, incorporating different disciplinary fields, or integrating quite literal fields—situating learning on sites and in soil.The first four contributors provide diverse examples of teaching agricultural history in the context of the “traditional” classroom through sample exercises, assessments, and assignments. The examples demonstrate the importance of digging into primary sources located in agriculture to better illustrate nuanced histories in East Asian, European, and American history.Peter Braden shares two assignments designed specifically for a commodity-driven course that balances the content of the commodity with its context as a prominent nonhuman figure and helps tell a larger East Asian history. Jeff Bremer provides the details for a primary source analysis that highlights the dimensions of gender, class, and health. Matthew Holmes recounts the importance of agricultural history in providing a scaffolding for understanding the framing and basic foundations of biology. Finally, Rebecca Kaplan reminds us to attend to the sharp social dimensions of agriculture, especially when crafting syllabi at land-grant institutions (and the archives available) with stories of settler colonialism and activist resistance in mind.Fieldwork and field work tend to blur together when the social sciences engage with topics in agriculture. The bottom line: agricultural “fields” work as sites for engaging with and learning about history.With site-based (and sometimes work-based) examples, experiential learning serves as the foundation of the pieces by Ashley Colby, Nicholas Timmerman and Abigail Carpenter, Saskia Cornes, and Cody Miller. Colby argues for the importance of international service learning opportunities for students engaged with interdisciplinary questions about sustainability. Timmerman and Carpenter also address service and site-based learning but outline the intricacies of executing a field trip with multiple institutional partners. Cornes and Miller—both situated in North Carolina—provide some detailed examples of the philosophical and pedagogical dimensions of teaching on soils that (quite literally) hold and stratify histories. Cornes speaks to engagement with the soil at Duke Campus Farm, while Miller outlines a lesson plan for students visiting Moses Cone Park.The last conversational section focuses on public history, an enormous category we use here to emphasize the applicability and adaptability of these contributions. These essays feature modes, methods, and philosophies that run parallel to ongoing conversations about integrating the digital humanities into teaching, the place of the present in teaching the past, and engagement with institutional collaborators.Camden Burd and Maria Fedorova detail two instances where hands-on activities like podcast creation (Burd) and Google Map curation (Fedorova) can help students sharpen their analytical and comprehension skills when engaging with agricultural history at local and global scales. Debra Reid reminds us of the importance of integrating historical agricultural artifacts and working alongside museums to inspire learners. Sanchia deSouza and Andrew Urban provide raw accounts where past and present cannot be disentangled and offer important theoretical and practical apparatuses that emphasize personal reflection and training in community-engaged collaborations.We hope that this forum sparks new ideas and conversations about teaching agricultural history. Each author provides key insights about their instruction, sharing the various teaching ingredients they include to make pedagogy successful while modeling approaches that can be used in numerous ways. Ultimately, this forum is meant to offer a toolkit for assignments, assessments, course designs, and philosophies of teaching that come from agriculture. This collection of essays is just a start, and we are eager see what the future holds. As you'll see, most of us are teaching agricultural history, even if we don't know it. And when we do know it, the care and intentionality taken to teach it in accessible and inclusive ways is a triumph worthy of rigorous discussion and documentation for the teachers to come.",

    "abstract": "In Oceans of Grain, Scott Nelson explores the role of wheat in making and unmaking empires. While there is some discussion of ancient and medieval empires, the book focuses mostly on empire-making during the “long nineteenth century” up until and including World War I. The book is much more about how wheat flows than about how wheat grows (or who grows it and under what conditions), but Nelson advances some highly original arguments.The story revolves in part around the ideas of the somewhat obscure Marxist thinker, revolutionary, grain trader, and arms dealer known as Parvus (Alexander Israel Helphand), whose ideas were influential in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries but who has since been largely forgotten. Nelson anchors his argument on the concept of the “black paths,” the ancient trade routes along which grain was carried to port, creating long-distance trade networks but also spreading disease, ideas, and culture along the way. According to Nelson, it was the chumaki, traditional traders from what is now Ukraine, who forged the first black paths leading from the rich black soils of the interior to Black Sea ports. Nelson's central argument is that trade precedes and facilitates empire, not the other way around. Empires emerged when warlords managed to “establish a protection racket along chumaki pathways,” thereby shaping and taxing the flow of grain to their benefit (17). In this sense, an empire is “a monopolizer of food along ancient grain pathways,” and its fortunes rise and fall with its ability to control the flow of grain (39). In Eurasia, Nelson argues that the Bosporus strait, as the chokepoint for grain flowing from the Black Sea, has been centrally important to the rise and fall of empires since ancient times.For most of Western history, empires acted as “grain pumps” that funneled grain inward to feed the cities, then outward again to feed colonies and armies. In the late eighteenth century, Catherine the Great, inspired by the physiocrats, reversed this strategy by using grain exports from the new port of Odessa as a strategy for empire building. This strategy was later adopted by the United States beginning in the mid-nineteenth century and would eventually result in a massive increase in North American exports to Europe. One of the factors that ushered in nineteenth-century “free trade,” when the United Kingdom abandoned import restrictions on grain, was the potato blight of the 1840s and the resulting European famines. The oceans of North American and Russian grain that flowed into Western Europe from the 1850s onward facilitated the growth of “consumption-accumulation cities” (Parvus's term), attracting workers and capital with the promise of cheap food (and therefore lower wages). In turn, city dwellers deposited savings into banks, fueling the imperial expansion of states such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Massive exports of grain were of course made possible by the expansion of wheat-growing frontiers in North America and Eurasia. Nineteenth-century imperial rivalries and wars were profoundly shaped by attempts to block or facilitate the continued flow of grain into European capitals.Nelson writes of the 1873 Great Depression as a major turning point in European history, setting off the decline of formerly powerful agricultural empires but contributing to the growing power of wheat-importing, industrializing countries. Here is where Parvus reenters the story. As an emerging intellectual, Parvus developed an original theory of capitalism based on his analysis of the Great Depression. He argued that Marx's model of industrial capitalism was incomplete since it downplayed the importance of distribution. According to Parvus, Nelson writes, “the working world was organized spatially around pathways” and production was “only the first part of a worldwide distribution process” (173). He suggested that improving logistics—straightening out trade routes and making transportation more efficient—was a key dynamic of capitalist development. Thus, a more complete theory of capitalism must take into account transportation logistics. Nelson sees Parvus's ideas as a kind of proto-world-systems theory, with powerful insights to offer for understanding economic and political rivalries.The last few chapters of the book offer a novel interpretation of the factors that led to war and revolution in the early twentieth century. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, Russia tried to compete with cheap North American exports through an ambitious phase of empire building and railroad building but ultimately failed, leading to revolution in 1905. This, according to Nelson, was the result of Russia's inability to create a continent-wide logistics and transportation corridor for wheat to rival that of the United States. In the lead-up to World War I, Russia feared the Ottoman Empire would block Russian grain shipments on the Black Sea, posing an existential threat. Nelson argues that this fear was one of the precipitating factors of the devastating conflict. Late in the war, severe Russian food shortages undermined the legitimacy of imperial rulers as revolutionaries began to collect and transport grain outside of imperial channels. Ultimately, this set the stage for the collapse of imperial rule and the revolution of 1917. Having been exiled from Russia for earlier revolutionary activities, Parvus helped broker the secret deal through which the German government provided large sums of money to the Bolsheviks in support of revolution. According to Nelson, Parvus had predicted that grain shortages would be the ultimate undoing of the Russian Empire. In sum, he suggests that Parvus provided a uniquely valuable perspective on capitalist geopolitics: “His understanding of the world shows us a deeper history about the growing of food . . . its prehistoric long-distance distribution lines, and the abstract instruments that made that trade possible. . . . Parvus saw the lines that bind us all together, the empire's fault lines, and their fatal weaknesses” (267).Oceans of Grain is a fascinating and frequently entertaining read. It will no doubt spark new debates on the rise and fall of empires and the role of food in geopolitics. This is certainly asking too much, but it would have been fascinating for Nelson to write about the period after World War I, when the collapse of world wheat prices led to many innovations including massive government intervention into markets (e.g., the US Agricultural Adjustment Act, government wheat boards) and international trade (e.g., International Wheat Agreements that set prices and production quotas). In the mid-twentieth century, the United States built a postwar “empire of grain” based on the strategic accumulation and disposal of massive grain surpluses, contributing significantly to American soft power. It would be equally fascinating for Nelson to apply his analytical lens to Russia's current war of conquest in Ukraine, given the strategic importance of Black Sea ports for the world food trade. To date, much more has been said about the geopolitics of energy in the Ukraine conflict, and less attention has been paid to the flow of grain. Perhaps these are topics for a second volume of this important book.",

    "abstract": "This special forum includes many examples of teaching methods that help students to understand the ecological, economic, and cultural significance of farms and food. The following two assignments are the main learning experiences in my course Rice: Connecting East Asian Societies, 1900–2022. These projects help students to examine, describe, and analyze physical and textual primary sources and use their insights to make evidence-based arguments about the production and consumption of rice. The projects would be useful for students and teachers who may live far from rice-producing regions and have little experience with the crop in the field. Both assignments are also adaptable to a range of teaching contexts: fully in-class, semiremote, or fully remote.In the first assignment, students treat a rice product as a primary source that can reveal much about the people and society that consume it. By examining the text and images on the item's packaging as well as its context within a physical or online store, students learn how material culture can reveal the capabilities and preferences of a society. The pedagogical aim is to help students to gain a fresh perspective on familiar agricultural products by interrogating them for specific details. Where was the rice grown and processed, and in what way? Who can afford it? What cultural symbols or tropes does its packaging invoke? In this way, a shopping trip becomes a field trip, yielding not only a cart full of groceries but, hopefully, deeper insights about the ecological, economic, and cultural significance of a vital food. This is a transferable skill, which applies as well to virtually any item in a supermarket. Instructors of courses that focus on other foods, such as wheat or coffee, could easily adapt the assignment to their own needs.In the second assignment, students read a brief memoir/how-to manual by a successful and iconoclastic Japanese rice and orange farmer. Whereas the first assignment helped students to extract meaning from a physical item, this project helps students to discern the values, ideology, and aspirations of an author through close reading. While the first project helps students to gain a contemporary historical perspective on their own society, the second project is a richly textured portrayal of rice farming in mid-twentieth-century Japan. The pedagogical aim is to help students to see farming, science, and commerce through the eyes of someone from a different time and place. Few students will become organic rice farmers, but all can benefit from honing the historian's ability to empathize with the values and attitudes of people far removed in time and space.The following three sections are taken directly from the course syllabus.Societies must answer two major questions about food: What will we eat? And how will we get it? In this course, we will ask how people in East Asia (including China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, as well as Vietnam, Burma, and Thailand) have answered these questions during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries by focusing on one of the most important grains in world history: rice.This course is not a conventional survey of national histories. Instead, we will use rice to trace and analyze historical concepts such as daily life, identity, imperialism, and human interactions with the environment. We will explore similarities and differences in the ways that neighboring societies have produced, traded, consumed, and thought about rice.Below are prompts for the two major projects for this course. Project 1, the packaging analysis, explores the consumption of rice. This project asks you to carefully consider a rice product in its cultural and commercial context. This will help us to think about questions including: Who uses the product? What is its attraction or significance to consumers?Project 2, the argumentative essay, examines a short book by a pioneering “natural” or “organic” rice farmer. This will help us better understand the production of rice. The author describes not only his methods of growing crops including oranges and rice but also his relationships to institutions including the agricultural marketplace, government, and scientific research programs. We will pay special attention to the ways that his experience, and the experience of people in mid-twentieth century Japan, shaped farmers' relationships to each other, to their customers, and to their land.In addition to texts such as newspapers and government reports, historians also examine and interpret advertisements and physical objects. These can reveal a great deal about the priorities, beliefs, anxieties, and capabilities of people and societies.Writing this essay will help us practice the skill of interpreting food packaging and advertising, giving us new perspectives on the consumption of rice in our society.The One-Straw Revolution, by Masanobu Fukuoka, makes radical arguments about farming, society, economics, environmentalism, and the nature of knowledge. We will discuss this book in class, using your argumentative essays as a starting point. There is no word limit or page count. Write enough to state, develop, and defend your argument—no more or less. Use standard footnotes to cite this text and any other readings.Here are some possible questions. You can also make up your own essay question! Masanobu Fukuoka says, “If we do have a food crisis, it will not be caused by the insufficiency of nature's productive power, but by the extravagance of human desire.” What does he mean? Do you agree with his assessment? Support your argument with evidence from this text and from our other readings.How do Mr. Fukuoka's attitude and actions toward nonhuman life compare to the other farming practices we have studied? Support your argument with specific examples.What does Mr. Fukuoka think of “modern” society? Is his critique persuasive? Support your argument with evidence from this text and from our other readings.What is Mr. Fukuoka's relationship to governments and markets? How does this compare to farmers in our other readings? Support your argument with specific examples.Courses that integrate both the production and consumption of a staple grain such as rice have several benefits. First, they avoid the tendency to treat the growing and eating of foods as discrete, independent practices, covering the former in agricultural or environmental studies and the latter in food studies. Instead, courses like this one show how producing and consuming food is a cyclical process inextricable from the welfare of humans, nonhumans, and their environment.By completing these assignments, students improve their ability to glean useful information from both material and textual primary sources. From assignment 1, they learn the skill of interpreting physical evidence, including packaging and art design. From assignment 2, they practice making analytical arguments based on a close reading of a text. Both skills are central to the craft of history, and both will be invaluable to students embarking on a wide range of careers and endeavors.",

    "abstract": "I teach an Iowa history class at Iowa State University. In recent years, this course has been online, but I taught it for several years face-to-face. One of the major readings for the class is the memoir of Mildred Armstrong Kalish, Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm during the Great Depression. This is a charming and highly readable primary source that has been popular with my students since I started teaching the class. It is appealing to those who are not history majors. The book ties into important themes of the class such as the transformation of agriculture and rural life in the twentieth century. Kalish's book could easily be used for courses in agricultural history as well as US history. Little Heathens is the story of a lost rural world of small family farms, which has become part of American mythology. The book has many strengths, but even its flaws encourage student discussion and reflection.Mildred Armstrong Kalish lived with her family on her grandparents' farm, insulated from the worst of the Depression. In Iowa the banking system had collapsed by the early 1930s, with the state leading the nation in bank failures from 1921 to 1931. Prices for farm goods steeply declined, and banks owned 30 percent of the property in some counties. Women turned to sex work to survive in Des Moines. Kalish's family did not go hungry or lose their land, but they did endure the long-term hardship of the 1930s. Her grandparents were land-poor, always afraid that they would not have money to pay taxes on farms they rented to family members. They were famously frugal, and she includes stories of farm life from the mid-twentieth century that Iowa students, those from families of modest means, or students from the developing world, can relate to.1Kalish's story is set near the small town of Garrison, located between Cedar Rapids and Waterloo in eastern Iowa. Her parents were divorced, thanks to her father's bankruptcy and jail time, and her family lived with her mother's parents. She grew up in a strict and austere household with a few basic rules: “Endure deprivation without complaining, mind your manners at all times, do as your elders say.” Kalish's grandmother referred to her daughter's four children as “spawn” or “little heathen,” a phrase usually muttered in frustration at their undisciplined behavior. Much of the book's appeal is tied to the clash between strict elders who “never completely made it into the twentieth century” and unsupervised, often troublesome children. Kalish's grandparents were keen to build character in the youngest generation. Literature, chores, church, school, and family reinforced daily lessons in thrift and hard work. Little Heathens has entertaining chapters on daily farm life and the improper behavior of children. (It also provides plenty of recipes, a useful reminder of meals where corn, flour, and apples were staple ingredients.)2Little Heathens is pedagogically useful in many ways, even if Kalish romanticizes farm life. The book is a good social and cultural history, providing readable and entertaining insight into the Depression and the lives of those who experienced it. The memoir allows students to compare Kalish's account of the 1930s to the present day or the nineteenth century. Her grandparents' farm did not get electricity until the mid-1930s, so the important story of electrical power for rural areas can be included as well. The book surveys topics as varied as gender roles, leisure, and education. Kalish also explains how soap was made, the joys and trials of one-room schools, the dangers of blizzards, and the love of farm animals. It is also useful when students read Little Heathens and compare it with Iowans whose experiences were far worse, such as a man who lost his farm, was kicked out of his church, and became a traveling salesman. Those who grew up on farms—not a small number at ISU—also make connections to current rural and farm life.Kalish's story has its limits and its flaws. It reflects an all-white, rural community that is mostly Protestant. The outside urban world is almost entirely absent. Women had little economic power in Garrison, Iowa. Men owned the property, held positions in church and government, and Kalish's grandfather determined what everybody ate for breakfast. Topics such as the unequal distribution of economic and political power, which are not addressed in the book, can spark student interest and discussion.3I provide scaffolding—structure and questions to guide learning—to help students understand and organize the information in Little Heathens. These questions were the basis for discussion when the class was face-to-face. There is no discussion component for the online class, only a short essay. Few students in the class each semester are history majors. It often contains students from departments such as English, political science, and biology, as well as those from the College of Agriculture, the School of Education, or the School of Journalism. Many may have never worked with historical sources like Kalish's book. There are also a few international students enrolled every year. These groups may need a bit more help in digesting a 290-page memoir from a period they are unfamiliar with, so I provide a list of reading questions for students who might need a bit more direction. This may seem a bit like high school work, but these questions are for student use only. I do not ask to see student notes or assign any grade here. These questions were also the basis for face-to-face discussions in the class before it moved online. I emphasize “how” and “why” questions to encourage deeper thinking, rather than simpler questions on “who,” “what,” or “when.” Does this book express the true horrors of the Great Depression? If not, why?How is the pace of everyday life different from that of the twenty-first century?How are chores, leisure time, family dynamics, and meals different from today?Does Kalish romanticize Iowa in the 1930s? Why or why not?Thrift and industriousness are ideals that Kalish's family strives toward. How are these characteristics shown throughout the book?How is the school system different from today?How do Kalish's grandparents view the world different from their grandchildren?How was sanitation, medical care, and disease treatment different from the twenty-first century?What common themes do you find today, as compared to the 1930s?Would you want to live in Iowa in the 1930s? Why or why not?Students write a six-hundred-word essay, one of five short essays required for the online class. (This is a short assignment. But Iowa history is taught online, usually in less than a month in a winter or summer session. Small writing assignments are a good match for such a fast-paced and diverse class. My summer 2022 course had students from twenty-three different majors, including elementary education, finance, mechanical engineering, animal studies, and architecture. History majors made up 10 percent of the class.) Essays constitute one-half of the class grade; five twenty-question quizzes make up the other half of course assessment. A combination of essay exams, book reviews, and discussion made up the class grade when the course was taught face-to-face.The essay question is straightforward: “How did the Great Depression impact Iowa, and how did the New Deal help people during the 1930s?” It hits on main themes of the course, outlined in the syllabus. These include understanding social and economic change over time as well as understanding the lives of previous generations of Iowans. Students are asked to use evidence from Little Heathens to answer the first half of this question, providing relevant examples from the life of the author. The second half of the question will be answered using Dorothy Schwieder's textbook Iowa: The Middle Land and material from online readings on the New Deal.Little Heathens is an entertaining and engaging memoir of the Great Depression. It gives students a window into a rural and agricultural world that has long been lost. Kalish's memoir is accessible to those who are not history majors. The book's readability and humor encourage students to write and think about important subjects such as gender roles, family farming, and education. Students rarely complain about the book in evaluations and sometimes tell me that they have given copies to family members to read. (This is a rare compliment that should not be undervalued. It emphasizes the importance of state and agricultural history for the public, especially in a place like Iowa with a long history of farming.) Kalish's story helps explain key parts of the history of the American Midwest and provides a useful social and cultural history. It is a book that could be successfully utilized in a variety of courses.",

    "abstract": "The farm crisis of the 1980s, which took place in a nation where barely 2 percent of the population currently farm, is largely forgotten. However, the causes of the steep economic downturn—high inflation and rapid deflation—were replicated a few years later in the Savings and Loan debacle, and during the much more serious subprime recession of 2008. In each case, borrowers bought land and homes in an inflationary market and were forced to pay off expensive mortgages in a climate of deflation.Pamela Riney-Kehrberg's most striking contribution in When a Dream Dies is to utilize the papers of two Republican governors: Robert Ray and Terry Branstad. Hitherto these materials were unavailable to researchers. Farmers who were distressed wrote thousands of letters to the governors outlining their straitened circumstances and pleaded for relief. These letters give insights into the financial and psychological trauma of a distressed farm population. However, they are less useful to gauge the situation of the Iowa farm population as a whole, given that around 60 percent did not suffer the indignity of the forced sale of land and equipment, the need to seek off-farm employment, or the ignominy of bankruptcy.The agricultural establishment—the Extension Service, the Farm Bureau, most of the agricultural press, and the Iowa state government—were slow to detect the dangers of the downturn. Riney-Kehrberg provides a balanced analysis of how these institutions eventually met the challenge of the crisis. Her discussion of the boom years of the late 1970s and early 1980s is insightful. Before the establishment mobilized, a loose coalition of neopopulists stepped into the breach to aid the farm community. The Iowa Farm Unity Coalition, in the shape of PrairieFire and Catholic Rural Life, made the most vital contributions. On the other hand, the American Agricultural Movement was overshadowed in Iowa by locally based organizations. PrairieFire borrowed tactics from the civil rights movement, and with a call-in hotline it began to assist farms under stress. In particular, PrairieFire learned to expertly manipulate the media. Television stations eagerly covered protests, which pressured the state government to intervene. Iowa's major paper, the Des Moines Register, provided expert and extensive coverage throughout the 1980s.Riley-Kehrberg's previous work on the lives of farm women and children is especially salient. For while she explores the travails of male farmers and their struggles with banks and the Farm Credit System, she gives farm women kudos for their willingness to assist in the struggle to confront the rigidity of bankers to negotiate delinquent loans. Only when the state government mobilized and introduced a moratorium on farm foreclosures did lenders alter their tactics. Although violence was almost nonexistent in Iowa, one particular incident—a farmer murdered a loan officer in late 1985—jolted the establishment to action. Similarly, shame, guilt, psychological strain, and ignominy of the loss of a farm, saw male farm suicides increase in the 1980s. Iowa's record, however, was less serious than in bordering states. By the fall of 1985 the Iowa farm crisis moved toward its partial resolution phase. The unwieldy bankruptcy laws were tailored to the needs of farmers when Chapter 12 was written; the Extension Service introduced new programs and literature; Republican politicians began to sound like neopopulists; and vitally, arbitration instead of confrontation forced the Farm Credit System and the banks toward forbearance when they dealt with indebtedness. One special irony was that some farm families, whose job it was to produce food, had to utilize the Food Stamp program to eat.How did the farm crisis affect Iowa in the long term? Early in the book the Committee on Economic Development is mentioned. This obscure organization championed the rationalization of the economy and, in particular, that farming should jettison its excess population and push farmers toward the nonfarm sector. The farm crisis obviously quickened this process. Most counties lost farmers, small towns and businesses suffered, and school consolidations took place. Farm children decided to pursue other careers, and after high school or college they moved to Iowa cities or out of state. Many farm women took off-farm jobs, and if a family remained on the land, the husband often farmed part-time. State government sought to bolster revenue. By the mid-1980s gambling was legalized: horse and dog race tracks and riverboat casinos enticed Iowans to spend their disposable income. State politics changed. In the 1960s and 1970s, Iowa saw close competition between parties. By the twenty-first century the state grew more conservative; Republicans dominated statewide offices, with Democrats only competitive in the metro areas.In sum, Riney-Kehrberg puts a human face on the Iowa farm crisis of the 1980s. She avoids, for the most part, a close analysis of the complexities of the financial downturn, but she gauges the trauma of the times for all members of the farm family in this handsomely produced book.",

    "abstract": "Now part of the Blue Ridge Parkway and the National Park Service, Moses Cone Park of Watauga County, North Carolina, was once a working estate with considerable apple orchards. Many Appalachian State University students visit the park because it is a popular hiking destination, yet few have probably given much thought to signs along the trails that warn visitors of contaminated soils. They soon learn that like other sizable agricultural operations in the early twentieth century, the orchards at Moses Cone were sprayed heavily with lead arsenate to reduce pests, most notably the codling moth. Unfortunately, these chemicals had a residual effect, and over one hundred years later, Moses Cone soils are still affected. The legacy effect of the contaminated soils on the park's surrounding areas is still unknown, yet this story illustrates soils' ability to preserve histories of human interactions with the landscape, both good and bad.1Hiking in Moses Cone Park or engagement with any other landscape we visit teaches us that soil is a historical archive that both agricultural historians and soil scientists should take very seriously. By pairing the methodologies of both the historian and the soil scientist, students can better grasp the deeply personal relationships between humanity and soils throughout time and space to bring soils “to life.” As soil scientists Daniel Richter and Daniel Markewitz note, “A historical perspective is essential for understanding soils.”2 Through interdisciplinary approaches to soils that integrate field experiences with historical research, students gain an enhanced toolkit to understand Appalachian agriculture and the dynamic pedagogy of teaching agricultural history.3 Perhaps, quite literally, soils can help students think from the bottom up and understand the inextricable place of agrarianism in southern Appalachian history and broader southern history. By learning that just a handful of soil is a living entity with thousands of microbes, students can hopefully learn more about the profound relationships between land and people in Appalachia.Drawing from twentieth-century Appalachian soil history, I am currently developing a field day experience that takes place at the Sustainable Development Teaching and Research Farm (SD Farm) at Appalachian State University. The farm is located within the Fleetwood community of Ashe County, North Carolina, on the historic “homeplace” property of Beulah Blackburn and Reeves Vannoy. This tract is 157 acres, including 35 acres of pasture, meadows, gardens, and other arable land, but most of it is woodland. On the farm, students take courses to learn diversified fruit and vegetable production as well as small-scale poultry and livestock production, integrated pest management, and regenerative forestry. The aim of the field day experience, however, is to position agriculture and soil within broader conversations about sense of place, which helps students frame agricultural spaces in holistic contexts, understand the cultural ecology of a given farm or garden, and think more critically about the community practice of sustainable development. Ultimately, the SD Farm serves as a place to explore soil-human entanglements in the twentieth-century mountain South.4We begin our field day by thinking critically about issues of community representation in soil science. To help students understand how agroecological knowledge is coproduced between farmers and scientists, we analyze correspondence from the Soil Conservation Service.5 Writing in 1952, Soil Conservation Service agent J. T. McLaurin strategized how to better present his conservation tactics to the community and brought visual aids into the field with him. Realizing that traditional outreach methods for conservation education were ineffective, McLaurin invited farmers to walk with him to his pickup truck, where he would lay pictures of strip farming conservation on the top of a metal box containing surveying equipment. The agent argued visual aids were as important as any piece of soil conservation equipment he had at his disposal and explained how his methods attracted crowds and conservation applications when parked in downtown West Jefferson, North Carolina.6 Sitting in the north pasture together, I encourage students to imagine this scene that took place less than ten miles away from us some seventy years ago. McLaurin's experience in Appalachia helps us form critical conversations about community-oriented outreach and development that inherently rests upon building trust and relationships. Such approaches continue to be essential in western North Carolina, which, like the rest of Appalachia, has a fraught history with federal conservation programs.7Photographs of soil erosion are also integral to students' understanding of soils as culture and political economy. During lunch, we analyze early to mid-twentieth-century erosion photos that feature severe gullies and sheet erosion in Appalachia. At first glance and after initial discussion, students learn that in some cases, the frequent changes in farm ownership led to severe land mismanagement and erosion. Before passing judgment on a farmer's soil mismanagement, it is crucial to understand the historical context of a particular piece of farmland. Students read that when one farmer purchased land in Buncombe County, North Carolina, in 1938, it had already changed hands six times since 1925. The previous owners were primarily concerned with producing the most profit possible with the least amount of management. One owner was said to have plowed fields without ever putting the land into crop production, so when it rained heavily, serious erosion in the form of “nude sore spots” occurred. The erosion became worse on the steeper areas of the farm, and the practice of monoculture coupled with constant crop harvesting meant considerable soil infertility.8Turning to photographs from 1930s north Georgia, we view deforested hillsides with severe erosion. With one photograph, soil conservation agents complained of a “noncooperative” farmer who felled a significant portion of his timber and then attempted to use it to check vast erosion gullies on sloped land. The agents were astonished to find tree stumps in the gullies.9 Many of our students are interested in pursuing agrarian development as a career both regionally and internationally, so further analysis of soil conservation literature allows them to track both economic and landscape change. The photographs help students understand farmers' decisions in light of extraordinary historical circumstances. Similarly to the Buncombe County example, students are encouraged to offer analysis within a holistic context that asks critical questions beyond soil mismanagement. We discuss the complexity of placing blame on farmers for clearing the forest, because like other areas of Appalachia during the Great Depression era, wage labor opportunities and access to prime farmland at lower elevations might have been nonexistent by that time.10To further showcase farmer agency and agroecological knowledge production, students then read a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) document that demonstrates how a failed soil fertility test (tricalcium phosphate fertilizer was accidentally labeled as a soil sample) further severed local trust of federal conservation programs in the larger context of external pressure to adopt commercial fertilizers.11 Juxtaposing the TVA document with the oral history of Mollie Combs of western North Carolina, we then learn about Appalachian families' experiences with commercial fertilizers. Recalling her memories of rural life in the first half of the twentieth century, Combs explained, “Yeah, and got the fertilizer you know, and it got too expensive and it didn't pay.”12 Through these soil stories, students learn about the political ecology of fertilizer programs and farmers' agroecological knowledge of soil fertility that, in the case of Combs, alternatively drew from crop rotations and cover crops to maintain fertility. Contrary to popular stereotypes, Appalachian farmers understood nutrient cycling, soil conservation, and farming in fragile agroecosystems before conservation officials came to the region.13Following our morning analysis of soil conservation documents and our discussion of erosion photographs over lunch, we return to the field to learn more about soil health and the ethnoagroecology of mountain agriculture through sowing buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) as a cover crop.14 We also discuss how students' sowing of buckwheat has just shaped the rhizosphere—the zone where plants and soil interact—to gain a stronger understanding of soil change and human-soil relationships in our region.15 Now that we have entered the rhizosphere, we take some soil samples and learn introductory methods to identify soil texture and classification. Students take turns using augers to pull samples, and it is wonderful to witness the looks on their faces when they view and touch the waterlogged, dark brown and black Tusquitee series with thick A horizons after just sampling the deep Evard series with little organic material some twenty yards away. We do not need to walk far to explore different soils with unique characteristics. Beyond lessons in carbon sequestration and soil classification, perhaps ending the day with this activity serves as great symbolism for the overarching lesson of this field day: just as the contours of the land influence soil structure, the contours of culture, political ecology and economy, and community have dynamic impacts on Appalachian agroecosystems.To close our day, students learn the concept of ethnopedology, which documents and understands the local approaches to soil perception, classification, appraisal, use, and management.16 We engage in one last act of human-soil entanglement to begin understanding ethnopedology by collectively reciting Irene Mathieu's poem “Soil,” which prompts students to reflect on lines such as “the way you say soil, sounds like soul . . . the way you say soil you make a poem out of every speck of dirt.”17 Mathieu's poem reminds us to explore the inextricable links between sense of place, community, and soil to cultivate a new worldview that reconsiders the world under our feet. Maybe students will now understand their role in the rhizosphere during a future hike in Moses Cone Park or visit to the SD Farm. On the bus ride back to Boone from Ashe County, I hope students reflect on what the mountain poet Thomas Rain Crowe explains is “the work that puts blisters and then smooth calluses on the hands and mind.”18 While they look out the window and reflect on soil erosion, community applications for soil conservation, mixed methods for soil science, and historical photographs, I also hope they imagine infinite poems and complex histories hidden in the soil. I am inspired by these students who are using place-based learning to tell new kinds of soil stories about our region. Perhaps these stories are not so hidden after all?",

Contemporary commentators, however, were very critical of the agricultural practices adopted by the country's first canegrowers, noting a lack of careful cultivation and plowing, fertilizer use, drainage and paddock design. Various reasons for the use of these inadequate are discussed in this essay, with the conclusion being offered that the most important factor was a lack of scientific knowledge about farming under Australian conditions. By 1891, cane-growing techniques were reported to be the upgrade, with improved cane and sugar yields. Such a transformation had commenced due to the introduction of some mechanization and the dissemination of research findings and technical information about scientific cultivation methods under Australian conditions.

Malin's ecological approach to the history and environment of the North American grasslands brought important new perspectives to those subjects. As a graduate student, Allan G. Bogue studied with both and here he describes and contrasts their personalities, teaching styles, and interests, as well as the graduate student mores and methods of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Although the processes of graduate student research have changed greatly since then, he believes that the careers of Gates and Malin still carry meaning in the present.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This essay examines three classic Mexican land grants along Putah Creek in the lower Sacramento Valley--Rio de los Putos, Los Putos, and Laguna de Santos Callé. The first was confirmed rather routinely, the second was a \"floating\" claim, and the third was an out and out fraud. Analyzed together, these three grants complicate our understanding of the northern borderlands, a term rarely applied to the far reaches of Alta California. Anglo and Hispanic grantees fostered a corrupt land grant system and permitted it to persist because it ultimately benefited them--Anglos more than Hispanics, to be sure--but both nonetheless. As demonstrated in the case Brown v. Greene (1884), corruption became institutionalized to such a high degree that adjudication could become impossible. Reluctance to reform the system permeated the cultural borderlands of northern California and in the process left an imprint on the physical borderlands that is still visible today.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Iowa experienced two well-known incidents of rural violence in the early 1930s with the \"Cow War of Cedar County\" during 1931 and the Farmers’ Holiday Movement Strike in northwest Iowa in August 1932. However, the violence in rural Iowa from 1930 to 1933 became far more widespread, insidious, and personal than these two nationally covered mob incidents. The most extensive violence during the early Depression years involved hired hands and family members attacking and killing each other on scattered farmsteads, bandits robbing vulnerable country folk for their hidden money, gangsters stealing from small town banks, prohibition officers raiding rural stills, or farmers hanging themselves from barn rafters. The climate of financial fear, whether real of exaggerated, added to this overall morbid tension, and midwestern rural society no longer projected an idealistic image of strength, peace, and prosperity but rather one of fear and violence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In many cases, residents in rural communities requiring specialized medical diagnostics and care have had to either endure long journeys to larger cities or do without. In response, a number of programs and services have emerged to bring the latest medical advances to rural populations. For example, in the 1970s a team of cardiologists in Wichita established a system of mobile echocardiography units that went to hospitals in Kansas and in neighboring states. In addition, the physicians themselves conducted regular clinics at these facilities. Sometimes the physicians drove, but in many cases, they flew to the location. In the 1980s these individuals formed a series of companies under the name of \"Mid-States whose employees performed diagnostic work ranging from echocardiography to pregnancy sonograms. One company even provided fitness equipment. Lasting into the 1990s Mid-States’s legacy lives on in the personnel who have gone on to from new businesses and practices, as well as in the many patients who recived treatment over the years.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rural credit in the Bohemian crown lands of the Habsburg monarchy became available on a wide scale only after the abolition of serfdom in 1848. Although organized to serve municipal interests, savings banks and Schulze-Delitzsch credit cooperatives initially provided rural credit, primarily in the form of mortgage loans. Such local financial institutions embraced a social mission of aiding the poor and promoting small producers, while seeking to encourage economic modernization and Czech national revival. Strengthening the economic position of small agricultural producers fit in with both the socioeconomic and national motives of local financial institutions in the 1860s and 1870s. With the agricultural depression of the 1880s, however, agrarian leaders criticized credit cooperatives and savings banks for promoting urban interests over those of their rural customers, and new financial institutions, particularly Raiffeisen-type cooperatives, were founded in the 1890s and 1900s to better meet the credit needs of small farmers. These new cooperatives contributed to the growing political and economic integration of the peasantry into the Czech national life.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Scholars have recognized World War I as a time of crisis for German Americans. The government’s campaign against the \"hyphen\" and for 100 percent Americanism threatened all ethnic Americans but especially those of German descent. This essay examines the wartime events in two rural German Catholic communities in central Minnesota and asserts the power of local culture to shape the communities’ response to the nativism unleashed by the war. More specifically, the war exacerbated pre-existing conflict between area farmers and members of the village merchant class. This played out politically. Merchants were supportive of the loyalty campaign and tried to control its impact, while area farmers broke from a tradition of antipathy to populist politics and rushed to join the newly established Nonpartisan League. These differences expressed conflicting material interests, but they also reflected a growing community-wide debate over the meaning of local identity and the content of local culture. That the merchant class failed during the war to challenge significantly the communities’ island status--indeed the merchants’ own interests precluded a closer alliance with the larger national community--speaks to the tenacity of ethnic culture in the countryside and its ability to support resistance to larger hegemonic forces.",

In order to support their small herds of cattle, these individuals relied on unfettered access to grass and especially water, a resource in short supply on the semi-arid prairies of Texas and Alberta. Larger ranchers and cattle syndicates resented the challenge posed by the settlers and feared the competition for water and grass. Supported by officials in Austin and Ottawa--who favored rapid industrial development on the Plains--cattlemen seized control of the range by fencing pastures and water holes and evicting squatters. When homesteaders resisted this exclusion, government authorities dispatched their rural constabularies--the Texas Rangers and the North-West Mounted Police--to protect a closed but embattled range.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The real and personal property that African-American farm families accumulated between the 1880s and the 1930s can tell a lot about the political consciousness of the disfranchised at the height of African-American landownership. Farm women and their families invested their limited financial and labor resources into household equipment and furnishings, knick-knacks and personal adornment, land, and homes. They used the legal system to secure their property and convey it to heirs even as unscrupulous landlords conspired against them. But purchasing land could limit a family’s mobility, disrupt kinship networks, and constrain their ability to purchase other products of the modern consumer age, most notably automobiles. Irrefutably, the white middle class defined consumer culture and the characteristics of modernization in the rural South, not the black farm families, but rural African Americans still had to feed, clothe, and house their families. Their choices became the object of analysis and ridicule by reformers during the early twentieth century. By the 1930s the small homes that once housed aspiring families became the symbols of poverty even as rural reformers and the Progressive farmers they served celebrated a rural aesthetic that advocated recycling and thrifty management.",

Attempting to produce quality live-stock for local and eastern markets, they found themselves struggling with an array of unforeseen obstacles. The worst of these were natural predators, harsh winter weather, drought, the ability of the domesticated animals to wander over great distances on the unfenced plains, and their tendency to breed indiscriminately. This article provides a detailed explanation of how all these conditions came together in the high-bred horse business on one very large ranch in southern Alberta. The author’s central argument is frontier ranching proved uneconomic in this case and thus in many others on both sides of the Canadian/American border.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tomato growing and canning was an important part of Ozarks life for sixty years. For a few months every year, from before the start of the twentieth century until shortly after the end of World War II, tens of thousands of Ozarkers picked or processed a significant portion of the United States canned tomato pack. During most of these years, they processed millions of cases of canned tomatoes either on the farm or in small, family-owned and operated canneries. The social and economic environment of the area largely determined the rise and decline of canning in the Ozarks and the organization of the industry. It expanded rapidly, not because of any natural advantage in soil or climate, but rather because it fit well with the needs of small, and often poor, farmers raising a variety of crops. It peaked during the 1920s and 1930s and faded a generation later. Canning largely disappeared when changes to local life and work patterns, most notably the decline of small-scale mixed farming, altered the Ozarks in ways that made the area incompatible with small-scale canning.",

Increased understanding of the region is becoming more imperative, and it recently has gained more attention from academia. This symposium offered a chance to add to the body of knowledge, plus have a venue where academics from the United States and Mexico could meet to exchange scholarship. The meeting also marked the return of an Agricultural History Society symposium to an agricultural museum and an invitation for public school teachers to hear current interpretations directly from scholars and museum professionals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The uses of enslaved labor outside the context of staple crop production become evident through an examination of colonial Somerset County, the southernmost Maryland county on the Chesapeake Bay’s Eastern Shore. By the early eighteenth century, conditions in Somerset amounted to something of a paradox. The county’s planters were thoroughly embedded in the larger Chesapeake plantation society and replicated, insofar as they were able, the features of that society, including the use of slave labor and cultivation of tobacco. Yet poor soil conditions pushed residents to the edges of the tobacco economy. Unable to grow tobacco profitably, Somerset’s men and women identified alternative export commodities that were more suited to the resources at hand, including lumber, meat, and ships. In addition, many Somerset residents were active in an expanding coastwide trade that linked economic activity in the county to markets elsewhere in the colonies. Russo examines the allocation of enslaved labor in Somerset’s diversified economy using information drawn from judicial, tax, probate, and land records. Consideration of the evidence for Somerset County indicates that scholars need to devote more attention to the characteristics of slavery in anomalous areas that exist within broad staple-producing regions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Lower Neretvian area is one of the most developed agricultural regions of Croatia. Until the second half of the twentieth century, this was a scarcely populated area with poor inhabitants and undeveloped agriculture. Extensive land cultivation and low production of field crops dominated the economy of the region. The agrarian landscape was formed by a simple system of ditch digging, which helped the local people extend cultivation into the swamp area. In the period of socialist planning and economy before 1990, the government made many attempts at land improvement in this area. These primarily involved the expansion of agricultural areas, intensive land cultivation, and introduction of new field crops. However, agricultural production in the communist period, especially until the mid-1960s, was not market-oriented; therefore problems regarding the management of this big economic potential did not emerge until the transformation of the Croatian economy during the 1990s. These regional problems have much larger social and economic ramifications.",

In the Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota, public apprehension was fueled also from an influx of Mexican people brought to the region by the rapidly expanding sugar beet industry. To address these perceived threats, state and local public officials, civic organizations, and the sugar industry launched a campaign to replace Mexican migrant laborers with local teenage workers. Hence, the number of Mexican people in the region would be reduced significantly, while teenagers were provided jobs that would keep them out of trouble. The Youth Beet Program (YBP) failed as a barrier to Mexican migrants; the teens simply could not produce as well as the migrants. The communities did believe the YBP helped discourage juvenile delinquent behavior. Therefore, the YBP functioned into the 1970s.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conservation of natural resources in South Texas is basically a modern development that parallels the evolution of the Soil Conservation Service and other federal agricultural agencies. Since the World War II era, Hispanic producers have played an important role in adopting new conservation practices to conserve and enhance the value of their lands. Initially, the region was a natural grassland devoted to ranching, but farm development in the early twentieth century led to a sharp increase in irrigated farmland along the Rio Grande. Conservation practices during the long period of extensive ranching were ineffective. As a result, by the twentieth century much of the grasslands were turned into brushland due to overgrazing, the disuse of fires to suppress weeds and useless shrubs, soil compaction, and soil and wind erosion. Hispanic farmers and ranchers had to be convinced that new practices were beneficial. The cooperation of SCS, ASCS, and other agencies facilitated the work of introducing new practices, such as disking, root plowing, seeding of new grasses, and range management practices. Farmers also benefited from new practices. Construction of Falcón Dam in 1954 was a great boost to water conservation and flood control. The last forty years have seen a rapid growth in wildlife ranches and the sale of rangelands to prosperous professionals and businessmen and women. At present, three thousand Hispanic producers are dedicated to conserving their water and soil resources, adapting to these two new developments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The small upcountry farms of Southern Appalachia were slowly fading away during the early twentieth century, but pockets of self-sufficient farms remained in places like the northern Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. These farmers, responsive to the constraints of the mountain landscape that surrounded them, tended to rely on less invasive, century-old technologies to work their fields. Although contemporaries widely disparaged this way of life, the records of these communities reflect a long history of viability and suggest that the ecological basis of upcountry agriculture was strong. This article, which is part of a larger project that studies the transition from small farms to publicly owned forests in Appalachia, analyzes the agricultural patterns within five Blue Ridge Mountain hollows and the economics of subsistence farming in the early twentieth century.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Paul Wallace Gates was the leading American historian of the public domain during the latter half of the twentieth century and James C. Malin’s ecological approach to the history and environment of the North American grasslands brought important new perspectives to those subjects. As a graduate student, Allan G. Bogue studied with both and here he describes and contrasts their personalities, teaching styles, and interests, as well as the graduate student mores and methods of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Although the processes of graduate student research have changed greatly since then, he believes that the careers of Gates and Malin still carry meaning in the present.",

Johnson and Holyoake were the masters of their political systems and dominated the political life of their countries in the 1960s. With similar rural backgrounds and professions, they understood one another and treated the foreign policy of their two countries as a series of political deals. Johnson’s most important concern was garnering support for the United States’ initiative in Vietnam, while Holyoake wanted to make sure that New Zealand had access to American markets for its agricultural exports.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The story of the creation of Cullman County in the post Civil War South has been the subject of propaganda and myth that has gone far beyond Alabama. German immigrants from Cincinnati, Ohio, founded an agricultural community that traditional accounts credit with bringing about an agricultural revolution in what had been a frontier area, in the best traditions of innovation in the New South. The reality of Cullman County’s history proves more valuable to understanding southern farming than the rosy legends. Hard geographical and social realties clashed with the often impractical vision of colonizer John G. Cullmann. His Germans, with their traditional work ethic and willingness to experiment with such new products as wine and strawberries, did try, sometimes unsuccessfully, to make practical changes in southern farming. Far more families from neighboring Georgia answered Cullmann’s call, and they implemented the traditional southern cotton culture. Living among both groups were local white and black farm families from before the arrival of the Germans who also struggled in their own ways to survive. How these groups failed, succeeded, and remained outlines just how limited could be the success of even the best laid plans in what remained all too much a part of the traditional South.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Three quarters of a century ago, writer Bess Streeter Aldrich sought to use her fiction to overturn a woefully inadequate portrayal of midwesterners and midwestern life; recent historians of rural midwestern women have been similarly motivated. Yet they have faced daunting challenges. Like Aldrich, historians contest the region’s stultifying and monolithic image to bring to light the wide variety of meaningful and important gendered and cross-cultural experiences. Although the region is often difficult to interpret in all of its complexity, contradictions, and variations, it is also a place tied to a common agricultural heritage. Within this context, rural Midwestern women and their experiences have historically shaped, altered, and influenced rural life and agriculture of localities, the region, and beyond as the recent scholarship in this bibliographic essay demonstrates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The 1999 Supreme Court of Canada decision in the case of R. v. Donald Marshall Jr. brought about a dramatic change in Aboriginal (First Nations) fishing and harvesting rights in Canada’s Maritime Provinces. Marshall argued that a series of eighteenth-century treaties signed between the Mi’kmaq and the British government guaranteed his right to fish for commercial purposes. The British and, later, the Canadian governments accorded little priority to these treaties, despite repeated protests by the Mi’kmaq. The Supreme Court’s decision caught most observers by surprise, particularly because of the sweeping provisions it made for Aboriginal participation in the commercial fishery. Political controversy followed, sparked by the absence of decisive action by the federal government, by the First Nations’ determination to commence commercial fishing, and by growing anger at \"judicial activism\" by the Supreme Court. The resulting tensions exacerbated long-standing ethnic tensions in the region. The Marshall decision represented a major turning point in Aboriginal harvesting rights in Canada. The Supreme Court’s judgment gave new power to treaties that non-Aboriginal governments had chosen to ignore. At the same time, the decision provided Aboriginal Maritimers with assured access to important fisheries (particularly the lucrative lobster trade) and therefore a key role in the evolving regional economy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Historians have noted the importance of chattel-mortgage financing in nineteenth-century Midwestern agriculture, including its contribution to farmer distress but have not examined its incidence, purposes, or practices in detail. Here the authors describe chattel mortgaging in the town of Springdale, Dane County, Wisconsin between 1848 and 1900, focusing on the borrowing and lending practices of the farmer householders listed in the population and agricultural federal census schedules of 1860 and 1880 and relating them to economic development, production patterns, and the ethnocultural backgrounds, tenure, and gender of the farm operators. They provide comparative data on the extent to which the farmers also borrowed on landed security. They include two detailed case histories of unsuccessful chattel borrowers but also show the importance of chattel credit in the agricultural mechanization that occurred during these years. This type of credit involved smaller principal sums than land credit but was a significant element in the business and commercial processes of the town and although more costly than land credit the difference was apparently less than has been suggested on the basis of experience elsewhere in this era. Farmer distress as reflected in foreclosures was greatest here at earlier dates than those of the Populist Era.",

It was a period of profound adjustment for beef cattle breeders, involving battles over genetic defects, the importation of new breeds, changing standards in relation to husbandry, and the extension of quantitative genetic breeding practices. These innovations would be echoed across Europe in the production of beef cattle and would also interact with the way dairy cattle were bred. This article explains the upheaval in beef breeding between 1950 and 2000, as well as how that upheaval affected dairy cattle breeding. Changes in beef breeding, in effect, modified the functioning of the entire cattle breeding world.",

    "abstract": "In Eliza Lucas Pinckney, Lorri Glover convincingly demonstrates that the eponymous subject of this work was—despite her sex—a planter-patriarch in her own right. From a young age, Eliza's efforts as a planter-patriarch were galvanized by the same motivation as her male counterparts: duty to and protection of family. First, she maintained her father's Low Country estate in his absence, and later, she would do the same after her husband passed, thus securing a future for her children and the family's descendants. Like other planter-patriarchs, her power was contingent on the labor of enslaved people whom she exploited, and whose enslavement she did not question or challenge. Eliza relished the role for herself, both as an extension of her filial and motherly duties, but also in the power and responsibility it granted to her. Some readers may bristle at the author's ostensible misgendering of Eliza as a planter-patriarch, but Glover makes her case for this significant intervention to great success.This spectacular biography presents a complex figure who balked at certain confines of her gender while eschewing others entirely. Eliza spent her earliest years in Antigua, later traveling to London for her education. After a brief return to the island, the Lucases moved to South Carolina, where eventually Eliza would take over the family's three plantations in the Low Country while her family returned to and remained in the Caribbean. The teenage Eliza proved herself worthy of the task, for good and for ill. A bright young woman, Eliza was adept at managing the logistics of the plantation; she experimented with agriculture over the course of many years—most notably, indigo—and proved herself to be quite savvy in financial matters as well. Yet she was also “a model eighteenth-century planter-patriarch” in her attitudes about slavery and enslaved people (2). No stranger to the violent system of bondage, Eliza did not question—and indeed benefited from—South Carolina's carefully crafted patriarchal society. Despite being a fairly devout woman prone to daily prayers and the recognition of divine intervention in her life, Eliza “could not seem to see and certainly never pondered the sinfulness of slaveholding” (4).While her female peers assiduously sought spouses, Eliza instead focused her time and energy on managing the Lucas family's Low Country estates. Yet just four months after the death of a dear friend of hers, Eliza married the woman's widower, Charles Pinckney, who was twenty-three years her senior. By all accounts, the Pinckneys' marriage seems to have been a love match, in addition to being a shrewd political and financial move for both spouses. The couple suffered losses together early in their marriage—his mother, her father, and their second son born prematurely—and the two turned to their faith amid tragedy. Together, the Pinckneys grew their wealth and power—through the exploitation of enslaved laborers—and even resided in England for several years, where Eliza arranged for a royal visit. Just a few short months after returning to South Carolina, Charles developed malaria, to which he ultimately succumbed.The loss of her husband devastated Eliza; for nearly a year, she “retreated into a shell of her former self” (145). Notably, Eliza made a conscious decision never to remarry, despite the numerous offers she did or could have received. She loved her late husband deeply, and a bad match could have jeopardized her children's future. After a year of deep mourning, Eliza returned to a position she knew well: planter-patriarch. Through the remaining decades of her life, Eliza managed the family's estate through the American Revolution and the ensuing economic crises, ensuring that her descendants would be comfortable and powerful for generations. In this and other regards, Eliza fulfilled the duties of a consummate planter-patriarch.Glover's analysis is primarily reliant on the extensive materials that Eliza purposefully left behind. Featured most prominently is Eliza's letter book—which includes her dutifully copied correspondence—but Glover also supplements her analysis with other family missives, newspapers, contemporaneous legal records, and even a bit of material culture (the yellow dress that adorns the cover provides an interesting metaphor for Pinckney's life and legacy). Importantly, this work goes a long way to correcting a body of hagiographical literature initiated by Eliza's family without negating the significant role she played in colonial and revolutionary American history and the Low Country plantation system. Glover reminds us again—but in a new way—that women themselves were vital players in the maintenance of patriarchal power. Although Glover could certainly analyze the theoretical paradox of identifying a woman as a planter-patriarch more explicitly, historians certainly have a well-defined roadmap for engaging with this new framework in future scholarship. Glover's work pushes the reader to recognize Eliza's position beyond what the historiographical field has previously allowed: Eliza was not merely a deputy husband, a republican mother, or a female planter. Instead, she was every bit a planter-patriarch, save for one technicality: her sex. Readers of this journal will appreciate Glover's nuanced analysis of Eliza's involvement in the indigo trade in the Low Country as well as the author's expanded understanding of who can reasonably be considered a “planter-patriarch.” But perhaps Glover's most valuable contribution is to call on scholars to question our use of such gendered terms and recognize that, as bell hooks reminds us in Teaching Critical Thinking: Practical Wisdom (2010), “patriarchy has no gender.”",

An examination of correspondence, federal records, promotional materials, photographs, and news articles related to the two fairs reveals that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) envisioned a subordinate and ancillary role for African Americans in its vision of industrial agriculture.

    "abstract": "In Herbs and Roots, Tamara Venit Shelton provides a sophisticated account of Chinese medicine in the United States from the late nineteenth century to the present. Drawing creatively from memoirs, interviews, archival documents, census information, newspaper articles, and advertisements, Venit Shelton compellingly analyzes how Chinese doctors navigated an increasingly hostile legal, medical, and political environment to promote their therapies, knowledge, and materia medica in the United States. Often assisted by patrons, politicians, and patients, Chinese herbalists tenaciously fought opposition to their presence. Many Chinese medical practitioners flourished, despite facing periodic imprisonment, fines, license revocation, and outright discrimination. Their dispensing of herbal medicine persisted until the end of World War II, when herbs from China became too difficult to obtain owing to Cold War restrictions. Chinese herbalists' experiences of challenging legal restrictions and promoting their medical therapies in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century America left critical legacies for the post-1970s period. In the early 1970s, white American visitors to China experienced medical treatment, and newly interested audiences back home reinterpreted the visitors' experiences for eager clients in the United States. Together with Chinese medical doctors, they elevated acupuncture to a viable therapy across the United States while maintaining long-standing tropes of “orientalism” in promoting classical Chinese medical practices.Chapters 1 and 2 trace how Chinese herbalist immigrants expanded their medical care beyond fellow immigrants to the broader population, who were already sensitized to herbal treatment prior to the arrival of Chinese medicine. Chapter 3 shows how Chinese American herbalists challenged opposition to their practices by promising noninvasive medical treatments and minimal interaction with female patients to promote their approaches as an alternative to mainstream medicine. Chapters 4 and 5 show how Chinese American herbalists worked with sympathetic advisors, patrons, politicians, and patients to subvert legal and cultural attempts to end their practice. Chapter 6 shows that, while opponents of Chinese medicine failed to diminish the herbalists' popularity, both the generational shift among Chinese Americans toward rejecting traditional medicine in favor of biomedicine and the paucity of imported herbal supplies from China during the Cold War led to the demise of the herbalists by the late 1940s. US-China rapprochement by the early 1970s, as chapter 7 shows, led white Americans to visit China; after experiencing acupuncture treatment firsthand on their travels, proponents touted its efficacy, and demand for the treatment back home increased.A key strength of Venit Shelton's account is how she demonstrates that the post-1970s struggles for legal, cultural, and political legitimacy in the United States drew from similar struggles in earlier periods. Like their predecessors, acupuncturists had to appeal to white America in their marketing and leverage sympathetic patrons and patients to evade enormous legal and biomedical scrutiny. Moreover, her rich account of many Chinese American doctors who were central to transforming and promoting Chinese medicine—including the transcultural Fong Wan, reformist Chang Gee Wo, and transpacific Ka-Kit Hui—provides biographies so needed in the global history of medicine as well as the history of medicine in the United States.Venit Shelton's focus on the nineteenth and early and mid-twentieth centuries raises important research questions for the more recent history of Chinese medicine in the United States. In addition to Venit Shelton's excellent account of how Americans' visits to China in the early 1970s popularized acupuncture therapy, additional consideration of immigrants from Taiwan and Hong Kong could also shed light on Chinese medicine in the United States from 1950 to the late 1970s. During this period, practitioners and their clients from Taiwan and Hong Kong (who made up the bulk of “ethnic Chinese” immigrants between 1960 and 1980) engaged with Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture in alternative spaces such as Asian grocery stores, bookstores, travel agencies, and trading companies. Their experiences suggest that the configuration of Chinese medicine during the Cold War became partly refracted through diasporic experiences in Taiwan and Hong Kong, in addition to long-standing medical practices in the United States and China. Similarly, the presence of some African American activists promoting acupuncture as an alternative to discriminatory mainstream biomedical systems in post-1970s New York also complicates the narrative of Chinese medicine as an encounter only between white and Chinese Americans.In sum, Venit Shelton provides a much-needed narrative on the history of Chinese medicine in the United States. Her deft weaving of stories of expertise, serendipity, courage, self-representation, and the tumultuous migrant experience of Chinese doctors and their collaborators should be reflected in future histories of medicine in the United States. Herbs and Roots deserves to be widely read by scholars interested in the globalization of Chinese medicine, Asian American experiences, and the intersection of knowledge and practice in transcultural contexts.",

    "abstract": "Challenging the notion that Plymouth Plantation turned its back on Europe to sow the seeds of a new nation, Carla Pestana argues that “connections rather than isolation sit at the heart of the Plymouth story” (11). Divided into six chapters, each of which explores how people, their ideas, and their things actively operated within Atlantic and global networks, this concise volume dismisses narratives of American exceptionalism and instead revels in the cultural, political, and economic dynamism that characterized New England's first permanent settlement.Pestana opens by showing how women were central to Plymouth's plans. They shaped encounters between the English and Natives and were essential to the establishment of a godly, growing “plantation”—then understood as a permanent settlement of English people living in English ways. European technologies, most notably guns, also played important roles in Plymouth's founding. But, as Pestana notes, Natives soon acquired firearms, thereby mitigating any technological advantage the English settlers may have had.If Pestana's first chapter emphasizes the elements that gave Plymouth permanence, subsequent chapters show the forces of change. Human migration tied Plymouth Plantation to an expanding Atlantic world. Native Americans moved seasonally across the region, and English immigrants—roughly 10 percent—later returned to England. Still others crossed the Atlantic repeatedly. Pestana rejects the notion that Plymouth's settlers were “pilgrims” who had embarked on a premeditated journey of religious devotion, instead recasting them “as refugees wandering in a strange land” (67). Those refugees brought animals, which quickly proliferated so that by the mid-seventeenth century colonists were exporting them to the Caribbean.As Plymouth expanded its commercial connections, traders and their truck houses caused some to grumble. But if textbooks have suggested that Puritans were opposed to profit, Pestana shows that “the first English arrivals in New England embraced trade (if not every trader) and tried to find profit in it” (85). In Pestana's estimation, even religious ideas were less rigid than historians have maintained. Native American belief systems gave the English “a glimpse of a different view,” and notions of an English god shaped Native American religion in return (94). These exchanges were often facilitated by tobacco both within New England and farther afield. “Tobacco,” Pestana concludes, “reveals the transatlantic circulation of things as well any item can” (101).Not all of Plymouth's people sought communion with the saints. Some came to the New World to avoid charges of theft, adultery, bigamy, and rape. But by upholding English law and enforcing its cultural norms, Plymouth's colonists created a “new England” on American shores. They used the English mile, followed English recipes, and wore English clothing made of English cloth, which came to Plymouth by way of new arrivals and the colony's commercial connections. Indeed, as Pestana points out, “Plymouth . . . was becoming something of a crossroads” (125).Anything but isolated, Plymouth relied on its connections with Europe. Colonists sought English servants to fill their labor needs. They also maintained important transatlantic religious ties. “Separatism,” Pestana explains, “was an idea that circulated, but less because the planters brought it with them and more because their detractors used it to renege on financial obligations or to avenge a wrong they felt had been done to them” (156). Finally, Plymouth joined Native America with Europe by way of the fur trade.These Atlantic networks were often vexed by privateers. At times, rovers brought prize money to Plymouth, and colonial leaders used veiled threats of English bandits to keep Dutch traders at bay. But at others, Plymouth fishing camps and cargo ships surrendered to their rivals. Seeking security, Plymouth colonists professed deference to the English king. Far from rejecting Crown authority, they “imagined themselves . . . as subjects of their monarch . . . [and] boldly cast themselves as emissaries as well” (178). Finally, and notably, the people of Plymouth reached across the Atlantic world by way of the books they published and purchased. They told the story of Plymouth's founding and read works that “gave readers a chance to participate in a broad community, one mostly, but not exclusively, English and reformed Protestant” (192).For Pestana, Plymouth Plantation was no isolated crucible of future American ideals. Rather, the colony was connected to and shaped by the economic, political, social, cultural, legal, and religious structures and assumptions of the times. Agricultural historians will take from Pestana's book a clearer understanding of how a seventeenth-century English plantation—one distinct from the slave plantations of the eighteenth-century American South and Caribbean—was imagined, established, and developed over time. In its “triptych” structure, the book also reinforces the connections between human actions, beliefs, and patterns of production and consumption. If in some chapters these connections are only loosely established, the book's many interpretive insights and fast-paced prose nevertheless create a sense of cohesion.Ultimately, this is an eminently readable and teachable book, one that will appeal to undergraduate and graduate students alike. At once challenging some of Plymouth's most enduring myths and adding to a growing body of scholarship that reimagines early America in all its vastness, Pestana has, with considerable panache, demonstrated that Plymouth Plantation was no inward-looking enclave but a colony that was deeply connected to the wider world.",

    "abstract": "When evaluating the significance of the New Materialism for agricultural history, it is crucial to acknowledge that this framework developed out of feminist science studies. Scholars such as Karen Barad and Jane Bennett reapproached what would now be considered the “old” materialism (narrative emphases on how technological and production systems formed human society) with careful consideration of its theoretical limitations. Women's studies, queer studies, and feminist philosophy ultimately shaped how New Materialism manifested as a scholarly conversation, methodological toolkit, and theoretical scaffold in the humanities. To understand what New Materialism could do for agricultural history, it is essential to see where these ideas come from and how they are distinct from previous Marxist materialist efforts.New Materialism emerged out of much longer conversations about what a focus on physical conditions and things can do in science studies, animal studies, and commodity histories, with some of these discussions overlapping with the developments and trajectories of agricultural history. Feminist theorists wondered about the best ways to talk about the use of “sameness” and “otherness” in the formation of class, gender, and racial hierarchies in human society, and it was unclear whether a focus on materialism (rooted in patriarchal dualisms) could do this work. Proposed ways to think about more equitable future configurations seemed to need to go beyond the human and human-made. Donna Haraway, for instance, proposed thinking with “cyborg,” which later evolved into “companion species,” with both informing her “speculative future” work in the context of the climate crisis.1In efforts to meld these theoretical projects with more grounded politics and attention to ethics, feminist philosophers such as Rosi Braidotti embraced positionality and embodiment as important methodological frameworks to make sense of the rapid technological changes, stark political divisions, and increased structural inequalities that define the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.2 Embodiment enabled theorists to take materialist (physical, tangible) and vitalist (active, ephemeral) positions of a subject seriously at the same time. It allowed researchers to suspend the cultural constraints mapped onto material conditions while also acknowledging their existence (especially in distinctions and debates about sex and gender). Positionality emphasized the importance of recognizing one's place in power and ever-shifting social and political circumstances, with scholars using it to illustrate how one's identities intersect and enable different forms of privilege and discrimination, and how scholarship as a whole is informed by the identities and experiences of the researcher.3These developments in feminist scholarship deeply informed the mission and ethos of New Materialism. New materialists actively seek out ways to obliterate bifurcations and, in this vein, philosophically experiment with “intra-actions,” intermediaries, hybrids, and parities.4 Methodological and narrative efforts in New Materialism challenge the assumed dualisms that anchor “modern” thought: male and female, nature and culture, mind and body, human and nonhuman, and even hard-to-reach history with the ever-evolving present. One of the ways this is done is through troubling anthropocentric storytelling and opting to tell histories with focus on nonhuman places, animals, and things. This is where stories of sheepdogs, chickens, and compost have bubbled out of New Materialism, topics near and dear to those in agricultural history.In this way, agricultural history has already passively engaged with projects in New Materialism, as the field's evocative subject matter naturally weaves bodies, matter, and chemicals together. As Kendra Smith-Howard rightly notes in this roundtable, agricultural history “pulses with materiality!,” and scholars in the field have found ways to tell rich stories about how nonhumans (from soil microbes to animals and plants) have shaped human interactions across time. Beyond agricultural topics, historians of agriculture have also grappled with the theoretical intricacies of feminist studies that make up the basis for many questions in New Materialism. More recently, scholars in the field have used this literature to make sense of the gendered dimensions of 4-H clubs and animal breeding, commercial advertising, rural politics, wartime farm labor, and the adoption of agricultural technologies.5 However, these projects do not propose to be extensions of the vision of New Materialism, nor were they designed to take on or speak to its overarching mission.An active engagement with New Materialism would force agricultural historians to reimagine some of the older methodologies used in the field, including, for instance, actual work done in a farmer's field (at a historical farm or through ethnographic work). New Materialism encourages the documentation of seemingly mundane actions that get lost in time, including how different beings and bodies work together (or resist one another) to keep larger, often invisible structures moving, sustaining, or oppressing others. Positionality forces researchers to stay honest about why they came to a topic and how they worked within it—literally and figuratively—based on their place and identity across academic, public, and personal communities. There is a place for participating in agricultural work in researching agricultural history, and that physical experience can help bring sharpness, contrast, and life to sources found in the archive. There is also a place for self-awareness about the privileges afforded to those who can do that work as a researcher in contrast to the laborers who rely on it for their livelihood.Just as New Materialism may encourage the embodiment of farm work as a methodological exercise for agricultural historians, it may also challenge scholars to experiment with traditional storytelling. New Materialism work can incorporate art, film, poetry, and theater in ways that are not always explored by agricultural historians today. The framework may help bridge discussions between museum curators and writers with reflections on interactions between bodies and objects. New Materialism as an educational tool could prove useful in the classroom, as it encourages lectures to be set in and around the subjects of study, with students experiencing firsthand the frictions and textures that exist between humans and nonhumans in agriculture. Creativity is not only mobilized but needed in New Materialism, and it could be further fostered in agricultural history.My excitement to embrace New Materialism comes from my love for executing different methodologies and acknowledging spaces of interdisciplinarity. Methodologically speaking, New Materialism is a fruitful space that challenges scholars to think outside the space of the archive and get their hands dirty (quite literally in muddy fields). It encourages the recognition of researchers' positions of power and aims to use that power to dismantle established hierarchies both within academia and in society more generally. New Materialism also gets agricultural historians talking to feminist theorists, anthropologists, and science and technology studies researchers, who would benefit just as much from the scholarship coming out of this field as aggies would gain from them. Related, as we critique the intellectual trajectory of New Materialism, we join in important conversations about Indigenous scholarship and the need to acknowledge and cite these related, longer-standing ways of knowing the world. New Materialism is not “new,” except in those pervasive Western attempts to juxtapose and classify.6However, my hesitancy toward New Materialism comes with this attention to the human subjects we are talking to, and those I write about and wish to reach with my own work. The politics of New Materialism is rooted in its subversion: to challenge authority and break boundaries through its starkness and, often, strangeness. There are many academic benefits to this kind of work, but there is also a fragility to the stories we tell: the ecological and economic disasters attached to these systems, the harsh realities of the abuse of agricultural laborers (yes, human and nonhuman), and the struggle to use history to make sense of past challenges in anticipation of future ones. To evoke positionality, there is much at stake here and much privilege in academia to tell these stories in the ways we see fit. New Materialism, then, may have a space for some audiences of agricultural historians, but not for others.",

    "abstract": "Pondering the relevance of New Materialism for agricultural history has been a bit like returning to a familiar childhood home only to find it newly remodeled. Is New Materialism simply wall-papering over existing grooves and contours of agricultural histories? Does it rewire and electrify our inquiries about the past? Does New Materialism simply add a new room onto an older structure? Or does it fundamentally alter the structures through which historians engage the subjects (and objects) of agricultural pasts?New materialists often launch their case by describing a scholarly world inattentive or ignorant of material forces. Diana Coole and Samantha Frost open their book New Materialisms: Ontology, Agency, and Politics by discussing the impact of microorganisms and material artifacts on daily life with the comment: “For the most part we take such materiality for granted, or we assume there is little of interest to say about it.”1 Jane Bennett's widely acclaimed Vibrant Matter, similarly, describes a social and humanities scholarship about food that is inattentive to material forces.2Such assessments prompted me to think new materialists are describing a different old house than the one with which I am familiar. For agricultural history pulses with materiality! In its pages, Bermuda grass creeps, boll weevils chomp, tsetse flies infect, cattle walk, weeds choke irrigation ditches, peaches enchant, bulls stomp, and boars refuse to mount.3 Far from taking materiality for granted, or treating the material as mundane, among agricultural historians, even manure matters.4 A great deal.5If agricultural historians have already conceptualized animals and plants (and manure!) as consequential makers of history, what do they have to gain from the new materiality? New Materialism enlarges both the temporal frame and the scope of action, inviting scholars to imagine humans as objects of material manipulation, not simply as modifiers of the natural world. In his Matter of History, Tim LeCain presents the history of the longhorn cow as an evolutionary history, tracing ruminants' development of a four-chambered stomach to the domestication of cattle eight thousand years ago. LeCain argues that, ultimately, the story of cows' domestication is not only about something that humans did to cows, but also about what cows did to humans. Human proximity to a domesticated ruminant, combined with a genetic mutation to make it possible for adults to drink milk, compelled people to take advantage of the nearby food source. Over time, well-fed genetic mutants (milk drinkers) proved more likely to survive, and thus their cultural traits and genetic mutation thrived.6This neo-materialist approach offers novel insights to histories of milk and dairying. Most works about dairy farming center people enacting change on cows—feeding, housing, and breeding them, and protecting their health.7 To a point, cows pattern human lives in these works, structuring the days of those tasked with milking them. Historians rarely explore, however, the longer, more profound ways cows shaped humans' bodies and human history writ large. In a sense, such a perspective forces readers to wonder whether theirs is the only house on the lot—or whether the anthill, bird's nest, doghouse, and compost pile might hold greater leverage than previously understood.Another element of LeCain's New Materialism is that it puts commodities in context with other materials—correcting a shortcoming of focused commodity-centric works. In LeCain's analysis of the cattle of the Deer Lodge Valley, evolutionary biology meets chemistry and physical properties of copper. He describes how copper smelting lofted arsenic-laden ash, ruining cattle ranching's prospects by tainting milk, poisoning cows' capacity to reproduce, and undermining cows' ability to fend for themselves on the open range.8 Making these connections overt provides a more textured history of the unique features of the Deer Lodge Valley, and it also promises to help rescue the field from an ever-more complex set of commodity-focused monographs that largely offer different variations of a similar narrative.LeCain makes this leap to understand humans as objects of cows by mining scholarly secondary literature in biology, psychology, and history, building on scholars who have mined the archives. By so doing, LeCain intends to bring about an end to anthropocentrism. It was striking to me, then, that to make this move, he turns to scientific traditions—cognitive biology, epigenetics—that center humans more than the ecological studies on which environmental historians have generally relied. Human biases are not historians' alone. What impact might amplification of the findings of cognitive and human biology at the expense of field biologists have on science, as well as on history?Thinking more about neo-materialism got me thinking as much about the objects within the remodeled house as of its walls. In particular, neo-materialism offered new ideas about positioning the robust scholarship in material culture studies in agricultural history. At present, neo-materialist works draw more heavily from the fields of technological, environmental, and animal histories than the robust scholarship in material culture and museum studies. Agricultural historians have thought deeply about the material world and the way it comes to life through objects.9 They have used objects to trace trade across rural spaces and considered how objects helped foster the development of social or cultural or regional identity.10 Agricultural historians have also turned to objects to glean hints of the meaning making and resistance of peoples otherwise sparsely documented in the written record. Lu Ann Jones's evaluation of embroidered and hand-dyed curtains made from chicken-feed sacks, for instance, reveals southern farm families' engagement with market-driven poultry production and demonstrates women's knowledge of the local ecology of natural dye sources.11 A set of canning jars in the possession of a southern African American rural household signals how determinedly the family sought self-sufficiency and community resilience.12How might neo-materialist scholarship mesh with material culture scholars to invigorate agricultural history? First, new materialists and material culture scholars might work together to probe the sensory elements of agricultural knowledge production. In the past two decades, sensory historians have helped reconstruct how the past smelled, sounded, tasted, and felt.13 Environmental history, similarly, has paid greater attention to the way that knowledge was embodied through work.14 In The Matter of History, LeCain emphasizes the significance of the material world in sparking cognition and knowledge. Drawing on anthropologist Tim Ingold, LeCain explains that a beginning cellist “would be unable to begin learning to truly play the cello until she picked one up, pressed her fingers to the board, and felt the inimitable deep vibrations as she pulled the bow across the strings.”15The sensory engagement afforded by object study is something long understood by agricultural historians. As John T. Schlebecker urged in his 1977 essay “The Use of Objects in Agricultural History,” “if at all possible the object should be touched, handled, and lifted . . . to know that a grain cradle weighs eleven pounds is not really as useful as lifting and walking with it.”16 The practice of farming—and its attendant pursuits—have many of the same embodied qualities as playing a cello. Whether evaluating friability of soil or gauging the pliability of a tobacco leaf or feeling the heat of an infected udder, to farm is to know by feeling, sniffing, listening, and watching.Might greater engagement with objects lend clues about the bodily experiences of these encounters? Might considering knowledge production from the perspective of cognitive science offer new angles on lay understandings of agriculture, and the pathways by which human bodies interact with the natural world? Thanks to living history farms and museums, it's possible for many scholars not to simply read about past work but to enact it; neo-materialist scholarship helps legitimize the significance of such institutions as not only historical repositories but also laboratories for understanding cognitive experiences.But objects of work are not the only kinds of artifacts that agricultural and rural historians have unearthed. In an arresting article in the 2018 Agricultural History special issue “Artifacts in Agraria,” museum curator Roland Sawatzky provided the “biography” of a violin that traveled from a London workshop to the Manitoban frontier—becoming a prized possession of Pierre Bruce, a Metis middle man for the North West Company. The violin, Sawatzky concludes, “was formative not only for the owners who played it, but for the communities that experienced its playing, followed its rhythms, danced its tunes, shared its sound, and were affected and transformed by its cultural mediations.”17Sawatzky's masterful biography of the object, viewed from the perspective of materialist approaches that attend to the organismal qualities of human behavior, prompted me to wonder whether material-culture scholars might add to the methodology of artifact analysis: How did it move them? What physical actions did the object invoke? What kinds of bodily behavior did it incite? But also—what emotional responses did the object elicit? How? From whom?Ultimately, my assessment is that much of the old house of agricultural history stands, even with the perspectives presented by New Materialism. Despite new materialists' bluster, agricultural history has a long tradition of acknowledging and being interested in the role of material forces—from animal bodies to climate, seed plasma to soil residue—as they interact with the human past. Rather than realign or replace existing fields of inquiry, New Materialism builds on and extends existing approaches.But New Materialism—like a new piece of art or a just-installed mirror—does prompt different kinds of questions and reflections, offering fresh perspectives and evocative questions on familiar terrain. Much like the fiddle's call on the Canadian frontier, the tune of New Materialism offers an invitation to dance with new steps in a familiar space. May the call-and-response of historical inquiry be harmonious.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural history has always had a somewhat complicated relationship with materiality, one that is likely to shape its reception of the New Materialism. On the one hand, it has certainly done better than most historical subfields in terms of recognizing the importance of the material world. Historians of agriculture have long known that things like drought, soil, selective breeding, insects, fungi, farm implements, agricultural outbuildings, and the like have shaped the fortunes of farmers, rural communities, and, indeed, nations. On the other hand, their acknowledgments that such things matter have not always, or even often, resulted in the kind of careful scrutiny of the ways in which things have shaped the past that the New Materialism calls for. Often, the attention agricultural historians have paid to materiality has proven rather perfunctory. Agricultural historians have long talked about soil, to take one example, but have seldom sought to understand its mechanics or integrate it as a historical actor in particularly nuanced ways. Moreover, since agricultural historians have commonly positioned farmers as the protagonists of their narratives, when the other-than-human world has crashed into those stories, it has tended to do so as an “act of God.” Drought, blight, and plague have made times tough for farming families in those histories, but the materiality of such things has mattered much less than the grit and determination of the farmers. Even so, there's been a great deal more emphasis on the material in agricultural history than, say, in political history or economic history, even if they, too, have hugely important (and largely neglected) material connections.In addition to this somewhat superficial engagement with materiality, agricultural historians have long proven suspicious of those material analyses they consider. To the degree that that suspicion is rooted in a lingering fear of determinism, agricultural history is hardly alone. A similar suspicion, for instance, is wrapped into the warp and woof of the historiography of the American South, where environmentally deterministic arguments once served to naturalize slavery. But whatever the reason for it, the suspicion continues to mark large swaths of the field. The examples are too numerous to note, so I'll offer the opening plenary of the most recent meeting of the Agricultural History Society as a representative example. In his thoughtful and provocative contribution to the session, Tom Isern captured this suspicion of materialist analyses when he contended that agricultural historians should seek “to make human agents the protagonists” of their analyses of “challenging environments.” Agricultural historians, he contended, needed to eschew a retreat to “disembodied factors,” environmental or otherwise, in establishing historical causality if they were to avoid the mistakes of environmental historians like Donald Worster, whose study of the Dust Bowl, in Isern's estimation, afforded the natural world too much influence in the shaping of the Plains.1This skepticism goes back a long way. It was certainly evident in the field's initial response to environmental history, as a number of historiographic essays have shown.2 Though Peter A. Coclanis's rather famous review of William Cronon's Nature's Metropolis was more pointed than most in seeing something a bit sinister—misanthropic even—in environmental history, he was not alone.3 Even materially minded agricultural historians like Jack Temple Kirby, who later embraced the field of environmental history, did so hesitantly at first. This is not to conflate the field of environmental history with material histories more generally, but given the overlaps between the two, the case of environmental history proves instructive.The core contention of environmental history's founding generation, after all (and much of what they wrote was agricultural history after one fashion or another), was that abstracting people from the other-than-human world distorted our historical understanding of their lived experience. By ignoring humanity's real connections to the material world, scholars like Worster argued, historians were inadvertently perpetuating a notion that people inhabited an ethereal realm that had little influence on their affairs.4 And while Worster was the most outspoken of that generation about this, even scholars who would later depart from him (Richard White and Cronon, for instance) were producing profoundly materialist studies at the time.5To be sure, their emphasis proved narrower than that of the New Materialism, focusing almost exclusively on the ostensibly natural world as it was understood through ecology and the life sciences. Nevertheless, many of those materialist strains can be seen in the New Materialism. There is no doubt that Timothy J. LeCain, who perhaps more than anyone else has been at the vanguard of the New Materialism in environmental history, and others—almost certainly including everyone on the panel that gave birth to this roundtable—have drawn inspiration from the work of that founding generation. The chief departure point for the New Materialism in this context is found in its self-conscious engagement with the constructivist critiques of material analyses that marked the last decades of the twentieth century and, among other things, set in motion environmental history's cultural turn. A longer essay might point to the difficulties of narrating stories that elide distinctions between nature and culture. It is much easier to reject their separateness as a philosophical proposition than it is to narrate in a way that avoids recapitulating those ontological categories in one way or another. Even so, to the degree that the New Materialism might offer a path forward for environmental history, a field that got bogged down in the notion of hybridity, that self-conscious engagement melded with a renewed commitment to materiality is certainly promising.6 But while I'm sympathetic with many of the larger aims of the New Materialism, I am less sanguine about its value for agricultural history.The New Materialists' rejoinder to Isern's insistence that people be privileged as the agents of history, after all, would essentially echo that of the founding generation of environmental historians. Materialists old and new will warn against the dangers of cultural determinism (which are no less real than those of environmental determinism) and agree that the best environmental history (and agricultural history) melds the ideal and the material, even if it denies the separateness of the categories. This was precisely Worster's rejoinder to his critics—appropriately titled “Seeing beyond Culture”—in the famous 1990 Journal of American History roundtable.7 And the theoretical distinctions of the New Materialism notwithstanding, I don't see how it provides a clearer path around agricultural history's longstanding suspicion of material analyses than those offered by its predecessors.But if the New Materialism seems likely to run up against the same issues as the “old materialism” in agricultural history circles, there are nevertheless places where, leveraged properly, it might redound to real advantage. Foodways offers one such place. Take a hamburger, in which the ground beef from an Angus cow sits on a bun made from hard-red winter wheat and next to oil and salt adhered to thin strips of fried potatoes, all of which are covered with tomatoes and sugar in the form of ketchup, perhaps even with traces of residual glyphosate. The path that each individual part of the burger took to the plate has important material aspects that tend to be taken for granted. But to take just the final step as an example, often lost in studies of foodways is the fact that people choose to eat things like hamburgers—in part at least—because the very material taste receptors on their tongues release chemicals pleasing to their brains.8 Agricultural historians have done a fine job of exploring the cultural factors at play in shaping foodways and have produced impressive studies tracing the commodity chains that produce that food. They have not done as good a job of recognizing that the very materiality of the food system—from field to table—has carried real consequences in shaping regional foodways and indeed the broad contours of agricultural systems. The insights of the New Materialism might offer a model for doing so.Histories of agricultural technology represent another area where the New Materialism could be useful. Agricultural historians have done excellent work underscoring the ways in which technologies have been culturally constructed and reappropriated by rural communities in ways that have shaped the production and marketing of those technologies.9 They have done far less in thinking about the ways in which those technologies, as artifacts, were profoundly material. Electricity traveled through copper; phonographs played music recorded on a resin secreted by lac bugs; tractors converted specific petrochemicals into horsepower. It will not do, of course, simply to assert that such things have agency. It might be a losing proposition, in fact, to contend that they do. Here the New Materialists have an even greater task before them in persuading skeptical agricultural historians than environmental historians who, by contrast, sought merely to convince agricultural historians to situate the ostensibly natural world as an actor in their histories. Nevertheless, taking the materiality of technologies seriously might allow scholars to reframe the connections not only between rural communities and those technologies, but also between rural communities and the larger world.Animal studies offers another obvious field where the New Materialism might reshape agricultural history. Here there might be more space to argue for agency, but I confess that, while there are some great studies along these lines, I often find them frustrating. Or maybe, more rightly, to paraphrase Claude Lévi-Strauss's now clichéd line, I find a lot of the animal studies scholarship good to think with, but less than wholly persuasive. Perhaps this is because animals often exist as abstractions in such studies, with the causal connections between hoof and soil elided by academic jargon. Some of the best studies of animals (like those of Virginia DeJohn Anderson and Mart A. Stewart, to pick two scholars familiar to agricultural historians) came before the New Materialism wielded real influence in scholarly history.10 In an article published three decades ago in this journal, for instance, Stewart successfully challenged several important studies that had rooted colonial cattle culture in various ethnic traditions. He did so by placing cattle—as material beings capable of adapting to the new material realities of a discrete environment—at the center of the story. In doing so, he didn't embrace a deterministic line of argumentation or deny the influence of ethnic traditions in shaping colonial herding practices, but by accounting for the materiality of cattle, he offered a far more persuasive explanation than one rooted wholly in culture.11 Self-consciously New Materialist studies that have proven as successful have done so for much the same reason: they have married concrete examples of the ways in which material realities have shaped the past with compelling storytelling—even if they might be more theory heavy than studies like Stewart's.12In the end, theoretical frameworks are probably less important than the space they open to shape our stories in ways that more accurately reflect the experience of people in the past. It comes down, as it always has, to the stories that we tell, and how we tell them.13 As agricultural historians, we need to be aware of the assumptions that we build into our narratives. If we dismiss the material as ancillary, the stories we tell will reflect that—and so perpetuate the notion that humans inhabit an ethereal world of ideas and abstractions from which they assemble the meaning in their lives. The cascading environmental crises now facing us would offer sufficient reason to challenge that notion, but the more compelling reason might be an academic one: good scholarship demands it. Few subfields are better positioned than agricultural history to underscore the degree to which material things have shaped people's lives. To the degree that the New Materialism helps us produce histories that do that, agricultural historians should embrace it. To the degree it doesn't, agricultural historians might just as well pass it by.",

    "abstract": "I think of the new materialism as a commitment to the idea that nonhuman forces are significant drivers of historical change and that human institutions, societies, and even identities are embedded in the nonhuman world. This is more than saying that nonhuman forces shape history, more than merely saying that an earthquake or typhoon can shape human events. Rather, it is the view that all sorts of things we take to be fundamentally human or social—things like capitalism or colonialism—become possible or gain meaning only through their emergence from, or dialogue with, the nonhuman world. In this sense, materialism is ecological. It is focused on the webs of relationships—human and nonhuman—that underpin human society.Trying to find and understand these relationships is a way of approaching history that has been enormously useful to me, both in helping me tell new stories and rethink familiar ones. Below are some concrete ways materialism has enriched my work. Where possible, I also try to provide some practical ideas on how one can integrate materialist approaches into their own work.In my first book, I wanted to tell a big story—beef in America. All of it. Or as much as I could. The problem when I was conceptualizing the project was how to frame it: Should I narrate the rise of the Chicago meatpackers? Focus primarily on the perspective of one key cattle ranch? Maybe focus on a few important characters? I wanted to provide a kaleidoscopic view, but I had no idea how to keep it together.I had been reading a lot of commodity history, agricultural history, and environmental history, including works by the others on this roundtable, and what I liked was how they focused on the process of making or doing things, especially at the interface of the human and the nonhuman. So I asked myself: What processes helped put (and keep) beef on the American table? How did an individual piece of meat or an individual animal become transformed into an abstract commodity? What relationships maintained that abstraction and what forces undermined it? By focusing on the material, I had no choice but to start on the ground and build up my story from there. The material production of beef as a commodity gave me a through line to analyze the power of a diverse range of actors and forces.I focused on beef as if it had historical power. What forces—human and nonhuman—made that possible? What I found is that the changing of the seasons, the vagaries of animal disease, the specifics of animal bodies and behavior, and even the cultural meanings of ranch labor all became critical parts of that story. Counterintuitively, for an approach opposed to anthropocentrism, materialism also allowed me to tell a big story that was fundamentally human. This was a story on the ground, and although humans were far from the only key actors, it was a vantage from which human consequences and meanings were never far out of view.Materialism also helps avoid another risk of big stories: naturalizing institutions or practices. When we talk about something like “the market,” there is a temptation to move to abstractions. This is understandable; how else can we talk about continent-spanning processes? But when we talk about something that big, it can begin to seem inevitable. There's a temptation to overemphasize uniformity and presuppose stability. On the ground, you find neither; things are more varied than they seemed, and everything is in flux.Materialist approaches can help think this through. First, focusing on a broader range of historical agents reveals the invisible forces sustaining or shaping these institutions. This can be, for instance, the animal labor—chiefly horses—that made a national market possible in the nineteenth century. Further, by emphasizing institutions as embedded in ecologies, materialism helps show how abstractions build up from concrete instantiations. The grading of wheat, for example, emerged from the climatic conditions of the American Midwest, agricultural knowledge, and the on-the-ground dynamics of the struggle between grain elevator owners, railroads, and farmers. From this web of interactions emerged the abstractions of the American commodity market. By building up from the ecological, and broadening the range of historical actors, materialist approaches help denaturalize historical abstractions. It's an approach that helps show how these institutions evolve or even collapse.Despite its power, materialism has its limits. It can help one puzzle through a complicated story, but in de-emphasizing the human, it has less to say about what that story might mean (which is, after all, a deeply human concern). Materialist thinking, then, is most powerful when put in dialogue with other approaches, especially cultural history. This can be either within the historiographic conversation or in one's thoughts.Take the history of the Texas Longhorn. For many Americans, the longhorn symbolizes an unsettled and exciting past, an imagined world that was at once wild and tamed. But when I started to study the longhorn from a materialist perspective, I found something odd. The longhorn was a product of human history, the adaptations of its body reflecting the economic and social system in which it had been embedded. Further, during its nineteenth-century heyday, the longhorn was big business, not a relic of some bygone period of American capitalism.There was a gap between my materialist account of the longhorn and its mythology. But it would be a mistake to view the materialist story as the “correct” one. The myth of the longhorn had real meaning and power. The key was to explore the gap between the two. What was the ideological work of the longhorn myth? Why did the two accounts look so different? And turning the methods of cultural history back on my own account: what was the ideological work of my materialist retelling of the breed's history?Materialist history and cultural history ask different questions and provide different answers. The key is to put them in dialogue. A materialist retelling of a familiar story provides exciting insights not because it is somehow more correct or complete, but because it provides a point of contrast with what we thought we knew. The opposite is true as well: if you are all in on the materialist approach, you should always bring in approaches better able to address key questions of meaning.Perhaps better than anyone, agricultural historians have shown how human history has been made in and through the nonhuman world. Materialist approaches take a similar tack but expand the range of things to which we apply this insight. What if, in addition to soils or crops, we think of gold or copper as the foundation of human power structures? In many ways this approach is not exactly new. But in a way, the ambition is new; materialist approaches show us how all historians can and should think ecologically.",

In Perilous Bounty he focuses on what he sees as the agricultural sustainability crisis in two essential production areas—California, and Iowa, which stands as a proxy for the Corn Belt as a whole.California's Central, San Joaquin, Imperial, and Salinas Valleys are the country's year-round primary sources of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as almonds and pistachios. The ability of farmers in those valleys to produce for domestic consumption, as well as for export, is increasingly compromised by water shortages. California farmers' dependence on mountain snows to fill the reservoirs that provide their annual allocations has been sorely tested over the past decade, during which the state has been more or less continually in drought conditions. Making matters worse is the shift among some farmers out of row crops and into nuts, especially almonds and pistachios. Both are thirsty crops, especially almonds, which require nearly two thousand gallons of water to produce one pound of nuts.California farmers have coped with the water shortage by improving irrigation technologies and by tapping aquifers when they are available. But drawing aquifers down has brought a new set of problems. One is subsidence. As groundwater is taken, land on the surface slumps away, causing problems with the built environment, including existing aqueducts. The other problem is salinization. As aquifers are depleted the water that remains holds higher concentrations of minerals, including salts. Philpott notes that the increasing popularity of pistachios among farmers is due in large part to that crop's high tolerance for salt. Not that this shift is due solely to farmers' decisions. The Wonderful Company controls half a million acres of nut trees and provides a ready market for smaller farmers' almonds and pistachios.Just when he has you thinking that California is about to dry up and blow away, Philpott raises another—if possible, much more alarming—possibility, that there might be a repeat of the catastrophic 1862 flood. That year, weeks of heavy rains turned the Central Valley into a lake six or more feet deep, driving settlers from their homes and killing tens of thousands of cattle. Today 6.5 million people live in the Central Valley, and the wetlands that helped prevent the 1862 flood from being even worse have been drained. A repeat of that flood would be the most devastating natural disaster in American history.Then there's Iowa and the larger Corn Belt it represents. As Philpott notes, Iowa farmers used to raise a mix of crops, especially corn, and animals, especially hogs. For the first century of Iowa's European-American history they usually included a cover crop, too, such as hay, rye, or oats. The hogs ate the corn, the cover crops held the soil in place, and the manure generated on the farm maintained the fertility of the fields. Now most of this has changed, and the change, Philpott argues, has not been for the better. Today the vast majority of hogs are raised in massive confinement facilities that foul the water and the air. Farmers buy their fertilizers in chemical form from off-farm sources. They now grow little, if anything, but corn and soybeans, becoming what my Iowa friends used to call “CBF” farmers, for “corn, beans, and Florida.”Philpott contends that farmers have not benefited from this change. They are on an agricultural treadmill, producing more and more on bigger and bigger farms to remain in the same place economically. They won't change because of fear, government programs that encourage them to grow the same crops, investment in machinery and skills that are crop specific, and because the processing and marketing structure for alternative crops is not available. Helping them stay in their position are the people who gain most of the benefits—suppliers of inputs like Deere and Monsanto and processors like Cargill and JBS.The farmers' situation is bad enough, but the impact of modern Corn Belt farming on the environment may be even worse. Uncovered fields are vulnerable to erosion when late winter and early spring downpours come, and as valuable topsoil enters ditches and streams it carries agricultural chemicals—especially nitrogen—with it. Nitrogen fouls aquifers and local water systems, creates or exacerbates algae blooms in local lakes and ponds, and, if it enters the Mississippi River drainage system, some of it will end up contributing to the growing “dead zone” of blooming algae in the Gulf of Mexico at the mouth of the river.When he moves from problems to solutions, Philpott takes a moderate approach, though his cures for the sustainability crisis will be difficult to achieve. For California, Philpott has hopes for the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, which will be fully implemented in 2040 and will empower the state to control groundwater exploitation. He urges that production of especially thirsty crops be scaled back, and that growers focus on satisfying local markets. He argues that this would encourage farmers elsewhere to grow fruits and vegetables. Certainly, fresh produce comes from Florida, but not enough to meet consumer demands. There was a time when fruits and vegetables were widely grown in the Upper Midwest and canned there. But we have become accustomed to fresh produce year-round, and changing that would require a reacceptance of seasonality on the part of consumers.There is another possible answer to the problem of water in western agriculture that is being implemented right now—move the water from the countryside to the cities, doing away entirely with agriculture as it is now practiced in much of the West. In Colorado, which, like California, is a “first in time, first in right” state in regard to water, fast-growing municipalities are buying water rights from farmers, who then rent their land out for dryland farming or grazing. The city of Aurora, for example, has been buying water rights from farmers in the Arkansas Valley, nearly two hundred miles away!Philpott's prescription for Iowa agriculture mostly involves a shift away from the exclusive emphasis on corn and soybeans, including ending federal programs encouraging these crops, especially the ethanol program. He thinks that Iowa farmers should include cover crops in their rotation, which would hold soil and water, diminish the need for nitrogen fertilizers, and facilitate carbon capture. He also believes they should return to raising hogs and cattle, thereby reducing the environmental and aesthetic curse of massive confinement facilities while providing natural nitrogen fertilization.These steps would undoubtedly improve the sustainability of Corn Belt agriculture by diversifying it and diminishing erosion while lowering chemical costs. Local nonfarmers would benefit from fewer floods and lakes and rivers less fouled by chemicals. But the execution would be a problem. As the ethanol program demonstrates, the closest thing to eternal life in modern America is the federal farm program, and eliminating any part of it is devilishly difficult. Getting farmers to change their ways is no snap either. Introducing cover crops on land where they have not been grown for a couple of generations will entail a new learning curve for farmers, and perhaps new expenses for equipment. Reintroducing animals would probably be the heaviest lift. Animals require a lot of attention that Iowa farmers, accustomed to less-demanding crops, might not be prepared to give.Ever since I have been involved in this enterprise, the sustainability of the American agricultural regime has been in serious doubt. Some of the factors many believed would doom it—such as running out of petroleum—have disappeared. Some of the suggestions that were offered to reform it, such as organic production and the consumption of local foods, have had effects that we see in our supermarkets and farmers' markets. But the question of the sustainability of most agricultural production in this country remains with us. Indeed, it is probably more immediate now than it has ever been.The increasing immediacy of climate change exacerbates the problem of agricultural sustainability, as the drought in California and the heavier spring rains in Iowa illustrate. The sustainability crisis and the climate change crisis are also linked by the reality that both are slow-moving crises, with no Pearl Harbor or 9/11 moment that would galvanize the public to demand and support action. As I write this review, the western drought is in yet another year, the fire season has started earlier, as seems to happen every year now, heat in the Northwest has been so intense that millions of shellfish have perished along the coast, and Lake Mead is so low that power generation has been compromised. Here in my state a 120-mile stretch of the Colorado River has been closed to fishermen owing to low flows and high temperatures that have stressed the trout.But by the time you read this review, it will be cooler, the fires will be under control, and we will probably have had fall and winter moisture. Climate change will fade as a pressing public concern. We'll be moving on with our lives, hoping that this summer will be wetter and cooler. Likewise, the grocery shelves will be stocked, the meat counter will be full, and the array of fresh fruits and vegetables we expect will be abundant. There will be nothing to lead us to expect that an agricultural sustainability crisis looms. The lack of immediacy of the threats that loom before us prevents us from giving them the sustained attention they demand, and until we are unable to maintain the diet to which we have become accustomed, we are unlikely to make the changes that might sustain us, even changes as mild and commonsensical as Philpott suggests.Tom Philpott is a journalist, and, as one would expect, he writes well, though sometimes more self-referentially than I would prefer. He has a story to tell, not a totally new story, to be sure, but one deserving the attention of readers of Agricultural History. It will repay the time you devote to it.",

    "abstract": "In the mid-1990s, Monsanto CEO Robert Shapiro insisted that the firm he headed, primarily known since its founding in the early twentieth century as a commodity chemical manufacturer, had become a forerunner of a new and “more ethereal strategy—sustainability.”1 Biotechnology was core to this strategic transformation, explained Shapiro, for only via “the substitution of information for stuff,” that is, by shifting from agrochemicals to information technology, could multinational corporations like Monsanto confront the environmental degradation caused by unsustainable industrial agriculture.2Three decades later, Monsanto was acquired by the German chemical firm Bayer, largely for its expertise in biotechnology and digital agriculture. Yet for all the continued promises to substitute “information for stuff,” Monsanto remains one of the world's largest producers of agrochemicals. Glyphosate, developed by Monsanto and marketed as Roundup since the early 1970s, continues to be the most widely used herbicide in modern agriculture. Despite long being touted as environmentally friendly owing to its compatibility with conservation tillage and its relatively short persistence in soil after application, the material realities of glyphosate's environmental impacts have become increasingly visible in recent years. The emergence of glyphosate-resistant “superweeds,” the successful waging of lawsuits targeting Roundup as a harm to human health, and environmentalist critiques of genetically modified Roundup Ready seeds highlight the political and ethical issues that have only become more urgent in the time since Shapiro's departure from Monsanto in 2001.3The relationship between the history of corporate agribusinesses and the contemporary challenges of developing more sustainable approaches to agriculture is a particularly inviting arena in which to explore the possibilities offered by new materialist thinking. Proponents of New Materialism, I suggest, would especially highlight the ontological, methodological, and ethical affordances offered by the approach.Ontologically, new materialists are united in their insistence on monism. The rejection of dualism—particularly the notion that “nature” and “culture” are somehow separate—is fundamental to the new materialist worldview.4 The consequences of such an ontological shift are profound. New materialists such as Jane Bennett would have us accede to things—foods, commodities, agrochemicals, genetically modified seeds—“their due” as active rather than passive constructors of the (one) world that we all inhabit.5 Doing so fundamentally undermines the dualist project of creating a hierarchical world in which the needs and interests of rational humans dominate over all other beings. A new materialist reading of Robert Shapiro's definition of agricultural sustainability as a triumph of “information” over “stuff,” therefore, would suggest that such thinking is nonsensical at best and deeply misleading at worst. Stock market investors might like to imagine a world in which multinational agribusinesses sustainably feed the world simply by manipulating genetic sequences, but for a new materialist the rise of “superweeds”—impervious to the latest agricultural technology, and with devasting consequences for global farm yields and livelihoods—is just one stark example of the power of material things to elude the control of even the most hubristic of human enterprises.Methodologically, new materialists are remarkably diverse in their approaches, but across the field there is a commitment to exploring systems and things as dynamic processes, always in a state of becoming.6 This is not a new idea for agricultural historians, for whom the methodological assumption that all things are the product of change over time is hardly controversial. Yet in the hands of new materialists, the turn to processes of becoming can be exceedingly useful for investigating surprises and paradoxes, and thus overturning simplistic assumptions. For proponents of New Materialism such as Jane Bennett and David Goodman, the study of agrofood systems looks very different from the perspective of a human body composed largely of bacteria rather than a passive conduit for the sugars and fats of an industrial food regime.7 Reflective new materialists, much like most historians I know, do not seek universal truths but instead are always creatively searching for new ways of understanding the complex world we inhabit; in this, agricultural historians and new materialists share a pragmatic approach to methodology that seeks to interpret and understand as much as (if not more than) to explain and predict.8 In the case of understanding the history of a multinational agribusiness such as Monsanto, the pragmatic methodological sensibility of New Materialism is perhaps most useful for rejecting teleological assumptions, as if the past predicts the future in some linear fashion. If all things, including multinational corporations and the political institutions that sustain them, are in the process of becoming, then even the most entrenched and seemingly all-powerful organizations are far from “unassailable.”9The ethical upshot of New Materialism both follows from and precedes its ontological and methodological aspects. If nature and (human) culture are inseparably entangled, and understanding this entanglement involves rejecting linear logics, then, according to new materialists, a giant rip is torn in the dualist ethical shroud that prevents humans from acting more responsibly, gently, and carefully in the material world. This is perhaps most evident in Anna Tsing's investigation of exotic mushrooms that resist the machinery of industrial capitalism, the matsutakes that she holds up as exemplars of “what manages to live despite capitalism,” organisms that model a capitalism “[that] has no teleology.”10 New materialists would reject the anthropocentric claims to “sustainability” made by an agribusiness CEO who insisted that only through the monopolistic might of a multinational corporation can a hungry (human) world be fed. From the ethical position of New Materialism, the question is not how to scale up industrial food production to meet the challenges of global environmental degradation, but instead how to rescale and rethink capitalism, ultimately moving to a new process of becoming built not on hubris but on responsibility in and to the material world.11 Not all agricultural historians will share this new materialist political vision, but the urgency of their ethical stance is difficult to ignore when the subjects of our studies—organisms and organizations, lives and livelihoods, processes and power—are so thoroughly intertwined.Yet for all the attractive elements provided by new materialist thinking for confronting the history of agribusiness, there are a number of valid concerns that suggest a need for some critical distance. For one, monist ontologies have for many years been derided by philosophers as “idiosyncratic” at best and “ridiculous” at worst.12 It is far beyond my capability either to defend or attack the logical consistency of a monist ontology, but I can see great value in the earlier concept of “second nature” developed by Alfred Schmidt, Neil Smith, and William Cronon.13 Although Bennett criticizes the concept of “second nature” for reifying a distinction between human culture and the material world,14 for the many environmental and agricultural historians who have deployed the concept, precisely the opposite has been the intent. Indeed, when Schmidt developed the concept by applying Frankfurt School thinking to Karl Marx's writings on nature, the explicit goal was to replace a dualist ontology with a dialectic approach, to explore dynamic and not static processes of power in a material world. New materialists bring fresh language of “assemblages” and “entanglement” and “vitality” to the fore, but even some of the field's strongest proponents are not entirely clear on whether the ideas are fundamentally “new” or whether they more humbly seek to build on long-standing concepts and approaches to elicit “a fresh ‘rhythm’ in academia today.”15Some new materialists have likewise reflected on the field's prioritization of ontology and ethics over epistemology.16 Many agricultural historians would be taken aback by the suggestion that all knowledge is situated and subjective; even new materialists such as Bennett appear to bracket concerns about the nature of knowledge as distractions from the strategic advantages of pursuing a “vital materialist ontology.”17 From the perspective of cultural theorist Paul Rekret, new materialists' failure to engage with epistemological questions leads to studies that “obscure, and at times even risk naturalising the logics by which non-human nature enters into social relations.”18 Indeed, we might see in the turn to “new” materialism a loss of the “old” attention from social scientists to human-conceived structures of power that are objectively real, even when nonmaterial, as with corporate agribusiness's efforts to strategically manipulate stakeholders by distorting or even disowning their own historical actions.19 Microorganisms such as bacteria are clearly powerful “actants” in history, but so are immaterial human concepts and actions such as the financial speculations and institutional arrangements that are increasingly defining the “nature” of contemporary agricultural production and consumption.20Neither Monsanto nor its new corporate parent Bayer has so far been entirely successful in replacing agrochemical “stuff” with digital “information.” Nor have multinational agribusinesses succeeded in bending the matsutake mushroom to the logics of industrial agriculture, or in stemming the tide of glyphosate-resistant superweeds. Yet for all the agency of the nonhuman material world, inhabited by actants ranging from microorganisms to inert matter, it is nonetheless striking just how many organisms have been subjected to forces that, at least to this historian, seem firmly in the control of human agents. Cows in industrial-scale milking parlors, soybeans genetically programmed to require Monsanto's chemical inputs, and peas transformed into burgers that taste astoundingly like beef raise many troubling ontological, ethical, and epistemological questions about the nature and sustainability of modern agribusiness. I am confident that agricultural historians will continue to play an important role in addressing these questions. For at least some of us, the ideas developed by New Materialism, when considered with careful critical distance, can and should play a role in generating our research questions and methods.",

    "abstract": "It has been a long time since we had a scholarly biography of Herman Husband—an attractive figure of the Revolution-era Left who engagingly pops in and out of agrarian popular protest movements in a Forrest Gump–like manner. Unlike the fictional Gump, Husband was an intellectual and political leader committed to the North Carolina Regulator Movement, the patriot cause in the American Revolution, and anti-tax and control disputes leading to the Whiskey Rebellion. Bruce Stewart fills this scholarly lacuna admirably. In Stewart's hands, we see Herman Husband not as a stock hero but a complicated leader who stood for greater opportunity for white men willing to work the soil. His concerns did not spread to people of color or women, whom he saw as appropriately limited to subservience and dependence. Independence was the lodestar of white men, and they saw the essential role of a good government as one that could guarantee opportunity to white men. Herman Husband himself had pursued independence through landholding all his life, moving and establishing himself through a combination of land purchases and opportunistic land grants. In his pursuit of fortune and ideals, he mirrored many other lesser-known men who made their way from the smell of salt in the air to the shadow of the Allegheny Mountains. Where Husband differed was his success. He remade his fortune repeatedly, even as he paid the price for his activist leadership.This is a timely book. Scholarship in American history has increasingly interrogated the foundations of American capitalism and wealth inequality as we live through a second Gilded Age. Herman Husband was a vocal proponent of the role of government in restraining wealth inequality and providing economic opportunity for white men. He joined a long line of American agrarian protesters who saw widespread opportunities to acquire land as vital to ensuring generations of independent farmers who contributed to society through work. They mistrusted lawyers, merchants, and others who benefited economically and socially from their government capture. Stewart argues that radical Protestantism was essential to the embrace of agrarian equality and radical advocacy for the role of all white men in government as voters and officeholders. Postmillennialism lay at the heart of Husband's willingness to lead public stands against government overreach. Stewart argues it also broke Husband's heart, as his faith in the American Revolution as a people's revolution was broken by the adoption of a constitution inimical to the economic and social power of all white men. Scholars have long argued over whether the adoption of the US Constitution was a counterrevolution. Husband knew it deep in his aged, weary bones.This biography of Herman Husband and his times proceeds chronologically: his youth in Maryland, conversion to the Society of Friends, move to North Carolina, rising prominence, expulsion from the Quakers, intellectual and moral leadership of the Regulator Movement, flight to safety as a wanted man, and his rebuilding of his fortune in far western Pennsylvania. It then follows middle-aged Husband through his leadership in the American Revolution, his difficulties and dashed hopes in the economic downturns in the decade after the revolution, and his involvement in the Whiskey Rebellion. Poor seventy-year-old Herman Husband survived seven months of prison only to die of prison-induced pneumonia in a tavern on the outskirts of Philadelphia as he began his laborious passage back to his beloved trans-Allegheny West. If the book seems like a mad dash, it would be, except for the clear and vivid prose, which makes it an enjoyable read.Bruce Stewart worked hard to follow Husband through the archives. Herman Husband mainly left us his eight pamphlets, all written for public distribution. In so doing, he endeavored to provide the religious and intellectual basis for an ongoing agrarian protest movement. In addition to this, he left a few letters scattered across archival collections as well as his many encounters with the eighteenth-century bureaucracy as a targeted leader. Stewart's greater source base allows him to tell Husband's full story beyond the argumentative essays Herman Husband bequeathed to his causes. In so doing, a fuller picture emerges of a loving, brave, but flawed man who fell out with family members, did not always turn the other cheek, and often came across as a ranting lunatic to some while being respected by others.Bruce Stewart is clear-eyed about both agrarianism's long history of advocating for wealth equality for white men and its blindness to any other entrenched inequalities. Readers of this journal who specialize in early America will find this book an insightful grounding in how Herman Husband fit into, and led, agrarian protesters through many dashed opportunities in the late eighteenth century. For historians of the American Revolution, this is a timely reminder of all the kinds of disaffection that were at work in driving popular participation in the revolution. And for historians of agrarian protest movements more generally, this is a reminder of just how deep the roots of agrarian protest are against all government capture, monetary manipulation, and wealth inequality. The issues are not new, and the solutions are also not so new. Herman Husband's long-desired New Jerusalem is still in the vista, beckoning beguilingly to all of us.",

    "abstract": "This thorough and pathbreaking book upends the ways historians have traditionally understood Mexico's revolutionary agrarian reform. Helga Baitenmann sheds new light on the foundational institutions and early trajectory of the twentieth-century ejido. The book shows that, far from being reluctant to distribute land, Carrancista officials and villagers actively participated in the early implementation of agrarian reform. It also argues that Emiliano Zapata and the Zapatista movement were not, in fact, rebelling against capitalism, but against the unprecedented ways its intrusions threatened villagers in Morelos.The book demonstrates that Arturo Warman's dichotomy, which informed generations of historians—land restitutions as a form of autonomy and land grants as a form of co-optation—was ultimately a false one. Indeed, Baitenmann finds some unexpected similarities when comparing the Zapatista and constitutionalist land reforms. Among these are that both created temporary methods for local administrators to manage restitution and grant lands. Although the Zapatista agrarian reform ultimately remained unfulfilled, the “accidental permanence” of the Carrancista temporary agrarian reforms became the origin of the twentieth-century ejido. Equally important, the book also traces the role of the judiciary in the process involved in the shift from restitution of pueblo lands to granting expropriated lands to villages, and it showcases villagers' agency in promoting and shaping that process of revolutionary land reform.The first chapter shows the litigious tradition of pueblos' filing land restitutions that stretched back to the nineteenth century. While hundreds of pueblo representatives filed restitutions in court (far more than previously acknowledged in the scholarship), it was difficult for them to win because of corruption, favoritism, or lack of legal documentation. These difficulties continued into the twentieth century (something discussed at length in chapter 6), but Baitenmann's focus is on the agency of pueblo representatives. Despite the many challenges they faced, they actively engaged in litigation and strategically pitted branches of government against one another.Chapters 2 and 3 demonstrate that the early phase of the Mexican Revolution witnessed not only armed battles but also legal ones, as pueblos continued exerting pressure on various levels of government to resolve land and water claims and fight over territorial boundaries with haciendas. Focusing on the localized Zapatista agrarian reform, a process that remains understudied, Baitenmann finds that Zapatista leadership resolved conflicts in the form of temporary repartos in their attempts to deal with the problem of vague or nonexistent documents. They intended to finalize these temporary repartos once the revolution was complete.In chapter 4, Baitenmann broadens her scope to the national level by examining the Carrancista land reform at a time when the Supreme Court was disbanded. Finding that the reform was more substantial than previous scholars claimed, she shows that José Venustiano Carranza's regime set the main procedures for land reform. These amounted to a shift in power from courts to commissions, and from the judiciary to the executive branch.Chapter 5 expands on Timothy M. James's work by showing that the Supreme Court was not more interventionist in resolving land and water issues during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries because it prioritized redistributing land over restricting the power of the executive branch. This, Baitenmann explains, is one of the reasons sitting presidents have had so much jurisdiction over the agrarian question throughout the twentieth century.Chapter 6 delves into the 1920s land reform in Morelos, arguing against the “revolution betrayed” thesis that has characterized so much of the historiography of twentieth-century Mexico. Baitenmann shows that the reason for so many land grants, and so few land restitutions, was that all the players—the National Agrarian Commission, the interim governor of Morelos, and the Supreme Court—prioritized their commitment to create agrarian reform in Morelos as quickly as possible. Furthermore, they gambled that inter-village conflicts over land and water would be resolved most effectively through land grants and not through restitutions.By deftly analyzing how neither reform intended to create what became the modern ejido, Baitenmann offers an excellent example of how to historicize the lasting consequences of unintentionality. In sum, this is a well-organized, dense, and clearly argued book to be appreciated by all historians of agrarian Mexico.",

    "abstract": "Between the presidential elections of 2016 and 2020, political commentators used the words populist and populism to describe voter discontent and support for Donald Trump. Too often, these political terms were misused and misunderstood, and they were magically applied to a variety of groups that had little in common with the historical origins of the philosophy espoused by the group that gave birth to them, the People's Party. Thus Gregg Cantrell's work is a timely corrective to the abuse of the term populist. Like Charles Postel in The Populist Vision (2007), Cantrell refutes the traditional narrative that the Populist movement was backward-looking or limited in its membership and appeal. In The People's Revolt, Cantrell describes Texas Populists as more radically progressive in their approach to contemporary problems than the stilted leadership of either the Democratic or Republican Party. He argues that a study of Texas Populists foreshadowed the political agenda of Progressives, the New Deal, and Texas native Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs.Home to more populists than any other state, Texas's cultural and geographic identity—both southern and western, Anglo and Mexican—acts as a reminder that Populists involved a far more diverse group of people than previously assumed. Because of this diversity, Cantrell's approach to the study of the People's Party uses both a chronological and thematic narrative to better understand the first well-organized response to the emergence of corporate capitalism and the transition from a labor-intensive, small-scale economy tied to the needs of the community to a capital-intensive, large-scale economy tied to the needs of shareholders. His chapters on religion, race, women, and the “Problem of the Border” convincingly argue that, although it began as a grassroots agrarian movement, the People's Party reflected the concerns of working-class Americans, whether rural plain folk, urban laborers, politically marginalized communities of African American workers in East Texas, or Mexican American workers of South Texas.A chapter titled “The Religious World of Texas Populists” reminds readers that religious values shaping the voice of voters are not exclusive to conservative political leaders. Evangelical Protestantism meant that a person's behavior must be measured against the moral standards of the Bible. The common reference to one another as brother and sister was not a casual friendly greeting, but a sincere expression that all persons belonged to the community, that all were members of the family. One's salvation, in fact, depended on fulfilling the moral obligation that all were God's children, and, as such, all must be treated as equals. The camp meetings of Evangelicals, therefore, were easily converted from theological sermons to political gatherings. The numerous Populist candidates who had been or were preachers represented the logical extension of religious work from the confines of a church to the political arena.Would this sense of moral obligation extend to those whose ancestors were held in bondage and believed to be inherently unequal members of God's family? Cantrell attempts to answer this question using the “Othello problem”: if you grant political rights, will this lead to a call for private rights? If African Americans have the right to vote, hold office, and serve on a jury, will that result in rights that include living anywhere they wish and marrying anyone of their choosing? Noting that some Populists either held prejudicial views or, at the least, were uncomfortable with the notion that social equality of the races should be a goal, Cantrell concludes that the People's Party made more of a sincere effort to embrace the concerns of working-poor Texans regardless of their skin color than the state's ruling Democrats.Cantrell makes a similar argument regarding gender and the Populist movement. Just as Populists challenged assumptions about the role of Black Texans, their party also questioned the limited opportunities for women in the public sphere. While the People's Party of Texas did not formally endorse the women's suffrage movement, Populists at the grassroots level questioned the narrow options of a patriarchal society. Populists also saw the Southern culture of manliness that required the subjection of women as a flawed definition of an honorable man. Instead, Populists defined manly dignity as self-control, respect for law and order, and the acceptance that all members of the community should be treated as equals.What separated the People's Party of Texas from that of other states was the presence of not one but two minority marginalized groups. Cantrell provides an excellent analysis of the difficulty of organizing South Texas and its Mexican American workers. The level of corruption, physical intimidation, and exploitation of the region's labor force who worked the land but did not own it made organizing a greater challenge than in other areas of the state. Cantrell concludes that the attempt to create a biracial coalition was among the first to bridge the political gap that separated white, Black, and Brown workers regardless of race, ethnicity, and religion.A well-written, well-organized, and meticulously researched book, Cantrell's People's Revolt will become standard reading for anyone interested not just in the politics of Texas but also in how Americans responded to the emergence of an industrialized urban corporate society. However, the argument that Populists foreshadowed the reforms of future political movements needs to be balanced against the influence of the Socialist Party of America between 1900 and 1912. A monograph about Socialists like Cantrell's work on Populists is needed.",

    "abstract": "Maybe fernand braudel was on to something when he spoke about the tides of history. Every scholar knows his comments about the different speeds of history in La Méditerranée. Braudel introduced the longue durée into the vocabulary of our profession and juxtaposed it to l'histoire événementielle: in his opinion, events were “surface disturbances, crests of foam that the tides of history carry on their strong backs.”1 It is typically read as a statement on the pace of times past, but maybe there is a materialist dimension in play, too. Waves are a material force if ever there was one, and if they reach a certain size, they dwarf human powers, as everyone who has been on a beach or out at sea will know. Jane Bennett invited us to an encounter with “vibrant matter,” but that sounds like an ambiguous undertaking in the face of the tides of history.2 Clever helmsmen learn to ride the waves, but they better not get overexcited about human supremacy. Waves can make you fall, struggle, and worse.The dynamism of the material is huge but also strangely invisible. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the world produces more than 750 million tons of wheat and more than 500 million tons of rice each year, but who really has an idea of what that number means in substantive terms? It is far more than anyone can eat or store in a silo, and data on production and trade tend to cater to merchants and food security experts. But what about the sheer material heft of masses in motion? The literature speaks of material properties, of the categories that we use for measurements, and of the enchanting quality of the power of the material. But where is the power of masses that sweep you away? Modern commerce has unleashed a veritable global deluge of stuff, agricultural commodities among them, but it seems that scholars struggle to acknowledge this deluge as a force in its own right.According to the laws of physics, masses gain momentum if set into motion, and that has been a loaded word in historical circles since Thomas P. Hughes introduced it into the history of technology. Hughes invoked momentum in his study of electric power networks, arguing that once networks reached a certain size, they were driven not just by the decisions of humans but also by sheer momentum. As conceptual metaphors go, it was one of the murkier ones, not least due to its whiff of technological determinism. Hughes tried to invoke momentum in a study that explains the rise and consolidation of electric power systems, but that brought him perilously close to a circular argument. In his reading, growth generates momentum, and momentum generates more growth.Hughes stressed that “technological momentum, like physical momentum, is not irresistible.”3 But if momentum meets another force, there is usually a price. In Hughes's study, this price is about the balance sheet of power companies, but penalties are of a more nefarious quality when it comes to food. If material flows come to an end, people will starve, and if the flow stops for an extended period of time, people will starve to death.It was a normalcy of sorts in premodern times. “Famine recurred so insistently for centuries on end that it became incorporated into man's biological regime and built into his daily life,” Braudel wrote in the first volume of Civilization and Capitalism.4 Yet the absence of food is a strange omission in our debate, and one that I record with a sense of mea culpa: I realized this when it was too late to make changes. Maybe we would get a different take on the New Materialism if I had invited scholars of Asia or Africa to this conversation, or really anyone whose scholarly realm lies outside modern history. As it stands, our comments tend to reflect an enchantment with the material that is probably a tough sell beyond the world of plenty.When Braudel wrote about the nonhuman world, he conceived “a history whose passage is almost imperceptible.” In the sixteenth-century world of Philip II of Spain, change in the natural environment was about “constant repetition, ever-recurring cycles.”5 That made sense half a millennium ago, but since the dawn of modernity, the waves have grown enormously in scale and scope. They became huge, global, they often went in the same direction and hence accumulated force, and there was more than one wave underway. It might be a worthwhile effort to imagine the flow of agricultural commodities around the world as exactly that: an undercurrent of modern history in the most literal sense. And those who have been out at sea in rough waters know that you should never underestimate the power of undercurrents.None of this is meant to challenge the points made by other contributors to this conversation. Quite the contrary: the place of the material in history becomes even more significant—but also more frightening—if we introduce the dynamism and the momentum of stuff in motion. Maybe there is a place for a view of modern history that takes Braudel's hydraulic metaphor seriously: where material flows gradually turn into forces in their own rights that dwarf human wishes, sensibilities, and modes of control. In such a history, humans would be out at sea, constantly trying to maintain and increase momentum, if only for lack of a choice. It may be a type of history that we cannot tell in the classic mode of historical narration, with a clear start and end and a more or less straight path between the two. We may not even be able to tell this history with our traditional understanding of cause and effect. If humans and material flows intertwine, and if maintaining the flow becomes akin to a categorical imperative, it may prove futile to inquire who is controlling whom. There certainly cannot be a real end in such a history, as the dynamism of the material shows no sign of relenting in the twenty-first century. We are in the midst of the materialist vortex that we have unleashed.The waves of history may not be to everyone's taste. They certainly challenge our understanding of history, in which humans still claim an outsize role at the center of the stage. Those who are not into conceptual metaphors may find all of this exceedingly watery. But maybe that is where we end up when we finally take stuff seriously.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Georgia fruit growers embodied the intelligent, business-minded mentality about which New South boosters preached. Rather than stubbornly adding to the already glutted cotton markets, these modern farmers diversified. In supplying urban markets with fruit and truck, growers drew the attention of northern capital southward. Queen Peach and her cousins would supplant King Cotton and bring prosperity to the prostrate South. Yet it was with the New South's critics that many growers allied themselves in the 1890s. Despite epitomizing scientific agriculture and virtuous industry, Georgia growers asserted the near impossibility of squeezing profits from fruit. Railroads, they argued, hindered the promised progress and liberation through extortionate freight rates. Consequently, growers became leaders of Georgia's Populist revolt. Their story challenges notions of Populism as backward-looking while revealing the inefficiencies, failures, and precarities of corporate capitalism exemplified by southern railroads. Moreover, it demonstrates the Populists' distinct threat to the rising corporate order.",

    "abstract": "Over a millennium ago, images began to appear in Christian church settings—as decorations of holy book covers, within the pages of books, and on church walls—of Jesus exorcizing a multitude of demons, named Legion, from a man into a herd of pigs who then rush into the sea and drown. In using this biblical story to frame the narrative of Legions of Pigs in the Early Medieval West, Jamie Kreiner makes clear the ambiguities of the pig as “both unholy and redemptive, both historically situated and universally relevant” (195). The pigs as Legion and a legion of pigs on farm and field are intertwined.Rather than approaching the history of the pig as only an issue of agricultural production, Kreiner examines it as “a history of the counterintuitive connections that developed between the micro-universes of pig husbandry and early medieval institutions and ideas on a wider scale” (4). She uses the pig as an entry point for thinking through how early medieval people thought about their environment. Her approach is to place the pig within wider social, cultural, and economic contexts of the Late Antique and Early Medieval periods, roughly AD 400 to 1000. While the evidence is focused on Western Europe, particularly the kingdoms of the Carolingians and Ottonians, which occupied large parts of what are today France, Germany, the Low Countries, and northern Italy, and kingdoms on the British Isles, Kreiner deftly weaves in sources from across Europe, stretching to the Islamic lands that were in continuous contact with their Christian counterparts.In her introduction, Kreiner stresses that the flexibility of pigs resulted in dynamic ecological systems in early medieval Europe. Human communities adapted their systems to accommodate pigs, who while potentially highly productive could also be highly unruly. This plays out in chapter 1, which underscores the distinctions medieval people drew between wild boar and domestic pig, the variability of landscapes that swine could be raised on, and attempts to control unwanted pig behaviors.The micro-universe of pig husbandry is then set within the much larger context of medieval philosophy in chapter 2. In this chapter, pigs scarcely appear—and yet the chapter puts the pig and its Christianization (which is discussed later) into the intellectual context of the age through a highly accessible explanation of medieval notions of environmental connectivity and complexity.Chapter 3 gets back to the pigs and their landscapes. Kreiner approaches swine husbandry as extracting value out of the landscape or, as she calls it, “salvaging.” Through their ability to turn found foods in the environment into food on human tables, pigs made the landscape productive for people. How they did this—by forest foraging, pasture grazing, or stall feeding—varied according to ecological and economic conditions. Kreiner brings together an impressive collection of sources to explain that variability.In chapter 4, the focus is on the assemblage of humans and pigs and the social groups that were created and modified by those relations. The section on swineherds in particular gives a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the economic and social status of those closest to pigs. She also shows how pork consumption was a Roman tradition, which had both ideological and practical implications, for example in the provisioning of soldiers with pork through taxes. Chapter 5 starts with the pig as Roman animal and then discusses how the pig became associated with Christians, both in symbolic and dietary forms. Kreiner stresses the counterintuitive connections here, as the pig takes on both diabolical natures and Christian conviction. The legions of pigs and Legion in pigs are co-constituted.Kreiner's book is written with non-medievalists in mind—she elucidates time-specific social and legal terms so that they are understandable without a background in the period. She finds just the right balance of using source materials to support her arguments without getting bogged down in details. Her writing style is a delight to read. This book demonstrates how medieval environmental and agricultural history can be written as a history of ideas and culture with wide appeal.",

    "abstract": "Many Germans, particularly in the eastern part of the country, associate rapeseed with the color yellow. Yellow rapeseed flowers are omnipresent in late April and May, and driving through the country at that time of the year means driving through yellow. It is thus understandable that Sarah Waltenberger begins her monograph picturing a tour through the German countryside on a random Sunday in spring. The book stems from her dissertation at the University of Bielefeld in 2018, and she clearly shows that the yellow flowers indicate more than spring: they are a testimony to the significant role this crop has played in German agriculture.Rapeseed is cultivated for its oil, which finds use in food production and industry, and the residue of the milling process serves as fodder. According to the title, Waltenberger aims at writing the history of rapeseed as Stoffgeschichte, and in her introduction she often uses the word Stoff. The term means “material,” “substance,” and “thing,” among others, and is part of the word Rohstoff, meaning “resource.” The term kindles associations with scholarship in the fields of materiality/material cultures and the history of things. Waltenberger cites many works stemming from this scholarship; however, she falls short in explaining which field her work connects with and why she prefers the term Stoff over Material or Ding.Waltenberger positions her study within Niklas Luhmann's social systems theory, analyzing the perception of rapeseed among various groups involved in its creation. She defines these actor groups as producers, breeders, politicians, and consumers, each with their own perceptions of rapeseed. From these considerations, she develops four central arguments for her study. The first is that rapeseed has been created. It was a crop constructed culturally, but also physically through breeding. This argument plays out very well throughout the book and is probably the most important insight.Her second argument is that rapeseed encoded an understanding of nature, though this point is not effectively illustrated and analyzed. Waltenberger's third argument is that rapeseed had its own agency and was not a passive object. The point clearly connects to her reflections on Stoff, and it would thus have been even more relevant if the book were more clearly positioned in the field of material cultures. The fourth argument relates to the actor groups, who built what she calls the world of rapeseed, protected by communication and trust across the groups (22). It is less clear what the danger to this world was.The introduction is followed by a short chapter on harvest numbers and areas planted from 1880 onward, the botanical features of the crop, and the historical development and characteristics of some rapeseed varieties. The information is useful for understanding the main part of this monograph, in which Waltenberger analyzes the causes of increasing rapeseed production in Germany. Here she works with mainly governmental sources but includes publications from contemporary actors as well.Rapeseed became an oil crop of significance especially in World War I and during the Nazi era, when Germans suffered from fat shortages, leading slowly to the idea among politicians that rapeseed could solve the problem. Rapeseed oil was edible but didn't taste good, and using the residue from the milling process was possible but only to a limited extent. A central insight is that rapeseed's status as a promising crop depended on governmental agricultural support.One of the strengths, but certainly also challenges, of the book lies in the fact that Waltenberger chose to include both postwar German states. Since both states' economies and agricultural systems developed differently, their approaches to and needs for rapeseed differed as well. In East Germany, rapeseed production was relevant immediately after the war. That was because East Germany's ability to import fat was limited and the country relied on domestic resources. In West Germany, production dropped after the war and grew only from the mid-1950s onward. It was spurred by governmental support, so much so that farmers soon faced an oversupply problem, especially internationally. In the 1960s, Canadian breeders developed canola, a variety that gave a less bitter oil and was thus preferred in global markets. West German rapeseed production rose nevertheless, and Waltenberger analyzes the various reasons and challenges behind this development. It was not before the mid-1970s that German breeders also created varieties more suitable for human and animal consumption, and these developments spurred the crop's cultivation even further.That rapeseed is a crop created by people, not a plant given to them by nature, remains the central insight of Waltenberger's study. Some reflections on whether this was true for other, if not all, similar crops might have enriched the point. It would have also enhanced her study if she had carved out more clearly how actor groups overlapped. Too often, Waltenberger remains unspecific, for example when speaking of “politics” or “research” as actors. Many pages do not address rapeseed but problematize fat, especially in the subchapter regarding World War I and the Nazi period, but these rely on the existing literature. Nevertheless, the book is an interesting read that enriches German agricultural history in the twentieth century.",

    "abstract": "New materialism has given me a lot to think about. At a macro level, the theory re-places humans and human history fully within a world of material things. As a theoretical framework it breaks down conceptual distinctions, arguing that there is no human history distinct from something called nature. Humans are and have always been, in Timothy J. LeCain's words, “deeply embedded in and the product of a dynamic and creative material environment.”1 Although New Materialism resembles historical materialism, its proponents have no interest in reviving the latter's tendency toward mechanistic reductionism.2 Instead they offer an expansive vision of the complexity of the material world. More specifically for the readers of this journal, New Materialism frames agriculture as an entangled project of humans with animals, plants, microbes, and elements, each with their own limits and agency (or at least “thing power”).What interests me most about New Materialism is not so much its framing of the material world (its ontology) but its ways of perceiving that world (its epistemology and methodology). How do we as historians attune our senses and our research methods to perceive this “vibrant matter”? What oracles should we consult to understand what we perceive? In this, LeCain's Matter of History provides an interesting model. The book combines archival research with forays into the sciences for insight, most notably materials science, evolutionary biology, and environmental health. Physics explains the thermodynamics of smelters. Chemistry unravels the mysteries of the copper atom. Entomology provides counsel on the habits and lifeways of the silkworm. It is, in other words, a work of environmental history. What is intriguing is the way LeCain not only reads and talks to scientists but also takes up the practices of a scientist. In his hands, historical research becomes a type of fieldwork and experiment. The image of Tim LeCain the historian tinkering with his copper downspouts to understand the material nature of copper, past and present, is compelling, all the more for having a touch of eccentricity about it.3 He seems to take seriously the insights of the phenomenologists: that humans understand the world as we live in it, not as we distance ourselves from it. For me this turn toward embodied storytelling is the most exciting promise of New Materialism. By embedding historical praxis in a dynamic material world, New Materialism provides a framework to send agricultural historians into the field to learn, in a small and faltering way, what was the daily practice and implicit knowledge of the farm laborer, surveyor, sawyer, or gardener.How might we historians become enchanted by the agricultural world of the past? For my part, when I have tried to attend to the material world of agriculture, I have found my hands weak and my senses dulled. It seems that the world whispers these truths to the poets, the mystics, and, at times, even to the scientists more than to the historians.4Confronted by these limits of perception and urged on by glimpses of vibrant matter, I have ventured off in a direction the new materialists might not have expected. I have taken up an apprenticeship with the poets.5 I was enticed there by a line from Robert Frost's poem “Mowing”: “The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.”6 These mysterious words, which Frost hears his scythe whisper to the grass as he mows, seems to sum up the kind of presence in the world that New Materialism calls for. This enchantment is not a disembodied or ethereal state, but a firm rootedness in fact, in place, and in time. Embedded in a life of contemplation through labor as well as rest, Frost was attentive to the agricultural world around him—a world in which the verb mow spoke to silence and attention as well as sweat and labor. The poem entices but never fully satisfies with this kind of experience when it describes the heat of sun, the feel of the tool, and the sound of the metal on grass.7At this point I expect some readers may cry foul. This talk of poetry seems the leading wedge of a leisured romanticism that celebrates its communion with some nature while countenancing the exploitation of people and other nature that made that leisure possible. It is a fair warning. Agricultural labor and rural landscapes have often looked sweetest to those who are a generation removed from toil and whose ancestors were not subject to either landlord or lash. I'll admit, though, that I do not see this particular blindness in most agricultural poets. Frost, for his part, was no stranger to long days of labor in the field. He warns against the thoughts of “idle hours” and the “fay or elf” of the romantics. As he put it, “Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak.” The spiritual apprehension and aesthetic appreciation of the natural world are not reducible to masks that obscure oppression, though they have long been used to that end. They can also be paths to mourning and lament for the burdens of life and of the sins of the past. Frost is just one voice among many. When hauling his own fields of Vermont hay by tractor, Hayden Carruth saw in the work a glimpse of cruciform suffering, calling down curses on the “sons of bitches who would drive men and women / to the fields where they can only die.”8 Attending to the material world will quickly confront us with the pain, violence, and sorrows that are never far from its beauty. This is what Richard Wilbur saw on the side of a road on trash day: “The sun shall glory / in the glitter of glass-chips, / Foreseeing the salvage / of the prisoned sand.”9 Derek Walcott lamented over the “disjected membra” of a ruined plantation in the Caribbean, “a green lawn, broken by low walls of stone.” There he found a way to tell his soul-crushing tale of the costs of empathy and the labor of reconciliation in places and among people where “the rot [of empire] remains.”10I admit that I am no materialist. I find it fascinating, then, to find the new materialists leaving room for mystery. Or, at least, a temporary stay on demystification. Political theorist (and new materialist) Jane Bennett, for instance, calls us to seek out “moments of sensuous enchantment with the everyday world” (yes, materialist enchantment). As she puts it (admittedly in rather unpoetic language), “The capacity to detect the presence of impersonal affect requires that one is caught up in it. One needs, at least for a while, to suspend suspicion and adopt a more open-ended comportment.” Elsewhere she approaches an almost mystical framing in Vibrant Matter, calling for us to “bear witness to the vital materialities that flow through and around us.” She goes on to argue, “Maybe it is worth running the risks associated with anthropomorphizing (superstition, the divinization of nature, romanticism) because it, oddly enough, works against anthropocentrism: a chord is struck between person and thing, and I am no longer above or outside a nonhuman ‘environment.’”11 On that shared foundation of humility in the face of the world's complexity, I gladly join the new materialists in working for a more materially vibrant, embedded, and multivocal agricultural history.But how? What does this mean for the practice of agricultural history? Should conferences include scythe classes, visits to outdoor ecology labs, and poetry workshops? I'll admit that I'm interested. If historians are to attend to the material world, we will probably have to leave our conference rooms from time to time. Paying attention to matter has as much to do with our hands and ears as it does with our eyes, as much with the dust of the field and the dust we are made of as it does the dust of the archive. It also might mean sitting in silence among the ruins, the places of violence and waste that we are inheriting. For me this has meant getting out of my office. It has meant stopping the car to look at a collapsing cotton seed oil press or a rusted-out cotton gin. It has meant picking up my wife's grandfather's rusted scythe and struggling to find the point of balance between the blade and handle. It has meant learning to spot the particular slope and vine-wrapped fence line of a superfund site. It has meant picking up the strange hedge apples of the Osage Orange tree, whose thorns fenced the fields of the West before factories refashioned them out of steel as barbed wire. We live in a world of wonders whispering for our attention—a world whose history is ours, but not ours alone.",

    "abstract": "In The Rise and Fall of United Grain Growers, Paul D. Earl traces the history of that powerful western Canadian farmer cooperative and places it in the context of the broader grain industry between 1906 and 2006. This book is more than a standard business or agricultural history, however. The history of “The Company,” as Earl refers to it across its several iterations, is a window into farmers' movements, competing ideologies, corporate takeovers, legal maneuverings, economics, and government power. In addition to traditional source material, Earl leverages his experiences as a former employee of the company and his access to interviews with upper management in the early twenty-first century to produce a unique examination into what was one of the world's largest farmer-owned grain marketing entities and its transition from cooperative to shareholder-dominated corporation.In parts 1 and 2, Earl traces the history of the company and the prairie grain industry from 1906 to 1990, identifying the economic and ideological contours within which wheat marketing operated. Between 1906, when the company began operations in Winnipeg, and 1945, the grain industry shifted from a relatively open and privately controlled market in which free trade predominated to a highly regulated and centralized arena dominated by state and cooperative control. The farming and cooperative community found itself divided between advocates of laissez-faire and government marketing controls. In this period, the company, generally successful, managed to straddle the two positions and embrace elements of both. From the postwar period through the 1980s, pressures to deregulate and return to private control of the grain industry increased, caused by outdated transportation, marketing, and handling arrangements and the concomitant need to modernize and rationalize railway and elevator systems. There were no easy answers to these challenges, as the company, the wheat pools, and various government administrations wrestled with how to enact systemic reforms. The company struggled with its own modernization efforts, and its growth slowed and financial issues mounted.Part 3 of the book examines the end of the company between 1991 and 2006, when the Saskatchewan wheat pool succeeded in a takeover bid. This final third of the book is the meat of Earl's argument, where he investigates the takeover from multiple angles. He ultimately concludes that, though all sides acted in good faith, the sale of the company to the pool was not a fait accompli, and its traditional and historical cooperative role was worth saving. In this period the grain industry underwent a long, overdue massive transformation characterized by deregulation, modernization, and consolidation of grain handling systems and transportation networks. The company adapted to these changes, becoming Agricore United after a merger with the Alberta and Manitoba wheat pools in the late 1990s, and it created a hybrid management and financial structure based on public shareholding and a cooperative farmer/member-dominated board.In 2006 the Saskatchewan pool launched a takeover bid of the company. Within Agricore United, two perspectives developed, and their adherents debated the merits of the takeover. Senior management argued for the “commercial perspective”: shareholder primacy is predominant, and the company should acquiesce to the takeover on grounds that it would increase shareholder returns. Farmer-directors on the board put forth the “traditional perspective”: shareholder primacy took a back seat to preserving the company's historic role as a farmer-controlled cooperative, a business that advocated for the rural community, its members, and its customers. Earl contends that the sale of the company to the pool, which ended a century of farmer control and created a shareholder-dominated corporation, was avoidable and remains regrettable. He explains how the takeover ultimately succeeded because of a lack of leadership, internal divisions, and broader acceptance of the commercial perspective within the company.As a historian, the history of the company within the context of the western Canadian grain industry interested me greatly. This section of the book is the best current analysis of the topic. In addition, I found myself fascinated by Earl's careful delineation of the intricacies of modern corporate law, the internal workings of large-scale businesses, and the complexities and emotions tied up in takeovers and mergers. The Rise and Fall of United Grain Growers is a useful book for scholars of agriculture and business, as well as those seeking insight into policy making, the Canadian grain industry, and corporate law.",

    "abstract": "In this interesting book, Francine McKenzie writes about an institution that was central to the making of a new international order after World War II: the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Through a concise, well-structured series of topical chapters, we learn about the political history of GATT from its origins in 1948 to its eventual dissolution within the World Trade Organization in 1994. McKenzie relies on an approach that is rich in primary sources and focuses on the links between international trade and international political relations. This allows her to provide a vivid description of “the way people have thought and talked about trade” (236).Readers of Agricultural History will be primarily interested in the last chapter, about “the agriculture challenge to GATT” (232). McKenzie portrays agriculture as “GATT's greatest failure” (232). Her analysis of agriculture in GATT goes back to the 1950s and 1960s, when first the United States and later the newly created European Economic Community (EEC) succeeded at implementing agricultural policies opposed to GATT's liberal principles. This gives McKenzie the chance to show us how difficult it would become to reintroduce agriculture in the pro-trade agenda, which eventually happened during the turbulent Uruguay round of the late 1980s and early 1990s.As elsewhere in the book, the analysis is finely nuanced. The United States and the EEC (and, within the latter, France in particular) are given the major roles that they deserve, but this does not prevent us from perceiving the important role that other states played in some critical junctures, for instance Australia as a promoter of the “Cairns group” that pressed for agricultural liberalization from the mid-1980s onward. McKenzie credibly portrays GATT as a flexible organization. Quite often we find it unable to impose its agenda on states, but it manages to establish a certain kind of normative authority: even those countries that deviated from GATT principles wanted GATT to certify their deviation as a justifiable exception to the rule. This is one of the ways in which trade liberalization came to be widely accepted as the default policy.Some of the limitations of the book are, in this reviewer's opinion, transparently presented by the author when she explains her purposes. The focus is on international governance, not on its economic and social effects. The epistemology borrows some concepts from political science but not much, since the author is focused on those forces that really mattered to policy makers. This imposes some limits. In the “clash between those who had faith in free trade and those who feared it,” the author seems to be on the believers' side, but the foundations of her position are not very explicit (290). A long tradition in political economy, from Friedrich List in the nineteenth century to Ha-Joon Chang today, has questioned the classical position that free trade must always be the default policy. It would have been interesting to assess which of the pro-trade arguments defended by GATT were solid and which were not, as well as the way in which different contexts probably required different recipes. It would have also been interesting to see the author engage with the historical institutionalist approach to political science that has been fruitfully applied to the history of agricultural policy by Adam Sheingate. Yet it would be unfair to criticize McKenzie for not doing what she is transparently saying that she will not do. In social science (as in trade policy), one size does not fit all.Perhaps a different kind of issue is the bias toward Anglo sources. These are sources that allow McKenzie to capture perspectives from the Anglo world and from GATT itself, but not as much from other countries and organizations. I am thinking of France and the European Economic Community in particular. How different would the international history narrated in this book have been if French- and German-language sources, for instance, had been used more extensively?Notwithstanding these drawbacks, the book will undoubtedly be of great interest to agricultural historians. Alongside its general virtues, it provides researchers interested in agricultural policy with something that is fundamental: the bigger picture. The world of agricultural politics is so complex and multifaceted that specialists are always in danger of losing themselves in the maze. But the maze can be understood in a better way if, as McKenzie consistently does in this book, agriculture is positioned within a more general view of collaboration and conflict between states and emerging patterns of international governance.",

    "abstract": "Sulphuric Utopias is a rich and multidimensional history of technological efforts to control diseases of commerce during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Cowritten by a historian of medicine and a medical anthropologist, the book examines how fumigation machines—particularly the Clayton machine—emerged as technological magic bullets that promised to end costly and unpopular quarantine regimes. Lukas Engelmann and Christos Lynteris argue that these fumigation technologies sprang from and shaped utopian visions of frictionless global trade freed from the public health threats of a world connected by commerce. These visions emerged at a moment of profound change in the global history of science, technology, and medicine, but this is not a story of enlightened understandings leading in straightforward ways to efficacious technological solutions. Instead, it is a conceptually and theoretically sophisticated case study in the emergence, spread, stabilization, and disassembly of a sociotechnical approach to solving a historically shifting set of public health problems. While there is limited agricultural history content here, readers interested in science and technology studies, the history of medicine and public health, and the globalization of commerce will find much of interest.Fumigation was a venerable approach to sanitation, mostly aimed at counteracting bad odors and noxious effluvia, but maritime fumigation was a product of the bacteriological revolution. Miasmatic understandings of fumigation's efficacy began to give way to bacteriological ones in New Orleans, where, in the 1880s, Thomas Andrew Clayton, a Scottish immigrant and former cotton farmer, developed a fumigation device to treat supposedly infected ships and their goods. The main problem was yellow fever, which regularly visited the city in the nineteenth century and necessitated a strict quarantine regime that hampered trade. Those who believed yellow fever to be contagious saw soiled clothing or trade goods as carrying the “fomites” that spread the disease. Clayton's machine, patented in 1893, pumped sulfur gases into ship holds with the aim of killing those germs and, hopefully, replacing quarantines with a quick technological fix. Ironically, and instructively, it was also a technique deployed before the modern understanding of yellow fever as a vector-borne disease; the fomites it targeted were phantoms, though fumigation may have incidentally controlled the mosquitoes that spread the disease. Here we see the first hint of a major transformation charted by Sulphuric Utopias: fumigation, reinvented in the bacteriological age as a means of disinfection, would shift its focus to disinfestation.The Clayton machine, and the “sulphuric utopia” it promised, soon spread from New Orleans to other port cities, though its shape shifted in the process. The authors examine efforts in Hamburg and Istanbul to control the spread of bubonic plague and cholera through fumigation, efforts that then combined with attempts to control shipboard rats. Indeed, fumigation with sulfur dioxide offered rat control as a by-product, and when rats and their fleas were discovered to be carriers of plague, fumigation shifted its goal from disinfection to “deratinization.” The Clayton machine and similar contraptions—such as the Aparato Marot in France—spread among other European nations such as Britain and France, often as a means for “keeping apart the imagined modern salubrity of the West from the epidemic constituency of the rest of the world” (15). The authors then examine fumigation in Latin American public health campaigns through a case study of Argentina and the “Sulfurozador,” a variation on the Clayton machine. Fumigation was critical to Latin American sanitary modernity, so much so that the Argentines brought these fumigation machines from the harbor, where they had only treated ships, to the city streets, where revived sanitary brigades in Buenos Aires and other Latin American cities fought rats and the plague.From New Orleans and Europe's port cities to the Ottoman Empire and Latin America, and from the 1880s through World War I, these new fumigation technologies came to symbolize a type of modern environmental control that promised, as the authors put it, “to fortify and encourage the belief in a continuous flow of trade without the risk of disease transmission” (199). What held these visions together for several decades was a sense that sulfur functioned both to disinfect and to disinfest. But as the efficacy of sulfur's disinfecting qualities came under greater scrutiny, and as disinfestation became the primary goal of fumigation, other compounds such as cyanide replaced sulfur, which had the disadvantages of being flammable and leaving behind a long-lasting stench. By the interwar years, the utopianism of sulfur fumigation had faded.In the skillful hands of Engelmann and Lynteris, maritime fumigation becomes a central story in the global rise of modern public health regimes, one that has as much to do with technological imaginaries of modernity as it does with materially controlling disease and improving public health. These new technologies and engineering approaches emerged in response to a revolution in the scientific understanding of disease, but, over four decades, they also continually reshaped those understandings and the various public health responses to them.",

    "abstract": "For some time now, scholars in the humanities have called for a more-than-human approach to analyzing and narrating the past. In recent years, research endeavors have mushroomed: scholars have considered the historical significance of everything from fungi to flies to copper filaments. To do so, they are drawing on theory and empirical findings from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives. There is no shortage of neologisms, including New Materialism.What are some of the implications of this scholarly foment for writing histories of agriculture?Before diving into this question, I should note that I can readily imagine some agricultural historians scratching—or perhaps shaking—their heads over this question. How can “agricultural history” be anything but materialist? In fact, a perusal of article titles from the first decade (1927–37) of Agricultural History finds authors addressing topics like cattle breeds, copper-based fungicides, grain elevators, grain drills, long-distance plant introductions, grasshopper plagues, and Hugh Nicol's 1936 gem titled “The Two Ends of Straw”—how much more material can one get?My rather obvious point is that the study of material things in agricultural history is not terribly new. I think that there are three things that distinguish recent efforts to rematerialize agricultural history. The key analytical move is a recasting of organisms and nonliving things, transforming them from eminently manipulable props into coproducers of historical change. In other words, a cow or a copper fungicide ceases to be an “input” in a farming system and becomes an actor (of sorts) capable of driving change via interactions with other components of the “assemblage”—a neologism that conveys a second hallmark of the New Materialism: an emphasis on contingency over fixed structures. Finally, practitioners of the New Materialism show a willingness to look beyond the forces of capitalism, plunging into deep histories of mineral formations, plant and animal domestications, and climate change. In addition to thinking about finance capitalism or merchant capitalism, we might do well to consider “livestock capitalisms” or “carbon capitalisms,” since it matters quite a bit that capitalists like to celebrate their winnings by driving fancy cars and eating steak dinners.Timothy J. LeCain notes that his approach to New Materialism draws inspiration from Donald Worster who, of course, has played a leading role in integrating agroecological principles in agricultural/environmental histories.1 Over the past two decades, agroecology has continued to influence historical scholarship on farming, posing new epistemic and ethical questions that emerged alongside what Raj Patel has called the “Long Green Revolution.”2 New Materialism builds on, and extends in promising new ways, agroecological histories that pose alternative, socio-ecological forms of valuation.Consider the concept of “yield.” If we can trust the folks at the venerable Oxford English Dictionary, the use of the word yield to refer to crop production dates to the fifteenth century. Yield derived from geld, whose now “obsolete” meaning was a payment of taxes, tributes, or fines. Leaving aside the tantalizing connections between the etymology of yield, the rise of plantation economies, and a notion that soils must “yield” bounty to the people who worked it, I would argue that histories of modern agriculture continue to revolve around the causes and consequences of rising yields, including mass urbanization and government food policies designed to keep food costs low for urban-based working classes. In other words, many historical “metanarratives” embraced by progressive as well as less progressive historians rest on unquestioned assumptions about the causes (and benefits) of the productivity of a rather small number of grain crops.My point here is not to deny the historical significance of agricultural intensification. The problem is that yield functions as the “gross domestic product” of agriculture: it's a quantitative measure that conceals at least as much as it reveals about the myriad life forms that make up farming. Yield or “productivity” functions to conceal power dynamics and inequalities while lending a technoscientific precision to evaluating farming systems against the “gold standard” of monocultures. For historians of agriculture, New Materialisms offer a way to begin to approach farming as something other than a “sector” that yields goods for “the economy”;3 it is a means to center on the reproduction of life forms. To put it in Worsterian terms, new materialist approaches to histories of agriculture are grounded in agroecology, not agronomy.4My sense is that New Materialism is deeply influenced by the present moment. Scholarly interest in granting power to other-than-human things is cresting precisely when many people are fearful of large-scale, anthropogenic climate change and its implications for nearly everything, including how writers narrate the past. Unsurprisingly, triumphant tales of fossil-fuel driven, technological “advances” have given way to far more unsettled and unsettling narratives. The very symbol of industrialization—the steam engine—is now looked on with bitter irony, recast as the epitome of the self-reinforcing logic of productionism: an early steam engine pumping water out of a mine pit to permit the extraction of more coal needed to power the steam engine. (Of course, engines would become more “efficient,” but that only coincided with increased consumption of fossil fuels.) Neo-materialism, then, is a pushback of sorts against assumptions that people will engineer their way out of large-scale, ecological calamity.The shift toward the New Materialism is therefore both epistemic and ethical, empirical and political. There is compelling, if not overwhelming, empirical evidence—assembled by a wide range of disciplines—indicating that societies driven by fossil fuels and high-input agriculture are neither sustainable nor just. One political implication—and this is a biggie—is that government policies that seek to redistribute wealth (be it in the form of money or bags of wheat) are insufficient to achieve long-term environmental/climate justice. A focus on monetary reparations without strengthening the means of socio-ecological reproduction is likely to provide only short-term victories.There is much in the New Materialism to empower agricultural history to challenge the privileged positions of political or military histories, and to engage with theorists of societal transformations.5 Given this potential, I want to suggest that new materialists avoid defining themselves in opposition to cultural or intellectual histories. Instead, I think a more creative approach would be to produce histories that tightly weave materialism with ideational forces. Here I draw inspiration from the late anthropologist Sidney Mintz's book Sweetness and Power, which linked the rise of sugar consumption in Europe to the enslavement of Africans on Caribbean plantations.6 On the one hand, his approach anticipated neo-materialism: he took seriously the idea that humans (and other creatures) might be predisposed to eat sweet-tasting things. This insight is helpful for appreciating the near-global circulation of sugarcane in the modern world and the long march of Coca-Cola. Mintz, however, instructively identified several other sources of sweetness (e.g., honey, sorghums, tree saps, corn syrup) utilized by people living in different times and places. He then sought to explain, largely by drawing on class dynamics and social relations among people, the rise of sugarcane-derived sucrose as the dominant form of sweetener in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Europe. Scholars continue to debate his arguments about social class and consumption practices, but Mintz's insights that production and consumption are interrelated, and that the meanings of consumption are themselves powerful, remain important for writing histories of agriculture.7In my research on the exploitation of animals in southern Patagonia for furs and fibers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, I draw on Mintz when trying to understand the interplay of genetics (i.e., selective breeding), socio-ecological conditions (i.e., the particularity of places), and mass markets for textiles (i.e., fashion). By taking the material qualities of animal fibers seriously, I somewhat paradoxically have had to confront shifting ideas about quality and valuation. For example, the material qualities of the hair or fiber from a guanaco (a South American camelid related to alpacas) are different from those of a Lincoln sheep, which are also different from those of a Corriedale sheep. Twentieth-century industrial researchers spent considerable amounts of energy studying and describing in great detail the material qualities of these fibers. This kind of material approach can tell us something important (maybe: “softness and power”?), but it tells us very little about why particular fibers were valued differently, at different times and in distinct places.I want to stress that I am not talking about an ideational “superstructure” but, rather, commodification as a coproduction of the material and the imaginary: fashion trends gave market value to certain material fiber qualities.8 Fashion in turn is very much about materiality, and textile manufacturers constantly experimented with blending fibers. Finally, fashion is also about social marking: dress signals gender, class, age, generation, politics. It can even be a marker of personhood: the “primitivity” of guanaco fur-clad Indigenous foragers and hunters in Tierra del Fuego became a marker of their “uncivilized” condition and helped justify their violent removal from grasslands that would nourish the sheep that simultaneously produced fibers and embodied Christian civilization.To convey this suggestion in a more generalized way: agricultural historians need to find ways to narrate histories that acknowledge the contradictions that result from actors who are at once humans and persons.9 New Materialist interpretations of the past that privilege an ecologically formed “human” at the expense of the socially constructed “person” ignore powerful forces in history—religion, ethno-nationalisms, and racism—and are unlikely to inspire collective political action.A historical narrative is a coproduction of author and intended audience: I write for particular people, not things or other-than-human species. As people/humans inhabiting worlds built largely, but not entirely, by the massive exploitation of both material things and humans denied personhood, historians must stay with the troubling contradictions of our tight-knit worlds.",

    "abstract": "In this deeply researched and ambitious book, Neil MacMaster examines the neglected history of peasant resistance to French colonialism in Algeria's Chelif Valley. War in the Mountains upends the scholarly consensus that has attributed a politically inert and reactive character to the Algerian peasantry, illuminating their central role in the struggle for independence. MacMaster dismantles the consensus view across four sections and twenty chapters, giving readers an unprecedented look at the kinship units, political organizations, and shared histories that together shaped peasant resistance in the valley. Here, there was no need for urban revolutionaries to “awaken” the ignorant peasantry; peasant communities in the surrounding Dahra and Ouarsenis mountains had been organizing mutual aid and nationalist propaganda networks for decades prior to the arrival of the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN) in 1956. When the Algerian Revolution finally came, these rural networks formed a base of support without which revolutionary forces could not have prevailed.War in the Mountains exemplifies just how much groundbreaking work can yet be done with colonial state archives. It is a truly social history that examines the critical—but often overlooked—kinship units that structured rural life in the Chelif Valley: the extended household (ayla) and the fraction (bocca), which were assemblies composed of the men in each ayla. By tracing the histories of individual fractions across decades, MacMaster identifies a means with which peasants preserved their communal solidarity and traditional social practices through years of land expropriation and dislocation. In the “native reserves” (communes mixtes) where most peasants lived, fraction patriarchs were often the sole links connecting the rural population to the colonial state. Absentee headmen (caïds) and French agents relied on these fraction leaders for local intelligence, offering access to state resources in exchange for their cooperation. As this system fell into crisis during the Great Depression, fractions and village councils (djemâa) coalesced into what would become a mass resistance movement. The fraction—a precolonial unit of rural social life—thus formed the organizational core through which peasants mobilized for a postcolonial future.The first three parts of the book chart the “terminal decline” of French rule in Algeria and the subsequent rise of the FLN “counter-state” that overtook it (254). Caught in an irreconcilable antagonism between the conservative defenders of the commune mixte system and reformers bent on modernization, the colonial state in Algeria underwent cycles of sputtering reform followed by reactionary backlash and repression. The constricted spaces that these cycles created for peasant political expression were never adequate to legitimize French rule, but they did provide a crucial medium for the introduction of mass electoral politics to the villages of the Chelif. Newly elected village councils operated as counterweights to corrupt French officials, compensating for the absence of colonial state administration with religious and kinship-based mutual aid networks. As revolutionary violence escalated, the survival of communist, Messalist, or Frontiste cells in the region depended on their ability to affect a “juncture” between themselves and the “dormant anti-colonialism of peasant society” expressed in these village councils (480). MacMaster contends that the FLN ultimately prevailed here because it offered a revolutionary program that was most responsive to the values and concerns of the peasantry.The final section of the text reassesses Opération Pilote, an ambitious counterinsurgency plan formulated by the anthropologist Jean Servier. With Pilote, Servier promised an ethnographic “hearts and minds” strategy—built upon political reforms and vast economic development initiatives—that would win over the region's peasant population. Military and civilian leaders soon hailed the operation as a success to be emulated throughout Algeria, but the book reveals stark truths that undermine this sanguine assessment. On the ground in the Dahra and Ouarsenis, the French presence largely continued as one of underadministration punctuated by catastrophic violence. Servier's ethnography also quickly fell out of favor with French officers, replaced by a simplistic program of sloganeering and propaganda derived from the field of behavioral psychology. Moreover, the FLN remained superior to the French in providing basic services and security to the Chelif peasantry. Pilote and its “successes” have been a staple of counterinsurgency literature for decades; MacMaster offers a necessary and overdue corrective to these accounts that dwells on the self-defeating brutality counterinsurgency practitioners unleashed on the very peasants they were supposed to be winning over.By positioning peasants at the center of Algeria's revolutionary struggle, War in the Mountains compels scholars to reconsider the balance of forces driving the country's independence and subsequent state formation. It also establishes a comparative research agenda grounded in an attentiveness to enduring structures of rural life that promises to influence the field for years to come. Accessibly written, albeit dense in its argumentation, this text will make for compelling reading in advanced undergraduate and graduate-level seminars.",

    "abstract": "These are fraught times for supporters in academia of economic development. Prodevelopment folk are viewed by many as being tainted by a number—and perhaps a majority—of the seven deadly sins, and for attempting to worsen one or another “existential” environmental problem. Thanks to luminaries such as Amitav Ghosh and Bill McKibben, they are seen as deluded, if not deranged, and chastised for striving to push the pace, even as the human race “falters.” In days of yore, one could expect some corners of academia—economics departments, engineering schools, programs in the history of technology—to offer robust support to proponents of development, to “have their backs,” as it were. Now, not so much, as the precautionary principle, safety-ism, and belief in Ghosh's “nutmeg's curse” course through academia, trumping the fact that in 2022 around 700 million people—over 9 percent of the world's population—still live in extreme poverty ($1.90 or less a day), with almost half of the world's population as recently as 2015 living on under $5.50 a day in terms of purchasing power parity or PPP, according to the World Bank. This is the bristly backdrop for Humans versus Nature, Daniel R. Headrick's important new book.On the surface, the subject of Headrick's book is a bit surprising. The author is not primarily an environmental historian but a distinguished historian of technology who has written a number of well-regarded studies in the latter vein, particularly pertaining to the early modern and modern periods. But certain changes in the way the history of technology is now being done make Headrick's new focus and argument more understandable. As implied above, until relatively recently, historians of technology, generally speaking, were bullish on invention and innovation. They typically focused on how human ingenuity transformed “nature” and its resources into tools, implements, methods, and processes that advanced humans' material well-being and made possible the more complex and sophisticated sociocultural formations and expressions we used to refer to, however ingenuously, as civilizations. To be sure, many historians of technology over the years, including Headrick, wrote on the deleterious distributional effects one or another technology often had for some humans and some human societies, even as said technology elevated others. However, unlike environmental historians, let alone environmentalist historians, few got exercised over the effects technology had on “nature” or the “natural world.” The title of perhaps the most famous modern history of the Industrial Revolution—The Unbound Prometheus (1969) by David S. Landes—is suggestive in this regard.How things have changed. Today, historians of technology, formerly admirers of innovation, often decry human “tools” and innovations such as large dams, nuclear power reactors, genetically modified organisms, and artificial intelligence. Some, joining up with kindred spirits in environmental history, charge humans with narrow, selfish speciesism, while still others, influenced by Arne Naess and other deep ecologists, are disenamored of the human “footprint” itself. Exaggerating only slightly: humans bad, nature good. Notwithstanding the title of his new book, Headrick is too sophisticated a scholar to fall into that dualistic trap. In his study, he correctly sees humans as part of nature, and ipso facto humans and the rest of the natural world as being connected inextricably, however uneasily and at times adversarially. At least at the margin, though, his present sympathies seem to lie with the “natural world,” whose “agency” in the form of negative “feedback” is increasingly giving ravenous, rapacious humans the comeuppance they have in his view long deserved.Headrick's foray into “big history”—technological, environmental, or otherwise—represents another departure from his earlier scholarship. Whereas his previous work never extended back in time before about 1400 CE, his temporal scope in Humans versus Nature is far greater, extending back almost 2 million years to the appearance in Africa of one hominid species, Homo erectus, from which many believe our own, Homo sapiens, emerged somewhere around three hundred thousand years ago. Headrick handles this immense swath of time with considerable aplomb. One of the many virtues of Humans versus Nature is its author's ability to organize the earth's environmental history over the (really) longue durée into comprehensible units of time and then cogently to describe and analyze the principal developments.As Headrick's title suggests, “interactions between humans and the rest of nature” are central to his study. According to the author, two aspects of these interactions stand out: “One is the human impacts on the rest of nature and how they have changed over time. The other is how nature, in turn, has affected humans and human civilizations, especially the ‘natural disasters’ that have disrupted (and sometimes reversed) the advancing power of nature over the natural world” (4). Well-chosen examples of such interactions—from the Paleolithic to the present—inform Humans versus Nature, which is divided into fifteen chapters, organized chronologically for the most part, along with a concise but effective introduction and a provocative epilogue.Chapters 1 through 3 treat the increasingly contested interpretive terrain regarding the proper classification and valorization of early human subsistence strategies and habitation patterns—that is to say, those associated with hunters and gatherers (“foragers”) and with farmers and herders. From my perspective, it is unfortunate that Headrick for the most part accepts the increasingly ascendant and, more to the point, trendy position elevating hunter-gatherers vis-à-vis farmers and herders, downplaying the positive dimensions and implications of the “Neolithic Revolution.” It is one thing to challenge the linearity of the move to agriculture and animal domestication, and it is also correct to point out the (many) problems occasioned by the shift. It is reasonable, too, to point out some of the dietary and health benefits associated with hunting and gathering and to note what seems to have been foragers' relatively light workloads. It is not acceptable, however, to do so without laying out in full the many problems and limitations associated with foraging communities, and without commenting about their low developmental ceilings. And it is as fatuous as it is unconscionable to refer to agriculture as “the worst mistake in the history of the human race,” as Jared Diamond, one of the champions of hunter-gatherers, infamously did many years ago.1 To his credit, Headrick's support of the new orthodoxy is measured. His balanced assessment in chapter 3 of the emergence and development of complex, hierarchical, agricultural civilizations based on sophisticated water control/irrigation works in various parts of the ancient world—Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, and the Americas—testifies to this point.In chapters 4 and 5 Headrick pushes ahead, homing in on the Eastern Hemisphere and treating the interactions between humans and the environment in Eurasia and Africa between about 1500 BCE and 1400 CE. Obviously, it is difficult to generalize about developments over such a huge area over such a long period of time, but Headrick emphasizes the constant tension between aggressive human populations pushing, seemingly inexorably, to expand both economically and demographically, and an overstretched nature pushing back. Such pushback was sometimes insidious, but sometimes blunt and brutal, as in the cases of the Justinianic plague of the sixth century CE and the so-called Black Death of the fourteenth century CE, which Headrick views as outgrowths and unintended consequences of the expansion and increased connectivity of human communities across Afro-Eurasia.Readers today will be particularly interested in one of the timely topics treated in chapter 5: the so-called medieval climate anomaly. This anomaly, marked by a pattern of significantly warmer temperatures in much of Afro-Eurasia from the eighth to the fourteenth centuries CE, promoted the expansion and growth of human settlements over much of Afro-Eurasia. It was followed, alas, by the dislocations of the so-called Little Ice Age, some of which are interpreted by Headrick as expressions of nature's agency manifested in harvest failures, plague, civil strife, and other forms of negative “feedback.”Headrick shifts his attention to the Western Hemisphere in chapter 6, detailing the monumental and, for Native Americans, cataclysmic consequences of the opening of contacts between Afro-Eurasia and the Americas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, understood by most scholars today in the context of Alfred Crosby's famous term “the Columbian Exchange.”2 So profound were the consequences of this exchange—biological, demographic, economic, cultural, political, and so on—that it is difficult even today to comprehend them fully.More or less the same time period is treated in chapter 7, but the focus is back to the Eastern Hemisphere, which, of course, was deeply affected not only by the Columbian Exchange, but also by shocks—harvest failures, famines, political and social upheavals, and so on—sparked by, or at least associated with the cooler weather prevailing during the “Little Ice Age.” The deleterious effects of cooler weather for humans were most powerful in the early modern period but stretched well into the nineteenth century in some areas. No part of the Eastern Hemisphere was immune to weather-related shocks, disturbances, and dislocations, which reverberated through Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.Humans fought back with a vengeance, as it were, beginning in the eighteenth century with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. For our purposes, this metaphorical revolution can be interpreted as shorthand for the development and/or increased deployment of new energy sources, along with technologies and methods relating to production, organization, capital mobilization, communications, and distribution. Taken together, this led over time to significant and sustained gains in economic output and productivity and to the vast range of changes that have often been subsumed under the rubrics of modernization or development. The changes growing out of this “revolution,” according to Headrick, led to a “sudden increase in the power of humans over nature,” which, however enriching and beneficial to humans, has left nature reeling (6).Headrick devotes chapters 8 and 9 to the key economic and environmental changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution. He focuses in the first of these chapters on two of the centers of the revolution, Great Britain and especially the United States, documenting the economic transformation and massive surge in economic output associated with industrialization as well as its sizable environmental and human costs, which in the United States would include at minimum land and water pollution, deforestation, the “Bison Holocaust,” and the devastation of Native American communities as a result of wars and diseases.In chapter 9, Headrick shifts his attention to the impact of the Industrial Revolution on the periphery—that is, nonindustrializing parts of the world, particularly in Asia. This topic has been the subject of much of Headrick's best work over the course of his career, and his mastery of the material comes through loud and clear. However much the Industrial Revolution transformed economic life in Europe and the United States in the nineteenth century, and in so doing improved living standards in the aggregate, the case was otherwise in much of the nonindustrializing world in the nineteenth century. The latter area, confronted with increasingly profound power asymmetries vis-à-vis the industrializing world, were routinely rendered into economic and political dependencies of the industrializing powers, and typically reduced to supplying raw materials and plantation commodities to Europe and the United States in exchange for manufactured goods and commercial/financial services. This reorientation wreaked environmental havoc on the nonindustrial world, including deforestation, the rise of monocultures and the loss of biodiversity, epidemics, and the intensification of droughts and flooding (particularly in the aftermath of El Niño–inspired weather events) because of ill-conceived or poorly executed irrigation projects.Headrick carries the story forward in chapters 10 and 11, detailing how industrialization, economic growth, population increase, wars, and mass consumption affected the environment all over the world in the twentieth century, straining the earth's carrying capacity, depleting and despoiling resources of all kinds, and spurring worrisome changes in climate, most notably greater weather variability and rising temperatures. So powerful were the environmental effects associated with industrialization, development, and the triumph worldwide of what might be called the ideology of developmentalism that many environmental writers argue that we have now entered a new geological age often referred to as the Anthropocene, highlighting the powerful role of humans in shaping and, in the eyes of most of these writers, ravaging the environment.In the last four chapters of Humans versus Nature Headrick discusses both the most salient environmental problems associated with humans' seemingly unceasing quest over the past two or three centuries for more development and the human responses these problems evoked. Here he must, of course, be selective in his coverage, but he wisely devotes space to issues relating to climate change in chapter 12, resource depletion (focusing on sea life) in chapter 13, the ominous threat of wholesale extinction of terrestrial species—what some refer to as the “Sixth Mass Extinction”—in chapter 14, and the rise of environmentalism across the globe in chapter 15. Headrick closes with a short, illuminating epilogue wherein he lays out several possible scenarios regarding what the future will hold for the increasingly fraught relationship between humans and nature, ending somberly by forewarning that “whatever happens, people may look back upon our age with envy” (473).Before raising a few caveats about Humans versus Nature, let me state for the record that I agree wholeheartedly with the overall assessment of the eminent environmental historian J. R. McNeill, who, in a back-cover blurb, calls Headrick's book “the most comprehensive environmental history in existence.” Moreover, I would add that Humans versus Nature is not only comprehensive, but also exceptionally well structured, up-to-date regarding scholarship, clearly written, and, as stated earlier, generally measured and balanced in its interpretations. In other words, the book should be considered a resounding success.This said—and said in all sincerity—I have questions regarding Headrick's rather blinkered depiction of humans and what I view as his overly critical view of their behavior toward nature over time. He is particularly critical of what he calls “our Paleolithic minds”—that is, of our will to dominate nature. But what is so wrong with attempting to shape and exercise control over nature, even of attempting to gain mastery over it? Where would we be had we settled for low-level equilibrium (“harmony”) with it? Why not try to set the terms?Humans' interest in “improving” nature and mobilizing it for our advantage goes way back. In both the Bible and the epic of Gilgamesh, for example, humans are charged with establishing dominion over the natural world. Indeed, one can argue that the process first began to take off well before then, when one of Homo sapiens' most creative predecessors, Homo erectus, began making systematic use of fire. It has been a long slog for humans ever since, but we have finally reached a position where larger and larger proportions of the human population are flourishing in a material sense, due to our ability to shape the environment in ways that enhance human welfare.Although Headrick and many of his scholarly confreres are distressed over what they view as an unhealthy and unsustainable relationship between humans and nature, humans, as a result of the Industrial Revolution and “developmentalism,” are by many measures now living in the wealthiest and healthiest age in our entire history, as Matt Ridley, Stephen Pinker, Hans Rosling, and Deirdre McCloskey, among others, have pointed out. And there is a lot of room for improvement in the human condition: I started this essay with some figures on global poverty. World income per capita in 2020, despite significant gains in recent decades, was still only about US$10,520 in constant (2010 dollar) terms—albeit somewhat higher in terms of PPP. So plenty of people could use more development.OK, but what about the relationship going forward between development and the environment? Some see demand for “environment”—that is, environmental services—as a superior good, rising more than proportionally vis-à-vis income, while others view it as a normal good. In either case we can expect demand for “environment” to increase. Per the so-called environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), as development makes individuals and countries richer, after a certain point they value environment more and more—and are increasingly willing to pay for it—which, ironically, renders environmental amelioration dependent at least in part on development.Certainly, we face a litany of serious environmental problems, but none of them is likely “existential,” not even climate change. Despite all the chatter about the depletion of this and the danger of that, one thing we are not short of is human ingenuity. Economist Julian L. Simon famously treated this matter long ago, focusing on what he called the “ultimate resource”: human imagination coupled with the human spirit.4 Headrick, almost in spite of himself, acknowledges this in Humans versus Nature, which is peppered with references to humans' flexibility, adaptability, creativity, drive, and so on. These are the features that got us where we are today—whether in a predicament or in what I see as an advantageous situation. If the past is any indication, we will likely not merely survive but thrive. If someone had asked experts in 1900, when world population was about 2 billion, if it would someday be possible for humans to produce sufficient food to feed 8 billion people—which number we are expected to reach as early as 2023—those experts would likely have considered the questioner daft. But we now produce sufficient food to feed 8 billion with a comfortable surplus left over. Development and developmentalism made that possible.In my view, some combination of R&D-induced reductions in the cost and improvements in the reliability of sustainable energy, innovations in carbon capture, and improvements in nuclear power technology—perhaps with some geoengineering wizardry thrown in—will get us through our climate problems. After all, flexible, adaptable, ingenious humans have weathered massive climate changes before. And what if I'm wrong (which I doubt) and groups such as Extinction Rebellion are right? Well, the earth survived the extinction of the dodo, last seen on the island of Mauritius in the late seventeenth century, and it will likely survive the eventual end of human life on Earth too. After all, as Headrick points out, “99.9 percent of all the species of living beings that ever inhabited the Earth have become extinct, making this a natural process” (403). That's where Elon Musk comes in. On to Mars—in a figurative sense at least!",

    "abstract": "This new book by historian Christiane Berth takes a fresh look at the Nicaraguan Revolution (1979–90) through the lens of food culture and policy. Her study makes a welcome contribution to the existing literature on revolutionary food policy by shedding light on food security matters over the several decades leading up to the revolution and during the revolution itself, explaining how these were consequential for the ultimate success of the revolutionary project. The novelty of Berth's approach is twofold: on the one hand, she broadens the analysis of (pre)revolutionary food politics to include international relief agencies, and, on the other hand, she places Nicaraguan consumers at the center of her analysis.The main premise of the book is that “insufficient access to food contributed to the rise and demise of the Nicaraguan Revolution” (5). Berth develops this thesis over six chronological chapters, followed by a seventh chapter that explores the unique food history of the Caribbean Coast and an epilogue that provides a look at more recent developments in the area of food policy. The first few chapters focus on early efforts by Central American development organizations to document malnutrition and hunger in Nicaragua in the 1950s and 1960s and the failure of the Somoza government to meaningfully respond to growing food insecurity, which ultimately helped to boost opposition to the regime. Access to food became a significant issue in the 1970s, particularly for low-income Nicaraguans, due to a number of factors, including waning Alliance for Progress food aid, low harvests resulting in dependence on expensive food imports, increasing urbanization, and the government's mismanagement of international aid funds following the 1972 earthquake that destroyed much of Managua. Against this backdrop, local food cultures were shifting as middle- and upper-income Nicaraguans increasingly preferred locally produced processed and fast foods and imported luxury foods. Influenced by discourses on US imperialism, revolutionaries rejected the growing influence of Americanized food cultures in favor of personal austerity in solidarity with low-income communities.Upon the success of the revolution in 1979, the revolutionary government, led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), prioritized food security as a critical component of the revolutionary project. Through an innovative package of policy reforms and public programs, the FSLN government sought to eliminate hunger and malnutrition by promoting self-sufficiency and traditional Nicaraguan foods. International cooperation and relief agencies worked with the government and local actors to realize these goals. However, as Berth argues, these measures ultimately underestimated the food preferences and demands of a diverse national constituency that included urban and rural consumers as well as the unique food cultures of Caribbean Coast communities.By the mid-1980s, Nicaragua found itself in a crippling economic crisis, leading to food scarcity and, in response, the increasing importation of food that weakened the revolution's goal of food self-sufficiency. Despite attempts by the revolutionary government to galvanize support for the revolutionary food project, these efforts were derailed by disproportionate access to food across geographic regions and social groups. As Berth notes, “Nicaraguan consumers' dissatisfaction over food insecurity turned into overall disillusionment with the revolutionary project in 1988” (145). With the success of opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro in the 1990 presidential election came the end of the revolution and the beginning of neoliberalism. However, Berth asserts that the period of transition to the new government was one of continuity and not a sharp break, given the FSLN's adoption of austerity policies beginning in 1986 to stabilize the economy. Furthermore, she argues that hunger and malnutrition had been growing during the later years of the revolution and continued to do so into the early 1990s. In this context, Nicaragua remained dependent on food aid while elites promoted US models of consumption, and imported goods once again became popular.A key strength of Berth's analysis is that it provides a comprehensive historical portrait of change (and continuity) in the national food regime as well as a nuanced understanding of the roles of international aid and relief agencies and their interactions with the government and local actors. Furthermore, the chapter on the Caribbean Coast is an appreciated addition because, as Berth points out, it is often overlooked in studies on food policy in Nicaragua. That said, readers may find the structure of the book curious. While the epilogue on more contemporary debates over food security and sovereignty is timely, the book lacks a concluding chapter to pull together the various strands of inquiry examined in the book. This does not diminish the important contribution of this book in terms of its scope of inquiry, however, and the epilogue in fact opens the door for future scholarship that examines, for example, the ways in which history may in fact be repeating itself in Nicaragua.",

Recent historiography of wheat during the Cold War has focused on telling how the United States turned to wheat exports in the “developing world” as a tool and weapon to achieve US hegemony and negate the influence of the Soviet Union. This article argues that the Pacific Northwest wheat industry's relationship with wheat consumers and importers in Japan shifts the Cold War wheat narrative away from staples like bread to confectionary products made with soft white flour. Japanese buyers and consumers purchased soft white wheat not to feed the hungry but instead to serve a growing market for cakes and other confectionary products. This relationship helps understand the current wheat market in the Pacific Northwest, where soft white wheat exports dominate.",

    "abstract": "Almost two decades ago, John R. McNeill pointed out that American environmental historians had not recognized “the prominence of the military in American life since 1941, and its significance in shaping American environments.”1 The following year, Richard P. Tucker and Edmund Russell produced Natural Enemy, Natural Ally: Toward an Environmental History of War (2004), an edited volume on the global environmental dimensions of war from sixteenth-century India, through the American Civil War, culminating with several chapters on the world wars. That collection opened the door for other works, including three edited volumes on the global environmental effects of war: War and the Environment: Military Destruction in the Modern Age (2009), edited by Charles E. Closmann; The Long Shadows: A Global Environmental History of the Second World War (2017), edited by Simo Laakkonen, Richard P. Tucker, and Timo Vuorisalo; and Environmental Histories of the First World War (2018), edited by Richard P. Tucker, Tait Keller, J.R. McNeill, and Martin Schmid. These works, along with a growing number of other historical works published in the last decade, constitute the robust beginnings of military-environmental history, a field that investigates the historical reciprocal interactions between nature and violent conflict.Nature at War: American Environments and World War II is the first military-environmental history to explore the effects of the world wars on specifically American ecologies and landscapes, “where slices of nature were extracted and processed into military machines and materiel,” illustrating the environmental interconnectedness between the home front and the battlefront (3). Scholars of twentieth-century warfare are familiar with the idea of total war—the complete mobilization of all natural, industrial, and human resources for the war effort—and the preponderance of economic and political histories on it. The fourteen contributors to this volume trace the consequences of total war on American environments and landscapes and in American minds and bodies. They remind us of the environmental origins of the military-industrial complex—how it shaped the built environment, material culture, and intellectual geography as well as the American landscapes of today.World War II was a war of superlatives: the largest seaborne invasion at Normandy, the most petroleum products used, the most food distributed and consumed, the most weaponry and ammunition deployed. All signaled the decisiveness of American production. That production had its origins somewhere, notably the soils, mines, and factories of the United States and its global extractive reach for things like rubber for tires and bauxite for aluminum. As the United States became an “arsenal of democracy” with a proliferation of military training camps across southern and western states, national rationing decisions had dramatic local consequences for farmers, and the Allied destruction of cities abroad held consequences for environmental and human health at home easily overlooked in a global war. Indeed, this was a war to win at any cost, including the sacrifice of landscapes and ecologies. Those consequences of total war—whether in terms of barren strip mining created by resource extraction to build tanks (contributor Kent Curtis), acres of soybean farms plowed under to make way for newly constructed aviation factories (Thomas Robertson and Christopher W. Wells), or military base construction and expansion of oil refining along the Gulf Coast that led to the growth of large metropolitan areas in sensitive biomes (Christopher M. Rein)—remade the American landscape and resulted in the birth of the Superfund site.Nature at War is organized into six parts illustrating themes related to (1) land acquisition, (2) ore extraction and petroleum, (3) agriculture and food production, (4) the creation of a military-industrial geography, (5) chemical and atomic revolutions, and (6) the resultant awareness of the earth's fragility that came out of such a global conflagration. Of particular interest to readers of Agricultural History will be part 3, which makes it clear that American power rested on natural resources. Kendra Smith-Howard's chapter explores the changes to agriculture resulting from the war. While in the short term all efforts were on increasing production, the more pronounced long-term effects included increased mechanization, chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and antibiotics for livestock. Kellen Backer focuses on the fruits of that agricultural revolution, the food. The United States produced enough food to feed itself and its allies. Victory gardens, tackling food waste, and promoting canning helped more Americans learn about local agriculture. In the postwar decades, this food system also became more industrialized as canned, frozen, and dehydrated foods made their way onto grocers' shelves. Joel R. Bius's work on the cigarette recounts how tobacco production, once curbed under New Deal soil conservation programs, increased during the war to satisfy the cravings of soldiers and workers. However, war production had its limits, as the lessons of soil conservation made farmers and policy-makers resistant to increase beyond a certain point. Nevertheless, human health suffered because of government distribution of tobacco to military personnel that would destroy the human environment for generations.The editors and contributors to this volume have produced an exceptional work of military-environmental history that offers powerful environmental perspectives to the study of World War II and helps us consider that nature is always present in production and war, no matter how far removed it may seem from industrialized factories or cutting-edge battlefield technologies. Although several contributors include discussions of natural resource acquisition from European colonies and independent states, the American empire—territories in the Pacific and Caribbean that were (and in some cases still are) part of the United States—was notably absent. Nature at War makes it clear that the environmental changes brought about by the war irrevocably remade the world we live in today with dependency on fossil fuels, cheap processed food, vast transportation networks, synthetic fertilizers, industrial food systems, and a growing list of multigenerational health crises and polluted sites dating from World War II and its legacies.",

    "abstract": "German industrialization has been the subject of heated debates among historians. During the so-called Sonderweg debate in the 1980s—which scrutinized the long-term structural developments that enabled the rise of National Socialism and attempted to explain the peculiar German path into modernity—the patterns of German industrialization and its entanglements with politics and culture ranked high on the agenda of historians. Attention to the topic has recently faded as German historiography, in the pointed words of Paul Nolte, said “farewell to the nineteenth century.” Yet economic and social historians continued to compile new econometric evidence, researched regional patterns of development, and questioned some of the assumptions that earlier historiography had taken for granted.This book encapsulates this historiographical trajectory. It provides a synthesis between two elements. One consists of a book that Richard H. Tilly published in German in 1990, Vom Zollverein zum Industriestaat; the other element presents new research tracing the roots of German industrialization back to the eighteenth century and offering new evidence on its regionally diverse evolution in the nineteenth century. Tilly's coauthor, Michael Kopsidis, is among those historians who have decisively contributed to this new perspective. The result of this synthesis is a concise, yet highly differentiated and insightful narrative of the making of the German industrial economy that connects industrialization to agriculture, state formation, the emergence of a modernizing bureaucracy, public and social policy, scientific knowledge and technology, migration and demography, and the change in financial institutions.Compared to other accounts that stress the suddenness of Germany's breakthrough to industrialization, Tilly and Kopsidis emphasize a drawn-out transition that proceeded gradually. They begin by examining the interplay between demographic change, agricultural reform, protoindustrialization, and institutional change in the eighteenth century. The spread of rural industries and protoindustrial structures contributed to a partial integration of the German economy into the flourishing Atlantic economy, yet regional differences remained important. Indeed, German industrialization was essentially an insular phenomenon. The state and a reform-minded bureaucracy played an important role, Prussia being the most striking example of a reform from above, creating a capable yet authoritarian modernizing bureaucracy that promoted a rapid transition to the market economy as a response to the challenges of the French Revolution and Napoleonic hegemony.Part 2 offers an account of early German industrialization covering the period from the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to the Revolution of 1848. Tilly and Kopsidis emphasize the role of the Zollverein, the German customs union established in 1834, as a crucial institutional precondition for integrating and widening markets. Moreover, state-supported investment in transport systems contributed to the development of closer interconnections between different regions and sectors of the economy and foreshadowed the importance of railroads as a driving force of industrialization. Out of the crises of the 1840s emerged two changes with far-reaching consequences for German industrialization: the political economy of public finance altered decisively; and the revolution, despite its ultimate failure, pushed the nonaristocratic bourgeoisie into the ruling center of power at the cost of blocking democratization.The interdependencies of steam power technology; railroads; the iron, steel, and machine industries; and coal mining had important effects on the overall economy in the 1850s and 1860s, pulling a growing share of agricultural and artisanal producers into capitalist markets and commercializing economic relationships. These developments were not without tensions. Farm families lost their subsistence and the gathering of craftsmen in centralized workshops promoted class consciousness, while economic and social inequality visibly increased.Part 4 discusses Germany's emergence as an industrial power from 1871 to 1914. This period was shaped by a more self-conscious and interventionist economic policy of the Kaiserreich; the formation of “organized capitalism” in the form of business associations, cartels, and unions; the rise of large-scale industrial businesses especially in the chemistry and electrotechnical sectors where the interplay between science and industrial production was most intense; the emergence of a new financial and monetary system with massive concentration processes in the banking sector; the rapid urbanization of the population; and a growing yet conflict-prone integration of the German economy into the world economy.In sum, Tilly and Kopsidis offer a rich and fascinating economic history of German industrialization that is, in their words, a combination of “economic history with a bit of social history” (vii). Indeed, some readers might wish to have more than just a “bit” of social history in such a narrative. The experiences, interpretations, and suffering of those who went through these fundamental changes are pushed out of sight due to an approach that favors econometric evidence, the mathematic charm of tables and graphs, and an abstract language borrowed from economic theory. One wonders, for instance, what family relationships and the gendered division of work looked like in the protoindustrial family economies of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. How did Polish and Russian seasonal laborers experience their integration into the East Elbian estate farms in the late nineteenth century? And what meaning did artisans and craftsmen give to the forces of industrial capitalism that threatened their economic existence and their way of life? Despite all its differentiated and judicious arguments on the structural development of German industrialization, the book remains strangely silent on questions like these. These reservations aside, Tilly's and Kopsidis's book is without doubt an important contribution to the history of German industrialization in the long nineteenth century.",

    "abstract": "Kevin Waite's new book is broad in geographical and chronological scope, extending from Washington, DC, across the continent to San Francisco and from the early 1840s through Reconstruction to twentieth-century memory of the Civil War. It is also broad in ambition, seeking to integrate original research with new literatures on empire and the Civil War–era West to create a new understanding of the South during the Civil War era. Far from viewing the South as a traditional, inward-looking society trying to protect old ways, Waite portrays an energetic, outward-looking society looking to create a new transcontinental empire.The book is divided into three generally chronological and topical sections. The first starts with examining the desire of southern leaders to expand to the Pacific coast both to gain more land for agriculture and to acquire California's deepwater Pacific ports vital for new markets in China. The development of a transcontinental railroad was central to this vision, with Waite commenting on the eventual irony that the “railroad, a great national project designed to bind together the American East and West, had triggered a rupture between North and South” (39). There is also a chapter on what Waite calls “the lesser slavery road,” how southerners secured a large federal subsidy for the nation's overland mail route and Jefferson Davis's plans for a camel corps to tame the West. Waite nicely shows how slave owners embraced broad construction of the Constitution and called for a massive mobilization of state power to aid their dreams of a continental empire.The second section focuses on the “southernization” of the West. Though a minority of the population, southerners dominated western states and territories through a combination of effective local politics, patronage from national Democrats, and anti-Black and anti-Chinese racism. Waite ably shows how “the view from the Desert South also throws new light on the so-called Slave Power, illuminating how it operated thousands of miles from the nation's capital” (125). In western states and territories the racism was intertwined with various forms of unfree labor, ranging from slavery to coolie labor to debt peonage. The southernization of the West meant that during the secession crisis in 1861 “as federal authority deteriorated across the continent, the Southwest had become a vast borderland of conflicting loyalties,” with some even fearing a military coup or the West splitting from the United States (176).The last section explores the fate of a southernized West in the Civil War, Reconstruction, and memory. Confederate sympathizers in California tried to cause problems, though Waite acknowledges that they never came close to overthrowing the US government, and a Confederate force of 2,500 soldiers tried to capture parts of the Southwest. Still, Waite is probably too enthusiastic when declaring in the epilogue that “Confederate grand strategy evolved from slaveholders' antebellum ambitions” (245). He is more measured analyzing how Reconstruction in the West greatly paralleled and to a lesser extent affected Reconstruction in the East. The few pages on Confederate monuments and memory in the West, including the Jefferson Davis Highway, are a nice coda to the book.Waite's book provides new ways to understand the antebellum South, the Confederacy, and the Civil War–era West by putting all three into conversation with each other. The southern interest and energetic pursuit of a continental empire using national power make the idea of an “old South” even more quaint than the last generation of scholarship has shown. Along the way, Waite gives insights into the thinking of southern leaders and tells some good stories. I have already used some material, including Davis's camel corps, from his book in my classes.",

    "abstract": "English local history has thrived on exploring the deep connections of people and land over time. This memorial volume for David Hey gives tribute to a dedicated and highly regarded practitioner of local history. It serves as a testament to the many ways land and people can be studied, as well as to Hey's influence on our knowledge of his native region (acknowledged by all the contributors) and the broader field of local history.Histories of People and Landscape provides a multifaceted look at a region in England's north, historically characterized by aristocratic deer parks, common wood-pasture farming, and extractive industry. A brief preface by the editor and a personal tribute by Charles Phythian-Adams, Hey's longtime friend and a leading figure in English local history, open the volume. The ten research articles in the collection explore people and places of this region across a broad expanse of time. About half of the contributions concentrate on the early modern period, Hey's main focus. Others range more widely, examining Sheffield and its region from the time of the Domesday Book up through the twentieth century.Changing land usage is a theme of several chapters. Melvyn Jones's close study of medieval deer parks utilizes both landscape and documentary evidence to show the powerful imprint of aristocratic values on the land, as well as the ways deer parks evolved to incorporate a variety of uses beyond hunting. Ian Rotherham's piece studies the landscape to chart its history from the eleventh century until today. Using an interdisciplinary approach combining methods from ecology, archaeology, and history, he uncovers “shadow landscapes,” evidence of a changing countryside that reveals a story of the past that can act as a guide for present-day land policy. How people responded to government alteration of land use by law and policy features in John Beckett's chapter on opposition to parliamentary enclosure of agricultural manors in the eighteenth century and Nicola Verdon's piece on the food production campaign (bringing more acreage under tillage) in World War I. It comes as little surprise that those working and living on the land did not always appreciate the government's policies, in either era.The close relationship of agriculture and industry in this region is another important theme. Long known for its knives, the Sheffield area was a key early center for English steel production, as Dorian Gerhold's careful reconstruction of the region's industry shows. Studies of individual families—Peter Edwards's on the noble Cavendish family and Alan Crosby's on the yeoman Bagshaws—demonstrate that both elite and common landholders diversified their agricultural interests into mining and other activities to enhance their bottom lines. Richard Hoyle's insightful chapter on early modern Sheffield's cutlers and the earls of Shrewsbury analyzes the complex relationship between the tradesmen of the town, struggling to govern themselves and their trade, and the great noble lords of the manor who wished to control them.As with many collections of this sort, the contributions vary in scope and impact, and the volume as a whole lacks a strong analytical theme. Nevertheless, it provides a richly detailed picture of one unique region, its land and people, farms and industries, jurisdictions and place-names. It demonstrates that deep study of a particular place reveals patterns and nuances often missed in more general studies. Histories of People and Landscape, like the scholar it memorializes, champions the value of both local history as a scholarly endeavor and the region that it illuminates.",

    "abstract": "This provocative and original volume enriches the scholarship on the post–Civil War United States as a nation and empire. It avers that conservative and pragmatic arguments reoriented antislavery in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Originating in Britain, this transformation spread to the United States after its grinding Civil War and legal abolition of slavery. There, despite occasional dissent, postbellum currents saw antislavery marshaled behind anti-immigrant, patriarchal, and imperial policies. The volume is wide-ranging, surveying Anglo-American commentary on unfree labor in places such as Hawaii, Nigeria, the Ottoman Empire, and South Africa.The volume delivers a complex portrait of ideological change in the United States. The struggle over southern slavery, it holds, narrowed domestic understandings of unfree labor to the chattel form present there. Transatlantic polemics about the institution, moreover, left enduring intellectual legacies, including antislavery strategies of foregrounding ideal victims and firsthand accounts. From Appomattox to the early twentieth century, Americans carried this baggage as they encountered, in person and in print, diverse forms of unfree labor around the globe. As a result, Americans, while they generally shared a faith in their nation's antislavery credentials, mulled over and debated what constituted slavery, sometimes with policy at stake. They often invoked slavery, for example, in criticisms of other empires' labor regimes, outrage over urban prostitution (decried as “white slavery”), and warnings about allegedly unfree immigrants. Yet Americans at other times tamped down such rhetoric, especially with Jim Crow practices. Antislavery infused and helped justify American imperialism, which some claimed would free victims of local exploitation, but also anti-imperial arguments that pointed to an impending flood of unfree Asian contract laborers arriving from annexed territories. Here, despite American conceits, the United States ended up being like its European peers, whose antislavery often veiled metropolitan complicity in labor oppression. The Belgian Congo, which itself elicited American responses, was paradigmatic in seeing the empire proclaim antislavery principles only to terrorize local populations. Social Darwinists, eugenicists, progressives, and others spoke out on these topics, with many directing antislavery toward controlling laborers, colonized peoples, and women. Onlookers frequently blamed victims, whether in terms of culture, race, religion, or gender, for their predicaments. Antislavery might generate outcry over white Circassian women held by allegedly lustful Turks, but, more concretely, sustained campaigns to regulate women's behavior in urban America and exclude Asian contract laborers. A similar movement, the author notes, took place in South Africa. More critical perspectives, often attuned to antislavery's emancipatory potential, came from individuals such as Frederick Douglass, Jane Addams, and the exploited themselves.Comprising an introduction, six chapters, and a conclusion, the volume moves thematically through its subject. Featured places, developments, and authors are wide-ranging and often reappear across multiple chapters. The introduction outlines the book's scope and purpose while providing helpful context. The first chapter focuses on antebellum carryovers—including racial beliefs, proslavery charges of antislavery cynicism, and an abolitionist iconography featuring whips, chains, and dogs—that shaped postbellum perceptions and rhetoric. Chapter 2 surveys the global influences on postbellum American thinking, with the British looming large for pioneering an antislavery nationalism and imperialism while tolerating and relying on unfree forms of labor. Chapters 3 and 4 examine the othering of slaveholders and slaves, which Americans presented as both outside of and antithetical to their own progressive and pure nation. Often this was done through racial or religious categories, sometimes both. The fifth chapter focuses on gendered commentaries on oppressed women. Women were at once ideal victims in the popular imagination, active campaigners against exploitation, and yet often rhetorically denied agency in their own struggles, especially if not white. The final chapter explores how the oppressed resisted their conditions and challenged the conservative and pragmatic form of antislavery with more radical variants. The conclusion succinctly reviews the volume and gestures toward its contemporary relevance.An ambitious volume, American Slavery, American Imperialism nonetheless leaves room for rival interpretations. Murky is the exact chronology of conservatism and pragmatism's ascendancy within American antislavery. The pivotal post-abolition decade ending in 1875 receives relatively little attention but saw a host of haphazard American campaigns to spread freedom abroad as well as federal and state efforts to control laborers. Did Americans, then, need the British example to end up where they were by the turn of the century? Also, while it is plausible that the struggle over southern slavery rendered a narrow domestic conceptualization of unfree labor, the volume does not prove the point. Grounds for skepticism include long-running metaphorical uses of the term slavery, including to describe political subjection, and antebellum interest in serfdom, industrialization, captivity narratives, concubinage, and polygamy. Finally, it is often difficult to determine from the volume how cohesive American discussions were and whether the selected authors influenced each other, broader discourse, or policy making. How often did postbellum Americans draw their own connections across space to make broader points about unfree labor? This work points the way to picking up such issues, and as scholars do so they will be in its debt.",

    "abstract": "A relative “newcomer” to a region of the Southwest where Latino families had farmed for over one hundred fifty years, David Stiller grew fascinated with the dualities that he observed in the San Luis Valley, carved at high altitude from the headwaters of the Rio Grande. Having studied earth science at several institutions, and as a hydrologist by profession, Stiller marveled that “water was diverted from the river as much by habit as by immediate need” (xi). He set himself the task in this fourteen-chapter study “to wonder how the valley's water habits came into being” (xii).The story of water in Colorado has been told at great length, from its laws to its irrigation practices to its dryland farming successes and failures. The author reviews the basic features of these works, in particular the Colorado Doctrine of “beneficial use” and its outcomes for agricultural sustainability. Stiller also has an eye for geological detail, describing the uniqueness of the eight-thousand-feet-high San Luis Valley as a function of four stages of growth and change.These included the expansion of irrigation canals in the late nineteenth century (little is made of the customers of this crop production: the silver mines of the Rockies and the coal camps of southern Colorado and northern New Mexico). The “closed basin” phenomenon of the valley led to a rise in its water table in the early twentieth century, a condition that allowed farmers to engage in “subirrigation” instead of increasing the flow of their ditches (this at great expense then as well as now.)After a century of growth and development along Colorado's Front Range, where San Luis Valley farmers supplied potatoes, hay, and alfalfa in large quantities, the more astute irrigators realized that they could drill groundwater wells to augment their farming practices. This left holders of senior water rights facing reductions in their direct flows from the valley's streams. Persistent drought in the first two decades of the twenty-first century only exacerbated these tensions. A solution appeared with the organization of “groundwater subdistricts,” where farmers charged themselves for overuse of the aquifer, and planned more wisely for the rotation of crops for market.Where the author might contribute to knowledge about the San Luis Valley is the place of Latino farmers in its long history of irrigation. There is no population or financial data on Anglo versus Hispano, even though the author accepts the conventional wisdom that the former had advantages that the latter did not enjoy. This appears in such references as “Spanish farmers” having a more collaborative worldview than what the author calls “Euro-American” farmers, not explaining how the former preferred to celebrate their roots in Europe instead of Mexico, Latin America, or even the Southwest (32).Stiller also wrote before the appearance of evidence that Native slavery was common among Latino farmers of the Valley. Nor does the author note that the first families from northern New Mexico entered the San Luis Valley under the protection of the US Army, who were charged with removal of Native hunters who had traversed the valley for centuries.This belief in the hardiness of Latino pioneers also can complicate the author's explanation of the Front Range water market, and its investors who wished to transfer Rio Grande flows to Denver and its environs in much the same fashion as diversion projects like the Colorado–Big Thompson, the Frying Pan–Arkansas, the multiple water projects of Denver Water Company, or the sale in the late twentieth century of Arkansas River ditch-company water rights to Colorado Springs, Thornton, and Aurora.For those who are interested in how such a small source of water (the San Luis Valley holds less than 1 percent of all of Colorado's stream flows) could attract so much attention from scholars, scientists, and visitors alike, David Stiller's work is a good start. Another generation that is curious about the complexities of culture and water will benefit from the author's bibliography, and his inference that the timelessness of the valley may not be what we think.",

Confronted with a situation that was well outside of their control, they sent thousands of letters to government officials, asking for, and sometimes demanding, answers. Many of those letters expressed puzzlement, anger, and disappointment as writers tried to explain how the hopes and dreams of a lifetime had slipped through their grasp. They expressed deep frustration with politicians, consumers, and even other farmers who did not understand or sympathize with the stresses imposed by markets, environmental forces, and government policy that first encouraged borrowing and expansion, and then punished those who had followed that advice. Although the Reagan administration eventually responded, it was not before a significant number of farmers had left, or been removed from, their land.",

    "abstract": "This book explores the material forms, economies, ecologies, and cultural histories of orchards in an interconnected way that will be of interest to a wide range of academics and general readers. The scope is broad, taking a comprehensive and critical view of the place of orchards in the English landscape as a whole and their place in the national context of developments in horticulture, agriculture, landscape architecture, and community planning. The book situates these larger movements in detailed examinations of specific orchards in towns, villages, and individual estates. In both respects, the book is exemplary, providing a social and humanistic study of orchards that has been lacking until now, despite broad popular interest in the subject.The book presents a wealth of information on the specific local circumstances of orchard management in eastern England. For the local historian, the book serves as a blueprint for how one might conduct further investigations, providing examples of different research methods, resources, and honest accountings of the questions yet to be addressed. The authors use historical and modern maps, archival and documentary sources, and ground-truthing evidence collected by volunteers through the “Orchards East” project.The authors apologetically explain the limitations of each of these sources in assessing changes in landscape over time, acknowledging “the impression of accuracy that obscures . . . the uncertain character of much of the data,” as well as the difficulties of defining an “orchard” in the first place (167). But this apology highlights for the reader the authors' achievement in bringing all these resources into useful conversation with each other. They have not only greatly increased the knowledge of the material realities of orchard landscapes over time, but have also introduced a new intellectual critique of the limits of knowledge, deepening our intellectual questions about what we think we can know, and thus how we can orient conversations about local landscape identity, conservation, and preservation.Another audience who will benefit from this book is the growing national and international community of people interested in the history of orchards and cider. While the eastern counties of England were not oriented toward the cider industry in the same way as the West Country, the growing enthusiasm for orchard preservation has coincided with a revival in the cider industry both in England and abroad. The authors are in conversation with the orchard conservation movement, and the rigor of their investigation into local data allows them to explore the impact the conservation of orchards, spearheaded by community groups and enshrined in agricultural, environmental, and planning policy, can really have on local landscapes.The authors' critical inquiry into the meaning of tradition and the efficacy of environmental conservation in the contexts of orchards is perhaps their greatest contribution to academic and public discourse on the topic. While the authors are supportive of the positive effect that romantic enthusiasm has had on the effort to conserve orchards and sustain local ecologies and landscapes in the face of industrialization and suburbanization, they do a great service by gently prying open the popular assumptions and myths attributed to orchards. Romanticism, myth, and sentimentality are not only vital threads of our personal and social attachment to orchards—and thus our conceptions of cultural heritage—but are woven into the ecological and environmental arguments for conservation policy. The authors ask the reader to think more critically about the way conservation is conceptualized and deployed in specific policies and to weigh whether policies are delivering outcomes that serve the greater good. In an era where discussion of conservation is quickly polarized, this nuanced approach opens up a trove of new creative orientations on the subject.Though often discussed in terms of tradition when targeted for conservation, orchards have specific histories related to the expansion of industry and transportation. The authors argue that “landscapes in which orchards formed a key element—ones that owed much of their distinctive ‘character’ to fruit production—were, for the most part, a nineteenth- and twentieth-century development.” The authors ask, “Given that landscapes have primarily been shaped by practical considerations—by agriculture and industry—and are constantly changing, how do we decide which of their constituent elements are worthy of protection?” (238).Growing out of a publicly funded project, relying on data-gathering and knowledge production by community members, and in conversation with sectors involved in the creation and application of public policy and preservation, this book is remarkably democratic in its construction of a knowledge community. While not every chapter will interest every reader in focus or detail, it is written in an accessible style that invites this diverse knowledge community into a rich and detailed conversation about the subject matter while elevating the intellectual pitch of that conversation to productive new levels. This book dives into the specific density of its topic with such rigor that, rather than closing the subject to future investigation, its intellectual framework opens up the possibility of new works on orchards everywhere and suggests new questions to investigate in light of the wealth of data presented about eastern England.",

    "abstract": "While many scholars have documented attempts at urban housing segregation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, historian Elizabeth Herbin-Triant reveals how, in North Carolina, ideologies regarding housing segregation in cities also influenced the southern countryside. White demands to control where African Americans lived grew more fevered as Black families grew in economic power. Concerned about continued loss of property and economic standing, middling whites in particular tried various methods to control and suppress Black property acquisition in urban and rural areas.Herbin-Triant starts her history by explaining how North Carolina's geography and large population of independent, yeomen farmers meant that a significant segment of white farmers embraced a vision of self-sufficiency, democratic engagement, and individualism. These small white farmers acutely felt competition for property from increasingly successful Black farmers. At the turn of the twentieth century, Black farm ownership was expanding and white land ownership was diminishing, a fact that many whites attributed to African Americans' willingness to accept “lower standards of living” (37). Migration to urban areas, too, produced racial tensions. In cities such as Winston, middling whites grew alarmed by growing numbers of Black workers seeking homes in historically white neighborhoods near employment centers. Resentment from working poor and middling whites produced violence and experiments with property segregation that took the form of restrictive covenants and, when those measures failed, racial zoning (which was soon ruled unenforceable).Clarence Poe, the young editor of Progressive Farmer, eventually the largest circulating farm journal in the Southeast, followed such urban segregation practices and the writings of South African apartheid architect Maurice Evans closely, considering how property segregation might be used to advance white small farmers' interests. Embracing populist ideals, Poe promoted yeomen self-sufficiency and the idea that white farmers should work together to benefit white farmers as a group. He sought a successful recipe for land segregation that would strengthen white farmers' economic opportunity and withstand challenges in court, and he regularly promoted the advantages of property segregation in his journal and in other venues. However, elite whites (whether urban industrial interests or rural planters) saw few advantages in property segregation: they saw no reason to hobble Black economic achievement, particularly because it did not threaten their own economic standing. They did not want to encourage migration by stifling Black success, as they depended on easy access to low-cost Black labor, and some thought individuals should be able to dispose of property as they wished. Thus, elites thwarted the property segregation efforts of middling whites in towns and the countryside.While there are already a number of scholarly works examining housing segregation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Threatening Property makes several important contributions to the subfield. Herbin-Triant shows that property segregation was an evolving conversation between urban and rural areas, and at least some white leaders saw advantages to implementing racial segregation in nonurban spaces. Furthermore, she outlines how this North Carolina story is both locally contingent and illustrative of national trends: North Carolina had a white independent, yeomen tradition that meant that farmers who owned (or had owned) small farms felt particularly threatened by and had the potential to be mobilized against Black economic success, a situation that Democratic political leaders took advantage of and that resulted in, among other things, Black disenfranchisement. At the same time, Winston reflected national engagement with racial segregation practices: it mimicked other cities in its attempts to confine Black families to neighborhoods lacking in resources or with fewer advantages. But the author is particularly successful in demonstrating how elite and middling whites experienced and responded to the “threat” of Black economic success in different ways. The elite white inclination to allow some measure of Black economic progress prevailed because elites held significantly more power. Thus, within the white community, conflicting class desires meant that some white supremacist agendas failed, even while white supremacist infrastructure (such as de facto social segregation) endured. And at least in the instances described, the failure of the middling white agenda benefited Black families who owned property or sought to, even while white racist terror continued.",

    "abstract": "The ascension of Charles II in 1660 marked a new era for England and its empire. Eager to bring order to English people and landscapes across the globe, the king and officials embraced the rhetoric of improvement and envisioned new projects that would (hopefully) turn rhetoric into reality. This, in turn, would create a healthy body politic. Kate Luce Mulry tracks this language, the policies that came from this rhetoric, and their consequences in An Empire Transformed. In doing so, she charts efforts to reconstitute a disaggregated body politic that was not only separated by the Atlantic Ocean, but also reeling from the Civil War and Interregnum. To encourage healthy English subjects, officials and thinkers envisioned projects that would transform landscapes from the fenlands to London's streets to Jamaican forests. As a result, An Empire Transformed chronicles the environmental history of state building in the early modern Atlantic world.An Empire Transformed begins in London on the eve of the 1666 fire. Mulry tracks how the dual disasters of plague and fire influenced how officials and Londoners conceived of the city, its urban spaces, and its inhabitants. As disease circulated among residents, officials quickly blamed the city's poor. In public discourses from pamphlets to proclamations, people reflected on how to prevent infection and improve the city of London. Similar discussions ensued in the wake of the fire. People of diverse backgrounds promoted different visions for the city's rebuilding. While many of these plans were too difficult to implement, small changes to the urban landscape enabled Londoners to mitigate the risk of similar events. For those interested in city planning and the rhetoric of improvement, the first chapter shows how this language guided recovery efforts in the wake of disasters. Moreover, it charts the emergence of city planning impulses that soon guided colonization in North America. Though firmly focused on London, this chapter's story has transatlantic implications.The next two chapters show how promoters and Restoration officials envisioned drainage projects as public health initiatives on both sides of the Atlantic. The English viewed swamps as dangerous places that were often inhabited by people deemed “unruly” by metropolitan and imperial officials, including fenlanders and Native Americans. Mulry tracks efforts to bring order to these environments—efforts that officials hoped would also improve the health and character of residents. By analyzing efforts to drain the English fenlands alongside projects to transform the marshy shores of the Delaware River, Mulry demonstrates how improvement was not only a transatlantic project, but also a collective one. Restoration officials, writers, and colonists all proposed ways to improve English landscapes. Yet, these public works projects were not always supported, especially by non-English residents of the colonies. Along the Delaware River, such projects raised important questions about public and private property as well as the ability of officials to demand labor from non-English residents in the wake of conquest. Local residents—as well as seasonal changes in environments—often undermined the quest for improvement.The final two chapters chart the role of food and gardens in England and its empire. For Restoration officials, food was both a mechanism of control and essential to a healthy body politic. As a result, officials sought to ensure reliable access to foodstuffs through legislation and state-sponsored agriculture. In England, some argued for the creation of grain storehouses. In the colonies, officials promoted planting orchards to not only showcase the English ability to control nature, but also to guarantee foodstuffs for residents. At the same time, English officials and thinkers promoted certain kinds of food as more appropriate than others. Because the body was believed to be porous, one's health depended on where one lived and what one consumed. Some foods were deemed more “English”—or appropriate—than others. As English officials sought to Anglicize diets, they also sought to build gardens. Envisioned as places to grow medicines to heal body politics, they would also create smellscapes that could transform the “wild” environs of Jamaica into a more civilized place.Situated at the intersection of environmental, imperial, and political history, An Empire Transformed enriches our understanding of the English Atlantic by tracing improvement projects throughout England and its colonies. But one wonders how much of this story is unique to the Restoration. In many ways, this story extends beyond the reign of Charles II, in both directions. Indeed, the rhetoric of improvement is a well-known aspect of England's transatlantic empire. While this longer story is obscured, Mulry's focus on the Restoration allows scholars to better understand the false starts and unfinished (or even hypothetical) plans of the mid-seventeenth century. Mulry chronicles how officials, colonists, and writers discussed not only how to improve English environs, but the best ways to do so. The quest for improvement was fraught with debate, incompletion, and myriad challenges. Indeed, Mulry ultimately shows that efforts to bring order to English places could, in fact, sow disorder.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The 1980s Farm Crisis began receiving national attention in the middle of the decade in large part because of Hollywood films such as Country and the star-studded Farm Aid concert. However, religious leaders and organizations had already started to warn of an impending crisis as early as 1978. They were motivated by a scriptural belief in land stewardship as well as empathy for their struggling rural parishioners. Throughout a series of noteworthy conferences, position statements, and protest actions coordinated by religious organizations across the denominational spectrum, Midwest-based leaders increasingly attempted to raise awareness, influence public policy, and bear witness to the escalating crisis. This article documents these ecumenical efforts during a pivotal time in America's rural history and provides a new angle on the farm crisis of the 1980s.",

This led to a privileged, front-row-seat perspective on the lead-up to the 1980s Farm Crisis, the depth of the financial turmoil, and its devastating aftermath on rural America. This article highlights the trajectory of the 1980s Farm Crisis, and reveals how her coverage documented the impact on farmers, as well as the efforts of support groups, farm organizations, and the US government to stabilize farms and farmers, and to keep families on their land. The financial repercussions are noted, but the focus is the emotional toll of the crisis, including stress, depression, suicide, divorce, dysfunctional family relationships, rural social problems, and how the Farm Crisis frayed the fabric of rural communities.",

    "abstract": "Anna Cant's book is an innovative study of the politics of the most radical agrarian reform in Latin America, in terms of the land expropriated; the speed with which cooperatives were created; and their rapid collapse and subsequent division into small, individually owned private property units. Peru's agrarian reform was not associated with violence, and was managed by a special bureaucracy under a left-leaning radical military government.On June 24, 1970, Gen. Juan Velasco Alvardo decreed the beginning of this agrarian reform. Television newscasts of the army occupying the largest sugar plantations amazed even the most skeptical civilians. Another part of the reform effort was carried out in the Andean highlands, dissolving the traditional hacienda system and liberating the Indigenous colono population who were obligated to work without pay in exchange for small subsistence plots.Agrarian reforms were demanded by communists, unions and worker movements, peasants, and revolutionary thinkers for at least half a century prior. Such reforms were also deemed a priority for Latin America by the West, backed by international institutions such as the Organization of American States, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress. Velasco's government declared that it was neither communist nor capitalist, but nationalist and reformist. It ruled through a corporatist, top-down bureaucracy that affected businesses, institutions, communications, social norms, schools, and civilians from every walk of life.This book is a remarkable study of the most controversial aspect of this dictatorship's rule, the Sistema Nacional de Movilización Social (SINAMOS). Its phonetic pronunciation could be understood in Spanish as sin amos, without masters. SINAMOS was eventually shut down in the second phase of the military rule by General Francisco Morales Bermudez in 1976 when the military had become unpopular and SINAMOS its most visible target.Subsequent regimes, especially Alberto Fujimori's, dedicated themselves to undoing most of Velasco's policies. The state apparatus was weakened and decentralized, and its archives were dispersed. Neglected papers decayed or were destroyed. With meticulous and cleverly applied methods and lots of patience, Anna Cant has reconstructed the activities of SINAMOS's offices in three regions: Piura on the North Coast, Cuzco in the Highlands, and the coastal department of Tacna on the border with Chile.Chapter 2 presents the results. SINAMOS caused tensions between different bureaucracies as newly recruited intellectuals from the Left exasperated officers of the ancien régime with their rhetoric. In Piura, preexisting unions, peasant confederations, and land-hungry social movements promoted land occupations before, during, and after Velasco's decrees, and consequently, SINAMOS's expropriations competed with peasant land occupations on the same terrain. In Cuzco, enthusiasm for the Confederación Campesina Peruana led to a lukewarm response to the recruitment efforts of the pro-Velasco Confederación Nacional Agraria. SINAMOS also fostered the recognition of official comunidades campesinas created from the lands and people of ex-haciendas, and these communities sabotaged the efforts of the gigantic collective state farm that government agencies had created. Finally, in Tacna, a region of smallholder properties without many haciendas to expropriate, SINAMOS was met with indifference.In Chapter 3, Cant examines SINAMOS's activities promoting the extension of citizens' rights, aimed at awakening the Indigenous political consciousness while devising mechanisms to make it congruent with Indigenous cultural norms as well as those of the nation. It moved away from the image of meek inferiority so that Indigenous people could occupy their rightful space in the modern nation of Peru. SINAMOS adapted and incorporated pedagogical techniques to reach out to colonos, the landless, and very poor casual laborers. Velasco renamed the Indians campesinos to address them as beneficiaries of the agrarian reform. Practices included literacy campaigns, puppet theaters, broadcasting programs, and official recognition of the Quechua and Aymara languages and their use in newspapers, TV, and radio shows.Though short-lived, these initiatives did a lot for the peasant population. The literacy campaign, for example, produced people who could sign only their name, but that permitted their acquisition of citizen papers and a legal identity. Educational reform pushed the children of campesinos into schools, wearing a single uniform that erased class distinctions, and the officialization of Indigenous languages brought smiles to waiters in Lima restaurants. Though a token, this was important. In carrying out its mandate to politicize the downtrodden campesino, SINAMOS incorporated other branches of government, culture, education, mass communications, and legal affairs into the tasks of social mobilization. Though brief, SINAMOS's impact was important. I agree with Cant that the effects of these measures went beyond the agrarian reform, that they were part of the social and political emancipation that the reform intended, and that it planted the seeds of processes that are still ongoing.On the other hand, the reform and SINAMOS generated strong opposition. Resentments and critiques often relied on cruel humor in gossip circles; Velasco's stern face became a repeated image in anticommunist editorials. A powerful right-wing opinion regarded the Velasco regime as a total disaster. The other side responded, in more measured terms, that Velasco's reform was a watershed in social and political terms. I compared it to the abolition of slavery in the Americas in Ugly Stories of the Peruvian Agrarian Reform (2009). Those changes are more lasting and are relevant to a rethinking of the historical trajectory of the nation. The agrarian reform emancipated a lot of people with an official act, full of its own limitations and contradictions and accompanied by a maverick style of interventions of which SINAMOS was the most interesting example. While middle-class urban rhetoric demonizes Velasco, his memory is still admired and maintained by more marginalized people, with gratitude for his programs expressed in shantytowns, villages, and campesino homes.",

    "abstract": "Part biography and part school history, Williams's book provides a well-researched and richly detailed story of Frederick Watts—businessman, lawyer, gentleman farmer, and president of Penn State's board of trustees—and his role in both the establishment of Pennsylvania's only land grant college and its surprising struggle to survive in the years 1864–82. In addition, the author includes an excellent chapter on Watts's work after he left the school's board to serve as President Ulysses S. Grant's commissioner of agriculture from 1871 to 1877. Williams states that his goal is to present a “fuller biographical treatment” of his subject and he largely succeeds in this task (xiii). He provides a more honest and realistic history of Watts's involvement with Penn State as he notes that many previous, but unnamed, biographies verged on hagiography. Readers do get a fuller picture of both Watts and these early decades in the college's history, but Williams does not always provide sufficient analysis and oftentimes he presents pieces of the puzzle but does not necessarily fit them together or state their importance and the result is that one is left to infer things or to just wonder about them.The book focuses on the “critical period” in Penn State's history, according to Williams. Following the death of its first president, Evan Pugh, the school entered a very difficult time during which it suffered greatly and almost failed because the spate of new leaders who followed either did not truly understand or were not dedicated to the agricultural/industrial mission of the school as outlined in the provisions of the first Morrill Act (1862). In short, the author tells us that this was a disaster for the school and states that “Watts, as president of the board of trustees until 1874, must bear the strongest measure of accountability for the appointment of four of five of the institutional presidents who floundered and failed during this eighteen-year retrogression” (xiii). The school's presidents during this time—William Allen (1864–66), John Frasier (1866–68), Thomas Burrows (1868–71), Rev. James Calder (1871–80), and Joseph Shortlidge (1880–82)—all varied in ability, background, effectiveness, interest, and vigor. Frequent changes at the top brought revisions in the curriculum. Some of these were generally positive, but others weakened the agriculture and science core and a least one was a blatant attempt to transform the college into a classical institution of higher learning. Williams notes challenges from the outside were no less dangerous, including the school's struggle to maintain its exclusive land grant funding and carping from Keystone State farmers and the members of the Pennsylvania Agricultural Society and the Grange who were eager to find fault with almost anything related to the college. These streams of discontent combined into a potent toxic mixture that damaged the institution's reputation among members of the legislature and the public at large and constituted an ongoing existential threat. Faced with this sea of troubles, with Watts at the helm, the board fumbled repeatedly in the searches for new leadership and Williams points the finger at Watts for the errors and even questions his commitment to the school's mission.This assessment is perhaps too harsh on Watts. Williams demonstrates but never says outright that Watts shares the blame for the choices of ill-suited presidents with the entire board. If the candidate pools for the president were weak, the board had five different opportunities to come up with a creative solution to finding an appropriate new leader for the college. It could have run the school itself for a time—extending the time of the search until it was able to locate a more suitable candidate to fill the position or even consulting the boards or presidents of other land grant institutions. And maybe it needed to make the criteria for the job clearer. Williams attributes the board's poor selections for new college presidents to expediency, yet he never clearly states the origins of this sense of urgency. He presents clues but neglects to put them together for the reader. Surely the rush to fill the presidency of the school multiple times stemmed from a sense of pressure, a fear of failure, and growing complaints about the school and doubts about its effectiveness. There were many eyes on the institution, and some wanted it to fail so they could accrue clout and political power or to take the land grant money. Ironically, in moving quickly to fill the college president's seat, the board was providing more fuel for the growing chorus of critics by helping to create the very situation it wished to avoid.Although he presents a great deal of information about Watts, Williams does not attempt to explain the man's unfortunate poor performance in guiding the selections of college presidents. Again, he scatters several pieces of the puzzle around, but he does not put them together and he leaves it to the reader to try to discern what might have been behind this situation. He does indicate that while president of the board of trustees of the college, Watts had many other interests that occupied his attention, including two farms and his service as the head of the board of directors of the Cumberland Valley Railroad. These responsibilities had to be time-consuming. For instance, Williams notes Watts's “parsimonious management” of the railroad (20). Although his penny-pinching style saved the company once and contributed to increased profits, at the end of his tenure in 1873, he was criticized for it. This suggests that Watts was a conscientious person and careful with other people's money—admirable traits for someone who runs an organization with investors. It is certainly possible that he brought that same level of frugality to the management of his household, his farms, and the college, too. Evidence of this can found in his intimate involvement in the design of the barn on the experimental farm at the college, for which he even provided specifics for the materials and fastenings for “racks” in the building. Watts was well-known for his innovative barn design on his Carlisle farm but it is odd considering all he was responsible for that the president of the board of trustees would take the time to involve himself in such a small thing. Did his penchant for frugality and an apparent love for minutiae distract him while attempting to grapple with issues posed by recurring searches for college presidents? It seems incredibly likely. Furthermore, Williams overlooks the fact that Watts was the father of nine children. Their education, health, and general well-being also had to have taken some of his attention during the eighteen-year period when the board struggled and floundered in its efforts to find a person who had the same drive and vision as Evan Pugh to lead the school.Williams provides a wealth of detail about the early history of Penn State and addresses previously unanswered questions about its past. However, the book prompts many new questions about this rocky period in the history of the school and agricultural education in Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, it could very well be a “must read” for many of the school's graduates in the agricultural sciences. The work should inspire others to do more research on the unresolved questions that it raises.",

He worked on many projects that helped farmers cope with the decade's troubles, and often mediated between competing groups in his position with Iowa State Cooperative Extension. He was the founding editor of the Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll, which gathered important evidence of the effects of the crisis at the ground level. Rev. David Ostendorf came to Iowa as part of the advocacy group Rural America. He arrived thinking he would be working on rural housing issues, but quickly found himself working with embattled farmers. When Rural America dissolved, he founded and headed PrairieFire, one of the decade's most important activist agricultural organizations, which demanded and provided aid to distressed farmers. Lasley has recently retired after forty years in Extension and rural sociology at Iowa State. Ostendorf continues to be a minister in the United Church of Christ, as well as organizing on issues of social, economic, and racial justice.In an hourlong conversation, the two of them reflected on their experience of the 1980s, the changes that have happened in agriculture and rural communities in the decades since, and the importance of history.",

Leavitt promoted the growing and processing of sugar beets, including building his own factory. When he saw the necessity for change, he quickly moved to the North Platte Valley of western Nebraska, first developing an irrigation project that was needed to raise sugar beets, then actively promoting the establishment of a sugar refinery in Scottsbluff. Leavitt was a visionary with the ability to attract investors with the large amounts of capital necessary to promote his projects; however, he seldom persevered long enough to profit from these projects. Leavitt was born in New York City, 22 March 1861, to prosperous parents, Henry S. and Martha A. Young Leavitt. His father was a New York banker, his paternal grandfather, David Leavitt, was president of American Express National Bank, and his maternal grandfather, Henry Young, was a banker and a builder of gas plants in Chicago, New York, and elsewhere. After attending private schools, Heyward graduated from Harvard 1882, and Columbia Law School in 1884. He practiced patent law for a time in New York City but left to work with his grandfather Young's gas plants. Around 1887, Leavitt moved to Grand Island, Nebraska, to operate the Grand Island Light and Fuel Company, of which he was president.1",

The first of these was the forced emigration of millions of Russian Jews following a wave of anti-Semitism during the reign of Czar Alexander III beginning in 1881. The second was the desperate attempt by the state of Nevada to offset the effect of its eroding mining economy and the precipitous decline in its population. One of the proposed solutions to the problems created by an inundation of unwanted new immigrants to American eastern cities was the relocation of Jews to rural sites throughout North America. The philanthropic Baron de Hirsch Fund provided transportation assistance from Europe to New York City, where the wealthy Jewish banker and entrepreneur, Jacob Schiff, helped to deploy clusters of Jews to remote agricultural sites. Nevada's prescription for its malaise was to advertise for immigrants. One group responding to the call included the family of Joseph Nudelman, whose experience mirrored the idealism, struggles, and failure of the late-nineteenth-century Jewish agricul? tural colonizing movement.

    "abstract": "There are good reasons for taking up the problem of leasefarming in eighteenth-century Europe. The leasefarmer, paying cash rents in return for control over all the harvest, was the central figure in the physiocratic program of economic growth, the champion who could revive and expand the French economy with proper support from the laws. For the Swiss scholar Herbert Luethy, Quesnay's idea of winning the crown over to agriculture of large landed estates administered by 'capitalist farmers' was so much the apt attempt at saving the old regime from itself that, in comparison, Voltaire's attack on physiocracy, his UHomme aux quarante ecus (Geneva, 1768), coming from the pen of the feudal lord of Ferney, can only appear as an act of bad faith. Indeed, in a massive thesis of 1994 about the leasefarmers in the Ile-de-France in the fifteenth through the eighteenth centuries, the French historian Jean-Marc Moriceau has brought to life an astonishing collection of these physiocratic entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial families, whose secular accumulations of capital and leaseholds, whose technical achievements and social promotions, bringing wealth and status to themselves and enrichment to the national economy, are sufficiently impressive to raise doubts about the established understanding of pre-Revolutionary France as a brilliant but fatally sclerotic civilization. Conversely, the American Philip Hoffman, in a recent study in econometrics, claims that making sense of this kingdom",
