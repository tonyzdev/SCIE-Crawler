A total of 1737 independent registrations of 14 mammal and 15 bird species were obtained. We recorded 27 species of wildlife from 21 families of native fauna, excluding stray dogs and cats. The golden jackal (Canis aureus Linnaeus, 1758), the red fox (Vulpes vulpes Linnaeus, 1758), the European badger (Meles meles Linnaeus, 1758) and the European hare (Lepus europaeus Pallas, 1778) were registered at all camera stations. Among the 17 established bird species there was a series of synanthropic species, such as the Eurasian magpie (Pica pica Linnaeus, 1758), Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius Linnaeus, 1758), blackbird (Turdus merula Linnaeus, 1758), common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus Linnaeus, 1758) and tits (Parus spp.). The tree-shrub belts in the study area appear to function successfully as oases for many wildlife species among local agricultural ecosystems. These belts could also represent travel corridors that enable the movement of wildlife across an agricultural landscape.",

The MPs accumulation in the bivalves was observed under a stereomicroscope after 10% KOH tissue digestion. Metal elements (Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn and Fe) in the bivalve soft tissues were measured by EPA-METHOD 3052. The effects of pollutants on the bivalve species were assessed by oxidative stress (OS) biomarkers, which were measured spectrophotometrically. MPs were observed in all studied species but at a different ratio, pellets being the most numerous (94.7%). The accumulated MPs and metal elements induced OS but significantly correlated with different OS indices in the individual bivalve species. The principal component analysis suggested that the MPs accumulation probably leads to changes in bivalve cells similar to those caused by Pb and associated with protein oxidation and glutathione levels. In conclusion, the accumulated MPs and metal elements caused OS in all studied bivalves, which, in turn, activated their antioxidant system. This suggested the presence of adaptive potential of the bivalve species to the current ecological state of the marine environment in their habitats of the Bulgarian Black Sea sublittoral.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of the current state of lakes and reservoirs is a prerequisite for the conservation and management of these ecosystems as well as for their restoration and mitigation of the damages triggered by various pressures. The aim of the present study was to explore associations of the zooplankton communities with the trophic state and (or) ecological potential (EP) of reservoirs, incorporating also standard physical and chemical factors and primary production. We recorded 48 zooplankton taxa: 32 rotifer, nine cladoceran and seven copepod taxa. Our results suggested a significant relationship of both zooplankton community and univariate metrics with trophic state index (TSI) and conductivity. Reservoirs with the highest correlation with TSI and chlorophyll a were with the highest trophic state. Most of the rotifers identified as indicator taxa evidenced eu-mesotrophic conditions or moderate-poor EP. The indicator cladocerans were significantly associated with moderate EP. The indicator copepods were associated with higher EP and oligo-mesotrophic conditions. Policy-driven approaches identified littoral macrozoobenthos as the key invertebrate group for the assessment of lentic water bodies, while science-driven studies focus more on the pelagial zooplankton communities in assessments of ecosystem health. The pelagial and the littoral of a lake (or a reservoir) are very different in the conditions, which they provide; they could be affected by distinct stressors, thus triggering a specific response of their communities. Studying lentic ecosystems in a more holistic way, across various water body types and for longer periods, would result in rigorous assessment schemes and improved management of the ecosystem health.",

This study aimed to examine the impact of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) exposure on the WBC kinetics of laboratory ICR albino mice over a subchronic intoxication period and to assess the efficacy of zeolite administration in modulating detoxification processes. Five variants of laboratory experiments were performed over 45 days: 1) food + water (control); 2) food + (water+Cd(NO3)2); 3) food + (water+Pb(NO3)2); 4) (food + clinoptilolite) + (water+Cd(NO3)2) and 5) (food + clinoptilolite) + (water+Pb(NO3)2). Haematological analyses were conducted on days 0, 15, 30 and 45. Pb and Cd intoxication resulted in pathological alterations of WBC kinetics, with inconsistent effects in different WBC subtypes but more pronounced in granulocyte. We observed a tendency for a decrease in WBC counts at day 15 and an increase at day 30, followed by normalisation at day 45 in all experimental groups. Pb ‒ more immunotoxic to mouse WBCs. The study on the effects of clinoptilolite (hydrated alkali aluminosilicate, one of the most abundant minerals in the zeolite family) administration suggests insufficient efficiency on leukopoiesis in ICR albino mice.

The aim was to assess the state of the urban population of the species in Belgorod (Russia) during the breeding season. The majority of the research was conducted in June 2021 and May 2022. The average population density of the common wood pigeon in the city was 1.7 ± 1.2 pairs/10 ha, while the highest population density was observed in the recreational parks (2.8 ± 1.6 pairs/10 ha). The species started to utilise urbanised habitats for breeding around the 1990s, including the green residential areas with predominantly five-story housing blocks, where the current population density was 1.2 ± 0.3 pairs/10 ha. In general, the average population density of the common wood pigeon in Belgorod was significantly lower than that in other European urban areas. In the green residential areas with predominantly five-story housing blocks, nests were located on trees belonging to eight taxa. Nests were most often placed in linden (25.9% of the total number of nests found), birch (14.8%) and horse chestnut (14.8%). The height of nests above the ground varied from 7 to 16 m, averaging 11.1 ± 0.49 m. The data obtained indicated an urban population of the species having formed in the city and being at one of the final stages of synanthropisation.",

In most of the anurans, these two metamorphic traits are largely influenced by several biotic and abiotic factors but mainly by habitat drying. We studied the influence of habitat drying on larval duration and size at emergence in Uperodon taprobanicus under laboratory conditions. Freshly hatched tadpoles (Gosner stage 19) were exposed to decreasing water levels (gradually or rapidly) up to the beginning of metamorphic climax stage (MC, Gosner stage 42; emergence of forelimbs). The control group was reared in constant water levels. Tadpoles reared in decreasing water levels (gradually or rapidly) reached MC and completed larval duration earlier and metamorphosed at a smaller size than those reared in constant water levels. Further, tadpoles experiencing rapid depletion of water reached MC and completed larval duration earlier and also metamorphosed at smaller size than those experiencing gradual depletion in water levels. Thus, tadpoles of U. taprobanicus showed adaptive plasticity in metamorphosis to habitat drying. The study shows that U. taprobanicus tadpoles are capable of developmental plasticity and exposed to decrease in water levels, the trade-off between growth and development is in favour of development, resulting in early metamorphosis at a smaller size.",

However, the potential influence of the facility where the animals are housed during experiments is unknown. Therefore, I performed an experiment with a caudate species widely used in behavioural experiments – the Alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris). Sixty-four females were captured in the Czech Republic and divided into two groups after controlled mating. Females from the first group were reared individually in small tanks (volume of 6 dm-3), females from the other – in large tanks (volume of 20 dm-3) and differences in egg-laying variables (the overall number of laid eggs, duration of the egg-laying period and the rate of egg-laying) between these groups were compared. The proportion of females that laid at least one egg (63%) did not differ between the groups. The average number of laid eggs per female was 77 (range 3-176), the mean duration of the egg-laying period (from first to last laid egg) was 15.35 days (range 3-34) and the mean rate of egg-laying was 4.73 eggs laid per day (range 0.40 – 12.40). The volume of tank did not influence these variables; however, the body length of the female (SVL), but not weight, was positively associated with the total number of laid eggs and the rate of egg-laying. We can conclude that an aquarium volume of 6 dm-3 of water is sufficient for individual housing of Alpine newt females and it does not represent any limitation in their reproduction outcomes.",

    "abstract": "We studied the species composition and abundance of Heteroptera in an oil-bearing rose plantation in the Kazanlak Valley, Southern Bulgaria. Insects were collected using two types of traps – sticky and funnel traps – combined with three types of visual stimuli (fluorescent yellow, transparent and purple). Over a four-month period (June to September 2023), a total of 152 specimens representing 22 species of eight families were collected. Our results indicate that some species are significantly more attracted to certain colours and trap types than to others. Insects belonging to the suborder Heteroptera, are not among the pests causing economic losses in Bulgarian oil-bearing rose production. However, the presence of the invasive pest species, Halyomorpha halys (Stål, 1855), raises concerns about the damage this pest could cause to rose plantations in Bulgaria. Additionally, our findings suggest that the predator Deraeocoris ruber, the most abundant species in the samples, might contribute to aphid population control in the studied agricultural setting. Further research would be beneficial to assess its effectiveness as a biological control agent in oil-bearing rose plantations and other cultivated crops.",

    "abstract": "The present study assessed the effects of photoperiod and temperature on the development and survival rate of the predatory insect Eocanthecona furcellata under various photothermal gradients in climate-controlled chambers. The eggs of E. furcellata did not hatch at 15°C and exhibited the lowest hatching rate at 35°C, with only 28.0% and 13.0% hatching rates under long and short photoperiods, respectively. Moreover, the nymphs hatched under the conditions mentioned above did not survive. Linear regression analysis identified 17.7°C as the developmental threshold temperature for eggs, with an effective accumulated temperature of 62.3 °C. The developmental threshold temperature for nymphs was 17.0°C, with an effective accumulated temperature of 167.3 °C. These findings indicate that temperature exerts a significant impact on the developmental rate of E. furcellata during early stages unlike photoperiod. Under both long and short photoperiods, the eggs exhibited high hatching rates, while nymphs demonstrated the highest survival rates at 25°C. Further analysis with the Weibull distribution function showed that the survival rate curves for the insect at the early stages fitted Type I category, indicating that mortality rate increased over time. Thus, we recommend rearing eggs under short photoperiod conditions and nymphs under long photoperiod conditions, maintaining the temperature of the growth chamber at 25°C.",

A sample of 200 horse-chestnut leaves was used, half from the sunny and the other from the shaded part of the crown, the eggs and mines were counted, and the location of the eggs on the leaves was determined. Three locations were distinguished: midrib, lateral vein and lamina. In total, just over 3,000 eggs were detected, with most eggs and mines found on sunlit leaves, on the lamina. As many as 90% of the eggs hatch into larvae inside the leaves, which initiate the development of mines. The most beneficial leaf part to lay eggs is near the midrib, but this place is chosen the least often. The question of why most eggs are laid on sunny leaves, even though the success and performance of the leaf miner is lower, remains unanswered.",

Current research focuses on evaluating herbal medicines and natural products for tick control. This study assessed the acaricidal effects of hydroalcoholic extracts of the plants Achillea millefolium L. and Ferula asafoetida H. Karst. against Hyalomma sp. ticks in vitro, while determining their toxicity using the MTT assay. The acaricidal activities of both plant extracts were evaluated at concentrations of 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/ml after exposure times of 15, 30 and 60 minutes, using spray and contact methods. The chemical composition of the extracts was analysed via gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and toxicity was assessed by the MTT assay. Results indicated that A. millefolium L. extracts achieved 100 % mortality at 200 mg/ml after 15 minutes and at 150 mg/ml after 30 minutes of exposure. In contrast, F. asafoetida H. Karst. exhibited 100 % mortality at 200 mg/ml after 60 minutes. The main chemical components identified in A. millefolium L. and F. asafoetida H. Karst. were docosane (9.82%) and 2-Methoxy-3-methylbutanoic acid (13.9%), respectively. The MTT toxicity test revealed that A. millefolium L. exhibited low toxicity across all concentrations, while F. asafoetida H. Karst. showed significant cytotoxicity against the Vero cell line. These findings demonstrate that both plants possess acaricidal activity, with A. millefolium L. showing the most potent effects at lower concentrations. However, further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of these extracts in vivo.",

Despite the ecological importance of these wetlands as key habitats for foraging and reproduction, there is limited scientific information regarding flamingo presence and their relationship with salinity and environmental variables in these ecosystems. The objective of the study was to evaluate the spatial distribution and abundance of flamingo species in 13 high-altitude wetlands, sampled between August and October 2021 and October and November 2024. Both adults and juveniles of Phoenicopterus chilensis, Phoenicoparrus andinus and Phoenicoparrus jamesi were recorded, alongside physicochemical and climatic variables. We found that the Loriscota Wetland harboured the highest abundance with 21,000 individuals and was one of the few sites where all three species co-occurred. Phoenicopterus chilensis was the most dominant species. A positive correlation was identified between the Phoenicopterus chilensis and Phoenicoparrus andinus abundance and water pH, maximum ambient temperature and relative humidity, while the distribution of Phoenicoparrus jamesi showed an association with salinity and electrical conductivity. This study provides the first detailed assessment of flamingo population structure in relation to physicochemical gradients in Peruvian high-Andean wetlands, contributing novel insights into their ecological preferences and highlighting critical areas for conservation planning.",

In addition, we provide information about the intraspecific variability of B. serborientalis, both in terms of shell and penial morphology. In general, the morphological variability is observed as quite high and there are no stable characters which could distinguish this species from its congeners. Therefore, DNA analyses should be used in order to complement morphological descriptions.",

    "abstract": "The three-toed woodpecker Picoides tridactylus is one of the rarest bird species in Serbia. Its distribution is limited to high-altitude forests in South-Western Serbia, where it represents a glacial relict. As a habitat specialist, it is vulnerable to climate change impacts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas in conserving suitable habitats for P. tridactylus in the present and the future (2050) under the moderate SSP2-4.5 and extreme SSP5-8.5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios. To accomplish this, a gap analysis was performed in QGIS by overlapping species distribution maps in the present and the future with the distribution of Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas in South-Western Serbia. Future projections were created using the warm/dry global climate model HadGEM3-GC31-LL, which had the greatest negative impact on the studied species and could, therefore, provide insight into the effectiveness of the Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas under the high climatic pressure. The results indicated that this network would encompass &gt; 90% of species suitable habitats by 2050. Nevertheless, moderately and highly suitable habitats for this species were shown to have a drastic reduction and/or a complete loss by 2050, both within and outside the network, indicating that it will probably become less suitable for P. tridactylus in the future. To mitigate the expected changes, it is necessary to provide adequate protection measure now by preserving the suitable habitats for this species. Currently, there are still 52.41 km2 of moderately suitable habitats outside the network that should become conservation priority. Given that Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas in Serbia face various threats, I recommend an adaptive management measures as a way to maintain the habitat of this endangered woodpecker in Serbia.",

This genus includes a group of loaches distributed in Europe, Asia and parts of North Africa, usually living in freshwater environments. There are 22 endemic species of Cobitis in Türkiye, distributed in Central, Western and South-Eastern Anatolia. The chromosomal characteristics of C. battalgilae have not been studied, limiting the scope of biological and ecological studies. We employed Giemsa-, C-, and Ag-NOR staining to characterise the karyotype macrostructure of two species of Cobitis from Türkiye, reporting cytogenetic data for the first time in C. battalgilae and reassessing previously known features of C. turcica. The diploid chromosome number in C. battalgilae and C. turcica was 2n = 50 and similar karyotype structures (8 m + 16 sm + 14 st + 12 a; NF = 74) were observed. In both species, there was a secondary constriction on the short arm of autosomal pair 1. Heteromorphic sex chromosomes were not detected. Constitutive heterochromatin (C-bands) was located in the peri/centromeric regions and differed in intensity on some chromosomes. Active Ag-NORs were detected on both homologues and were associated with heterochromatin on the largest metacentric chromosome pair (no. 1) in both species The cytogenetic findings of these two species supported the close relatedness revealed by phylogenetic analysis based on molecular (mitochondrial genes) data.",

Sampling was conducted at six sites (L1-L6) along the main course of the river and two macroinvertebrate-based ecological indices were employed to determine the water quality status: the Family Biotic Index (FBI) and the richness of taxa of orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT). We identified macroinvertebrate taxa of 28 families (22 taxa of class Insecta and six – belonging to other macroinvertebrate groups). The values of the indices across the six sampling stations ranged between 1.3 and 9.2 for EPT family richness and between 3.4 and 6.6 for FBI. According to the data concerning macroinvertebrates, the water of the Prizren River was, overall, of good quality. There was severe water quality degradation at two downstream locations, emphasizing the necessity for enhanced water resource management. The findings indicated that the diversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates varied across different sites, reflecting the ecological health of the river and, indirectly, the impacts of human activities on water quality. This research provided insights into the ecological health of the Prizren River, offering а valuable basis for future conservation and remediation efforts.",

Changes in the enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione (GSH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels were determined using ELISA kits. In D. polymorpha exposed to the three experimental concentrations of cadmium, there was a statistically significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in SOD enzyme activity with increasing concentration or exposure times. No change was observed in CAT enzyme activity with increasing concentrations. The decrease in the activity depending on the exposure times was not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05).

TBARS and GSH levels increased significantly in all Cd application groups compared to the control at 24 and 96 hours. The effects of different concentrations of Cd on D. polymorpha in the acute period were associated with changes in SOD, CAT, GPx enzyme activities.

This study examines the spatial variations in the annual cycles of functional groups of planktonic Appendicularia in response to environmental changes within the Bay of Boka Kotorska. Monthly sampling over the course of a year during 2008/09 was conducted at seven stations, each characterised by distinct hydrographic conditions. Appendicularians exhibited spatial variations in their annual cycles across the seven stations. Based on these findings, it is proposed that the observed spatial variations in the annual cycles of functional groups of planktonic Appendicularia may reflect changes in hydrographic conditions. We present hydrographic data alongside information on the presence, abundance and distribution of eight species of two genera: Oikopleura dioica Fol, O. longicauda Vogt, O.fusiformis Fol, Fritillaria aequatorialis Lohmann, F. megachille Fol, F. pellucida (Busch), F. haplostoma Fol and F. borealis Lohmann.

The capture of three adult specimens within a small surveyed area suggests that the species is widespread within the National Park and possibly has established a viable population. Given its ecological traits – high environmental adaptability, top predator status, habitat modification tendencies, and territorial behavior – S. aristotelis is expected to exert significant competitive pressure on the park’s endemic and native species, particularly the Marathon minnow (Pelasgus marathonicus Vinciguerra, 1921) and the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.). Additionally, its invasion risk is amplified under projected climate change scenarios, raising concerns about its long-term ecological impact. The detection of S. aristotelis within this protected area highlights the urgent need for immediate management actions, including eradication or population control measures, particularly since angling is strictly prohibited in this area.",

The research was conducted over an eight-month period (April–November 2022), covering six distinct sampling sites. A total of 12 molluscan species were identified. The average molluscan density was 26,746 ind/m². The dominant species in terms of density throughout all seasons and sites was Ecrobia maritima, demonstrating extreme seasonal variability. Other abundant species included Mytilaster lineatus, Bittium reticulatum and Cerastoderma glaucum, which exhibited distinct seasonal density peaks. Densities of M. lineatus, Pusillina lineolata and C. glaucum peaked in spring, while B. reticulatum had maximum abundance in summer. Cerastoderma glaucum was the dominant species in terms of biomass (43% of total biomass), followed by M. lineatus (40%). The study highlighted the influence of environmental parameters (salinity, temperature, substrate composition and anthropogenic impacts) on the molluscan community structure. The observed fluctuations suggest that the ecosystem of the Pomorie Lake is undergoing shifts due to hydrological and climatic changes. The findings contribute to the long-term monitoring of the biodiversity in this protected wetland and offer insights into the ecological dynamics of hypersaline lagoons.",

In autumn and in the first months of winter (October-December) the immature individuals prevailed. The mature vs. immature individuals ratio was 1: 3.6; while in January to March the ratio was balanced. The number of individuals caught per mound was 1-21 (average 6.9 in season 2004/2005, 10.4 in 2005/2006). During the investigation, 175 mounds were measured and examined. The average base of mound was 122 cm in long and 106 cm in wide, the average height was 29 cm and the average periphery on hill base was 396 cm. There were 3.0-26.0 (average 11.6) cm seed layers observed in the single mounds. Mounds were usually located 10-30 m apart from each other. Spherical nests of 10-35 cm in diameter were situated in a depth of 1-45 cm under the ground.",

    "abstract": "The fauna from the late Miocene localities of Kocherinovo (KCH), SW Bulgaria, is briefly described. Their faunal features and geologic situation suggest that all of these localities (KCH-1, KCH-2, KCH-3) are roughly contemporaneous. The evolutionary stages of several taxa (Choerolophodon, Microstonyx, Palaeoreas) the presence of an archaic aardvark, as well as the presence of C. cf. macedonicum are features indicative of an earlier age than the other Bulgarian Turolian localities, suggesting an early Turolian age. Hipparions, Gazella and spiral-horned bovids (especially Palaeoreas sp.) make up the bulk of the bone sample, a faunal assemblage that is typical, from a palaeoecological point of view, for the Turolian palaeocoenoses of Southern Bulgaria. This indicates that open woodland and shrubland represented the dominant landscape in the region, and shows that it was present in the area as early as the early Turolian. The zoogeographic relationships of the fauna are similar to those of other Turolian localities of Bulgaria, although individuals identified as “? Samotherium” and the aardwark tentatively referred to Amphiorycteropus cf. browni attest to an eastern influence.",

Further, this is the first documented record of P. glenii outside this lake, and namely in Siegenbach Stream, which connects the lake with the Naab River. The river is a left tributary of the Danube River with known presence of P. glenii. These data confirm spreading of the invasion from the reserve and beginning of forming of the Upper-Danube (Bavarian) invasive subrange of this alien species.

Larvae were collected from four stations (Chaya River and The Farm in Bulgaria, and Pazar fountain and Derincay River in Turkey), whose sediments had different concentrations of several trace metals. The number of cytogenetic aberrations was higher in larvae from those stations whose sediments had higher concentrations of trace metals. Through FISH analysis of the cytogenetic localization of the three transposable elements, we found fixed insertion sites in the centromere regions and many variable insertion sites. NLRCth1, CTRT1, TFB1 insertion sites and locations of somatic-rearrangements occurred significantly more often in the proximal than in the distal regions of the polytene chromosomes. In addition, some common breakpoints of aberrations co-localized with NLRCth1, CTRT1 or TFB1 insertion sites in the populations of C.riparius samples: from Pazar (for all studied TEs: from 35.7% to 57.1%); Derincay River (from 38.8% to 69.4%); The Farm (from 34.8% to 50%) and Chaya River (from 23.3% to 50%). We advance the hypothesis that chromosome instabilities induced by stress agents in the environment could be related to the position of the TEs in the genome of C. riparius.",

Four external features, 13 linear measurements of the skull and 14 dental characters were measured. Dental and cranial characters were evaluated based on the frequencies of 27 character states for 12 morphological characters. The oak forests of the north-western slopes of the Zagros Mountains are known as the easternmost range boundary of A. mystacinus, and the species has been blocked by the north-south extension of the Zagros Mountains.

In such systems, an array of chemical cues (e.g., kairomones, alarm, dietary) affects the behavioural responses of the prey tadpoles. The study on the behavioural responses of tadpoles belongs to the family Microhylidae to predators are very less hence the outcome of this study will provide a novel information in the field of behavioural ecology of anuran tadpoles with reference to prey-predator interactions. The behavioural responses of tadpoles of Indian painted frog Uperodon taprobanicus (Microhylidae) to its naturally co-existing predatory tadpoles of the Indian bullfrog Hoplobatrachus tigerinus (Dicroglossidae) were studied in the laboratory. The predator’s kairomones (water conditioned by a starved predator) was used to simulate predation threat. The results of the experiment showed that U. taprobanicus tadpoles exhibited strong antipredator behavioural responses, i.e. drastically reduced swimming movements and overall time spent in swimming as well as had a higher burst speed in response to kairomones of predators. Thus, U. taprobanicus tadpoles consider H. tigerinus tadpoles as potential predators. This may be because of long ecological co-existence of U. taprobanicus tadpoles with sympatric carnivorous tadpoles, H. tigerinus may have led to the evolution of antipredator defence strategies in response to kairomones of these predators. In summary, tadpoles of U. taprobanicus perceive predation risk by detecting kairomones emanating from the predator H. tigerinus and showed appropriate antipredator behavioural responses.",

One male specimen was collected by a pitfall trap in the Chepan Planina Mountain (part of the Western Stara Planina Mts.) in central-western Bulgaria, in the period July–September 2023. In addition, 14 other members of the family Carabidae were found during the same study. Of them, Cymindis axillaris is recorded for the first time from the Western Stara Planina Mts. This study is also the second record of Ophonus parallelus in the Stara Planina Mts. The relatively low anthropogenic pressure in the studied habitat and the adjacent areas is believed be a crucial factor for the survival of vulnerable steppe elements, including A. taurica.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic methods are widely used to study bird communities. They are particularly helpful in remote and hard reachable regions. In this study, we evaluated four acoustic indices (Acoustic Complexity Index, Acoustic Diversity Index, Acoustic Evenness Index and Bioacoustic Index) for biodiversity assessment in mountain beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests inside Belasitsa Nature Park, Bulgaria. We used twelve autonomous recording units and deployed four each in three forest types: old-growth forests in Kongura Reserve, mature managed forests (80–130 years of age) and premature managed forests (50–60 years of age). First, we verified that there were correlations between the acoustic indices and bird species richness detected by manual spectrogram scanning and listening of series of 3-min sound samples. Then, we compared the values of acoustic indices among the three forest types, finding higher bird species richness and abundance in old-growth forests and mature managed forests. We found no significant difference in the bird species composition in the three beech forest types, but more hole-nesting birds and species of conservation concern were identified in the old forests. We demonstrated that acoustic indices could be used for avian diversity monitoring and conservation management in mountain beech forests.",

In the course of molecular genetic analysis using four inter-primer binding site (iPBS) primers, 82 amplification fragments were detected. The difference between populations depends on the frequency of a particular allele allows us to separate the population from the Tylihul Estuary and all freshwater ones. The samples from the Dnipro River basin (Stuhna River and Dnipro Reservoir) related to different subclusters, which may indicate that the introduction of the pipefish into the Dnipro basin could have occurred several times and in different ways: 1. Natural range expansion; 2. Artificial acclimatisation; 3. Introduction with river transport. The differences in allele frequencies suggest the existence of populations with different origins in the Dnipro River, which can be explained by the introduction of this species from the delta areas of the Danube and Dniester (population from the Stuhna River) and self-settlement upstream of the Dnipro River (population from the Dnipro Reservoir).",

The movement patterns, length and width of the crawling paths and the azimuths of direction to sunlight were examined. Juvenile T. tridentatus at the seventh- to tenth-instars (95.5%, 21of 22) could emerge from sand and start to feed on beach surface. Their crawling trails did not follow a straight-line directed pattern; D : Wall was 0.52±1.99; 0.1–0.83 (mean ± s.d.; range). The juveniles rarely faced the sunlight when departing from the starting point or stayed at the end-point of crawling paths. We first detected a lateral phototaxis tendency of juvenile T. tridentatus that was more often with a body lateral to the sunlight than a direct orientation of head towards (81.8% and 18.2%, Binomial test, N = 22, P &lt; 0.01). Their body left-side was more frequently exposed in direction to sunlight the right-side (75% and 25%, Binomial test, N = 24, P &lt; 0.01). We suppose that such a lateral phototaxis and related movement patterns are adaptive foraging strategies of juveniles of T. tridentatus.",

Any potential adverse impacts of altered natural clinoptilolite on the regular physiological processes of animals were evaluated. Sixty male ICR laboratory mice, aged approximately 6–8 weeks, were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Both groups underwent a 45-day testing period, during which the experimental group was given rodent food mixed with 12.5% modified natural clinoptilolite from the Beli Plast deposit, Bulgaria. Sampling was carried out on days 0, 15, 30 and 45, with each time point providing samples for morpho-physiological and haematological studies, the oxidative stress on the base of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) measurements in liver and kidney so as the assessment of gene toxicity via the micronucleus test. All animals used in the experiment survived until the end of the study, gained weight and showed good activity and vital signs. The mice supplemented with clinoptilolite showed 21% higher body weight gain compared to the control group. Furthermore, there were no established signs of gene toxicity, pathological changes in the levels of oxidative stress and haematological parameters. These results suggest that using clinoptilolite as a food supplement does not lead to observable toxicities and even improves growth performance. Owing to its elevated sorption potential, this method is appropriate for purging the mammalian organism of toxins, with negligible adverse outcomes.",

Since the altitudinal distribution and habitat preferences of these species in the country make them potentially vulnerable to agricultural activities, the primary aim was to establish what part of the known records of each species falls within agricultural lands. Results indicated that all five studied species inhabit CLC types falling within the general type “Agricultural areas” (CLC Level 1: 2), with four species predominantly occurring in such regions. In total, three species (Bombina bombina, Triturus cristatus and T. ivanbureschi) had more than 50% of their distribution records in agricultural areas. In another species, Triturus dobrogicus, the percentage was above 40%. The lowest number (under 36%) was for B. variegata. For T. dobrogicus, nearly 32% of all records were concentrated in the CLC Level 3 category “Non-irrigated arable lands”. This data suggests that a large percentage of the populations of these protected species across Bulgaria are potentially exposed to agricultural practices such as pesticide use, or crop land aggregation and highlight the need for regional approach for species protection.",

Our aim was to investigate the seasonal and sexual differences in trapping success of C. elburzensis and evaluate the efficiency of different bait types. Singlecapture custom-made mesh live traps were set for 16 trials. We had 48 captures of C. elburzensis: 27 adults, nine subadults, and 12 juvenile males and females. Capture rates were 47.9% and 52.1% in spring and summer, respectively. Overall capture number was 25 (52.1%) individuals for males and 23 (47.9%) individuals for females. Sunflower seeds were more effective in capturing than any other bait. Trapping success averaged at11.95±0.5%. More adult males were trapped during the mating season (in spring), whereas more adult females were caught during the lactating period (in summer). There was no overall difference between male and female captures. However, there was a significant difference in the number of captures between males and females when using different baits: seeds captured more females and fruits more males. Further studies are required to investigate the population dynamics and the success of trapping with different baits in varying habitats for Calomyscus species, for most of which limited scientific data are available.",

Koch, 1833); Prosthesima rufipes Thorell, 1875 n. syn. = Poecilochroa senilis (O.P.-Cambridge, 1872); Zelotes kukushkini Kovblyuk, 2006 n. syn. = Zelotes fuscus (Thorell, 1875); Deliriosa karadagensis Kovblyuk, 2009 n. syn. = Deliriosa chiragrica (Thorell, 1875) n. comb. for Tarentula chiragrica Thorell, 1875. In addition it was found that a record of Zelotes femellus from Crimea actually refers to Zelotes hermani (Chyzer, 1897). Lectotype made is designated for Zelotes fuscus. Diagnostic figures for Zelotes fuscus and Deliriosa chiragrica are provided.",

Only one male specimen of Testudo graeca ibera Pallas, 1814, was found and marked. The age structure was skewed, low juvenile/ female ratio - 0.19 pointed at an alarming decline of population density. Detailed, continuous observa- tions over the seasonal and daily activity level, territorial and courtship behaviour were conducted in the field and within the enclosed protected 2000 sq. m area. Seven adult females, 3 males and 12 hatchlings were the object of detailed observations in the enclosed protected area. The actual nest excavation and the egg laying process were precisely described, along with some unusual behaviour, the preferred time for nesting was assumedly established. Monitoring of temperatures during incubation period of a natural nest was carried out and the results were compared with the ones measured in an artificial incubator environ - ment. Detailed description of the hatchlings and their development and growth rate during the first 90 days was made.",

The linear and weight growth were described very well by thecorresponding Von Bertalanffy's equations. However, neither k and Lr parameters of the equations nor their derivatives (w=kLr, f=logk+2logL r ) can be used for comparing fish growth. The growth rate of rudd from different water bodies was compared by the average values of body length calculated at the same age. 78 populations from the whole species range were compared. The rudd in the Batak Reservoir had moderate growth rate and the rudd in the Ovcharitsa Cooling-Reservoir - very high growth rate. Mean weights calculated by the equation W=aL b at the same round length values were used as condition factors of different populations. The populations were arranged according to their average weights calculated at the same initial lengths (50 mm) (W 5 0 ). The following tendency is observed: with the increase of L values (50, 100, etc., mm) the values of W come closer to each other, then become equal, and at L over 250 mm the first populations have the highest W values and the last populations - the lowest W values. This inverse relation can be described by the equation W 3 0 0 =929.26W 5 0 -0.244, r=-0.50, n=12.",

This is the first ichthyological investigation in Ukraine to use non-invasive eDNA analysis. Gillnet sampling took place at four localities between March and August in 2019 to 2021, while water was sampled for eDNA at 15 localities in October2022 and May 2023, the samples being preserved and sent to a laboratory for further analysis. Twenty-nine fish species were registered using gillnet sampling, and twenty-eight fish taxa and two species complexes using eDNA. While eDNA confirmed four taxa absent in gillnet samples, 13 species recorded using gillnets were not detected using eDNA. Seven taxa (21% of total fish fauna) were non-indigenous, which could prove critical for the Natural Protected Area. Although species composition determined by the two methods was relatively similar, use of eDNA made it possible to estimate species composition and relative frequency with higher accuracy. Parallel studies using eDNA and standard fishing tools could help identify a greater number of species; however, such studies would be complicated, especially in lakes overgrown with macrophytes or in Natural Protected Areas.",

They are measured by a set of metrics in a model area of abandoned agricultural lands in different stages of vegetation succession. Under such conditions, the edge effect proved to be а significant factor for the species composition. The established specific preferences of the farmland and forest specialists as well as the generalist species in four landscape classes (Open Landscapes, Shrubland, Open Forest and Forest) contribute to better understanding of the causes of changes in breeding population trends. These data allow predicting the impact on the habitat bird guilds when developing landscape management plans for protected areas or conservation measures for priority bird species. This approach can increase the effectiveness of the implementation of European agri-environmental measures.",

Of the seven species that made up the owl prey, Myotis nattereri (9 cases) and Plecotus auritus (6 cases) were by far the most numerous. The proportion of bats in the vertebrate prey was very low. In the central and north-eastern parts of the country, it was 0.05% between 1980 and 2002 and 0.04% between 2010 and 2024, although the differences were not statistically significant. The hypothesis that bat species associated with foraging in open areas are more abundant in the diet of this owl species, which hunts mainly in agricultural landscapes, could not be confirmed. The vast majority of prey were species that hunt near trees, in forests or over bodies of water. This indicates that the bats are mostly caught in situations other than typical foraging, e.g. near their roosts or resting places of owls. The fact that typical forest bats (Myotis bechsteinii, Barbastella barbastellus) were found in the winter diet of A. otus suggests that they were caught near underground hibernacula, which may be located in open areas away from forests.",

    "abstract": "We applied radio-telemetry on 21 individuals (10 females and 11 males) to provide data on the temporal activity patterns of the whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) in the Carpathian Mountains (southern Poland). We tested whether sex, season and weather conditions affect their activity patterns in July-September. On average, whiskered bats left day roosts 18.9 minutes after sunset and returned to roosts 198.1 minutes before sunrise. The mean length of activity was 330 minutes (SE±25) per night. Bats were active mainly (85%) during the whole night; they rarely (15% of nights) interrupted foraging and returned to their roosts for 10-60 minutes. Their activity peaked between the 2nd and the 3rd hour after sunset, when 76% of individuals foraged. Duration of activity varied between sexes. In females, it was one hour longer and noticeably increased from July to August. Males, but not females, shortened their activity again in September. However, due to high individual variation, differences in activity patterns between sexes were insignificant. Mean night temperature (positive effect) and duration of rainfalls (negative effect) best explained the variation in whiskered bats’ activity. Our study delivered further evidence of the importance of weather conditions for the foraging activity of insectivorous bats in temperate environments.",

Despite intensive human activities in the vicinity of crows’ nests, we did not record aggression toward humans or pet animals, indicating that attacks are rare before fledglings leave their nests. In addition, vocalisation by crows was affected by the number of conspecifics in the nest vicinity but not by the human presence or activities.",

The difference between populations depends on the frequency of a particular allele allows us to separate the population from the Tylihul Estuary and all freshwater ones. The samples from the Dnipro River basin (Stuhna River and Dnipro Reservoir) related to different subclusters, which may indicate that the introduction of the pipefish into the Dnipro basin could have occurred several times and in different ways: 1. Natural range expansion; 2. Artificial acclimatisation; 3. Introduction with river transport. The differences in allele frequencies suggest the existence of populations with different origins in the Dnipro River, which can be explained by the introduction of this species from the delta areas of the Danube and Dniester (population from the Stuhna River) and self-settlement upstream of the Dnipro River (population from the Dnipro Reservoir).",

The study is carried out between July 2017 and June 2019. We used 38 camera traps, which stayed in the field for 5279 days. From the collected photos and videos, 5001 independent registrations were identified: 2551 for red deer, 1266 for roe deer and 1184 for wild boar. We defined five groups to study the sex and age structure of the herds: F – female adult individuals; M – male adults individuals; S – young up to 2 years; FJS – females with offspring and young and mixed – individuals by both sex and different age. We found that all three species are more active at night in autumn. We observed higher daytime activity for red deer in spring, for roe deer in winter, and for wild boar in summer. The overlap of their daily activities is greatest in summer and least in spring. A different frequency of occurrence of the five types of herds was found in the studied ungulates during the various seasons, as well as a difference in diurnal activity mainly between the herds with females and the other herds. The lowest percentage of mixed herds in winter we registered in herds of red deer compared to those of roe deer and wild boar. This study shows that the activity patterns of the three ungulates are significantly influenced by species-specific features, season and anthropogenic activity. The greater nocturnal activity of the studied ungulates in autumn is due to the hunting season and the accompanying increased restlessness of the animals. The present research may benefit the sustainable management and protection of game populations in the future.",

This study was conducted in 2020, from September 16th to October 15th, at the Zhuanglang Musk Deer Farm in Gansu Province of China. We recorded behaviours of 41 captive Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) (in 12 enclosures) using the integrated methods of focal sampling and all occurrence recording for sociability analysis, while non-invasive sampling methods and radioimmunoassay were used to collect and measure faecal cortisol level. The relationship between the sociability of captive Alpine musk deer and faecal cortisol hormone was analysed. The results showed that the sociability of captive Alpine musk deer was 14.754% (± 3.026%) (n=41). Individuals in high-density enclosures (19.090% ± 4.497%, n=26) were significantly more sociable as compared to those in low-density enclosures (7.979% ± 2.640%, n=15; P=0.011). The cortisol level of Alpine musk deer was 109.215 (± 5.349) ng/g (n=41). The cortisol level of female individuals (120.419 ± 11.103 ng/g, n=14) was significantly higher than that of male individuals (103.406 ± 5.575 ng/g, n=27; P=0.008). The male musk deer in high sociability (44.114% ± 9.364%, n=8) had lower faecal cortisol levels (102.415 ± 14.885 ng/g, n=8) than those in low sociability (5.518% ± 1.369%, n=19) (103.823 ± 5.243 ng/g, n=19), however these differences were not significant (P=0.911). The female musk deer in high sociability (20.556% ± 2.174%, n=3) had significantly lower (P=0.035) faecal cortisol levels (77.018 ± 17.036 ng/g, n=3) than those in low sociability (7.773% ± 1.595%, n=11) (132.256 ± 11.079 ng/g, n=11), which could be related to maternal care and weaning period. It is suggested that the enclosing density should be increased to improve captive Alpine musk deer’s (especially female musk deer) sociability in the domestication of musk deer.",

We studied 206 birds from the museum collections of the Sitnyakovo Palace (Rila Mnt.) and the National Museum of Natural History, (Bulgarian Academy of Sciences). The age of the birds was determined by the shape of the beak, the shape of the outer feathers of tail, the length of the beak, the length of the beak furrow and the height of the beak at the base. For each of the characteristics used, we divided the birds into three age classes: juvenile (up to 14 months), subadult (between 14 and 60 months) and adult (over 60 months). Of all individuals studied, 92 (44.7%) were juveniles, 64 (31.1%) were subadults and 50 (24.3%) were adults. We found an inconsistency in determining the age of individuals using only one of the characteristics. We proposed to use the angle of curvature of the beak for the age determination. We recommend introducing the requirement to examine more somatometric characteristics in the rare cases when shooting of capercaillies is allowed. This will allow the correct estimation of the age of capercaillies and the accumulation of database information, which will be useful for the management of this difficult to be studied and economically important species.",

    "abstract": "The red mullet Mullus barbatus holds significant ecological and economic value within the Black Sea fisheries. However, similar to numerous other species, the stocks of red mullet are currently being harvested at levels that are not sustainable. The knowledge of the genetic diversity is an essential prerequisite for maintenance of the resources of this species as well as for understanding its adaptation to various environmental pressures. In this case study, nine microsatellite markers were used to evaluate the genetic population structure of M. barbatus along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. This investigation represents the initial assessment of such genetic patterns in this particular geographic area. Totally, 80 specimens were genotyped from two locations along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast, revealing 122 alleles. For the samples from both locations, the mean values of observed and expected heterozygosity were rather high (Ho = 0.628 and He = 0.696 for Balgarevo; Ho = 0.672 and He = 0.716 for Sveti Vlas), indicating a high level of genetic diversity. Our results showed a substantial level of migration occurring among populations of the studied species. The low Fst value (0.007) is primarily related to within-population variation (90.81%) and implies a low level of population differentiation.

Red mullet is a widely distributed and commercially important demersal fish species in the Black Sea. This makes it a promising bioindicator for the state of the marine environment and ecosystem health. This study aimed to investigate the effect of seasonal variations in the marine environment on OS in red mullet from four sites on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast – Kavarna, Kamchiya, St. Vlas and Sozopol. Most of the measured OS biomarkers displayed seasonal variations in the two studied fish organs – liver and gills. In autumn, higher lipid peroxidation levels and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were presented in the liver of fish from all studied sites. In gills, higher activity of SOD, CAT, GST, and acetylcholinesterase were measured in the summer. In conclusion, the significant local variability of the sea environment quality induced different levels of OS in autumn in the fish liver and in summer in the gills for all studied sites. The measured seasonal fluctuations in the red mullet’s OS biomarkers can be successfully used for biomonitoring and environmental marine risk assessment.",

Decreased ghrelin levels correlate with obesity, insulin resistance and elevated blood pressure, which are components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). The effect of physical exercise is studied mainly after an already induced MetS, the results are contradictory and it is not clear what the effect of exercise on ghrelin concentration is. There are no data for gender comparisons of changes in ghrelin due to submaximal training. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of submaximal training on serum ghrelin concentrations during the dietary induction of MetS in female and male rats. Dietary-manipulated female and male Wistar rats (n = 32) were used. They were divided into four groups: male and female sedentary (MD and FD) and male and female trained on treadmill (MDT and FDT). For 16 weeks, the four groups received high-fat high-carbohydrate (HFHC) food and both MDT and FDT simultaneously with the diet were subjected to submaximal training (70-75% VO2max). At the end of the experiment, mixed blood was collected and ghrelin concentrations were measured. The submaximal training and gender had a significant main effect on ghrelin levels, as trained dietary-manipulated rats had higher serum concentrations compared to the sedentary (p &lt; 0.05) and males had higher concentrations compared to females (p &lt; 0.05). Overall, applied for 16 weeks, simultaneously with the combined HFHC diet, the submaximal training had a positive effect, lowering the serum ghrelin concentration. Sexual dimorphism, characterised by higher ghrelin in male rats, was also found.",

We determined that the superspecies N. ehrenbergi and N. xanthodon contain a mixture of cryptic species distributed in the Anatolian part of Turkey. Our study indicated a fundamental split between two groups, one consisting of populations of N. ehrenbergi from the South-eastern Anatolia and the other including the remaining taxa (N. xanthodon and N. leucodon) from the remaining regions of Anatolia and from Thrace. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that there were two new unnamed cryptic species (2n=48–52 cytotype group and 2n=56 cytotype group) within the superspecies N. ehrenbergi that were reciprocally monophyletic. We reviewed species identified by traditional morphological methods to determine their taxonomic validity. We suggest that N. cilicicus (stat. n.), which is endemic to the central Anatolia, has to be considered a distinct species and not a synonym of N. xanthodon.",

The sensory trap hypothesis proposes that males exploit the maternal care instinct of females by a close resemblance to a wrapped gift with an egg sac. We predict that if the sensory trap hypothesis works, then females should not feed on egg sacs and should adopt and carry them after copulation finishes. There were no differences in mating behaviour in terms of latency to copulation, copulation duration, wrapping prey/egg sacs with silk or with the likelihood of holding gifts/egg sacs by females after copulation. Females consumed approximately 23% of the egg sacs during copulation (mean = 0.016 g, 95% CI [0.01–0.02]). None of the females who received an egg sac during mating continued to care for it. We conclude that the production of gifts by males correlates with female foraging needs, and the silk wrapping of prey during courtship in P. mirabilis did not evolve as a sensory trap.",

This is especially true for the species that frequently occur in smaller and transient habitats such as Aplexa hypnorum (Linnaeus, 1758), Physa fontinalis (Linnaeus, 1758), Anisus (Disculifer) vorticulus (Troschel, 1834), Hippeutis complanatus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Segmentina nitida (O.F. Müller, 1774). Our survey of various smaller habitats in the Pannonian part of Serbia took place in 2021 and 2022 and included 11 sites. One or more of the above-mentioned snail species were found at nine of these sites. Of particular interest are the findings of A. hypnorum, the species whose last and only confirmed finding dated back to the beginning of the 20th century. In total, we present three new localities of A. hypnorum and S. nitida. The number of known localities of A. vorticulus and H. complanatus has doubled (now seven and eight localities respectively). Physa fontinalis, a native species once quite common in the Pannonian areas, is with a declining frequency. During our survey, an abundant population of P. fontinalis was found at a new site. The results presented suggest that a comprehensive survey focusing on smaller and neglected habitats is necessary to fill the gaps in our knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of the freshwater gastropod fauna in Serbia.",

Netting was performed in July and August 2023 at 14 sites situated near water bodies and at 14 sites remote from waters. In total, 396 individuals belonging to 11 species were caught. Tracks were most often used by Eptesicus serotinus, Myotis daubentonii and Pipistrellus pygmaeus (55% of all caught bats). Eptesicus serotinus and Barbastella barbastellus were more numerous on tracks remote from waters. The group of species known to feed over waters or in riparian habitats (M. daubentonii, N. noctula and Pipistrellus spp.) was represented more frequently on tracks near waters. Forest tracks in the studied landscape are important feeding grounds and corridors for commuting to feeding grounds for many bat species.",

The study was conducted in three similar wetland landscapes: Ayata, Merdjadja and Sidi Slimane. Sampling was implemented using 24 live-traps at each station based on the Random Sampling Design. The sampled species belonged to the family Muridae. The three sampled localities demonstrated differences and similarities in terms of species composition. To describe the diversity of rodent’s communities, the species richness (S), relative abundance, relative frequency and the Shannon-Weaver Index were used. In Ayata Lake, the subfamily Murinae dominated, represented by Mus musculus L., 1758 (50%) and Rattus rattus L., 1758. InMerdjadja Lake, the subfamily Gerbillinae dominated, with Gerbillus nanus Blanford, 1875 (36.67%) and G. tarabuli Thomas, 1902 (20.00%). In the Sidi Slimane Wetland, the Gerbillinae was the dominant subfamily, represented by Gerbillus tarabuli (41.17%), G. nanus Blanford, 1875 (29.41%) and G. gerbillus Olivier, 1800 (11.76%). Only one individual of Meriones libycus Lichtenstein, 1823 was captured at the Sidi Slimane Wetland.",

    "abstract": "Home range size, dispersal and activity of wolves were studied for the first time in Bulgaria using radio-telemetry. In 2005–2009, three wolves (two males and one female), were equipped with VHF collars and radio-tracked in the south-western part of the country, in the Pirin and Maleshevska Mts. The first male (WM1), estimated as 8–9 years old, was tracked for 1.5 months, covering a small area of 10.3 km2 (100% MCP). Home ranges of a female (WF1, 1 y old) and a second male (WM2, 1.5 y old), when resident in their natal packs, were 93.1 km2 and 139.7 km2, respectively, (100% MCP) (mean = 116.4 km2). The core areas (50% KDE) were 35 and 59.9 km2 (mean = 47.5 km2). Both WF1 and WM2 dispersed from their natal packs (mean dispersal distance of 33.1 km) but were killed by humans before settling and reproducing. During dispersal, WF1 was never recorded crossing main roads or other urbanised areas. In contrast, WM2 crossed the non-fenced international road E79 and the railway through the Kresna Gorge, at least 11 times. WF1 and WM2 were active in 45.1% and 44.9% (mean = 45%) of the time recorded, with pronounced crepuscular patterns. The results of the present work are a contribution to the study of the wolf population spatial ecology in Bulgaria and can serve for the better management of the species and its long-term conservation.",

Escape latency at capture and response to a novel environment and a new object in captivity were assessed. Slow worms of A. fragilis were more exploratory than A. colchica but no difference in risk-taking between the two species was found. Probably the higher exploratory activity of A. fragilis, compared to A. colchica, could be connected to its wider vertical distribution and greater diversity of habitat occupancy.",

Three species out of the 25 registered taxa were recorded with significantly higher densities: Dreissena carinata (14400 ind./m2), Gammarus triacanthus prespensis (4950 ind./m2) and Pyrgohydrobia prespaensis (4425 ind./m2). The results could contribute in obtaining a better understanding of the vertical and horizontal distribution, seasonal fluctuations in the population densities and the general state of the benthic fauna of this locality of high conservational importance.",

    "abstract": "Plastic pollution of marine environments has become a global problem. Microplastics have the potential to bioaccumulate in marine biota and ecosystems. Depending on their bioavailability and size, they can be potentially dangerous to the health of organisms and ecosystems. This study aimed to assess microplastics bioaccumulation in bivalve species from the hypereutrophic Varna Lake. Totally, 58 bivalves of three species (Mya arenaria, Mytilus galloprovincialis and Cerastroderma glaucum) were collected from Varna Lake. The most common type of microplastics were fragments (61.54%) followed by fibres (15.38%), microbeads (11.54%), films and sponge/foam. Microplastics were recovered in 60 % of M. galloprovincialis (1.73±2.09 part/ind.), 58 % of M. arenaria (1.77±2.27 part/ind.), and 29 % of C. glaucum (0.35±0.61 part/ind.). The lowest number of microplastics was identified in C. glaucum (0–2 part/ind.) while M. galloprovincialis (0–6 part/ind.) and M. arenaria (0–8 part/ind.) presented almost equal content. The most frequent plastic colour was blue (26.92 %) followed by red (25.64 %), grey (15.38 %), black (12.82 %) and green (10.26 %). Our study reveals the first evaluation of the uptake, level of accumulation, shape, colour and size class of microplastics by three native bivalve species in Varna Lake. Much more research is needed for a more precise assessment of the patterns of bioaccumulation and the effects of microplastics in marine bivalves.",

    "abstract": "The goby fish is dominant in tropical mangrove estuaries like Xuan Thuy National Park in Vietnam, where fishing is allowed in the core area, but the lack of regulations targeting specific species and landing sizes contributes to bycatch issues. To address this, we conducted a one-year survey to investigate non-target and undersized fish bycatch. Based on collections using a series trap nets from March 2018 to February 2019, it revealed a relatively diverse goby community consisting of 28 species, with the most abundant being Glossogobius olivaceus and Bostrychus sinensis in the study site. Among the captured species, 16 (57.14%) had no economic value and were bycatch. Additionally, between 5.46% and 92.31% of individuals from each species had a standard length below the optimum length, including the three primary target species, B. sinensis, G. olivaceus, and G. giuris, with 88.81%, 90.95%, and 92.31% of individuals being smaller than the optimum length. The goby community in the study area faces severe bycatch issues concerning both non-target species and undesired size. As the body depth – standard length relation model estimated the optimum body depth of target species to be larger than 15 mm when the optimum length is used, we propose using fishing gear with a mesh size of 15 mm for sustainable fishing.",

    "abstract": "Sociability indicates the variances of affinity and solitary among animals and it is strongly correlated with cortisol levels. This study was conducted in 2020, from September 16th to October 15th, at the Zhuanglang Musk Deer Farm in Gansu Province of China. We recorded behaviours of 41 captive Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) (in 12 enclosures) using the integrated methods of focal sampling and all occurrence recording for sociability analysis, while non-invasive sampling methods and radioimmunoassay were used to collect and measure faecal cortisol level. The relationship between the sociability of captive Alpine musk deer and faecal cortisol hormone was analysed. The results showed that the sociability of captive Alpine musk deer was 14.754% (± 3.026%) (n=41). Individuals in high-density enclosures (19.090% ± 4.497%, n=26) were significantly more sociable as compared to those in low-density enclosures (7.979% ± 2.640%, n=15; P=0.011). The cortisol level of Alpine musk deer was 109.215 (± 5.349) ng/g (n=41). The cortisol level of female individuals (120.419 ± 11.103 ng/g, n=14) was significantly higher than that of male individuals (103.406 ± 5.575 ng/g, n=27; P=0.008). The male musk deer in high sociability (44.114% ± 9.364%, n=8) had lower faecal cortisol levels (102.415 ± 14.885 ng/g, n=8) than those in low sociability (5.518% ± 1.369%, n=19) (103.823 ± 5.243 ng/g, n=19), however these differences were not significant (P=0.911). The female musk deer in high sociability (20.556% ± 2.174%, n=3) had significantly lower (P=0.035) faecal cortisol levels (77.018 ± 17.036 ng/g, n=3) than those in low sociability (7.773% ± 1.595%, n=11) (132.256 ± 11.079 ng/g, n=11), which could be related to maternal care and weaning period. It is suggested that the enclosing density should be increased to improve captive Alpine musk deer’s (especially female musk deer) sociability in the domestication of musk deer.",

It was based on abundance estimates of rodents considered the main prey of the Marbled and the Steppe polecats in Bulgaria: the European ground squirrel, the lesser blind mole-rat, and the voles. Most of the sampling sites were characterized by low abundance of all three investigated prey species. Differences in rodent species’ abundance were observed among regions. Among the five examined regions, West Central Bulgaria, which exhibits the highest occurrence of the marbled polecat, is characterized by the most abundant prey, although the optimal prey was not present in the studied sites. Our results suggest that in the western part of its range the distribution of the marbled polecat may not be as reliant on the presence of the European ground squirrel as traditionally assumed. Being simple and unexpensive the proposed transect method for assessment of the polecats’ prey abundance is suitable for conservation purposes and national or regional monitoring.",

While virtually all injected L. dispar died, with ST50s (median survival times for 50% of insects injected with the two isolates) of six - seven days, only 65.6-86.7% of the injected L. monacha died, with ST50s of 11-17 days. Both isolates produced conidia and resting spores more frequently within dead L. dispar than L. monacha. In more ecologically relevant host range assays, larvae of both species were exposed to germinating soil-borne E. maimaiga resting spores in the laboratory. More L. dispar than L. monacha larvae died after these exposures. However, while resting spores were formed within 100% of L. dispar larvae that died, significantly fewer (10%) dead L. monacha contained resting spores. When L. monacha larvae were collected during an E. maimaiga epizootic occurring in a sympatric L. dispar population, only 0.2 % of the L. monacha died and produced spores.

The results corroborate the monophyly of T. karelinii and confirm that all Iranian and Azerbaijan populations belong to the same species. Genetic distances (K2-p) between Iranian T. karelinii and other Triturus species was relatively high, (7–25% for ND4 and 8–19% for cytb).

Since information about its distribution and echolocation was very limited, the author conducted a series of bat surveys in northwestern Vietnam with an emphasis on this species between 2022 and 2023. Bats were captured using harp traps and mist nets then identified in the field based on their morphological diagnoses. Echolocation calls were recorded under three different situations (free-flying while emerging from caves, handheld, and flying within a flight tent) using the PCTape system. A colony of the species was discovered in Son La Province. The adults of this colony were found to be considerably larger than all individuals described in previous publications. The species emits multiharmonic calls with the most energy in the second harmonic. Each usual call comprises two components: a constant-frequency (CF) component followed by a downward frequency-modulated terminal sweep (tFM). Special calls, which were not mentioned in any literature, were recorded in-between usual calls. Each special call comprises three distinct components: an upward frequency-modulated initial sweep (iFM) followed by a CF and a tFM. The frequency of the CF component and the pulse duration of the adult bats from Son La Province are higher and longer than those in published descriptions. The present study results indicate that H. khaokhouayensis emits a single call or calls in groups up to seven signals. The new distributional record, morphological features and echolocation characteristics demonstrated herewith, provide essential information for monitoring and conservation of this vulnerable species at national and international scales.",

A total of 40 trail cameras were deployed for 1,025 trap nights in different watersheds of the park territory. The species was photo-captured at seven stations during 11 capture events. The camera-trapping results showed that SKFS was present in the central and western parts of the park. The photo-captured history of the species shows nocturnal activity between 20:00 to 3:00 hrs. Based on photo-captured data, we assume that moon phases do not affect the activity of SKFS in MDNP. Rainfall had a negative impact, while the temperature was directly correlated with the species’ activity. Current research has helped to redefine this species’ range, as its presence was confirmed about 38 km from the IUCN nearest declared range.",

Firstly, LC50 values of flubendiamide on G. pulex were determined at 16, 18 and 20 °C as 256.83 ± 19.59 µgL-1, 169.38 ± 34.17 µgL-1 and 155.84 ± 17.22 µgL-1, respectively. We found that the acute toxicity sensitivity of the test organism to the pesticide containing flubendiamide increased with increasing temperature. Secondly, G. pulex was exposed to non-lethal concentrations of flubendiamide pesticide for 96 hours at the above temperatures. Finally, the changes in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activity were determined for each temperature using ELISA kits. The exposure time between the 24th and 96th h at the same temperature was found to be statistically insignificant (p˃0.05). It was determined that the inhibition value of AChE enzyme activity on the test organism of the pesticide with active ingredient flubendiamide increased depending on the temperature increase. Considering the changes in AChE enzyme activities in G. pulex at different temperatures against flubendiamide insecticide, it was concluded that it can be used as a useful biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Most of the anuran tadpoles spend their early phase of life in aquatic medium. In such system, they respond to a wide variety of stimuli (e.g., tactile, chemical and visual cues) and exhibit appropriate behavioural responses. The ability to detection food and predator was studied in the tadpoles of the bicolored frog, Clinotarsus curtipes in the laboratory by using a rectangular glass test tank with end compartments (stimulus zones) providing exclusively visual and/or chemical food (boiled spinach) or predator (Laccotrephes sp.) cues. A test tadpole, C. curtipes (either starved or fed; Gosner stage 25) was held at the centre of the test tank for 5 min (acclimation) to perceive visual and/or chemical food or predator cues. Then it was released from the centre of the test tank and allowed to associate or stay away from the caged stimulus subjects (food or predator), which were placed at one end of the test tank either in a glass beaker (visual cues) or in a mesh cage wrapped with cheese cloth (chemical cues) for a period of 10 min. The test tadpoles were unable to detect both food and predator through visual cues. They spent almost an equal amount of time in the zone housing food or predator in a glass beaker or opposite zone, which was kept empty. However, they detected both food and predator solely through chemical cues. In tests with chemical food cues, they spent a significantly higher period of time (70.42% of total time) near chemical food cues rather than empty or visual food cues. In contrast, in tests with chemical predator cues, they spent the majority of their time (69.32% of total time) away from the chemical predator cues. The findings thus show that C. curtipes tadpoles detect both food and predator solely through chemical cues rather than visual cues.",

Six limiting anthropogenic factors were identified: disturbance caused by fishermen and tourists (16.44 %), forestry works (4.11 %), illegal cutting of the tree supporting the nest (1.37 %), construction of a fishing hut near the nest (1.37 %), fires (1.37 %) and agricultural works and human presence (1.37 %).

    "abstract": "The study of fish diet composition can provide valuable information on the ecology and ethology of wild populations, even more so in the case of endangered species such as Black Sea sturgeons. The area off the Danube mouths (Western Black Sea shelf, Romania) represents a traditional feeding ground of the family Acipenseridae. At the same time, in recent years, the marine zone of the Danube Delta has become targeted by beam-trawl fisheries of the invasive gastropod Rapana venosa, with a potential destructive impact on benthic habitats. In this context, the present study aimed at mapping of sturgeon foraging areas in order to propose appropriate management measures. Zoobenthos samples and stomach contents were analysed in order to identify the feeding preferences of the three sturgeon species investigated (Huso huso, Acipenser gueldenstaedtii and Acipenser stellatus). Stomach contents samples were collected from 15 individuals using the non-invasive technique of gastric lavage. Zoobenthos samples were taken from the same sampling points, as well as from the established zoobenthos sampling area covering the 20–40 m isobath of the Danube Delta – marine zone (ROSCI0066). The study revealed that A. gueldenstaedtii prefers food items belonging to the group Bivalvia, H. huso mostly feeds on fish and molluscs while, in A. stellatus, the highest dominance was achieved by polychaetes. Overall, a high dominance of polychaetes was recorded in both zoobenthos samples and sturgeon stomach contents, with the highest Index of Relative Importance (IRI – 45.60%) in A. stellatus. The study indicated that food availability played an important role in fish diet selection. Fish also recorded a high IRI (23.90%) in the food array of the three sturgeon species, while molluscs recorded an IRI of 13.90%. The identified foraging areas were subsequently mapped using a GIS software, ultimately aiming at providing a sound scientific background for an ecosystem–based management of these valuable species, taking into account the potential impact of invasive fishing methods (beam-trawling) on the feeding habitats of sturgeons.",

The results showed that rainbow trout reproduce successfully in the sampled river stretch. Vital specimens at stages of egg and fry development were found through the whole period, from February to April.

Four invertebrate species were cosmopolitan and were found in all sampling sites. The ecological analysis demonstrated the difference in the vegetation and invertebrate diversity of the natural and degraded landscapes of the Saskhori Quarry differentiated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Cluster analysis based on the Jaccard similarity coefficient separated the diversity of the degraded landscapes (1) using combined data of the vegetation and invertebrate diversity and (2) using only the diversity data of invertebrates. The latter analyses, along with the other statistical methods used (SIMPER and ISA), proved the habitat specificity of the invertebrate species by revealing their specific distribution in the natural and degraded landscapes.",

Totally, 45 dens were studied. We measured the width, length of entrance and depth of the dens and considered the presence and type of bedding in each den. The elevation, aspect, slope, surrounding habitat and distance from roads, settlements and large rivers were analysed. The results showed that all located brown bear dens were in rock cavities, most often in high rocky terrain. Majority of dens were with a southern aspect and situated in forests close to large rivers. In Stara Planina, the dens were at higher altitudes while, in Rhodope Mts, they were at steeper slopes and were significantly closer to roads and settlements. These differences call for different management approaches in the regions of the two subpopulations in order to maximise the conservation efforts in each of them.",

Four 45-day experiments were conducted using laboratory mice. A control group was compared to three groups exposed to 0.00250M Pb(NO3)2 and 0.00125M Cd(NO3)2 solutions, applied in drinking water separately or in combination. As biomarkers of oxidative stress, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and total glutathione were evaluated, respectively, by using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances test (TBARS) and a colorimetric assay for total glutathione. The results demonstrated approximately 2-fold higher induction of MDA in the liver of Pb-exposed mice in comparison with Cd-exposed mice, combined with a slow but not statistically significant depletion of total glutathione. In the kidneys of the Cd-exposed mice, the highest accumulation of MDA was detected, accompanied by 1.5-fold glutathione depletion. Nevertheless, in groups exposed to Pb and Pb/Cd intoxication, an inducible increase in total glutathione was observed. These findings confirmed that Pb induces higher levels of oxidative stress in the liver while the kidneys suffered more oxidative damage due to Cd intoxication, attributable to the bioaccumulation profiles of the two toxic metals.",

In such system, they respond to a broad array of stimuli (tactile, chemical and visual cues) and exhibit suitable behavioural responses. The ability of detection of food and predator was studied in the tadpoles of the Indian skipper frog Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis in the laboratory setup by using a rectangular glass test tank with end compartments (stimulus zones) providing exclusively visual and and (or) chemical food (either boiled spinach or tadpoles of Duttaphrynus melanostictus) and predator (tadpoles of Hoplobatrachus tigerinus). A test tadpole E. cyanophlyctis was held at the centre of the test tank for 5 min (acclimation) to perceive visual and (or) chemical food or predator cues. Then it was released from the centre of the test tank and allowed to associate or stay away from the caged stimulus subjects (food or predator), which were placed at one end of the test tank either in a glass beaker (visual cues) or in a mesh cage wrapped with cheese cloth (chemical cues) for a period of 10 min. The test tadpoles failed to detect either food or predator through visual cues. They spent almost an equal amount of time in the zone housing food or predator in a glass beaker as compared to the opposite zone, which was kept empty. However, they detected both food and predator solely through chemical cues. In tests with chemical food cues (either boiled spinach or tadpoles of D. melanostictus), they spent the majority of their time (67.25 % of total time) near chemical food cues rather than empty or visual food cues. In contrast, in tests with chemical predator cues (tadpoles of H. tigerinus), they spent the majority of their time (68.89 % of total time) away from the chemical predator cues. Therefore, the findings show that E. cyanophlyctis tadpoles detect both food and predator through chemical sensory mechanism rather than visual ones.",

The present study aimed to characterize gastrointestinal parasites in G. cuvieri and to understand the relationship between seasonality factor and parasitic infection rates as well as to analyse their conservational importance in seasonally-variable environments in northern Algeria. Totally, 48 faecal samples were analysed and ten gastrointestinal parasite species were identified, representing seven species of gastrointestinal helminths and three species of parasitic protozoans. It was observed that the seasonal faecal samples were mostly infected with Nematodirus sp. (prevalence 97.9 %). The overall prevalence of Marshallagia sp. and Eimeria sp. were significantly very higher in rainfall season compared to harsh environmental season. The highest gastrointestinal parasite counts were recorded during and soon after peak rainfall, while the lowest value was in the dry season. These findings show that seasonality can be an important driver of gastrointestinal parasitic infections. It seems that observations such as the high prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites and intensity of the infection, especially in the winter season, should be specifically considered by the wildlife conservation officers. This study could be the key to success in the long-term conservation of this vulnerable species in its native range and in providing a wealth of new information about parasite biodiversity.",

Among the netted bats, Myotis brandtii and Barbastella barbastellus were the most numerous. The ultrasound recordings were dominated by the small Myotis spp., with only a little share of Pipistrellus spp. We found predominance of Myotis mystacinus/brandtii/alcathoe complex and significantly male-skewed sex ratio, both features typical for the bat assemblages of the higher mountain ranges (e.g., Carpathians). Comparison of individual rarefaction curves with the two other Polish montane national parks revealed, however, much faster species accumulation due to the lower altitude and milder climate. Capture data suggest elevational gradient of bat species composition, with a shift in the structure of the bat assemblages around 330 m a.s.l., resulting in formation of two zones. These zones roughly correspond to the belt of lowland oak-hornbeam forests and montane beech and fir forests. However, no such pattern was revealed by the acoustic survey.",

    "abstract": "The combined toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex was investigated. The 14-day LC50 values of fluoranthene, phenanthrene and their combination for G. pulex were determined as 5.88±0.23, 8.31±0.57 and 7.00±0.33 mg/L, respectively. To evaluate the single and combined toxicity, sublethal concentrations of fluoranthene, phenanthrene and their combination were exposed to G. pulex for 14 days. Acetylcholinesterase, glutathione-s-transferase and cytochrome P450 1A1 enzymes were measured as biomarkers. Acetylcholinesterase activities showed significant inhibition at the end of 7 and 14 days. No statistically significant change was observed in cytochrome P450 1A1 levels at the end of the 7th day, but a significant increase was detected at the end of the 14th day. A significant inhibition was observed in glutathione-s-transferase activities at the end of the 7th and 14th days. Statistically significant changes were observed in all parameters when the application times are compared. It was determined that G. pulex exposed to different concentrations of phenanthrene and fluoranthene individually and in combination caused significant changes in activites of the all measured enzymes. It was concluded that the cytochrome P450 1A1, glutathione-s-transferase and acetylcholinesterase enzymes in G. pulex are useful biochemical markers for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of changes in the leukogram of adult marsh frogs Pelophylax ridibundus inhabiting the polluted sedimentation lake of the Brikel Thermal Power Station (TPS), southern Bulgaria, as biomarkers for ecological stress is presented. For a comparison, data for frogs inhabiting a less disrupted habitat (reference site, RS) are presented. Leukopenia in the blood of individuals of P. ridibundus inhabiting the sedimentation lake of the Brikel TPS was detected but not in frogs from the reference site. Furthermore, the differential leukocyte count of the affected frogs was characterised by neutrophilia, eosinophilia, monocytosis, basopenia and lymphopenia. The values of the neutrophil-lymphocyte (N/L) ratio of the frogs from the lake of the Brikel TPS were higher than that of the ones inhabiting the RS. These changes in the leukogram are indicators of the exhaustion of the immune system and of activation of the organism’s defences in response to stress. The changes in the leukogram are interpreted as caused by the deteriorated water quality in the sedimentation lake as it contained toxicants (reactive water-soluble forms of nitrogen and phosphates) and industrial ash. The results from this study confirm the role of parameter changes in the leukogram of P. ridibundus as diagnostic biomarkers for ecological stress.",
