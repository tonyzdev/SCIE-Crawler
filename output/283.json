    "abstract": "In tropical algebraic geometry, the solution sets of polynomial equations are piecewise-linear. We introduce the tropical variety of a polynomial ideal, and we identify it with a polyhedral subcomplex of the Grobner fan. The tropical Grassmannian arises in this manner from the ideal of quadratic Plucker relations. It parametrizes all tropical linear spaces. Lines in tropical projective space are trees, and their tropical Grassmannian G2; n equals the space of phylogenetic trees studied by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann. Higher Grassmannians oer a natural generalization of the space of trees. Their faces correspond to monomial-free initial ideals of the Plucker ideal. The tropical Grassmannian G3; 6 is a simplicial complex glued from 1035 tetrahedra.",

It is a generalization not only of regular curves with linear independent condition, but also of Legendre curves in the unit tangent bundle. We define smooth functions for a framed curve, called the curvature of the framed curve, similarly to the curvature of a regular curve and of a Legendre curve. Framed curves may have singularities. The curvature of the framed curve is quite useful to analyse the framed curves and their singularities. In fact, we give the existence and the uniqueness for the framed curves by using their curvature. As applications, we consider a contact between framed curves, and give a relationship between projections of framed space curves and Legendre curves.",

More precisely, we construct a natural linear map from the former space to the latter and prove that it has dense image and infinite-dimensional kernel. The proof uses the author’s irreducibility theorem and properties of the real Monge–Ampère operators due to A.D. Alexandrov and Z. Blocki.

Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 354 (2002), 4285–4301]. Section 1 is introductory. In Section 2 we prove a basic lemma, Lemma 2.1, and use it to give new proofs of key technical results of Scheiderer in [C. Scheiderer, Sums of squares of regular functions on real algebraic varieties. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 352 (2000), 1039–1069] [C. Scheiderer, Sums of squares on real algebraic curves. Math. Z. 245 (2003), 725–760] in the compact case; see Corollaries 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5. Lemma 2.1 is also used in Section 3 where we continue the examination of the case n = 1 initiated in [S. Kuhlmann, M. Marshall, Positivity, sums of squares and the multi-dimensional moment problem. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 354 (2002), 4285–4301], concentrating on the compact case. In Section 4 we prove certain uniform degree bounds for representations in the case n = 1, which we then use in Section 5 to prove that (‡) holds for basic closed semi-algebraic subsets of cylinders with compact cross-section, provided the generators satisfy certain conditions; see Theorem 5.3 and Corollary 5.5. Theorem 5.3 provides a partial answer to a question raised by Schmüdgen in [K. Schmüdgen, On the moment problem of closed semi-algebraic sets. J. Reine Angew. Math. 558 (2003), 225–234]. We also show that, for basic closed semi-algebraic subsets of cylinders with compact cross-section, the sufficient conditions for (SMP) given in [K. Schmüdgen, On the moment problem of closed semi-algebraic sets. J. Reine Angew. Math. 558 (2003), 225–234] are also necessary; see Corollary 5.2(b). In Section 6 we prove a module variant of the result in [K. Schmüdgen, On the moment problem of closed semi-algebraic sets. J. Reine Angew. Math. 558 (2003), 225–234], in the same spirit as Putinar’s variant [M. Putinar, Positive polynomials on compact semi-algebraic sets. Indiana Univ. Math. J. 42 (1993), 969–984] of the result in [K. Schmüdgen, The K-moment problem for compact semi-algebraic sets. Math. Ann. 289 (1991), 203–206] in the compact case; see Theorem 6.1. We apply this to basic closed semi-algebraic subsets of cylinders with compact cross-section; see Corollary 6.4. In Section 7 we apply the results from Section 5 to solve two of the open problems listed in [S. Kuhlmann, M. Marshall, Positivity, sums of squares and the multi-dimensional moment problem. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 354 (2002), 4285–4301]; see Corollary 7.1 and Corollary 7.4. In Section 8 we consider a number of examples in the plane. In Section 9 we list some open problems.",

We apply our results in the specific case of ℝ n − {0} realized as the warped product (0, ∞) × r S n−1 , providing many new examples of densities where spheres about the origin are isoperimetric, including simple densities with finite volume, simple densities that at the origin are neither log-convex nor smooth, and non-simple densities. We also generalize the results of Kolesnikov and Zhdanov on large balls in Rn with increasing strictly log-convex simple density.

Barth and Nieto have shown that these varieties have Calabi-Yau models Z and Y , respectively. In this paper we apply the Weil conjectures to show that Y and Z are rigid and we prove that the L function of their common third étale cohomology group is modular, as predicted by a conjecture of Fontaine and Mazur. The corresponding modular form is the unique normalized cusp form of weight 4 for the group~ Γ 1 (6) . By Tate's conjecture, this should imply that Y , the fibred square of the universal elliptic curve~ S 1 (6) , and Verrill's rigid Calabi-Yau~ 𝒵 A 3 , which all have the same L function, are in correspondence over ℚ . We show that this is indeed the case by giving explicit maps.",

In particular, we introduce the Reeb commutator function and the Reeb Killing function, we define the new classes of canonical almost 3-contact metric manifolds and of 3-$(\\alpha,\\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds (including as special cases 3-Sasaki manifolds, quaternionic Heisenberg groups, and many others) and prove that the latter are hypernormal, thus generalizing a seminal result by Kashiwada. We study their behaviour under a new class of deformations, called $\\mathcal{H}$-homothetic deformations, and prove that they admit an underlying quaternionic contact structure, from which we deduce the Ricci curvature. For example, a 3-$(\\alpha,\\delta)$-Sasaki manifold is Einstein either if $\\alpha=\\delta$ (the 3-$\\alpha$-Sasaki case) or if $\\delta=(2n+3)\\alpha$, where $\\dim M=4n+3$. The second part is actually devoted to finding these adapted connections. We start with a very general notion of $\\varphi$-compatible connections, where $\\varphi$ denotes any element of the associated sphere of almost contact structures, and make them unique by a certain extra condition, thus yielding the notion of canonical connection (they exist exactly on canonical manifolds, hence the name). For 3-$(\\alpha,\\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds, we compute the torsion of this connection explicitly and we prove that it is parallel, we describe the holonomy, the $\\nabla$-Ricci curvature, and we show that the metric cone is a HKT-manifold. In dimension 7, we construct a cocalibrated $G_2$-structure inducing the canonical connection and we prove the existence of four generalized Killing spinors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hyperbolic polynomials elegantly encode a rich class of convex cones that includes polyhedral and spectrahedral cones. Hyperbolic polynomials are closed under taking polars and the corresponding cones-the derivative cones-yield relaxations for the associated optimization problem and exhibit interesting facial properties. While it is unknown if every hyperbolicity cone is a section of the positive semidefinite cone, it is natural to ask whether spectrahedral cones are closed under taking derivative cones. In this note we give an affirmative answer for polyhedral cones by exhibiting an explicit spectrahedral representation for the first derivative cone. We also prove that higher polars do not have a determinantal representation which shows that the problem for general spectrahedral cones is considerably more difficult",

A topological contact isotopy is not generated by a vector field; nevertheless, the group identities, the transformation law, and classical uniqueness results in the smooth case extend to topological contact isotopies and homeomorphisms, giving rise to an extension of smooth contact dynamics to topological dynamics. Our approach is via symplectization of a contact manifold, and our main tools are an energy-capacity inequality we prove for contact diffeomorphisms, combined with techniques from measure theory on oriented manifolds. We establish non-degeneracy of a Hofer-like bi-invariant pseudo-metric on the group of strictly contact diffeomorphisms constructed in [4]. The topological automorphism group of the contact structure exhibits rigidity properties analogous to those of symplectic diffeomorphisms, including C 0 -rigidity of contact and strictly contact diffeomorphisms.",

A computational approach to this problem was developed by Dietmaier in 1998 who used a local linearization procedure to move in the parameter space to change the number of real solutions. He used this approach to show that there exists a Stewart-Gough platform that attains the maximum of forty real assembly modes. Due to the necessary ill-conditioning near the discriminant locus, we propose replacing the local linearization near the discriminant locus with a homotopy-based method derived from the method of gradient descent arising in optimization. This new hybrid approach is then used to develop a new result in real enumerative geometry.",

Recent research has shed new light on the structure (algebraic, combinatorial and geometric) of tropical idempotents, and in this paper we explore the consequences of this for the metric geometry of tropical polytopes. We prove, for example, that every n-point metric space is realised by the Hilbert projective metric on the tropical vertices of a pure n-dimensional, tropical and convex polytope in tropical n-space. More generally, every n-point asymmetric distance function is realised by a residuation operator on the vertices of such a polytope. In the symmetric case, we show that the maximal group of tropical matrices containing the idempotent associated to a metric space is isomorphic to G × ℝ, where G is the isometry group of the space. From this we deduce that every group of the form G×ℝ with Gfinite arises as amaximal subgroup of a sufficiently large finitary full tropical matrix semigroup. In the process we also prove some new results about tropical idempotent matrices, and note some semigroup-theoretic consequences which may be of independent interest.",

These two big classes are not very well understood. For instance it is still unknown whether, say in the convex case, the second class is dense. For a C 2 metric on both surfaces and the space of surfaces, the first class has, however, nonempty interior. We describe various properties of the sets of critical points, and of relative and absolute maxima of distance functions, and find several connections between them. We see for example that, on smooth surfaces homeomorphic to S 2 , a point cannot be critical with respect to more than one other point. Sufficient conditions for a surface to belong to the second class will be formulated and a particular Tannery surface belonging to the boundary of both classes will be presented.",

The curves of multiplicity n are obtained by taking an open cover ( U i ) of a smooth curve C and by glueing schemes of type U i × Z n using automorphisms of U ij × Z n that leave U ij invariant. This leads to the study of the sheaf of nonabelian groups G n of automorphisms of C × Z n that leave the reduced curve invariant, and to the study of its first cohomology set. We prove also that in most cases it is the same to extend a primitive curve C n of multiplicity n to one of multiplicity n + 1, and to extend the quasi locally free sheaf D n of derivations of C n to a rank 2 vector bundle on C n .",

Therefore it is very natural to ask how it changes if we allow the summands of an integer partition to take also negative values. In such a case, m can be an arbitrary integer and Par ( m ) becomes an infinite set. In this paperwe extend the classical dominance order in this more general case. In particular, we consider the resulting lattice Par ( m ) as an infinite increasing union on n of a sequence of finite lattices O ( m , n ). The lattice O ( m , n ) can be considered a generalization of the Brylawski lattice. We study in detail the lattice structure of O ( m , n ).",

Recently it has been shown how, given a conformal hypersurface embedding, a distinguished ambient metric is found (within its conformal class) by solving a singular version of the Yamabe problem [21]. This enables a route to proliferating conformal hypersurface invariants. The aim of this work is to give a self contained and explicit treatment of the calculus and identities required to use this machinery in practice. In addition we show how to compute the solution’s asymptotics. We also develop the calculus for explicitly constructing the conformal hypersurface invariant differential operators discovered in [21] and in particular how to compute extrinsically coupled analogues of conformal Laplacian powers. Our methods also enable the study of integrated conformal hypersurface invariants and their functional variations. As a main application we prove that a class of energy functions proposed in a recent work have the right properties to be deemed higher-dimensional analogues of the Willmore energy. This complements recent progress on the existence and construction of different functionals in [22] and [20].",

The method builds on and generalizes Ferroni’s work on sparse paving matroids. Combinatorially, our construction corresponds to constructing a uniform matroid from a paving matroid by iterating the operation of stressed-hyperplane relaxation introduced by Ferroni, Nasr and Vecchi, which generalizes the standard matroid-theoretic notion of circuit-hyperplane relaxation. We present evidence that panhandle matroids are Ehrhart positive and describe a conjectured combinatorial formula involving chain forests and Eulerian numbers from which Ehrhart positivity of panhandle matroids will follow. As an application of the main result, we calculate the Ehrhart polynomials of matroids associated with Steiner systems and finite projective planes, and show that they depend only on their design-theoretic parameters: for example, while projective planes of the same order need not have isomorphic matroids, their base polytopes must be Ehrhart equivalent.",

When n ≥ 3 and is a compact Einstein Riemannian manifold with positive scalar curvature, we also characterize the slices as the only compact two-sided hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature in the Riemannian product whose angle function does not change sign.

    "abstract": "Abstract Mixed volumes in n -dimensional Euclidean space are functionals of n -tuples consisting of convex bodies K , L , C 1 , …, C n –2 . The Alexandrov–Fenchel inequalities are fundamental inequalities between mixed volumes of convex bodies, which cover as very special cases many important inequalities between basic geometric functionals. The problem of characterizing completely the equality cases in the Alexandrov–Fenchel inequality is wide open. Major recent progress was made by Yair Shenfeld and Ramon van Handel [25; 26], in particular they resolved the problem in the cases where K , L are general convex bodies and C 1 , …, C n –2 are polytopes, zonoids or smooth bodies (under some dimensional restriction). We introduce the class of polyoids, which includes polytopes, zonoids and triangle bodies, and characterize polyoids by using generating measures. Based on this characterization and Shenfeld and van Handel's contribution, we extend their result to a class of convex bodies containing all polyoids and smooth bodies (under some dimensional restriction). Our result is stated in terms of the support of the mixed area measure of the unit ball B n and convex bodies C 1 , …, C n –2 . A geometric description of this support is provided in the accompanying work [12].",

We show that the SOS+SONC cone is proper and neither closed under multiplication nor under linear transformation of variables. Moreover, we present an alternative proof of an analog of Hilbert’s 1888 Theorem for the SOS+SONC cone and prove that in the non-Hilbert cases it provides a proper superset of the union of the SOS and SONC cones. This follows by exploiting a new necessary condition for membership in the SONC cone.",

We initiate the study of bisection cones and bisection fans with respect to arbitrary polyhedral norms. In particular, we show that the bisection fan always exists for polyhedral norms in two dimensions. Furthermore, we determine the bisection fan of the ℓ 1 -norm and the ℓ ∞ -norm as well as the discrete Wasserstein distance in arbitrary dimensions. Intricate combinatorial structures, such as the resonance arrangement, make their appearance. We apply our results to obtain bounds on the combinatorial complexity of the bisectors.",

Neumaier and Seidel (1988), as well as Delsarte and Seidel (1989), also proved a Fisher-type inequality |𝒳| ≥ N ( n , | R |, t ) (assuming that the design is antipodal if t is odd). For fixed n and | R | we have N ( n , | R |, t ) = O ( t n −1 ). This paper contains two main results. First, we provide a recursive construction for Euclidean t -designs in ℝ n . Namely, we show how to use certain Gauss–Jacobi quadrature formulae to ‘lift’ a Euclidean t -design in ℝ n −1 to a Euclidean t -design in ℝ n , preserving both the norm spectrum R and the weight sum W r for each r ∈ R . For fixed n and | R | this construction yields a design of size O ( t n −1 ); however, the coefficient of t n −1 here is significantly greater than it is in N ( n , | R |, t ). A Euclidean design with exactly N ( n , | R |, t ) points is called tight; in both of the above mentioned papers it was conjectured that a tight Euclidean design with t ≥ 4 must be a spherical design, that is, | R | = 1 and w is constant on 𝒳. Bannai and Bannai (2003) disproved this conjecture by exhibiting an example for the parameters, ( n , | R |, t ) = (2,2,4). Here we construct tight Euclidean designs for n = 2 and every t and | R | with | R | ≤ .",

We show that a translation plane admits an orthogonal polarity if, and only if, it is a shift plane. The corresponding planes are exactly those that can be coordinatized by commutative semifields. The orthogonal polarities form a single conjugacy class. Finally, we construct examples of compact connected shift planes with more conjugacy classes of polarities than the corresponding classical planes.",

Here concentration means that the number of vertices of the convex hull outside of the neighbourhoods of the vertices of the polygon is negligible asymptotically. The first moment of the number of vertices of the convex hull in a neighbourhood of a vertex of the polygon was obtained in 1963 by Renyi and Sulanke in a classical paper. The second moment was achieved in 1988 by Groeneboom using a Poisson point process approximation technique. Due to the complexity of the occurring calculations the extension of this technique to higher moments appears to be out of reach. Based on a purely geometric approach, which avoids stochastic processes, we derive the moments of all orders.",

In this paper, we generalize this construction to a wider class of varieties. More specifically, let A be an invertible matrix with non-negative integer entries. We introduce varieties X A and in weighted projective space and in , respectively. The variety turns out to be a quotient of a Fermat variety by a finite group. As a by-product, X A is a quotient of a Fermat variety and is a quotient of X A by a finite group. We apply this construction to some families of Calabi–Yau manifolds in order to show their birationality.",

(2) The set of points at distance at most two from a point forms a geometric hyperplane. (3) If every sym- plecton has rank at least three, every maximal singular subspace has finite projective rank. Then G is either D6; 6; A5; 3 or E7; 1, a classical dual polar space of rank three, or a product geometry LP where P is a polar space and L is a line. The second theorem concerns parapolar spaces S of symplectic rank at least three whose point-collinearity diameter is at least three such that for every point-symplecton pair, ðx; SÞ, x ? V S is never just a point. With a mild local condi- tion, one can show that such a geometry has point-diameter three and has a simply connected point-collinearity graph. If singular spaces have finite projective rank, one can show that S is E6; 4, E7; 7, E8; 1, a metasymplectic space, or a polar Grassmannian of type Bn; 2, Dn; 2, nd 4. All of these geometries are truncations of buildings. The last case can be modified so that the as- sumption that singular spaces have finite projective rank can be discarded.",

In general, it is an open question to decide whether for a polytope P every orientation of its graph satisfying these conditions can in fact be realized in this fashion; two natural families of polytopes to consider are cubes and crosspolytopes. For cubes, we show that, as n grows, the percentage of n -cube Holt–Klee orientations which can be realized goes asymptotically to 0. For crosspolytopes, we give a stronger set of conditions which are both necessary and sufficient for an orientation to be in this class; as a corollary, we prove that all shellings of cubes are line shellings.",

We extend this phenomenon to dimension 4 by exhibiting an example of a noncompact hyperbolic 4-manifold that is topologically the complement of 5 tori in the 4-sphere. We also exhibit examples of hyperbolic manifolds that are complements of 5n tori in a simply-connected 4-manifold with Euler characteristic 2n. All the examples are based on a construction of Ratcliffe and Tschantz, who produced 1171 noncompact hyperbolic manifolds with Euler characteristic 1. Our examples are finite covers of the Ratcliffe-Tschantz manifold with the biggest symmetry group.",

First we construct a moduli space A 2 (3) − parametrizing abelian surfaces with a symmetric theta structure and an odd theta characteristic. Such objects can in fact be seen as Weddle surfaces. We prove that A 2 (3) − is rational. Then, given a genus 2 curve C , we give an interpretation of the Weddle surface as a moduli space of extensions classes (invariant with respect to the hyperelliptic involution) of the canonical sheaf ω of C with ω −1 . This in turn allows to see the Weddle surface as a hyperplane section of the secant variety Sec( C ) of the curve C tricanonically embedded in ℙ 4 .",

In fact we first obtain all of the descriptions of their homogeneous Lorentzian and Riemannian structures and their types. Then we calculate the energy of an arbitrary left-invariant vector field X on these spaces and in the Lorentzian case we prove that no left-invariant unit time-like vector fields on these spaces are critical points for the space-like energy.

Two cubes [0,1) d + t , [0,1) d + s are called a twin pair if their closures have a complete facet in common. In 1930, Keller conjectured that in every cube tiling of ℝ d there is a twin pair. Keller's conjecture is true for dimensions d ≤ 6 and false for all dimensions d ≥ 8. For d = 7 the conjecture is still open. Let x ∈ ℝ d , i ∈ [ d ], and let L ( T , x , i ) be the set of all i th coordinates t i of vectors t ∈ T such that ([0,1) d + t ) ∩ ([0,1] d + x ) ≠ ø and t i ≤ x i . Let r − ( T ) = min x ∈ℝ d max 1≤ i ≤ d | L ( T , x , i )| and r + ( T ) = max x ∈ℝ d max 1≤ i ≤ d | L ( T , x , i )|. It is known that Keller's conjecture is true in dimension seven for cube tilings [0,1) 7 + T for which r − ( T ) ≤ 2. In the present paper we show that it is also true for d = 7 if r + ( T ) ≥ 6. Thus, if [0,1) d + T is a counterexample to Keller's conjecture in dimension seven, then r − ( T ), r + ( T ) ∈ {3, 4, 5}.",

When projecting a regular surface in ℝ 4 to ℝ 3 in a tangent direction, corank 1 singularities appear generically. The projection has a cross-cap singularity unless the direction of projection is asymptotic, where more degenerate singularities can appear. In this paper we relate the geometry of an immersed surface in ℝ 4 at a certain point to the geometry of the projection of the surface to ℝ 3 at the singular point.

New solutions on finer meshes are obtained from solutions on coarser meshes using a complex homotopy deformation. Two difficulties arise. First, the number of solutions typically grows with the number of mesh points and some form of filtering becomes necessary. Secondly, bifurcations may occur along homotopy paths of solutions and efficient methods to swap branches are developed when the mappings are analytic. For polynomial nonlinearities we generalize an earlier strategy for finding all solutions of two-point boundary value problems in one dimension and then introduce exclusion algorithms to extend the method to general nonlinearities.",

The computations of the maximal sets of compatible resolutions of the 2-(52,4,1) designs associated with maximal (52,4)-arcs show that five of the known projective planes of order 16 contain maximal arcs whose associated designs are embeddable in two nonisomorphic planes of order 16.",

In this paper we give strong evidence for this conjecture. Contingent on conjectural generalisations of the Quantum Lefschetz theorem and the Abelian/non-Abelian correspondence, we compute many quantum periods for del Pezzo surfaces with <m:math xmlns:m=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><m:mtable><m:mtr><m:mtd><m:mfrac><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mn>3</m:mn></m:mfrac></m:mtd></m:mtr></m:mtable></m:math> $\\begin{array}{} \\frac{1}{3} \\end{array} $ (1, 1) singularities.

Thenwe concentrate on the case n = 3 and apply McDuff’s method of probes to show that “most” of the generic Gelfand-Tsetlin fibers are displaceable. “Most” means “all but one” in the non-monotone case, and it means “all but a 1-parameter family” in the monotone case. In the case of a non-monotone manifold of full flags we present explicitly a unique non-displaceable Lagrangian fiber (S 1 ) 3 . This fiber was already proved to be non-displaceable in [10].

    "abstract": "Let V H ðC Þ be a variety and let Log denote the logarithmic moment map Log : ðC Þ ! R, ðz1; . . . ; znÞ 7! ðlogjz1j; . . . ; logjznjÞ. The amoeba A of the variety V H ðC Þ is its image under that map. Amoebas were introduced by Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky in [6]. They show that for varieties of codimension 1, the complement A of the amoeba A in R is a disjoint union of convex regions. If V is of codimension k þ 1 and A is its amoeba complement, we consider oriented ðk þ 1Þ-planes p in R. Let us call a class in the reduced homology group1 ~ HmðpV AÞ non-negative if its image in ~ HkðpnfpgÞFZ is non-negative for all p A pVA. We show that such a class is never sent to zero in ~ HkðAÞ, except if it is already zero. In other words, the maps ~ HkðpV AÞ ! ~ HkðAÞ induced by the inclusions pV A ! A never send non-zero non-negative classes to zero. The author expects these maps on homology to actually be injective, but this is only known for k 1⁄4 0. In that case, the result specializes to the one mentioned above and proven in [6]. Indeed, when k 1⁄4 0, we are looking at lines l and at the maps on ~ H0 induced by lV A ! A. Assuming our result, we want to show that A is a disjoint union of convex sets. Suppose by contradiction that X is a component of A that is not convex. Choose p; q A X such that the interval joining them is not contained in X , and let l be the oriented line pq !. It is then clear that 00 1⁄2q 1⁄2 p A ~ H0ðlV AÞ is a nonnegative class that is sent to zero in ~ H0ðAÞ. On the other hand, if all components of A are convex, then the map H0ðlV AÞ ! H0ðAÞ is always injective, and so is the map ~ H0ðlV AÞ ! ~ H0ðAÞ.",

More precisely, we present “Minkowskian analogues” of the philosophical symbol Yin-Yang, of the Arbelos, a special case of the famous Apollonius problem on circles touching each other, and one of the Sangaku-circles problems (coming from the Japanese Temple Geometry). The latter is remarkable since the consideration of this type of problems in the Euclidean plane requires the use of inversion or of the Pythagorean Theorem (i.e., of tools having no analogues in normed planes). Finally we observe that a strictly convex normed plane which, in addition, is smooth can be considered as a flat Möbius plane where, for example, Apollonius' problem is solved.",

Identifying points in E 3 which are in the same orbit under the action of this group yields the flat, closed 3-manifold known as the didicosm (also as the Hantzsche-Wendt manifold). When this group is realized as a group of symmetries of the standard cubical tessellation in E 3 , the resulting quotient gives a cubical tessellation on the didicosm. This paper describes a complete classification of these cubical tessellations on the didicosm into ten classes, according to their automorphism groups.",

We derive the second variation formula of the volume of L with respect to Hamiltonian variations and apply this formula to several cases. We observe that a minimal Lagrangian submanifold L in a Ricci-flat pseudo- or para-Kähler manifold is H-stable, i.e. its second variation is definite and L is in particular a local extremizer of the volume with respect to Hamiltonian variations. We also give a stability criterion for spacelike minimal Lagrangian submanifolds in para-Kähler manifolds, similar to Oh’s stability criterion for minimal Lagrangian manifolds in Kähler-Einstein manifolds (cf. [20]). Finally, we determine the H-stability of a series of examples of H-minimal Lagrangian submanifolds: the product S 1 (r 1 ) x ··· x S 1 (r n ) of n circles of arbitrary radii in complex space Cn is H-unstable with respect to any indefinite flat Hermitian metric, while the product ℍ 1 (r 1 ) x ···x ℍ 1 (r n ) of n hyperbolas in para-complex vector space D n is H-stable for n = 1; 2 and H-unstable for n ≥ 3. Recently, minimal Lagrangian surfaces in the space of geodesics of space forms have been characterized ([4], [11]); on the other hand, a class of H-minimal Lagrangian surfaces in the tangent bundle of a Riemannian, oriented surface has been identified in [6]. We discuss the H-stability of all these examples.",

In 1992 a new family of 467 such spaces was constructed, all having 729 points and line size 8. These were shown to be the only linear spaces attaining an upper bound of Delandtsheer and Doyen on the number of points. Projective planes, and the linear spaces just mentioned on 91 or 729 points, are the only known examples of such spaces, and in all cases the line-transitive group has a non-trivial normal subgroup intransitive on points. The orbits of this normal subgroup form a partition of the point set called a normal point-partition. We give a systematic analysis of finite line-transitive linear spaces with normal point-partitions. As well as the usual parameters of linear spaces there are extra parameters connected with the normal point-partition that aect the structure of the linear space. Using this analysis we characterise the line-transitive linear spaces for which the values of various of these parameters are small. In particular we obtain a classification of all imprimitive line- transitive linear spaces that 'nearly attain' the Delandtsheer-Doyen upper bound.",

A third and subsidiary aim is to show how tropical differential algebraic geometry is a natural application of semiring theory, and in so doing, contribute to the valuative study of differential algebraic geometry. We use this formalism to extend the fundamental theorem of partial differential algebraic geometry to the differential fraction field of the ring of formal power series in arbitrarily (finitely many variables; in doing so we produce new examples of non-Krull valuations that merit further study in their own right.",

They therefore yield valuable summary statistics for stationary marked point processes with marks in the family of convex bodies, or, slightly more specialised, for stationary particle processes. We show here that if the distribution of the typical particle is invariant under rotations about a fixed k -plane, then the average volume tensors of the typical particle can be derived from k + 1-dimensional sections. This finding extends the well-known three-dimensional special case to higher dimensions. A corresponding result for the surface tensors is also proven. In the last part of the paper we show how Minkowski tensors can be used to define three ellipsoidal set-valued summary statistics, discuss their estimation and illustrate their construction and use in a simulation example. Two of these, the so-called Miles ellipsoid and the inertia ellipsoid, are based on mean volume tensors of ranks up to 2. The third, based on the mean surface tensor of rank 2, will be called the Blaschke ellipsoid and is only defined when the typical particle has a rotationally symmetric distribution about an axis, as we then can use uniqueness and reconstruction results for centred ellipsoids of revolution from their rank-2 surface tensor. The latter are also established here.",

This isomorphism is through a Cremona transformation on the Grassmannian of lines in ℙ d , which enables a precise description of the convex hull and affine span of up to d ascending lines: the lines in such an affine span turn out to be the rulings of certain classical determinantal varieties.

This choice of the standard pseudo-metric form allows us to study the isomorphism properties. If the elements of the centre of the standard pseudo-metric form constitute a Lie triple system of the pseudo-orthogonal Lie algebra, then the original 2-step nilpotent Lie algebra admits integer structure constants.

We characterize all possible systems of generators for such vector-field valued operators including the classical ones given by normal tensors and covariant derivatives. We also describe the size of the space of such operators and prove the existence of an ‘ideal’ basis consisting of operators with given leading terms which satisfy the (generalized) Bianchi–Ricci identities without the correction terms. The proofs given in this paper combine the classical methods of normal coordinates with the graph complex method.",

For k = 1 and k = d − 1, simple formulas for the projection functions exist. In particular, υ d -1 ( K , ·) can be written as a spherical integral with respect to the surface area measure of K . Here, we generalize this result and prove two integral representations for υ k ( K , ·), k = 1,..., d − 1, over flag manifolds. Whereas the first representation generalizes a result of Ambartzumian (1987), but uses a flag measure which is not continuous in K , the second representation is related to a recent flag formula for mixed volumes by Hug, Rataj and Weil (2013) and depends continuously on K .",

Our main results determine completely the combinatorial configurations associated with such subplanes, and enables, for example, a computational method to determine the number of nuclear planes of order q in semifield planes of order q t . The results have a number of applications. Firstly, they imply ‘fusion’ theorems. The most basic one is that if two or more seminuclear subfields, of a semifield D coordinatizing a translation plane π , are each isomorphic to GF( q ), then π may be recoordinatized by a semifield E such that the indicated seminuclear fields, of order q , coincide. The most important case is nuclear fusion: if all three seminuclei of D are isomorphic to GF( q ) then the nucleus N ( E ) ≅ GF( q ). Further applications are concerned with semifield spreads π of order q 2 . We classify all such π that admit three homology groups of order q – 1 with dierent axis (the shears axis, the infinite line, and any other component), thus generalizing a theorem of D. E. Knuth, who proved an algebraic version of the result.",

In [4] we have shown that non-classical compact projective planes do not admit Riemannian metrics. Here we use different methods that are suited to two-dimensional planes in general. We apply them to three families of topological affine planes with large collineation groups. It turns out that for the standard models of the skew-parabola planes and the planes over cartesian fields no affine connection, and hence no Riemannian metric exist. However, for the Moulton planes affine connections do exist and we determine all of them. Among them is at least one Riemannian connection. We also give an example where no Riemannian metric exists. Moreover, we derive a characterization of the classical affine plane in the case that ℝ 2 acts by vector space translations as a subgroup of the collineation group.",

We use this procedure to obtain an easy way to compute the contribution of a Brieskorn singularity to the stringy E -function. As a corollary, we prove that stringy Hodge numbers of varieties with a certain class of strictly canonical Brieskorn singularities are nonnegative.

If at least two of the weights are 1, we prove that Δ 0, w is homotopic to a wedge sum of spheres, possibly of varying dimensions. Under additional natural hypotheses on the weight vector, we establish explicit formulas for the Betti numbers of the spaces. We exhibit infinite families of weights for which the space Δ 0, w is disconnected and for which the fundamental group of Δ 0, w has torsion. In the latter case, the universal cover is shown to have a natural modular interpretation. This places the weighted variant of the space in stark contrast to the heavy/light cases studied previously by Vogtmann and Cavalieri–Hampe–Markwig–Ranganathan. Finally, we prove a structural result relating the spaces of weighted stable curves in genus 0 and 1, and leverage this to extend several of our genus 0 results to the spaces Δ 1, w .",

    "abstract": "Abstract A cube tiling of ℝ d is a family of pairwise disjoint cubes [0, 1) d + T = {[0, 1) d + t : t ∈ T } such that ∪ t ∈ T ([0, 1) d + t ) = ℝ d . Two cubes [0, 1) d + t , [0, 1) d + s are called a twin pair if | t j − s j | = 1 for some j ∈ [ d ] = {1, ⋅, d } and t i = s i for every i ∈ [ d ]∖{ j }. In 1930, Keller conjectured that in every cube tiling of ℝ d there is a twin pair. For x ∈ ℝ d and i ∈ [ d ], let L ( T , x , i ) be the set of all i th coordinates t i of vectors t ∈ T such that ([0, 1) d + t )∩([0, 1] d + x )≠∅ and t i ≤ x i .

An embedded complex projective surface which is adjoint to a degree one weak Del Pezzo surface contains families of minimal degree rational curves, which cannot be defined by the fibers of a map. Such families are called minimal non-fibration families. Families of bitangent planes of cone curves correspond to minimal non-fibration families. The main motivation of this paper is to classify minimal non-fibration families. We present algorithms wich compute all bitangent families of a given cone curve and their geometric genera. We consider cone curves to be equivalent if they have the same singularity configuration. For each equivalence class of cone curves we determine the possible number of bitangent families and the number of rational bitangent families. Finally we compute an example of a minimal non-fibration family on an embedded weak degree one Del Pezzo surface.",

Each member of the family (including the analogues of the focal sets) is tight in the boundary complex of an ambient convex polytope. In particular, the tube around the real (or complex) Veronese surface is represented as a tight polyhedron in 5-space (or 8-space). The examples are based on a certain Bier sphere triangulation of S 4 or S 7 , respectively. In the 4-dimensional case there are simplicial branched coverings of these triangulations in the complex projective plane and in S 2 × S 2 which are branched precisely along the polyhedral analogues of the Veronese surface. Moreover, we introduce a notion of PL-tautness and discuss its relationship with tightness of polyhedra. In particular, each member of our polyhedral isoparametric family is PL-taut.

Finally, we conjecture that two real open books on a real contact manifold supporting the same real contact structure are related by positive real stabilizations and equivariant isotopy, and that the Giroux correspondence applies to real manifolds as well, namely that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the real contact structures on a real 3-manifold up to equivariant contact isotopy and the real open books up to positive real stabilization.

Examples show that this fails to hold in higher dimensions $d \\geq 5$.

Firstly, a geometric lattice is associated to any discrete L -algebra. Monoids of I-type are obtained as a special case where the perspectivity relation is trivial. Secondly, the structure group of a non-degenerate discrete L -algebra X is determined and shown to be a complete invariant. It is proved that X ∖ {1} is a projective space with an orthogonality relation. A new definition of non-symmetric quantum sets, extending the recursive definition of symmetric quantum sets, is provided and shown to be equivalent to the former one. Quantum sets are characterized as complete projective spaces with an anisotropic duality, and they are also characterized in terms of their complete lattice of closed subspaces, which is one-sided orthomodular and semimodular. For quantum sets of finite cardinality n &gt; 3, a representation as a projective space with duality over a skew-field is given. Quantum sets of cardinality 2 are classified, and the structure group of their associated L -algebra is determined.",

In previous work the author proved that T k M , 1 ≤ k ≤∞, admits a vector bundle structure on M if and only if M is endowed with a linear connection, or equivalently if a connection map on T k M is defined. This bundle structure depends heavily on the choice of the connection. In this paper we ask about the extent to which this vector bundle structure remains isomorphic. To this end we define the k-th order differential T k g : T k M ⟶ T k N for a given differentiable map g between manifolds M and N . As we shall see, T k g becomes a vector bundle morphism if the base manifolds are endowed with g -related connections. In particular, replacing a connection with a g -related one, where g : M ⟶ M is a diffeomorphism, one obtains invariant vector bundle structures. Finally, using immersions on Hilbert manifolds, convex combinations of connection maps and manifolds of C r maps we offer three examples for our theory, showing its interaction with known problems such as the Sasaki lift of metrics.",

According to results of Nikulin, the existence of a Nikulin configuration means that the K3 surface is a Kummer surface, moreover the abelian surface from the Kummer structure is determined by the 16 curves. In the paper [16], we constructed explicitly non-isomorphic Kummer structures on some Kummer surfaces. In this paper we generalize the construction to Kummer surfaces with a weaker restriction on the degree of the polarization and we describe some cases where the previous construction does not work.",

A systematic treatment of such planes can be found in the book Compact Projective Planes [15]. Each line L e £ is homotopy equivalent to a sphere §/ with / 1 8, and d = 2/, see [15] (54.1 1). In all known examples, L is in fact homeomorphic to §/. Taken with the compact-open topology, the automorphism group Σ = Aut^ (of all continuous collineations) is a locally compact transformation group of Ρ with a countable basis, the dimension dim Σ is finite [15] (44.3 and 83.2). The classical examples are the planes κ over the three locally compact, connected fields IK with ( — dim IK and the 16-dimensional Moufang plane G = έΡ® over the octonion algebra Θ. If 9 is a classical plane, then Aut^ is an almost simple Lie group of dimension Q, where C = 8, €2 = 16, €4 = 35, and Cg = 78. In all other cases, dim Σ < ^ Q + 1 < 5Λ Planes with a group of dimension sufficiently close to  C( can be described explicitly. More precisely, the classification program seeks to determine all pair s (&, Δ), where Δ is a connected closed subgroup of Aut & and bf ^ dim Δ 5^ for a suitable bound be 4/ — 1 . This has been accomplished for t ^ 2 and also for 64 = 17. Here, the case ( = 8 will be studied; the value of bt varies with the configuration of the fixed elements ofA. Most theorems that have been obtained so far require additional assumptions on the structure of Δ. If dim Δ 27, then Δ is always a Lie group [12]. By the structure theory of Lie groups, there are 3 possibilities: (i) Δ is semi-simple, or (ii) Δ contains a central torus subgroup, or (iii) Δ has a minimal normal vector subgroup, cf. [15] (94.26). The first two cases are understood fairly well:",

In order to determine all doubly transitive dimensional dual hyperovals, it remains to classify the solvable ones, and this paper is a contribution to this problem. A doubly transitive, solvable dimensional dual hyperoval D of rank n is defined over 𝔽 2 and has an automorphism of the form ES , where E is elementary abelian of order 2 n and S ≤ Γ L(1, 2 n ); see Yoshiara [12]. The known examples D are bilinear. In [1] the bilinear , doubly transitive, solvable dimensional dual hyperovals D of rank n with GL(1, 2 n ) ≤ S are classified. Here we present two new classes of non - bilinear , doubly transitive dimensional dual hyperovals. We also consider universal covers of doubly transitive dimensional dual hyperovals, since they are again doubly transitive dimensional dual hyperovals by [2, Cor. 1.3]. We determine the universal covers of the presently known doubly transitive dimensional dual hyperovals.",

The aim of this article is twofold: firstly, to introduce and study the cone topology on the twin building at infinity of a masure. It turns out that this topology has various favorable properties that are required in the literature as axioms for a topological twin building. Secondly, by making use of the cone topology, we study strongly transitive actions of a group G on a masure Δ . Under some hypotheses, with respect to the masure and the group action of G , we prove that G acts strongly transitively on Δ if and only if it acts strongly transitively on the twin building at infinity ∂ Δ . Along the way a criterion for strong transitivity is given and the existence and good dynamical properties of strongly regular hyperbolic automorphisms of the masure are proven.",

For a precise definition see Section 2. The Greek mathematician C. Stephanos showed in 1883 (see [10]) that one can associate to every Desargues configuration a curve of genus 2 in a canonical way. Moreover he proved that the induced map from the moduli space of Desargues configurations to the moduli space of curves of genus 2 is birational. Our main motivation for writing this paper was to understand the last result. Stephanos needed about a hundred pages of classical invariant theory to prove it. We apply instead a simple argument of Schubert calculus to prove a slightly more precise version of his result. Let MD denote the (coarse) moduli space of Desargues configurations. It is a threedimensional quasiprojective variety. On the other hand, let M 6 denote the moduli space of stable binary sextics. There is a canonical isomorphism H2nD1 GM 6 (see [1]). Here H2 denotes the moduli space of stable curves of genus 2 in the sense of Deligne–Mumford and D1 the boundary divisor parametrizing two curves of genus 1 intersecting transversely in one point. So instead of curves of genus 2, we may speak of binary sextics. The main result of the paper consists of the following two statements:",

    "abstract": "In this note we give examples of division rings which posses an anti-automorphism but no involution. The motivation for such examples comes from geometry. If D is a division ring and V a finite-dimensional right D-vector space of dimension ≥ 3, then the projective geometry P(V ) has a duality (resp. polarity) if and only if D has an anti-automorphism (resp. involution) [2, p. 97, p. 111]. Thus, the existence of a division ring with an anti-automorphism but no involution gives examples of projective geometries with dualities but no polarities. All the division rings considered in this paper are finite-dimensional algebras over their center. The anti-automorphisms we construct are not linear over the center (i.e. they do not restrict to the identity on the center) since a theorem of Albert [1, Theorem 10.19] shows that every finite-dimensional central division algebra with a linear anti-automorphism has an involution. Several proofs of this result can be found in the literature, see for instance [5] or [10, Chapter 8, §8]. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 collects some background information on central division algebras. Section 3 establishes the existence of division algebras over algebraic number fields which have anti-automorphisms but no involution, and gives two explicit constructions of such algebras. The proofs rely on deep classical results on the Brauer group of number fields. Section 4 gives examples whose center has a more complicated structure (they are Laurent series fields over local fields), but the proof that these algebras have no involution is more elementary. Sections 3 and 4 are independent of each other.",

    "abstract": "There is a priori no nonvanishing lower bound for the length of the cut locus on a surface with respect to a point. Since the sphere is responsible for this, we considered in [5] the case of surfaces not homeomorphic to the sphere. With the same motivation in mind, we investigate here the length of cut loci with respect to finite sets containing more than one point, on various surfaces. Throughout this paper, each appearing surface is a compact 2-dimensional Alexandrov space with curvature bounded below, as defined in [2] or [6]. Thus, it is equipped with an intrinsic metric and is a topological 2-manifold [2]. For any compact surface S and closed subset MHS, r denotes the intrinsic metric on S and dðMÞ the intrinsic diameter of M. A segment ab is a shortest path joining a to b (and has length rða; bÞ). Moreover, CðMÞ denotes the cut locus of M in S, i.e., the set of all points x A S such that some shortest path from x to M cannot be extended as a shortest path to M beyond x, and CðMÞ its cyclic part, i.e., the set of points in CðMÞ admitting two segments to M which do not form a null-homotopic closed curve. Let Sx be the (1-dimensional) space of directions at x A S (for a definition, see [2]). If the diameter of Sx is less than p, x is called singular. Let us call strongly singular those points x A S for which Sx has diameter at most p=2. We denote by l the length (1-dimensional Hausdor¤ measure). We are going to give in Theorems 1–7 various lower bounds for the length of the cut locus with respect to a set M, which will always be assumed finite and containing more than one point.",

To this end, we determine the irreducible components of the jet schemes of such a space monomial curve. This approach does not only yield a closed formula for the motivic zeta function, but also allows to determine its poles. We show that, while the family of the jet schemes of the fibers is not flat, the number of poles of the motivic zeta function associated with the space monomial curve is equal to the number of poles of the motivic zeta function associated with a generic curve in the family.",

This article treats in more detail the special case of lattice packings and coverings with circular discs. The aim is to determine those lattices for which the densities of the corresponding packings and coverings with circular discs, and certain products and quotients thereof, are semi-stationary, stationary, extreme, and ultra-extreme. The latter notion is a sharper version of extremality. It turns out that in all cases where solutions exist, the regular hexagonal lattices are solutions. Unexpectedly, in a few cases the square lattices and in one case special parallelogram lattices are solutions too. A further surprise is the fact that the lattices forwhich the circle packing density is extreme coincide with the lattices with ultra-extreme density. For semi-stationarity, stationarity and ultra-extremality the duality between packing and covering results breaks down. All results may be interpreted in terms of binary positive definite quadratic forms.",

We prove the existence of h -tilings on every finite simplicial complex after finitely many stellar subdivisions at maximal simplices. These tilings are moreover shellable. We also prove that the number of tiles of each type used by a tiling, encoded by its h -vector, is determined by the number of critical tiles of each index it uses, encoded by its critical vector. In the case of closed triangulated manifolds, these vectors satisfy some palindromic property. We finally study the behavior of tilings under any stellar subdivision.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bridgeland stability manifolds of Calabi–Yau categories are of noticeable interest both in mathematics and physics. By looking at some of the known examples, a pattern clearly emerges and gives a fairly precise description of how they look like. In particular, they all seem to have missing loci, which tend to correspond to degenerate stability conditions vanishing on spherical objects. Describing such missing strata is also interesting from a mirror-symmetric perspective, as they conjecturally parametrize interesting types of degenerations of complex structures. All the naive attempts at constructing modular partial compactifications show how elusive and subtle the problem in fact is: ideally, the missing strata would correspond to stability manifolds of quotient triangulated categories, but establishing such a correspondence on the geometric level and viewing stability conditions on quotients of the original triangulated category as suitable degenerations of stability conditions is not straightforward. In this paper, we will present a method to construct such partial compactifications if some additional hypotheses are satisfied, by realizing our space of interest as a suitable metric completion of the stability manifold.",

A convex body K in a finite dimensional real Banach space is called universal cover if any set of diameter 1 can be covered by a congruent copy of K; if ”congruent copy“ is replaced by ”translate”, then K is called strong universal cover. We describe the smallest regular hexagons, the smallest equilateral triangles, and the smallest squares (all these figures defined in the sense of the norm) that are strong universal covers in normed planes. In addition, the paper contains a new characterization of Radon planes. In view of universal covers having ball shape we shortly discuss also Jung constants of real Banach spaces, and a known result on Borsuk’s partition problem is reproved.",

This way we obtain two slightly different metrics δ φ and δ φker (see Definition 4.2). We show that both metric spaces obtained are separable. Further, we present an analytic approach to the radial function. It enables us to define the metric δ φ L ' (see Definition 5.3). We prove that if we use δ φ L ' in the family of star bodies whose kernels have non-empty interiors, then the mapping K 7→ kerK is continuous.",

Relative differential geometry can be described as the geometry of surfaces in the affine space, endowed with a distinguished relative normal vector which generalises the notion of unit normal vector field N from Euclidean differential geometry. A concise review of differential geometry will be presented. The main result, to which the title of this article refers, will be given in the third section. Here we consider, for a function $f$ of two variables, normal vector fields of the form $f(H,K)\\,N-\\grad_{\\II}(f(H,K))$ for non-degenerate surfaces in the Euclidean three-dimensional space. A comparison of the variation of the curvature functional $\\int f(H,K)\\,\\dd\\Omega$ with the area functional obtained from the above normal vector field, results in a distinguishing property for the one-parameter family of normal vector fields which was introduced by F. Manhart, and which is obtained by choosing $f(H,K)=|K|^{\\alpha}$ (where we will assume that $\\alpha\\neq 1$). More precisely, the following will be shown in theorem~6: ``{The curvature functionals $(\\ast)$ for which the critical points coincide with the relative-minimal surfaces with respect to the normal vector field $(\\dagger)$, are essentially those obtained from Manhart's family}. In the fourth section, we give a characterisation of the sphere by means of relations between the support function and the curvatures. In the last section, we combine the previously described results and arrive at a variational characterisation of the sphere.",

It is known to be true if B is the class of almost all projective spaces or the class of almost all nondegenerate polar spaces. We show that this is true for the class of almost all strong parapolar spaces, including dual polar spaces. A special case occurs when Γ 1 = Γ 2 = Γ has an embedding into a projective space ℙ( V ) that is natural in the sense that Aut(Γ ) ≤ PΓL( V ). Then the question becomes whether ℙ( V ) is also the natural embedding for Γ − . Our result shows that in most cases the stabilizer Stab Aut(Γ) (Γ − ) is faithful on Γ − and equals Aut(Γ − ) and so the answer is affirmative. We know that there exist some interesting exceptions. These will be covered in a subsequent paper.",

Here, we ﬁrst give a short proof for the description of point rows and line pencils in these incidence structures. Furthermore, we provide criteria which characterize intersecting lines (or points which can be joined by a line, respectively) and obtain a simple description of the intersection point (the joining line, respectively). Finally, we describe for each antiﬂag ( p , L ) the position of the uniquely determined ﬂag ( q , K ) such that ( p , K , q , L ) is a 3-chain. In this paper, we make extensive use of the theory of isoparametric triple systems as developed in [1].",

The aim of this paper is to introduce the notion of Affine Tallini Set and provide a natural and intrinsic characterization of from the point-line geometry point of view. More precisely, we prove that if a projective space over a skew-field K contains an Affine Tallini Set Δ satisfying suitable axioms on “perp” of lines, then the skew-field K is forced to be a commutative field and Δ is an affine Grassmannian, up to projections. Furthermore, several results concerning Affine Tallini Sets are stated and proved.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we give two applications of the theory of multiplier ideals to vector bundles over complex projective manifolds, generalizing to higher rank results already established for line bundles. The first addresses the existence of sections of (suitable twists) of symmetric powers of a very ample vector bundle, vanishing on a given subvariety. The second is a vanishing theorem of Gri‰ths type, adjusted with an additional multiplier ideal term as in the standard Nadel vanishing theorem. To begin with, we recall that, starting with work of Bombieri and Skoda, there has been considerable interest in going from hypersurfaces in P highly singular at a given set of points S to hypersurfaces through S of relatively low degree; there is now a very direct and terse approach based on multiplier ideals [3], [4], [5], [6]. Here, the same method is shown to yield a statement in the same spirit about sections of very ample vector bundles on a projective manifold. One says that a rank r holomorphic vector bundle on a complex projective manifold is very ample if the relative hyperplane line bundle OPE ð1Þ on the projectivised dual PE is very ample. If X is a projective manifold and ZJX an irreducible subvariety, for every integer pd 1 the p-th symbolic power I hpi Z JOZ of the ideal sheaf of Z is the ideal sheaf of the holomorphic functions vanishing with multiplicity dp along Z (that is, at a generic point of Z ).",

Moreover, for many large subclasses, such as the simple polytopes, or the simplicial polytopes, there are monoid structures on the set of f -vectors by themselves: “addition of f -vectors minus the f -vector of the d-simplex” always yields a new f -vector. For general 4-polytopes, we show that the modified addition operation does not always produce an f -vector, but that the result is always close to an f -vector. In this sense, the set of f -vectors of all 4-polytopes forms an “approximate affine semigroup”. The proof relies on the fact for d = 4 every d-polytope, or its dual, has a “small facet”. This fails for d &gt; 4. We also describe a two further modified addition operations on f -vectors that can be geometrically realized by glueing corresponding polytopes. The second one of these may yield a semigroup structure on the f -vector set of all 4-polytopes.",

Young in [10] this gives sharp bounds on higher order Dehn functions for such horospheres. Moreover, if Γ ⊂ Is( X ) is a lattice acting cocompactly on X minus a union of disjoint horoballs, then we get a sharp bound on higher order Dehn functions for Γ . We deduce that apart from the Hilbert modular groups already considered by R. Young, every irreducible ℚ-rank one lattice acting on a product of r Riemannian symmetric spaces of the noncompact type is undistorted up to dimension r −1 and has k -th order Dehn function asymptotic to V ( k +1)/ k for all k ≤ r − 2.",

Similarly to h/h * -vectors, the f * -vector of P coincides with the f -vector of its unimodular triangulations (if they exist). We present several inequalities that hold among the coefficients of f * -vectors of lattice polytopes. These inequalities resemble striking similarities with existing inequalities for the coefficients of f -vectors of simplicial polytopes; e.g., the first half of the f * -coefficients increases and the last quarter decreases. Even though f * -vectors of polytopes are not always unimodal, there are several families of polytopes that carry the unimodality property. We also show that for any polytope with a given Ehrhart h * -vector, there is a polytope with the same h * -vector whose f * -vector is unimodal.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In Blok [R. J. Blok, Extensions of isomorphisms for affine dual polar spaces and strong parapolar spaces. Adv. Geom. 5 (2005), 509–532.] affinely rigid classes of geometries were studied. These are classes B of geometries with the following property: Given any two geometries Γ 1 , Γ 2 ∈ B with subspaces 𝒮 1 and 𝒮 2 respectively, then any isomorphism Γ 1 − 𝒮 1 → Γ 2 − 𝒮 2 uniquely extends to an isomorphism Γ 1 → Γ 2 . Suppose Γ belongs to an affinely rigid class. Then for any subspace 𝒮 we have Aut(Γ − 𝒮) ≤ Aut(Γ). Suppose that, in addition, Γ is embedded into the projective space ℙ( V ) for some vector space V . Then one may think of V as a “natural” embedding if every automorphism of Γ is induced by some (semi-) linear automorphism of V . This is for instance true of the projective geometry Γ = ℙ( V ) itself by the fundamental theorem of projective geometry. Clearly since Γ belongs to an affinely rigid class and has a natural embedding into ℙ( V ), also the embedding Γ − 𝒮 into ℙ( V ) is natural. In Blok [R. J. Blok, Extensions of isomorphisms for affine dual polar spaces and strong parapolar spaces. Adv. Geom. 5 (2005), 509–532.] the notion of a layer-extendable class was introduced and it was shown that layer-extendable classes are affinely rigid. As an application, it was shown that the union of most projective geometries, (dual) polar spaces, and strong parapolar spaces forms an affinely rigid class. However, the geometries motivating that study, the Grassmannians defined over 𝔽 2 , were not included in this class because they do not form a layer-extendable class. Since affine projective geometries (1-Grassmannians, if you will) are simply complete graphs, clearly they are not affinely rigid at all. In the present note we show that also the class of 2-Grassmannians over 𝔽 2 fails to form an affinely rigid class, although in a less dramatic way, whereas the class of k -Grassmannians of projective spaces of dimension n over 𝔽 2 where 3 ≤ k ≤ n − 2 is in fact affinely rigid.",

We study this problem under two dierent viewpoints.

This continuous variant of the Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity was introduced by Mustopa, and he raised the question whether a continuously 1-regular such sheaf F is GV. Here we answer the question in the affirmative for many pairs ( X , O X (1)) which includes the case of any polarized abelian variety. Moreover, for these pairs, we show that if F is continuously k -regular for some positive integer k ≤ dim X , then F is a GV −( k −1) sheaf. Further, we extend the notion of continuous CM-regularity to a real valued function on the ℚ-twisted bundles on polarized abelian varieties ( X , O X (1)), and we show that this function can be extended to a continuous function on N 1 ( X ) ℝ . We also provide syzygetic consequences of our results for O ℙ(E) (1) on ℙ(ɛ) associated to a 0-regular bundle ɛ on polarized abelian varieties. In particular, we show that O ℙ(E) (1) satisfies the N p property if the base-point freeness threshold of the class of O X (1) in N 1 ( X ) is less than 1/( p + 2).

A point p ∈ int K is said to be a Larman point of K if for every hyperplane Π passing through p , the section Π ∩ K has an ( n – 2)-plane of symmetry. If p is a Larman point of K and for every section Π ∩ K , p is in the corresponding ( n – 2)-plane of symmetry, then we call p a revolution point of K . We conjecture that if K contains a Larman point which is not a revolution point, then K is either an ellipsoid or a body of revolution. This generalizes a conjecture of Bezdek for n = 3. We prove several results related to the conjecture for strictly convex origin symmetric bodies. Namely, if K ⊂ ℝ n is a strictly convex origin symmetric body that contains a revolution point p which is not the origin, then K is a body of revolution. This generalizes the False Axis of Revolution Theorem in [7]. We also show that if p is a Larman point of K ⊂ ℝ 3 and there exists a line L such that p ∉ L and, for every plane Π passing through p , the line of symmetry of the section Π ∩ K intersects L , then K is a body of revolution (in some cases, K is a sphere). We obtain a similar result for projections of K . Additionally, for K ⊂ ℝ n with n ≥ 4, we show that if every hyperplane section or projection of K is a body of revolution and K has a unique diameter D , then K is a body of revolution with axis D .",

Lunardon and Polverino proved in [11] that Q + (3; q), Q(4; q) and Q + (5; q) are the only finite orthogonal polar spaces having translation ovoids. In this paper we prove that H(3; q 2 ) is the only finite unitary polar space having translation ovoids.

In this note we prove that the existence of an integral curve C ⊂ V induces relations between some of these virtual fundamental classes . The corresponding relations for the Poincaré invariant can be considered as algebraic analoga of the fundamental relations obtained in [Ozsváth, Szabó, Ann. of Math. 151: 93–124, 2000].",

It is well known that an ordinary fan or polytope is associated with a toric variety. On the other hand, we can geometrically realize multi-fans in terms of torus manifolds. However, it is unfortunate that two different torus manifolds may correspond to the same multi-fan. The goal of this paper is to give some criteria for a multi-polytope to be an ordinary polytope in terms of the Duistermaat–Heckman functions and winding numbers. Moreover, we also prove a generalized Pick formula and its consequences for simple lattice multi-polytopes by studying their Ehrhart polynomials.",

For example, our result applies to the stack of semistable G -bundles, to stacks of semistable Hitchin pairs, and to stacks of semistable parabolic G -bundles. Similar arguments apply to Gieseker semistable G -bundles in higher dimensions. We present two applications of the main result. First, we show that in characteristic 0 every stack of semistable decorated G -bundles admitting a quasiprojective good moduli space can be written naturally as a G -linearized global quotient Y / G , so the moduli problem can be interpreted as a GIT problem. Secondly, we give a proof that the stack of semistable meromorphic G -Higgs bundles on a family of curves is smooth over any base in characteristic 0.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While the maximum cut problem and its corresponding polytope has received a lot of attention inliterature, comparably little is known about the natural closely related variant maximum bond. Here, given a graph G = (V, E) , we ask for a maximum cut δ(S) ⊆ E with S ⊆ V under the restriction that both G [ S ] as well as G [ V \\ S ] are connected. Observe that both the maximum cut and the maximum bond can be seen as inverse problems to the traditional minimum cut, as there, the connectivity arises naturally in optimal solutions. The bond polytope is the convex hull of all incidence vectors of bonds. Similar to the connection of the corresponding optimization problems, the bond polytope is closely related to the cut polytope. While the latter has been intensively studied, there are no results on bond polytopes. We start a structural study of the latter, which additionally allows us to deduce algorithmic consequences. We investigate the relation between cut- and bond polytopes and the additional intricacies that arise when requiring connectivity in the solutions. We study the effect of graph modifications on bond polytopes and their facets, akin to what has been spearheaded for cut polytopes by Barahona, Grötschel and Mahjoub [4; 3] and Deza and Laurant [17; 15; 16]. Moreover, we study facet-defining inequalities arising from edges and cycles for bond polytopes. In particular, these yield a complete linear description of bond polytopes of cycles and 3-connected planar ( K 5 − e )-minor free graphs. Finally, we present a reduction of the maximum bond problem on arbitrary graphs to the maximum bond problem on 3-connected graphs. This yields a linear time algorithm for maximum bond on ( K 5 − e )-minor free graphs.",

MR0075606 (17,776b) Zbl 0066.38901 ] and G. Panella [ G. Panella, Caratterizzazione delle quadriche di uno spazio (tridimensionale) lineare sopra un corpo finito. Boll. Un. Mat. Ital. (3) 10 (1955), 507–513. MR0075607 (17,776c) Zbl 0066.38902 ]. A breakthrough result was a recent one of M. R. Brown, who showed in [ M. R. Brown, Ovoids of PG (3, q), q even, with a conic section. J. London Math. Soc. (2) 62 (2000), 569–582. MR1783645 (2001i:51012) Zbl 1038.51008 ] that when such an ovoid has a conic plane section, the ovoid must be an elliptic quadric. Even more recently, M. R. Brown and M. Lavrauw [ M. R. Brown, M. Lavrauw, Eggs in PG(4 n − 1, q ), q even, containing a pseudo-conic. Bull. London Math. Soc. 36 (2004), 633–639. MR2070439 (2005k:51009) Zbl 1064.51005 ] generalized this theorem by obtaining a similar result for higher dimensions. Both results have equivalent statements in the theory of (translation) generalized quadrangles. In this note, we improve these results by showing that an elation generalized quadrangle of order ( q , q 2 ), q even, with a subGQ containing the elation point arises from a non-singular elliptic quadric in PG(5, q ). The theorem itself arises as a corollary of a more general observation which works for all characteristics. There is a wealth of consequences.",

    "abstract": "In his paper (1) Ciliberto proposes a conjecture in order to characterize special linear systems of P n through multiple base points. In this note we give a counterexample to this con- jecture by showing that there is a substantial dierence between the speciality of linear systems on P 2 and those of P 3 . Let us take the projective space P n and let us consider the linear system of hyper- surfaces of degree d having some points of fixed multiplicity. The virtual dimension of such systems is the dimension of the space of degree d polynomials minus the con- ditions imposed by the multiple points and the expected dimension is the maximum between the virtual one and � 1. The systems whose dimension is bigger than the ex- pected one are called special systems. There exists a conjecture due to Hirschowitz (see (5)), characterizing special linear systems on P 2 , which has been proved in some special cases (2), (3), (7), (6). Concerning linear systems on P n , in (1) Ciliberto gives a conjecture based on the classification of special linear systems through double points. In this note we describe a linear system on P 3 that we found in a list of special systems generated with the help of Singular (4) and which turns out to be a counterexample to that conjecture. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 1 we fix some notation and state Ciliberto's conjecture, while Section 2 is devoted to the counterexample. In Section 3 we try to explain speciality of some systems by the Riemann-Roch formula, and we conclude the note with an appendix containing some computations.",

As a special case we are able to show that any two degenerate Buchsbaum curves will belong to the same even G-liaison class if and only if they have isomorphic deficiency modules (up to shifts). We then explore when this may also be true for curves which are obtained as hypersurface sections of Buchsbaum surfaces in ℙ 4 .",

In the second part of the paper, we use this characterization to determine the sequence of outer (n – 1)-radii of regular simplices (which are the radii of smallest enclosing cylinders).

Lichnerowicz proved that the abelianization of 𝓛 0 ( X ) is a finite-dimensional vector space, and that its dimension depends only on the topology of X . In this paper we provide analogous results for some classical examples of non-singular complex affine algebraic varieties with trivial canonical bundle, which include certain algebraic surfaces and linear algebraic groups. The proofs are based on a remarkable result of Grothendieck on the cohomology of affine varieties, and some techniques that were introduced with the purpose of extending the Andersén–Lempert theory, which was originally developed for the complex spaces ℂ n , to the larger class of Stein manifolds that satisfy the density property.",

We describe how these varieties are linked to the Freudenthal–Tits magic square, and discuss how they would even fit in, when also allowing the sextonions and other “degenerate composition algebras” as the algebras used to construct the square.",

All feasible Kleinewillinghöfer types of 2-dimensional Laguerre planes were completely determined in 2021. In this paper we investigate the Kleinewillinghöfer types of 4-dimensional Laguerre planes with respect to the automorphism groups of these planes and show that of the 49 types Kleinewillinghöfer described, only twelve are feasible in 4-dimensional Laguerre planes. Examples of four of these type are provided.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Using the Klein correspondence, regular parallelisms of PG(3, ℝ) have been described by Betten and Riesinger in terms of a dual object, called a hyperflock determining ( hfd ) line set. In the special case where this set has a span of dimension 3, a second dualization leads to a more convenient object, called a generalized star of lines. Both constructions have later been simplified by the author. Here we refine our simplified approach in order to obtain similar results for regular parallelisms of oriented lines. As a consequence, we can demonstrate that for oriented parallelisms, as we call them, there are distinctly more possibilities than in the non-oriented case. The proofs require a thorough analysis of orientation in projective spaces (as manifolds and as lattices) and in projective planes and, in particular, in translation planes. This is used in order to handle continuous families of oriented regular spreads in terms of the Klein model of PG(3, ℝ). This turns out to be quite subtle. Even the definition of suitable classes of dual objects modeling oriented parallelisms is not so obvious.",

Moreover, we give a partial classification for d = 35 and d = 36. The latter case will be completely finished in a forthcoming paper [16] of the author, while the case where d = 35 is completed except for groups whose maximal compact subgroups are 9-dimensional.",

These algebras are 2 A , 2 B , 3 C and 4 B . The classification of Majorana representations restricted to the closed shapes was anticipated for a long time. In the present article the classification is achieved for shapes restricted to 2 A , 3 C and 4 B and for the set of generating involutions in the target group forming a single conjugacy class. Timmesfeld’s classification of {3, 4}+-transposition groups reduces to consideration of just three groups: L 3 (2), G 2 (2) ' and 3 D 4 (2). Each of these groups possesses a unique Majorana representation of the required shape. Only the representation of L 3 (2), known before, is based on an embedding into the Monster.",

Similarly, a ( d + 2)- point hypersphere of such a set is one that contains exactly d + 2 points of the set. We find the minimum number of ordinary hyperspheres, solving the d -dimensional spherical analogue of the Dirac–Motzkin conjecture for d ⩾ 3.

A cage is said to hold a set if the set cannot be continuously moved to a distant location, remaining congruent to itself and disjoint from the cage. In how many positions can (compact 2-dimensional) unit discs be held by a tetrahedral cage? We completely answer this question for all tetrahedra.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we investigate an extremum problem for the power moment of a convex polygon contained in a disc. Our result is a generalization of a classical theorem: among all convex n -gons contained in a given disc, the regular n -gon inscribed in the circle (up to rotation) uniquely maximizes the area functional. It also implies that, among all convex n -gons contained in a given disc and containing the center in those interiors, the regular n -gon inscribed in the circle (up to rotation) uniquely maximizes the mean of the length of the chords passing through the center of the disc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Let X ⊂ ℙ n be an unramified real curve with X (ℝ) ≠ 0. If n ≥ 3 is odd, Huisman [9] conjectured that X is an M -curve and that every branch of X (ℝ) is a pseudo-line. If n ≥ 4 is even, he conjectures that X is a rational normal curve or a twisted form of such a curve. Recently, a family of unramified M -curves in ℙ 3 providing counterexamples to the first conjecture was constructed in [11]. In this note we construct another family of counterexamples that are not even M -curves. We remark that the second conjecture follows for generic curves of odd degree from the de Jonquières formula.",

    "abstract": "In 1895 Wiman introduced the Riemann surface W of genus 6 over the complex field C defined by the equation X6+Y6+Z6+(X2+Y2+Z2)(X4+Y4+Z4)-12X2Y2Z2 = 0, and showed that its full automorphism group is isomorphic to the symmetric group S5. We show that this holds also over every algebraically closed field Kof characteristic p ≥ 7. For p = 2, 3 the above polynomial is reducible over K, and for p = 5 the curve W is rational and Aut(W) ≅ PGL(2,K). We also show that Wiman's F192-maximal sextic W is not Galois covered by the Hermitian curve H19 over the finite field H192.",
