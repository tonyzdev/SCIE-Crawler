    "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this paper was to discuss the design and development of an innovative e-nose system which can detect respiratory ailments by detecting the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the expelled breath. In addition to nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, the expelled breath contains several VOCs, some of which are indicative of lung-related conditions and can differentiate healthy controls from people affected with pulmonary diseases. Methods: This work detailed the sensor selection process, the assembly of the sensors into a sensor array, the design and implementation of the circuit, sampling methods, and an algorithm for data analysis. The clinical feasibility of the system was checked in 27 lung cancer patients, 22 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, and 39 healthy controls including smokers and non-smokers. Results: The classification model developed using the support vector machine (SVM) was able to provide accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 88.79, 89.58 and 88.23%, respectively for lung cancer, and 78.70, 72.50 and 82.35%, respectively for COPD. Conclusions: The sensor array system developed with TGS gas sensors was non-invasive, low cost, and gave a rapid response. It has been demonstrated that the VOC profiles of patients with pulmonary diseases and healthy controls are different, hence, the e-nose system can be used as a potential diagnostic device for patients with lung diseases.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this work to determine the influence of a program containing exercises in a closed kinematic chain, eccentric and strength exercises on injuries of students – rock climbers. Methods: Participants in this study were 84 male amateur climbing students, aged 18–19, 40 athletes were in the intervention group and 44 in the control group. In the intervention group, the program for the injuries prevention has been stalled. The program included exercises that are performed in a closed kinematic chain in combination with exercises that are performed in eccentric mode and strength exercises. We determined the Incidence rate ratio and confidence intervals. The Incidence rate ratio was determined by the by Fisher exact test. Results: The significant influence of the developed program on the reduction of injuries among the athletes of the intervention group was revealed. Injury rate per 1000 AEs recorded of all shoulder injuries in the control group was 3.182, in the intervention group was 0.5, P &lt; 0.001. The incidence rate ratio for mild shoulder injuries was 0.861 (0.737; 1.007). The incidence rate ratio for moderate shoulder injuries was 0.862 (0.751; 0.990; P = 0.039). The incidence rate ratio for severe shoulder injuries was 0.864 (0.768; 0.971; P = 0.017). Conclusions: The use of exercises in a closed kinematic chain and exercises in an eccentric mode reduces the Incidence rate ratio of shoulders among students – amateur climbers. The incidence rate ratio decreases in the intervention group for mild, moderate, and severe shoulder injuries.",

Methods: By using Inertial Measurement Units a lower limb joint angles (hip, knee and ankle in sagittal plane) during walking and running were calculated. The geometric model of a human leg pneumatic exoskeleton was presented. Joint angle data acquired during experiments were used in the mathematical model. Results: The position and velocity of exoskeleton actuators in each phase of the movement were calculated using the MATLAB package (Matlab_R2017b, The MathWorks Company, Novi, MI, USA). Conclusions: The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach that can be utilized to analyze the kinematics of pneumatic exoskeletons using the dedicated design process. The developed mathematical model makes it possible to determine the position of lower limb segments and exoskeleton elements. The proposed model allows for calculating the position of the human leg and actuators’ characteristic points",

This study aims to optimize the geometric parameters of polylactic acid (PLA) scaffolds fabricated via 3D printing, focusing on pore size, porosity, and geometric configurations to enhance mechanical performance and biological functionality. Methods Two geometric configurations—orthogonal and offset orthogonal—were evaluated with pore sizes ranging from 400–1000 µm and porosities between 55–70%. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in ANSYS Workbench was used to simulate mechanical behavior, while the Taguchi experimental design determined the optimal parameter combinations. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA, assessed the significance of each factor. Results The study identified a pore size of 400 µm as optimal for structural strength, while a porosity of 70% provided a balance between stability and cell growth. Orthogonal geometries distributed stress more uniformly, reducing critical stress concentrations compared to offset configurations. ANOVA revealed that pore size was the most significant factor, followed by porosity and geometry, achieving a model reliability of R² = 98.42%. Conclusions The findings highlight the importance of geometric optimization for improving scaffold mechanical properties while maintaining biological functionality. This study offers a robust framework for designing patient-specific scaffolds tailored to bone tissue engineering applications.",

Investigations were carried out in the group of 5 competitors with mastery class of taekwondo WTF. Indicators which described two maximal trials of each limb of the body for the side-kick (yop-chagi) and spinning back kick (dwit-chagi) were analyzed. The athletes executed strokes against vertically mounted force plate equipped with an appropriate absorption layer which minimized the risk of injuries. The signal of force was sampled with the frequency of 800 Hz. Signals were filtered by Bessel’s filter at a limit frequency of 75 Hz. The following indicators were analyzed: maximal and average values of stroke force, impulse of stroke, time of gaining maximal force, average velocity of increasing stroke force. The results show that taekwondo athletes recorded similar values of the strokes investigated. The differences in maximal stroke force were 6% and in average stroke force ‐ 3% and they were also related to athlete’s weight. The results confirm athlete’s ability to use the total body mass to increase the stroke force. No significant relations were found between time of gaining maximal force and the value of stroke force. This proves that the technique of stroke, different size and kind of striking surfaces influence the value of stroke force.",

Methods: The study examined 29 healthy non-athlete young adults. A test was performed for 30 s while standing on one foot, without moving, with eyes open and arms relaxed along the sides of the body. The examinations were performed twice, with a one-week interval. Relative reliability was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI), whereas the absolute reliability was evaluated based on the standard error of measurement (SEM) and the minimal detectable change (MDC). Results: The results of this study showed moderate to good relative reliability scores for all the postural stability measures, with ICC values ranging from 0.62 to 0.70. For most of the analysed variables, SEM% ranged from ca. 10 to 14%. Relatively high SEM% values were obtained only for two variables (Area, Convex Hull Area). Conclusions: The low costs of GYKO inertial sensor systems, the fast and easy installation, the mobility and high reliability of the measurement of postural stability show that it can be effective alternative to stabilographic platforms.",

The objectives were to share a numerical model capable to evaluate the long-term stability of implants and to use this model to extract data sets showing how shape and material stiffness of threaded, press-fit and modular press-fit implants affect stress-shielding intensity. Methods: Three designs were considered: threaded, press-fit and modular press-fit. The effect of shape and material stiffness of each design on stress-shielding intensity was assessed using Young’s modulus (10 to 210 GPa). Furthermore, the impact of the diameter of percutaneous part (10 to 18 mm) and thickness of medullar part (5 to 1 mm) was investigated for the modular press-fit implant. Results: The threaded design generated 4% more bone mass loss at the distal femur but an overall loss of bone mass was by 5% lower to press-fit design. The influence of Young’s modulus on bone mass changes was noticeable for modular press-fit implant, depending on diameter of percutaneous or medullary part. A 20 GPa change of stiffness caused a bone mass change from 0.65% up to 2.45% and from 0.07% up to 0.32% for percutaneous parts with 18 mm and 10 mm diameter, respectively. Conclusions: Results suggested that threaded implant provides greater stability despite an increased bone loss at the distal femur. Altogether, this work provided an initial model that could be applied in subsequent studies on the long-term stability of current and upcoming implants.",

Methods: The analysis of the effect of various positions of the pelvis was performed using the Free Posture Model in the AnyBody Modeling System software. Simulated positions involving various values of pelvis inclination ranged from the extreme pelvic retroposition (–7°) through normative values (0–23°) to the extreme pelvic anteversion (33°). Results: The lowest resultant reaction forces in the intervertebral joints recorded for an angle of inclination restricted within the range of 9–27° and segment L5–S1 amounted to less than 0.7 BW. A change in the pelvic inclination from the normative values towards retroposition or anteversion resulted in the increased muscular activity of the erector spinae, transverse abdominal muscles as well as internal and external oblique muscles. Regarding the lower limbs, changes in the activity were observed in the biceps femoris muscle, iliac muscle, gluteus minimus, gluteus medius and the gluteus maximus. Conclusion: The results obtained in the research-related tests confirmed that the pelvic inclination affects loads present in the musculoskeletal system. The abovenamed results will be used to develop therapeutic exercises aimed to reduce loads present in the musculoskeletal system. The aforesaid exercises will be used to teach participants how to properly position their pelvis and how to activate individual groups of muscles.",

As the respiratory tract is considered to be potentially exposed to contamination during the implantation procedure there is a need to modify the implant with an antibacterial additives. The purpose of this work was to analyze the effect of biodegradable polymer – polycaprolactone (PCL) modification with various additives on its antibacterial properties. Methods: PCL filament modified with graphene (0.5, 5, 10% wt.), bioglass (0.4% wt.) and zinc-doped bioglass (0.4% wt.) were used to print spatial biomaterials using FDM 3D printer. Pure polymer biomaterials without additives were used as reference samples. The key task was to assess the antimicrobial impact of the prepared biomaterials against the following microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25293, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Results: The research results point to a significant antibacterial efficacy of the tested materials against S. aureus and C. albicans, which, however, seems to decrease with increasing graphene content in the filaments. A complete lack of antibacterial efficacy against E. coli was determined. Conclusions: The tested biomaterials have important antibacterial properties, especially against C. albicans. The obtained results showed that biomaterials made of modified filaments can be successfully used in implantology, where a need to create temporary tissue scaffolds occurs.",

The participants were asked to perform a running task. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was used to investigate any differences between NS and BS during the running stance phases. The principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to further explore the differences of the muscle force between the BS and NS. Results: Significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) were found in the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ1), ground reaction force (GRF), ankle joint and around muscle forces. Furthermore, the accuracy of SVM model in identifying the gait muscle force between BS and NS reached 100%, which proved that the BS had a very large impact on the gait muscle force compared with NS. Conclusions: We found that BS may be better suited to the human condition than other unstable shoes, or even NS. In addition, our results suggest that BS play an important role in reducing ankle injuries during running by increasing muscle participation in unstable conditions while better restoring the most primitive instability of foot condition that humans have.",

The study aimed to evaluate the biomechanical effects of different shoe longitudinal bending stiffness (adjusted by inserting carbon plate) on the lower limb during running in novice runners and experienced runners. Methods Twelve experienced runners and ten novice runners ran at a speed of 4.47 m/s while randomly wearing shoes with either low stiffness (5.9 Nm/rad) or high stiffness (8.6 Nm/rad). An Opensim musculoskeletal model was adopted for estimating lower limb joint angles, joint angular velocities, joint moment, joint work, peak joint reaction forces during running stance phase. Results Results showed that novice runners displayed greater lower limb joint mobility and less joint moment, while experienced runners exhibited less joint mobility but greater joint moment, and higher peak joint reaction forces were observed at the knee and ankle joints. Furthermore, increased shoe longitudinal bending stiffness resulted in higher peak joint reaction forces at the metatarsophalangeal joint for novice runners while lower for experienced runners. Conclusions Novice runners may face an increased risk of metatarsal pain or stress fractures when dealing with higher shoe stiffness. This nuanced understanding of joint dynamics underscores the need for tailored training and footwear recommendations to mitigate injury risks specific to different levels of running experience.",

The efficiency of intercalation has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Zeta potential measurements. The materials were studied for surface wettability, roughness and mechanical properties during 6 weeks of incubation in phosphate buffer saline, and their bactericidal activity was tested against Escherichia coli bacteria before and after 6 weeks of incubation in distilled water at 37 °C. The presence of antibiotics during the incubation was monitored by conductivity and pH measurements. Results: The results indicate that nanocomposite polylactide films with montmorillonite filler intercalated with gentamicin and neomycin tend to degrade faster that their counterparts with non-intercalated fillers, which affects their mechanical properties. However, drug intercalation provided an antibacterial activity, which was confirmed by the presence of zones inhibiting the growth of Gram-negative bacteria for both antibiotics. It was also confirmed that the interaction of antibiotics with clay and polimer matrix did not adversely affect this bactericidal effect. Conclusions: Montmorillonite can be successfully intercalated with both gentamicin and neomycin, and then used as active filler for polylactide films having very good antibacterial properties, therefore their use in biomedical applications can be significantly expanded.",

Methods: Three self-adhesive, self-etching cements (Panavia SA, RelyX U200, Maxcem Elite), and one conventional cement (Panavia V5), were selected to lute three CAD/CAM ceramics (IPS Empress CAD, IPS e.max CAD, IPS e.max ZirCAD) onto the dentin. The bond strength was evaluated using a shear strength test according to the PN-EN ISO 29022:2013-10. Evaluation of the differences was performed using the Statistica software. Failure modes were analyzed using a light microscope. Results: All the studied cements differed (regardless of the ceramic type) in the bond strength. The highest bond strength was observed in Panavia V5, lower – in RelyX U200 and Panavia SA, and the lowest – in Maxcem. For IPS e.max ZirCAD, it was observed that compared to Panavia V5, the other cements were characterized by a significantly higher bond strength. For the IPS Empress CAD and the IPS e.max CAD, Panavia V5 displayed the highest bond strength. For all the studied self-adhesive cements, the failure of adhesion between the cement and dentin was predominant mode. Conclusions: Significant differences were found in the shear bond strengths of the CAD/CAM ceramics luted to dentin using tested self-adhesive and conventional cements. The bond strength depended on the combination of ceramic and cement. The IPS e.max ZirCAD had the highest bond strength to dentin after cementation with RelyX U200, while the IPS Empress CAD and IPS e.max CAD – with Panavia V5.",

The aim of the study was to investigate FHL and FHB activation in two isometric toe flexion tasks – one called a “toe-pushing” task with the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints extended and the interphalangeal (IP) joints in neutral and another called a “toe-gripping” task with the MTP joints in neutral and flexed IP joints. Methods Twenty participants’ FHL and FHB muscles were instrumented with intramuscular electromyography electrodes. Muscle activation was normalized to a maximum voluntary contraction and compared between the two isometric toe flexor force production tasks. Results Overall, participants utilized these two toe flexors completely differently in the two tasks. In the toe-gripping task, the FHL was activated to a much greater extent than the FHB. In fact, 18 our of 20 participants activated FHL at more than seventy percent maximum voluntary contraction and half of participants activated FHB at less than ten percent. In contrast, muscle activation during the toe-pushing task appeared more reliant on the FHB for most participants. Conclusions Different contributions from the FHL and FHB to toe flexor force production in these two tasks are potentially driven by differences in muscle functional length among other factors. These findings help to inform the selection of rehabilitation and training exercises meant to preferentially target intrinsic or extrinsic foot musculature.",

The results showed that the four upper limb locations chosen are differentiated by the value of maximum handgrip force. The study also confirmed the hypothesis that upper limb location influences the component of muscle activity which is responsible for handgrip force exertion.

Lack of chartered and experienced prosthetist has often led to painful experience of wearing prosthesis and this will in turn deter the patients to wear the prosthesis, which will further aggravate stump shrinkage. Thus, the hydrostatic socket which demands relatively lower level of fabricating skill is proposed to replace the PTB socket in order to produce the equivalent, if not better, quality of support to the amputee patients. Both sockets' pressure profiles are studied and compared using finite element analysis (FEA) software. Three-dimensional models of both sockets were developed using MIMICS software. The analysis results showed that hydrostatic socket did exhibit more uniform pressure profiles than that of PTB socket. PTB socket showed pressure concentration near the proximal brim of the socket and also at the distal fibula. It was also found that the pressure magnitude in hydrostatic socket is relatively lower than that of PTB socket.",

The Holmes method recommends that knee angle be between 25° and 35° when the pedal is at bottom dead centre in static. Other authors advocate knee angle of 30-40° during maximum knee extension while pedalling. Although knee angle would be 5-10° greater at bottom dead centre during pedalling, no study has reported reference values in this condition. The purpose of this study was to compare these three methodologies on knee, hip, and ankle angles and to develop new dynamic reference range at bottom dead centre.Twenty-six cyclists volunteered for this experiment and performed a pedalling test on their personal road or mountain bike. Knee, hip, and ankle angles were assessed by two-dimensional video analysis.Dynamic knee angle was 8° significantly greater than static knee angle when the pedal was at bottom dead centre. Moreover, dynamic knee angle with the pedal at bottom dead centre was 3° significantly greater than dynamic knee angle during maximum knee extension. The chosen methodology also significantly impacted hip and ankle angles under most conditions.The results allow us to suggest a new range of 33-43° when the pedal is at bottom dead centre during pedalling. Thus, this study defines clearly the different ranges to determine optimal saddle height in cycling according to the condition of measurement. These findings are important for researchers and bike-fitting professionals to avoid saddle height adjustment errors that can affect cyclists' health and performance.",

In addition, the effects of annealing temperature (450-550 °C) on the electrochemical characteristics of these structures, as well as the influence of diameter and height of TiO2 nanotubes on these properties were examined. The results were referred to a compact TiO2 layer (100 nm thick). METHODS The electrochemical test included open circuit potential, impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements. The scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy analyser, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction analysers were used for surface morphology characterisation as well as elemental, phase and chemical composition of TiO2 layers. RESULTS It was found that nanotubes with the diameter of 50 and 75 nm (height of 1000 nm) annealed at 550 °C exhibit the lowest impedance and phase angle values. However, the voltammetric detection of potassium ferricyanide indicated that the closest to 1 Ipc /Ipa ratio were shown by nanotubes with a diameter of 50 and 75 nm annealed at 450 °C. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of performed analysis, it can be stated that the TiO2 layer with nanotubes of 50 nm in diameter and of 1000 nm in height, annealed in 450 °C may be indicated as the ones having the most favourable sensing and biosensing properties.",

The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of gait speed on plantar pressure variables in flatfoot by comparing it to normal foot posture. Methods: Thirty individuals with flatfoot and 30 individuals with normal foot posture were recruited. Plantar pressure variables were obtained by a pressure-sensitive mat at self-selected slow, normal, and fast speeds. All assessments were performed on the dominant foot, and three satisfactory steps were obtained for each gait speed condition. The order of gait speeds was randomized. Results: In the flatfoot group, the contact area was higher in the midfoot, third metatarsal, and hallux at all speeds, also in the second metatarsal at slow and normal speeds than the normal foot posture group (p &lt; 0.05). The maximum force was higher in the midfoot and hallux at all speeds in the flatfoot group (p &lt; 0.05). Also, the maximum force was lower in the first metatarsal at normal and fast speeds, and in the lateral heel at fast speed (p &lt; 0.05). In the flatfoot group, the peak pressure was found to be higher in the hallux at slow speed, but to be lower in the first metatarsal at fast speed (p &lt; 0.05).

Methods: The comparative analysis was based both on experimental tests and computer simulations performed in the AnyBody Modeling System environment. Input data used to prepare models were based on the information obtained in experimental tests. The test participants were tasked with adopting two postures: 1) standing position and 2) sitting position. Kinematics measurements were performed using the Zebris ultrasonic system. During sitting position, the tests additionally involved the use of a dynamometric platform measuring reaction forces occurring between buttocks and the seat. Results: The comparative analysis included measurements of the trunk inclination angle and the pelvic inclination angle as well as results of computer simulations. The sitting posture is responsible for increased trunk inclination and a change in the position of the pelvis. In terms of the sitting position, it was possible to observe an increase in the loads affecting individual intervertebral joints of the lumbar spine by 155–184% in comparison with the standing posture (100%). Simulations revealed an increased muscle activity of the erector spinae, abdominal internal oblique muscles and abdominal external oblique muscles. Conclusions: Adopting a sitting position increases the loads on the lumbar spine and increases the activity of the erector spinae and abdominal muscles compared to the standing position, which is caused by change in the position of the pelvis and the curvature of the lumbar region.",

This study also aimed to investigate the effect of different implant stiffness and parafunctional loading values on the defined mechanical stimuli transfer from the implant to the surrounding bone. Methods A three-dimensional finite element model of two-piece threaded dental implant with internal hexagonal connection and mandibular bone block was constructed. Response surface method through face-centred central composite design was applied to examine the influence of two independent factors variables using three levels. The analysis model fitted to a second-order polynomial equation to determine the response values. Results The results showed that the implant stiffness was more effective than the horizontal load value in increasing the stress and strain energy density transfers. The interaction between both factors was significant in decreasing the likelihood of bone resorption. Decreasing the implant stiffness and horizontal load value led to the increased stress transfer and unexpected decrease in the strain energy density except at the minimum level of the horizontal load. The increase in the implant stiffness and horizontal load value (up to medium level) have increased the strain energy transfer to the bone. Conclusions The stress and strain energy density were transferred distinctively at the bone-implant interface. The role of both implant stiffness and parafunctional loading is important and should be highlighted in the pre-operative treatment planning and design of dental implant.",

The study aims to use the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to analyze electromyographic signals (EMG) recorded during diagnostic assessment of muscle and peripheral nerve electrical activity (electroneurography) using an electromyography device (EMG). Methods The analysis involved implementing calculations such as mean frequency (MNF) and median frequency (MDF) using the reconstructed EMG signal through DWT. The study examined the efficacy of DWT analysis in assessing muscle fatigue after physical exertion. Results The study obtained a negative regression coefficient for DWT analysis in all muscles except for the right gastrocnemius (GAS). The results suggest that DWT analysis can be an effective tool for evaluating muscle fatigue after physical exertion. Conclusions The use of DWT in the analysis of EMG signals during rowing ergometer exercises has shown promising results in assessing muscle fatigue. However, additional investigations are necessary to confirm and expand these findings. This publication addresses the literature gap on the determination of muscle fatigue considering motion analysis on a rowing ergometer using the discrete wavelet transform. Previous studies have extensively compared and analyzed methods such as the Fourier transform (FFT), short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and wavelet transform (WT) for muscle fatigue analysis. However, no previous work has specifically examined the assessment of muscle fatigue by incorporating DWT analysis with motion analysis on a rowing ergometer.",

This report deals with the in vivo tensile deformability of lumbar segments only. The biomechanical parameter analysis and the time-dependent numerical creep model of human lumbar spine segments will be reported in forthcoming papers.",

The research was carried out for three professional dancers. Kinematic and kinetic parameters of the landing were analysed.The mean maximum GRF value in relation to the classical dancer amounted to 8.16 ± 1.37 N/BW. During landing, the joints of the lower limb are affected by external force moments of high values (ankle - 3.04 ± 0.54 [Nm/BW], knee - 7.56 ± 5.53 [Nm/BW], hip - 10.97 ± 6.80 [Nm/BW]). The maximum value of the external force moments in the joint were strongly negatively correlated with the value of the angle in the hip joint at the moment of the first contact with the ground. It was noticed that the obtainment of maxGRF was preceded by a decrease in kinetic energy of approximately 50%.Factors affecting loads present in the musculoskeletal system during the shock absorption of a leap are: GRF values, the values of external force generated inside the joints and a change in the value of kinetic energy. The safe shock absorption after landing is influenced by properly positioned limb at the moment of the first contact, a greater range of movements in the joints and longer time from the moment of the first contact to the obtainment of maxGRF.",

Another ten asymptomatic individuals were defined as the Control group. The inhomogeneous properties were assigned to the models. The muscle forces and boundary conditions corresponding to left and right unilateral occlusions were applied on the models. The analysis of variation (ANOVA) was chosen for the comparison among the groups. Results: The results showed that the Pre group had abnormal stress distributions ang higher stress level in TMJs, compared with those of the Post and Control groups. Moreover, from clinical cases, symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) always followed with increased stresses. Conclusion: Generally, orthognathic surgeries could improve the stress distribution in TMJs of the patients with mandibular prognathism under the unilateral occlusions. However, the postoperative complications, especially symptoms of TMD, were closely related to changes of stress for patients with mandibular prognathism after orthognathic surgeries. Individual virtual surgery and finite element analysis should be conducted to prevent complications in TMJ.",

In the first stage of the study, the experimental tests were conducted using a research test stand, designed to be used in this evaluation. The study evaluated the blood flow through a silicone vessel with an implanted coronary stent. Methods: The PIV method was used in order to visualize the flow vectors inside a silicone vessel. Deformed vessel geometry implemented for computational fluid dynamics purposes was obtained owing to a non-linear simulation of the stent expansion (angioplasty process) in a silicone vessel. Additionally, a vessel model with a statistical 55% area stenosis and an irregular real vessel with an atherosclerotic plaque were also subjected to analysis from the hemodynamic flow point of view. A vessel with a statistical stenosis was also used to simulate the angioplasty process, which resulted in obtaining a flow domain for the vessel with an atherosclerotic plaque after the stent implantation. Results: For each case, distributions of parameters such as OSI or TAWSS were also analyzed and discussed. The areas of low TAWSS values appear close to the stent struts. Conclusions: Stents with increased diameters, compared to the normal vessel diameter, create a higher risk of occurrence of the areas with low WSS values. Excessive stent deformation can cause inflammation by injuring the vessel and can initiate the restenosis and thrombotic phenomena through the increased vessel diameter.",

We also investigated the effects of running speed on the bilateral asymmetry of the lower limb joints kinematic variables among novice runners. Methods: Kinematic (200 Hz) running data were collected bilaterally for 17 healthy male novice runners (age: 23.1 ± 1.3 years, height: 1.77 ± 0.04 m, mass: 72.3 ± 4.57 kg, BMI: 23.1 ± 1.0 kg/m2) running on a treadmill at 5 fixed speeds (8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 km/h) in a randomized order. Symmetry angles (SA) were calculated to quantify gait asymmetry magnitude at each running speed. Results: Overall, SPM analysis using paired t-tests revealed significant joints kinematic differences between the left lower limb and the right lower limb at each running speed. Significant differences between limbs were found for all joint kinematic variables in the ankle and hip, regardless of running speed. As for the knee angle, significant differences between legs were only found during the running speed of 11 km/h. For knee angle velocity, significant differences between legs were found in all running speeds except for 8 km/h. However, there was no noticeable difference in asymmetry values across running speeds. Conclusions: The findings of the current study indicate that gait asymmetry of joint kinematics variables between lower limbs during running is apparent in healthy novice runners. Meanwhile, running speed does not influence lower limb joints kinematic asymmetry among novice runners.",

When the bone injury occurs, the blood flow at the defect changes from laminar flow to turbulent flow. Consequently, it is essential to employ a numerical simulation method that accurately reflects the actual conditions to study and analyze the surface FSS experienced by scaffolds and cells, thereby enhancing the osteogenic properties of the scaffolds. Methods In this research, nine scaffolds with different structures and pore sizes were designed. The two-way fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method was used to evaluate scaffolds' internal flow field velocity and the surface FSS of scaffolds and cells. Results The results show that the velocity distribution of different scaffolds is basically the same. FSS on the scaffold surface and FSS on cell surface decreased with the increase of scaffold aperture. FSS accepted by cells was much larger than that received by scaffolds, and FSS was distributed in a stepped pattern on the cell surface. Conclusions Based on the FSS of the scaffold and cell surface, the triangle-600 and triangle-800 scaffolds have better osteogenic differentiation ability. This provides a more practical strategy for tissue engineering to design better scaffolds.",

Methods IMU (Noraxon Ultium) data from 13 International Taekwon-do Federation (ITF) athletes (9 training, 4 validation) across genders and skill levels (expert in training, expert/advanced in validation) were collected. Sensors were attached to a foot, shank, and tight kicking leg. Athletes performed turning kicks in diverse stances towards a padded force plate (2000 Hz) attached to a wall. LSTM models were trained to predict kick force value, and trained on capturing the IMU data from sensors placed on the lower limb. Results The trained LSTM models showed accuracy on the training data (R-square values 0.972 - 0.978). Feature validity analysis highlighted the importance of ankle dorsiflexion in shaping the model score. Model performance on the validation dataset was less consistent, ranging from good accuracy (RMSE 6.91) to poor accuracy (RMSE over 30), depending on the participant tested. Conclusions This study demonstrated the potential of LSTM models combined with IMU data to predict Taekwondo kick forces. Although the validation performance indicated the need for further model refinement or the inclusion of additional input variables, the results highlighted the feasibility of predicting force values without relying on a force plate. This approach could enhance the accessibility of field studies conducted outside laboratory settings.",

However, the underlying mechanisms behind in-stent neoarteriosclerosis and restenosis following the intervention remain unclear. Our hypothesis posits that stent implantation may impact the transportation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) within the host artery, thereby disrupting its concentration distribution and leading to adverse clinical events. Methods To validate this hypothesis, we conducted a numerical investigation to examine the influence of stenting on LDL distribution, utilizing a lumen-wall model based on the coronary artery. Results The findings of the study suggest that the introduction of an implanted stent can disrupt blood flow and result in an abnormal accumulation of lipids on the inner surface of the arterial wall, particularly in the vicinity of the strut protrusion. Additionally, improper stent implantation, characterized by thick struts, reduced spacing between struts, and non-streamlined struts, can exacerbate the local mechanical conditions of the host artery and contribute to a relatively high concentration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) near the stent strut. Conclusions In summary, the presence of a stent in the artery leads to an elevated LDL concentration both within the stented segment and downstream, potentially leading to adverse consequences.",

Methods Based on the Weight-Bearing Lunge Test (WBLT), a total of 32 basketball players into two groups: normal dorsiflexion (ND) and limited dorsiflexion (LD) and conducted six countermovement jumps (CMJ) while collecting motion and force data. Personalized musculoskeletal models were created using OpenSim to analyze kinematics and kinetics, and Helium-free MRI and CT scans were used for finite element modeling to assess internal tissue stress in the knee. Results During landing, the patellofemoral joint contact force in LD was reduced compared to the ND. The coactivation of muscles around the knee joint decreased. The von Mises stress in the tibial cartilage, meniscus, anterior cruciate ligament, and posterior cruciate ligament were elevated. Conclusions The results suggest that increased ankle dorsiflexion during landing may effectively reduce internal tissue stress in the knee joint while enhancing muscle coactivation around the knee joint and increasing patellofemoral joint contact force. These findings provide valuable theoretical support for strategies to reduce the risk of knee injuries during landing. Additionally, they offer reliable technical approaches and theoretical insights for studying injury mechanisms in other sports activities, such as running and lateral jumping.",

The simulation of the cooling process was carried out according to the liquidus-tracking (LT) protocol developed by Pegg et al., including eight stages in which both the bath solution concentration and temperature are controlled to prevent the formation of ice crystals. Methods To determine the temperature distribution during cryopreservation processes, one uses the Fourier equation, while mass transfer was taken into account using an equation based on the Fick's laws. This paper considers a model assuming fuzzy thermophysical parameters described by a triangular and a Gaussian membership function. The numerical problem was solved using the finite difference method including fuzzy set theory. Results The diagrams of temperature and mass distributions as a function on time and the distribution of the fuzzy variable at a given moment in time were prepared. Moreover, the fuzzy temperatures and concentrations were compared with experimental results from the literature in table. Conclusions In the conclusions, two different types of membership functions were compared with each other, with which the fuzzy variables were described. It can be said that the Gaussian membership function works well for experimental data where the mean and standard deviation are known. In addition, the obtained results were confronted with experimental data. The calculated fuzzy temperatures are consistent with the temperature values occurring in the LT protocol.

However, there is a lack of experimental studies that compare the influence of both procedures on knee periarticular muscles biomechanics. The aim of the study was to analyze periarticular muscles torque and their activity during movement for young patients after ACL repair (IB) and ACL reconstruction (ACLR), compare them with each other and with a healthy subjects (Controls). Methods Methods: Isokinetic torques of knee flexors and extensors and their EMG activity during gait and drop vertical jump (DVJ) were measured in 48 patients (IB – 20, ACLR – 28) at least one year after surgery and in 25 healthy controls. Results Results: The muscle torques in the operated limb were lower in both group of patients comparing to Controls, but IB scored the lowest values (79% of Controls for extensors, p=0.005; 74% for flexors, p=0.001). Decrease of muscle torques in the contralateral limb occurred only in IB group (84% of Controls for both extensors (p=0.045) and flexors). Increased hamstrings activity were noticed for ACLR comparing to IB and Controls. The balance between activity of muscles acting on the medial and lateral side of the knee for ACLR tilts more towards the lateral side. Conclusions Conclusions: Increased hamstrings activity and changes in balance between laterally and medially located muscles indicate on the increased need for muscle support of knee stability in ACLR patients.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study investigates cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics to enhance the understanding of brain biomechanics and the importance of CSF during high-impact loading. Methods: Comparative analyses were conducted using the benchmark model with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), without cerebrospinal fluid, and with an additional element - the arachnoid trabeculae - which functions as rigid connections between the brain and skull. The numerical modelling of cerebrospinal fluid and the derived conclusions were validated and calibrated through experiments performed in the additional research phase. Results: The research emphasises the challenges of accurately modelling cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and brain biomechanics. The results were unexpected in several ways. Initially, a rigid cortex-skull connection was anticipated to yield results nearly identical to those observed in Hardy's experiments. Even more surprising were the results for the models with cerebrospinal fluid modelled as smoothed particle hydrodynamics and the model without cerebrospinal fluid, which showed almost identical results in comparison to each other. The novel physical experiment with a gelatine insert subjected to controlled loading and numerical model simulations revealed that SPH models exhibited closely resembling fluid displacement, while tetrahedral elements imposed unrealistic rigidity. Conclusions: The simulations and the novel experiment provide key insights into cerebrospinal fluid dynamics during traumatic brain injury. The findings suggest that the protective function of CSF might be less pronounced under extreme conditions than previously assumed. The smoothed particle hydrodynamics method demonstrates clear advantages over tetrahedral finite element approaches by offering superior brain-in-skull flexibility and avoiding the excessive rigidity inherent to traditional finite element models. We concluded that mechanism of brain protection by CSF is performed rather by hydraulic damping than the brain immersion in vast volume of CSF.",

Methods A sample of 50 children under the age of 12 years was divided into three groups (i.e., gymnasts, handball players, and video gamers). They participated in a dual-task experiment involving mental rotation tasks with static and dynamic balance assessments. Participants performed mental rotation tasks (i.e., object-based 3D cube and human body conditions) while simultaneously maintaining static and/or dynamic balance on a stabilometric platform. Center of pressure sway, acceleration, and displacement were measured. Performance in both cognitive and balance tasks was recorded and analyzed. Results The results revealed significant immediate beneficial effects of cognitive tasks on dynamic balance. Specifically, dual tasks led to improved performance in mental rotation tasks and enhanced postural control, as evidenced by a reduced center-of pressure sway (p &lt; 0.01). Athletes demonstrated greater improvements than non-athletes, highlighting the effectiveness of cognitive engagement in improving postural control. Conclusions These results suggest that participation in sports during childhood can significantly enhance neuromuscular control and balance, which are critical for maintaining stability. The findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive challenges into physical training. This approach enhances both cognitive and motor performance in young athletes.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The objective of this study is to ascertain how specific somatic traits and kinematic indices influence the force of a punch, contingent on the type of kick (i.e. turning kick and side kick). Methods One hundred kicks were performed by five female elite ITF taekwon-do (International Taekwon-do Federation) athletes (aged 27.0 ± 4.8 years, body mass 64.2 ± 5.8 kg, height 163.0 ± 6.5 cm). To record the force of the impact, a strain gauge platform padded with a training disc was used as a target to protect the participants from direct impact on a force plate mounted on a stable structure. Results The study demonstrated that the side kicks of female taekwon-do athletes achieved, on average, a higher peak pressure force (1770 N) than the turning kick (1379 N) (p &lt; 0.01). Conversely, the lower limb segments demonstrate an inverse trend in terms of average peak acceleration values. The effective mass values recorded in this study expressed as a percentage of the athletes’ total body mass, were approximately 18% for the turning kick and 85% for the side kick. Conclusions The findings of these studies demonstrate that pressure force evidently increases with rising effective mass. However, no correlation was observed between the acceleration of the foot and the other segments of the lower limb. The calculated β* factor indicates that there are no lateralisation differences in pressure force between kicks performed with the right and left leg.",

Lower limb exoskeletons are the most widely used as assistive devices for people with disabilities. The aim of the study was to determine the magnitude of forces necessary to induce the fall of a person using the Polish prototype of the exoskeleton robot. Methods Sixteen volunteers used DreamMotion prototype designed to perform medical tasks was tested. Measurements of the fall-inducing forces were performed in compliance with safety standards. Assessed were fall-inducing forces acting in various directions in 3 static, vertical body positions. In each test position, 10 trials were completed resulting in the effective measurement. Results In the 2-leg standing with posterior vector direction, the lowest value of fall-inducing force was recorded (mean 1.50kG). Also, in 1-leg standing position, the lowest value of the fall-inducing force was recorded with posterior vector direction (1.66kG). In the step position, the highest fall-inducing forces were recorded with the posterior (8.58 kG) and anterior (6.37kG) vector directions, the lowest – with the lateral vector direction towards the stepping limb (3.26kG). Conclusions The forces required to induce a fall in a person wearing the exoskeleton robot are relatively low, with relative forces ranging from 1.45% to 8.30% of the subject-ER setup weight. In both the 2-leg and 1-leg standing positions, the lowest fall-inducing forces were recorded when the force vector was directed posteriorly. The exoskeleton robot’s design will likely need to be modified to enhance safety in this particular direction.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The current study aims at comparing the protective performance of helmets with different sizes and cushion materials for skull and brain injuries in children. Methods A 6-year-old child head finite element (FE) model was used to conduct impact simulations under the protection of helmets with different sizes (small, medium and large) and cushion materials (EPS-expanded polystyrene, PU-polyurethane and airbag) according to the testing conditions specified by the standard. The protective performance of different helmets was evaluated by assessing skull and brain injury risk calculated from the kinematic and biomechanical response of the child head model. Results The skull fracture risk of children under the protection of airbag helmets is lower than that of EPS and PU helmets by more than 50%. Large-sized helmets, with thicker padding, show better protective capability for skull injury compared to small-sized helmets. The risk of brain injury under airbag helmet protection is significantly lower than EPS and PU helmet under 4.8m/s sharp drill impact test condition, and small sized helmet could generally reduce brain injury risk under the 6.2m/s flat drill impact test condition. However, no obvious effect has been found of helmet size and material to brain injury risk in the impact scenarios at 6.2m/s. Conclusions Both size and cushion material of the helmet have a significant influence on its skull injury protection performance, but their effect pattern on brain injury protection capability is not obvious. The use of airbag helmets can effectively reduce both the risk of skull and brain injuries under relatively low impact loads.",

In this study, we analyzed differences in body composition, segmental muscle mass and isometric strength in soccer players, basketball players, handball players and volleyball players. Methods Height and weight were measured in 96 men aged 20.7±1.88 years training in academic sports clubs in Wrocław (Poland): football (n=24; age: 20.3±1.08 years), basketball (n=24; age: 20.9±1.83 years), handball (n=24; age: 21.2±1. 90 years) and volleyball (n=24; age: 20.3±1.06 years). Body composition was assessed using BIA and SBIA. Motor tests were conducted to assess grip strength and back strength. Results It occurred that soccer players are characterized by significantly lower height. Handball players have higher body cell mass and better results in strength tests. Additionally, they have a less muscular torso and more strongly muscled legs. Basketball players, handball players and volleyball players are characterized by a more muscular right side of the torso. Football players are distinguished by greater muscularity of the right lower limb. Among volleyball players, greater muscularity of the right upper limb was noted. In football, handball and basketball players, significantly greater right hand strength was observed. Conclusions It can be concluded that training load in team games shapes specific differences in body composition and isometric strength. Team game players also tend to develop directional asymmetries in the musculature of body segments and grip strength.",

Methods The authors reconstructed patient-specific model of the cerebral arteries with diagnosed aneurysm. Then, four virtual models of the Flow Diverter stent (with varied nominal diameters) were prepared. During the numerical analyses, the Immersed Solid Method was used to model the presence of the stent wirebraid. After performing steady state and transient simulations of non-Newtonian blood flow in pre- and post-treatment models, changes in numerous hemodynamic parameters were analysed. Results The results confirmed that stent porosity influences hemodynamic changes inside the aneurysm (for presented case studies). The less porous the stent, the more it promotes the possible intrasaccular thrombosis. This could be concluded by observing larger regions of stagnant blood with higher viscosity. Additionally, the denser the stent, the lower and more uniform the stress exerted on the aneurysm wall. Conclusions Numerical simulations can provide valuable insight into phenomena occurring inside the blood flow after implanting the stent. This can support selecting optimal stent configuration for the particular patient and, consequently, can help in planning the endovascular procedure.",

Methods To modelling of the potential action then Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) model was used. The model consists of four coupled differential equations: one partial differential equation, which describes the temporal and spatial variation of the membrane potential, and three ordinary differential equations, which represent the dynamics of voltage-gated ion channels. The HH model consists of four coupled differential equations: one PDE, which describes the temporal and spatial variation of the membrane potential, and equation represent the dynamics of voltage-gated ion channels. This model was solved numerically by the finite difference method. Results The results indicate on change of the action potential for a nerve cell activated by a continuous electrical stimulus, assuming high conductivity of the Na+ and K+ channels. According to the presented model the ion channels respond to pressure, what modulate the permeability of the neuronal membrane for ions. Conclusions The results of the analyses suggest that pressure above 1.4 kPa can disrupt the normal functioning of nerve cells, leading to serious health consequences. In addition, a load of nerve cells, less than 1%, can cause disorders in the functioning of the nervous system. As a result, this mechanism leads to damage to nerve cells, disorders in the conduction of nerve impulses and affects the functioning of synapses.",

Methods Thirty-five participants, comprising 15 young and 20 elderly, completed 60-second bipedal quiet standing trials on a force plate. Excluding the initial and final 10-second preparation and recovery phases, the central 40 seconds of CoP trajectory were quantified using time-domain and frequency-domain parameters across the medial-lateral (ML), anterior-posterior (AP), and resultant spatial (RS) directions. Rambling (RM) and trembling (TR) components were also extracted. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed-effect regression (LMER). Results SD significantly affected CoP control, with the elderly exhibiting greater changes in most variables than the younger group. During the transition from transparent to SD conditions, time-domain parameters showed a significant increase in mean movement distance and root mean square in the RS direction for both traditional and RM components among the elderly. Additionally, the 95% confidence circle and ellipse areas were larger in the elderly group. In the frequency-domain parameters, such as 80% power frequency, frequency dispersion, and concentrated frequency decreased in the AP and RS directions for both traditional and RM components in the elderly group. Conclusions The reduction in visual inputs caused by SD leads to decreased flexibility and automaticity in the postural control of elderly individuals, making it more difficult for them to control CoP sway and adapt to changes in visual input compared to younger individuals.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The goal is to repair soft tissue defects (such as those in the stomach or bladder) using flexible fibrous materials that adapt to the shape of the affected area. These materials would also include a marker to track tissue regeneration and the gradual breakdown of the patch. By incorporating a radiopaque marker, like barium sulfate (BaSO₄), into polymer fibers (e.g., PCL), the processes of resorption and tissue regrowth can be effectively monitored using X-ray imaging. Methods In this work fibrous patch of electrospun polymer fibers based on polycaprolactone (PCL) with submicron barium sulfate (BaSO₄) was prepared. Their physicochemical (wettability, surface free energy), mechanical (uniaxial tensile test), microstructural (fiber and particle size distribution) and biological (viability and cytotoxicity in contact with BJ fibroblasts for 3 and 7 days) properties were investigated. The relative durability of the implant in vitro and the safety of degradation products were demonstrated. Results Barium sulfate particles (ranging from 0.03–1.3 µm for non-ground samples, 0.8–90 µm for ground samples) were successfully encapsulated within polycaprolactone fibers (~900 nm). The incorporation of barium sulfate increased fiber thickness and altered the diameter distribution from bimodal to unimodal. All resulting materials exhibited hydrophobic properties. Surface free energy was predominantly dispersive, with a polar-to-dispersive (P/D) ratio of approximately 1:10. Submicron particles in fibers volume reduced ~50% the maximum tensile force and tensile strength. Implant are biocompatibility and supported cell viability. Conclusions The fibrous implant base on PCL and barium sulfate can obtaining be electrospinning method and be visualized using RTG imaging in ex vivo model.",

Methods The posture of children (n=43, mean age 7 years) was analysed. Group 1 included those who did not use orthopedic equipment; Group 2 – users of unilateral AFOs; Group 3 – users of bilateral AFOs. The BTS SMART D-140 6 TVC optoelectronic system was used. Results There were no significant differences between the study groups in terms of obliqueness, rotation or pelvic inclination in standing position, or in hip joint angle on the (un)affected sides with and without AFOs. However, differences could be observed in obliqueness and rotation after applying AFOs (0.1&gt;p&gt;0.05). In all study groups, knee flexion angle on the affected side was greater. After putting on the orthoses (Groups 2 and 3), knee joint flexion decreased. Analysis of measurements without orthoses showed significantly less dorsiflexion and greater external rotation of the ankle joint on the affected side (p&lt;0.05). After putting on the orthoses (Groups 2 and 3), the differences in dorsiflexion noted in the ankle joints of both feet did not exceed 1°. In such conditions, the rotation in these joints also became equal. Conclusions The use of AFOs in children with hemiplegic CP has a beneficial effect on the joint directly supported, while also aiding other joints of the lower limbs and pelvis. Bilateral AFOs lead to greater improvements in standing symmetry than unilateral ones.",

    "abstract": "Basketball requires high lower limb performance. Assessing jump biomechanics is vital for enhancing performance and injury prevention. Marker-based (MB) systems are common but limited. In recent years, Markerless (ML) motion capture systems have gradually become emerging tools in sports biomechanics research due to their characteristic of not requiring physical marker points. However, their specific application and verification in basketball events are still relatively limited. Purpose: In this study, lower limb kinematics and kinetics estimated by MB and ML motion capture systems during jumps were compared. Methods: Twelve subjects performed the standing vertical jump (SVJ), standing long jump (SLJ) and running vertical jump (RVJ) tests. Data was collected using 10 infrared cameras, 6 high-resolution cameras and two force platforms via Vicon Nexus software. Markerless motion capture calculated sagittal plane angles, torque and power of the Hip, Knee and Ankle joints via Theia3D software, with these parameters also collected by the marker-based Vicon system. Both systems' '64ata were then processed in Visual3D. We analyzed the correlation coefficient (r), root mean square difference (RMSD), and maximum/minimum errors, as well as using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to compare temporal patterns between groups and determine specific moments where significant differences occurred. Results: SLJ capture was slightly inferior in both systems. SPM analysis of the sagittal plane showed significant differences only at the hip joint. Joint angle RMSD was < 8.2°, torque RMSD < 0.41 N·M/kg, and power RMSD < 1.76 W/kg. Conclusions: The ML system accurately captures knee and ankle joints in the sagittal plane but shows significant differences in hip measurement and certain movements, requiring further validation.",

Methods: Six knee models were established under a musculoskeletal multibody dynamic framework. The ACL attachment points and muscle volume of the quadriceps femoris and hamstrings were modified to simulate ACL reconstructions and post-operative muscle atrophy. Walking and running simulations were performed to quantify ACL graft force and PFJ contact force. A single stance phase of the motion cycle was divided into eleven time points (periods 0.0-1.0). The computational results were statistically tested at each time point. Results: The results showed that central ACL reconstruction reduced graft force at contralateral toe-off and toe-off phases under walking conditions and the entire cycle under running conditions, with maximal reductions were 10.96 ± 7.42% and 29.00 ± 10.41%, respectively. Compared to AM reconstruction, central reconstruction increased the mean PFJ contact force by up to 2.12 ± 1.17% of body weight during periods 0.4-0.9 of the walking cycle and exhibited a complex pattern during the running cycle. Conclusions: Central ACL reconstruction provided a significantly higher PFJ load compared to AM reconstruction during walking after surgery. No consistent conclusions were reached between the two surgical protocols on PFJ contact force during running. These findings provide clinicians with a better understanding of the PFJ mechanics after ACL reconstruction.",

Methods This paper analyzes the postoperative macroscopic spine model in the modal, time, and frequency domains to obtain the vibration response of the patient's entire spine. Subsequently, the stresses in the cortical bone mesoscopic bone units around the surgically damaged interface were calculated using submodeling algorithms. The pore stresses and pore flow velocities of the osteocytes were then derived from the stresses of the mesoscopic bone units to predict fatigue damage at the fusion surface. Results The findings indicated that the first three orders of intrinsic frequency exerted the most significant influence on the spine model. The maximum stress of the bone unit was observed at the X3 bone plate on the left side of the fusion surface, and the maximum pore pressure and flow velocity of the bone cells occurred at the X4 on the right side of the fusion surface. The medical implants used in spinal orthopedics, titanium cages and pedicle nails, change the mobility of the adjacent segments and also create a stress shielding effect that impacts the fusion of bone tissues. Conclusions Microscopic bone cell synapses experience greater pore pressures and pore flow velocities in the vibration environment compared to those under the static environment, which may promote cell growth. Vibration at low loads typically does not induce fatigue damage to cancellous bone at the fusion surface of medical implants.",

Traditional measurement methods, however, are often limited by expensive equipment and laboratory settings. This study aimed to develop an accurate, portable and cost-effective method using a deep learning model based on data from wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) to predict comprehensive plantar pressure distributions. Methods: We proposed a hybrid model combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network. The CNN extracts local features from IMU data; the BiLSTM captures temporal dependencies; a temporal attention mechanism optimizes the prediction of key time steps; and body weight information is integrated to accommodate individual differences. Results: Experimental results show that in 10-fold cross-validation, the model achieves a Mean Squared Error of 0.98 and a Structural Similarity Index of 0.89, demonstrating excellent prediction accuracy and distribution similarity. Conclusions: This study provides a cost-effective method for plantar pressure analysis, which is expected to be integrated into wearable devices for real -time gait monitoring, with applications in rehabilitation and sports optimization.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The aim of this study was to compare the biomechanical parameters of runners during overground and treadmill running, to assess the significance of these differences for treadmill training, and to evaluate their relevance for physiotherapy. Methods Ten professional runners (mean age of 31.2 ± 6.8 years) were evaluated using a 10-camera Vicon motion capture system and a Phantom V12 high-speed camera. After completing a 200-meter overground run at a self-selected pace, each athlete entered the calibrated capture volume, where their running velocity and kinetic data were recorded. The individual mean velocities were then replicated on a treadmill positioned within the same capture space. Results Treadmill running altered lower limb biomechanics compared to over-ground running. Median step length was 3% longer and markedly less variable on the treadmill than over-ground (p &lt; 0.001). The knee-flexion angle differed by surface and side (p &lt; 0.0001), changes were (1° for left, -2° right) but variability narrowed on the treadmill, while the knee-impact angle remained unchanged. Relative to over-ground running treadmill running reduced the horizontal distance between the center of gravity and foot initial contact; ground-contact time (12%) and heel velocity after toe-off by 19 % (p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions Treadmill running alters lower limb biomechanics by reducing ground contact time, heel velocity, and variability in movement patterns. The consistent mechanics observed on the treadmill may support its use in physiotherapy, particularly for hamstring rehabilitation. However, due to limited replication of natural conditions, treadmill training should complement rather than replace overground running.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat pain, but they have side effects, including the inhibition of bone healing. Diclofenac (DF), a member of the NSAID group, affects bone health adversely. One potential approach to protect bones from the effects of NSAIDs involves the administration of short nucleic acids, such as microRNAs (miRNAs). This study aimed to determine whether two specific miRNAs, miR-15b and miR-365, could mitigate the effects of DF on bone. Methods: We used the C57BL/6J mouse strain and the MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cell line derived from this mouse strain. Female C57BL/6J mice were treated with DF and miR-15b or miR-365 mimics. After euthanising the mice, we analysed their femurs using micro-computed tomography (μCT) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). In addition, we performed experiments in cultured MC3T3-E1 cells, which were transfected with either miR- 15b or miR-365. We assessed the relative mRNA levels of osteoblast differentiation markers using real-time PCR. Results: Our findings indicated that miR-15b and miR-365 were effective in reversing the detrimental effects of DF on bone mineral density. DF decreased the bone's storage modulus (E'), while miR-15b and miR-365 ameliorated this effect. In the preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells, DF did not significantly regulate marker genes; however, the administration of miR-15b and miR-365 reduced the gene expression of Runx2, Alp, and Satb2. Conclusions: In summary, the impact of DF on the structural and mechanical properties of bone was not mediated by gene regulation in osteoblasts. However, osteoblasts were responsive to the administration of miR-15b and miR-365.",

Methods A total of 68 participants (40 males and 28 females) were included. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group using a balanced randomization scheme. Athletic performance was assessed using unloaded countermovement jump (CMJ), unloaded squat jump (SJ), and isokinetic knee flexion and extension strength tests. The experimental group received an isometric activation protocol, while the control group maintained their regular exercise routines. Results The isometric activation protocol led to varying degrees of improvement across genders in the experimental group. Among male participants, there were significant increases in CMJ performance 24 hours post-activation. SJ performance also improved significantly. Furthermore, SJ performance remained significantly elevated 48 hours post-intervention compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.05, JH: ES = 0.829). For female participants, SJ performance showed significant improvement 24 hours after activation, although no other significant changes were observed.Regarding knee flexion and extension strength, at an angular velocity of 60°/s, the male group exhibited significantly greater strength at 48 hours post-intervention compared to 24 hours . In the female group, bilateral knee strength significantly improved at both 24 and 48 hours post-intervention. Conclusions ISA interventions can enhance knee joint strength in both male and female participants within 24 and 48 hours post-intervention, and also induce a cross-activation effect.",

Methods Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) data contains two classes (healthy and diabetic), 15 features and 3525 instances. In the first stage, the widely used and effective KNN and Regression methods were employed for the filling of missing data. Then, the data source transformed into grayscale images as primary images and multiplexed images. Finally, both original data and transformed data are classified with KNN, SVM and CNN using k-fold cross validation technique. Performance metrics were compared to extract the best suitable system. Results The original GDM source and the missing values replacement of GDM are classified with KNN and SVM methods. Also, primary images of this dataset and multiplexed images are classified with CNN 50%-50% and 70%-30% train-test respectively. The results of classification performance demonstrated that reaching up to 97,91% with CNN, recall of 97,61%, specificity of 97,61%, Precision of 97,97%, and F1-score of 97,79%. This result outperformed all previous studies conducted on the same dataset in the literature. Conclusions This work is demonstrated a new approach that the best results of classification accuracy when compared with previous studies related to proposed methods to identify GDM disease. It can be clearly stated that applying a data mining method to impute missing values, followed by converting the dataset into images based on certain criteria and classifying with CNN, is the most effective approach for predicting GDM.",

Methods A running-induced fatigue protocol was employed to explore changes in joint angle, moments, stiffness, and loading rate during the CMJ landing pre and post -fatigue. Paired-sample t-tests assessed changes in discrete parameters of joint stiffness, loading rates, and time-varying parameters were compared with one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping. Results Fatigue significantly reduced the range of motion (ROM) during landing, with significant differences in angles, specifically the dorsi-plantar flexion of right ankle, flexion-extension of left hip, rotation of left knee, and adduction-abduction of right knee (P&lt;0.001). The first loading rate at touchdown decreased by 10%, and the time intervals between the first and second peak and the second and third peak reduced by 40% and 80%, respectively. Joint loading increased and the sagittal joint stiffness of left hip, right knee, and right ankle exhibited significant differences post-fatigue (P&lt;0.001). Knee joint reduced the flexion angle (P&lt;0.001) and the load of knee joint (P&lt;0.001) during post-fatigue, with the role compensated by hip and ankle joints to achieve balance in the lower limb kinetic chain. Conclusions These findings provide pilot evidence that running fatigue may lead to changes in lower limb joint loadings and provide a scientific foundation for fatigue prediction and injury assessment.",

Methods Football players aged 14-16 joined the study and were evaluated for lower extremity alignment in the frontal plane radiographs. We examined adductor longus muscle thickness and cross-sectional area on both sides with ultrasound. To evaluate anaerobic power capacity, we did a 30-second Wingate test. Correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were performed. Results Twenty-seven football players were enrolled in the study. The anatomical axis angle of the right side was 2.85+1.75, and left side was 2.67+1.62. A positive and strong correlation was found between both side muscle cross-sectional area and maximum and average power (right: r=0.829, p&lt;0.001; r=0.851, p&lt;0.001, left: r=0.742, p&lt;0.001; r=0.789, p&lt;0.001, respectively), and the right and left muscle thickness and the maximum and average power (right: r=0.678, p&lt;0.001; r=0.717, p&lt;0.001, left: r=0.714, p&lt;0.001; r=0.741, p&lt;0.001, respectively). The multiple regression analysis found that average power could be assessed with right and left axis angles, right muscle cross-sectional area, age, body mass index, and career duration. The analysis showed that these variables accounted for 80.3% of the variability in the average power (F(6,20)=13.558, p&lt;0.001). Same independent variables could explain 77.6% of the variability in the maximum power (F(6,20)=11.577, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Muscle thickness and cross-sectional area strongly correlate with average and maximum power. The cross-sectional area and lower extremity alignment angle in the dominant leg could be used to estimate anaerobic power outputs.",

Investigating the local hemodynamic characteristics and analyzing the postoperative flow dynamics can provide valuable insights for determining the optimal implantation angle, thereby offering clinical guidance for improved surgical outcomes. Methods Three-dimensional anatomical model of the Left Ventricle (LV) and BMHV was reconstructed based on patient-specific medical imaging data and anatomical parameters. The hemodynamic effects of varying implantation angles were investigated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) integrated with a Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) framework. Results The key analyses focused on the downstream shear stress distribution, vortex dynamics, clinically relevant hemodynamic indicators. When the valve was implanted along the axis of the aortic outflow tract (referred to as the AO angle), several benefits were observed. Blood flow penetrability improved, high shear stress regions were reduced, mechanical trauma to blood cells was significantly lessened. Quantitative metrics further demonstrated that the AO angle minimized values of Time-Averaged Wall Shear Stress(TAWSS), Oscillatory Shear Index(OSI) and Relative Residence Time(RRT). These metrics indicate more stable hemodynamics and a lower risk of ventricular wall inflammation and thrombosis. Furthermore, the Hemolysis Index (HI) reached its lowest level under the AO angle, suggesting optimal mitigation of hemolysis. This study systematically examines how the orientation of BMHV implantation affects LV hemodynamics. It identifies the AO angle as the most effective strategy for positioning. Conclusions These findings provide quantitative evidence that can inform preoperative planning and support the advancement of precision-guided cardiac valve interventions based on hemodynamics considerations.",

In this model, the effect of Hertzian contact stiffness and local shell stiffness are combined to derive explicit equations for impact duration, the peak force transmitted to head, and the head injury criterion. One of the advantages of the model presented is sensitivity to the site of impact.

Six balance tests were performed with the use of AMTI AccuSway Plus ACS platform: quiet standing for 30s, maximal voluntary sways of the body in the sagittal plane (anterior-posterior – AP test) for 30 s, and in the frontal plane (left-right – ML test) for 30s. All tests were performed in two conditions: eyes open and eyes closed. Results: During quiet standing with eyes open, most balance measures were lower in girls (p &lt; 0.05). In AP and ML tests with eyes open, a few balance parameters were different between boys and girls (p &lt; 0.05). In quiet standing, AP and ML tests with eyes closed, there were no between-gender differences (p &gt; 0.05). In quiet standing with eyes open and closed most balance parameters were negatively correlated with age (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Quiet standing postural sway characteristics depended on gender under normal visual conditions and it was similar in boys and girls under visual deprivation conditions.

    "abstract": "Purpose: An arteriovenous fistula has been a widely accepted vascular access for hemodialysis, however, a fistula maturation proces is still not fully understood. In the short period of time, right after vein and artery shunting, the physical and biological changes take place mainly in the venous wall. A two-stage modeling method of arteriovenous fistula maturation process was proposed and presented. Methods: The first stage of the maturation was modeled with two-way coupled fluid structure interaction computer simulations. Whereas for the second, biological stage, a model was based on the change in the elasticity of the venous wall due to wall shear stress (WSS) modifications. Results: The relation between stress and radial and circumferential strain, based on Lame’s theory, makes possible to introduce a mathematical model defining modulus of elasticity, averaged WSS, and venous diameter as time functions. The presented model enables one to predict changes in the monitored parameters in the arteriovenous fistula taking place in the time longer than 90 days. Conclusions: We found that probably the majority of fistulas can be assessed to be mature too early, when the adequate blood flow rate is achieved but mean WSS still remains at the non-physiological level (&gt;10 Pa).",

Methods: Various mechanical properties, i.e., mechanical failure properties, elastic moduli, inflection point coordinates, index of anisotropy and incompressibility were determined under uniaxial loading conditions in the circumferential and axial directions. Constitutive parameters were derived from the commonly used constitutive model proposed by Holzapfel et al. [9]. The microstructural arrangement was examined by histological staining supported by scanning electron microscopy analysis. The content of collagen fibres and elastic lamellae was tested in relation to mechanical properties and constitutive parameters. Results: Significant differences were found in the microstructural arrangement and layer composition of the aneurysmal specimens, compared to the normal aorta group. The mechanical properties and constitutive parameters of the aneurysmal specimens were significantly altered, indicating a weakening of the load-bearing properties of the walls of the aneurysms. A comparative analysis discovered significant correlations between structural composition and mechanical parameters, in particular with respect to the number of collagen fibres and failure stress, which can be important for clinical evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture. Conclusions: Changes in the content of collagen fibres and elastic lamellae correlate with mechanical and constitutive parameters, indicating AAA severity.",

Methods: The study examined members of the Polish National Badminton Team seven women and seven men. A special torque meter was used to assess the strength of the upper limb muscles. Vertical jumps were performed on an AMTI force plate. Shuttlecock velocity was measured using Vicon motion capture system. Results: Differences between the right and left limbs were observed in all muscle groups except shoulder flexion for both genders. The results of all measured parameters: torques, height of countermovement and spike jump (HA CMJ , H CMJ , H SPJ ), V maxWJ and V maxNJ , were greater for men than for women. No statistically significant differences were found between V maxWJ (men: 83.27 ± 4.83 m/s; women: 67.57 ± 4.21 m/s) and V maxNJ (men: 84.19 ± 6.05 m/s; women: 69.70 ± 6.53 m/s) within the same gender. Positive correlations were found between both H CMJ and H SPJ regarding V maxWJ in men; the height of shuttlecock impact in jump smash (H WJ ) and H SPJ in women; proving the importance of jumping ability in badminton. Negative correlations were found between HWJ and V maxWJ for both genders. Conclusions: The jump before smash is not used in order to hit the shuttle from the highest point, but to gain time to correctly prepare the phase of stroke while being in the air.",

Methods: Using computational modeling and design optimization techniques, the objective of this study was to compare the biomechanical functions among different combinations of design factors using computer simulation. A finite element foot model was reconstructed from a midfoot arthritis patient. Orthotic designs with 3 levels for each of the 3 design factors (arch height, lateral wedge angle, and insole stiffness) contributed to 9 configurations using a fractional factorial design were tested. Results: An increase in peak plantar stress of the midfoot was facilitated by a medium arch height and wedge angle, and stiffest insole material, notwithstanding the combination neither reduced the peak plantar stress of other foot regions nor was consistent with the combination that minimized the stress of the articular cartilage. Conclusions: Insole with high arch (H = 30 mm), low stiffness (E = 1.0 MPa), and medium wedge angle (A = 5°) could minimize the stress of the cartilage at the arthritic joint (primary outcome) and could be beneficial to the patients. Also, insole stiffness predominantly influenced cartilage stress. However, secondary outcomes including the stress of the navicular and medial cuneiform and the regional plantar stress did not produce the same solution. Future studies can consider a patient-specific loading profile to further the investigation on the stabilizing effect and the attenuation of load transfer induced by the insole.",

Methods: Thirty-one men performed strength assessment at different velocities (V) (V1 = 0.15 m·s−1, V2 = 0.30 m·s−1, V3 = 0.45 m·s−1) and range of movement (R) (R1 = 25% cm; R2 = 50% cm), and isometric contraction at 90º. Reliability was obtained through the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical error (TE), and coefficient of variation (CV). Results: The absolute reliability provided stable repeatability of the average eccentric strength in the V1R1 condition (CV = 9.52%) and the maximum eccentric strength in V1R1 (CV = 9.63%) and V2R2 (CV = 9.66%). The relative reliability of the trunk extensor’s average strength was good (ICC = 0.77–0.83) for concentric and good (ICC = 0.78–0.85) and moderate (ICC = 0.67–0.74) for eccentric contraction. Also, good (ICC = 0.77–0.81) and moderate (ICC = 0.55–0.74) reliability of the maximum strength were obtained for concentric and eccentric contraction. The most reliable manifestation to evaluate the concentric (CV = 11.33%) and eccentric (CV = 9.52%) strength was the average strength in the V1R1 condition and the maximum strength (CV = 10.29%) to isometric assessment. The average concentric strength in the V2R2 condition (r = 0.69) and the maximum eccentric strength in the V1R1 condition (r = 0.65) were the best related to the maximum isometric strength. Conclusions: FEMD is a highly reliable device to evaluate trunk extensors strength.",

The research team explores three geometric structures produced through additive methods and compares their energy absorption properties with a standard bicycle helmet made of Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) foam. Methods The study prepared samples of three geometric structures (a ball, a honeycomb, and a conical shape) and a fragment of a bicycle helmet made of EPS foam with the same overall dimensions. Laboratory tests were conducted using a pneumatic hammer, piston compressor, anvil, triaxial accelerometer, and data processing systems. Three crash tests were performed for each type of structure, and the anvil's maximum acceleration and stopping distance after the crash were analyzed. Results The study found that the energy absorption properties of the Polylactic Acid (PLA) material printed with the incremental method were comparable or better than those of the EPS material used in helmets. The geometric structure of the energy-absorbing material played a crucial role in its effectiveness. The most promising results were obtained for the ball samples. Conclusions The study concluded that further research on energy-absorbing structures made using the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) method could be useful in the production of bicycle helmets. The results show that the geometric structure of the energy-absorbing material is a crucial factor in its effectiveness. The findings suggest that the ball-shaped structure made with PLA material printed using the incremental method could be a promising design for bicycle helmets to minimize head injuries caused by collisions.",

To achieve a successful shot, these variables need to be adjusted according to the player’s position on the court. This study aims to identify the changes in kinematics variables of the basketball jump shot with an increasing shooting distance performed by players with varying skill levels. Methods Seventeen male subjects, divided into experienced (N = 9), and non-experienced (N = 8) players, performed three successful jump shots from the free-throw line (4.23 m) and the 3-point line (6.75 m). All attempts were recorded at 120 Hz with a camera perpendicular to the sagittal plane, and the kinematics variables were calculated using Tracker software. Results The increase in shooting distance shows a decrease in height and angle of ball release. In contrast, the velocity of ball release increased for both groups at longer distances. Experienced players present a higher mean value of the height of ball release in both distances, which allowed a lower velocity of ball release. Conclusions The most meaningful improvement for players training the jump shot technique, is to increase the release height of the ball, jumping higher and shooting the ball near the peak of the jump.",

Modern trends in the design of adhesive orthodontic cements focus on the ability to release cariostatic fluoride ions. One of the methods is to incorporate the material with fluorapatite nanoparticles. The aim of the study was to determine the fluoride release capacity of orthodontic cement doped with nanosized fluorapatite in selected media and solution pH over a 12-week period. Methods A commercial light-curing two-component orthodontic cement GC Fuji Ortho®LC was modified by the addition of nanofluorapatite at 2% or 5% by weight. Each of the three groups (5 samples in 9 different media of varying ionic composition and pH). Fluoride determination was performed at 18 time intervals. Results The largest amount of fluoride is released in the first hour of incubation of all samples. Incorporating cement with 5% w/w nFAp significantly increases the amount of ions released. Low pH and artificial saliva rich in calcium cations promote significantly lower fluoride detection, which is associated with the formation of CaF2 conglomerates. The erosion of the surface layer was confirmed by the SEM image to be responsible for the ability to release the largest amounts of fluoride ions in an acidic environment. Conclusions The selection of experimental media for studying the fluoride release capacity of biomaterials is important in terms of the results achieved. The nanofluorapatite content correlates with the amount of fluorine released. Some limitations of the current research require further studies.",

Methods Kinematic and kinetic parameters of 12 football players performing a vertical drop jump from a 30 cm high box were recorded using the Xsens MVN Awinda motion capture system and Vald Force Decks. Results The findings revealed significant differences in range of motion between the limbs, particularly in internal/external rotation and dorsiflexion/plantarflexion (p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were found in abduction/adduction or flexion-extension ROM between limbs during both landing phases. Internal/external rotation range differed significantly during the first landing phase (p &lt; 0.05) but not the second. Hip joint flexion/extension exhibited minimal variation compared to the ankle and knee, with slight increases observed at the hip. From a kinetic standpoint, concentric mean power demonstrated a strong positive correlation with peak power (ρ = 0.903), underscoring its crucial role in optimizing performance and mitigating injury risk. Conclusions The study evaluated biomechanical indicators strongly linked to ACL injury risk. Findings highlight that asymmetrical loading and movement patterns—especially knee valgus and inter-limb discrepancies—may predispose female athletes to non-contact ACL injuries. These results emphasize the need for neuromuscular training interventions targeting symmetry, proprioception, and controlled landing to reduce injury risk and enhance performance.",

Whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) is used in MS rehabilitation, but its effect on balance without subsequent kinesiotherapy remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the impact of 10 and 20 WBC sessions, without kinesiotherapy, on disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale – EDSS), muscle spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale – MAS), and body balance. Methods The study was completed by 51 patients, aged 23 to 65 years, with a disability grade of 3.5-6.5 on the EDSS scale and spasticity 0-3.0 assessed by the MAS. Patients were randomly assigned to the control group (n=18) or the experimental group participating in 20 WBC sessions (n=33). Balance assessment consisted of performing two, 30-second static tests on stabilometric platform, the first test with eyes open and the second one with eyes closed. Results A series of 20 daily WBC resulted in an improvement in the functional status of patients with multiple sclerosis in the form of a significant reduction in EDSS values and spasticity, both on the side with greater and less spasticity. Under the effect of whole-body cryotherapy treatments, there was slight improvement in the stability in patients with multiple sclerosis. Conclusions It can be concluded that WBC, without subsequent targeted kinesiotherapy, are not sufficient to obtain clear and measurable benefits in the rehabilitation of patients with multiple sclerosis.",

The level of mastering elements of the swimming technique and swimming kinematics is a key element to succeed in swiftly reaching the drowning person which is limited by the time needed for drowning. The aim of this study was two-fold: (i) analyze the variations of swimming kinematics after 8-weeks of lifeguard training; and (ii) analyzer the relationships between changes in kinematic outcomes and swimming performance over 25 and 100 meters. Methods Six lifeguard candidates (age: 21.0±1.09 years old; three female and three male students) voluntarily participated in this study. The 4x25-m freestyle test and a 100-m freestyle tests were performed twice (before and after 8-week training period). The tests were video-recorded and the following kinematic variables were calculated: swimming velocity, stroke frequency, stroke length and stroke index. Results No significant changes in kinematic variables were observed. However, a strong correlation (r=0.83) occurred between the swimming velocity of the 4x25m test and the finish velocity of the 100m test. The stroke index of the 4x25 m test was strongly correlated with the swimming velocity of the 100m test (r=0.89). Conclusions Although lifeguard training did not improve swimming kinematics, it is worthwhile using training methods to check the preparation level of a lifeguard to ensure that he/she is properly trained to help people drowning in water bodies.",

Results Significant differences in balance parameters under static conditions were found between OI types (61.5% between Types I and III, 38.5% between Types I and IV, and 30.7% between Types III and IV). Across all OI types, maintaining balance predominantly involved displacement of the COP (Centre of Pressure) in the sagittal plane, observed in 84.7% of Type II OI, 75.2% of Type III OI, and 74.5% of Type IV OI cases. Under dynamic conditions, significant differences in balance parameters were noted in 84.6% of comparisons between Types I and III, 46.1% between Types I and IV, and 69.2% between Types III and IV. Conclusions Balance assessment in individuals with OI is essential for injury prevention, improving mobility and daily function, and monitoring therapy effectiveness. Development of more preventive strategies aimed at reducing fracture risk and enhancing the quality of life for these patients. The relatively small number of patients with type III and the wide age range represent limitations of our study.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The determinants of the sports results of young and adult swimmers differ, especially in sprint races (50-100m). Their identification can be used to assess the athlete's potential and to set appropriate requirements. The aim was to distinguish energy-anthropometric profiles (clusters) among young athletes and to characterize their kinematic indices in freestyle sprint races (50-100m). Kinematic variables from both distances were compared in each cluster. Methods Anthropometric indices and mechanical power of the upper limbs (arm-cranking) were determined in 43 subjects (boys, aged 12-13 years), which were used for cluster analysis. For the 50- and 100m races the following are determined: velocity (v), stroke rate (SR), stroke length (SL) and stroke index (SI). Comparative analysis was performed between clusters and between distances. Results The following clusters were distinguished: Large (LSP), Medium (MSP) and Small Size and Power (SSP), which differed due to anthropometric and power indices. Intergroup differences (LSP, MSP and SSP, respectively) were revealed in v50 (1.65m/s, 1.55m/s, 1.49m/s), v100 (1.52, 1.41, 1.34m/s), SL100 (1.92m, 1.77m, 1.72m), SI50 (2.92m/s2, 2.65m/s2, 2.54m/s2), SI100 (2.91m/s2, 2.51m/s2, 2.31m/s2). In all clusters differences were revealed between v50 and v100 and SR50 and SR100. Differences in SL50 and SL100 were noticed in LSP and MSP, while in SI50 and SI100 in MSP and SSP. Conclusions The evaluation of the technique should consider the energy-anthropometric profile of the athlete. The swimming technique need to be modified depending on the distance – also in races perceived as sprints.",

This research aimed to provide a reference for the numerical reconstruction studies of traffic collisions based on human body models. Methods: The walking posture of the Chinese 50th percentile male pedestrian model AC-HUMs (Advanced China Human body Models) was transformed, after which an analysis model was established for simulation based on the simplified model of the minivan vehicle and the collision information. Subsequently, the injury conditions of the model's lower extremities, chest and head were extracted, and compared with the information of the injured person. Results: The findings reveal that the pedestrian model exhibits tibia-fibula fractures in the lower limbs, six rib fractures in the chest and a head injury classified as AIS5 (Abbreviated Injury Scale), suggesting a potential risk of concussion. While the injuries to the lower limbs and chest are predicted with considerable accuracy, the head injuries in the model are more severe. Conclusions: In the reconstruction of a minivan-pedestrian collision using the AC-HUMs model, AC-HUMs showed good injury prediction capabilities for the pedestrian's lower limbs and chest, and while the head injury prediction based on intracranial pressure was more severe, that, based on brain strain, was consistent with the actual situation, reflecting the model's satisfactory performance. This research provides valuable insights for studying injury patterns among Chinese pedestrians through numerical reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The mechanical environment of the extracellular matrix strongly influences how cells behave - affecting their adhesion, migration, growth, and differentiation. While stiffness has been widely studied, recent research highlights the importance of viscoelasticity, especially the stress relaxation timescale, in how cells sense and respond to their surroundings. According to the widely accepted motor-clutch model, optimal cell spreading occurs when the stress relaxation timescale is similar to the timescale of molecular clutch binding. Methods: Polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels, due to their tunable mechanical properties and bioinert nature, are commonly used as model substrates in mechanobiology. In this study, we investigated how changing the concentrations of crosslinker (N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide) and initiator (ammonium persulfate) affects the viscoelastic behavior of PAAm hydrogels. Using creep-recovery tests and fitting the data to the Standard Linear Solid model, we extracted mechanical parameters and calculated the stress relaxation timescale. Results: We found that the relaxation timescale increases with crosslinker concentration up to 0.05%, then decreases - suggesting an optimal crosslinking density. At a fixed 0.05% crosslinker, increasing initiator concentration reduced the relaxation timescale, likely due to faster gelation and less organized network formation. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate how simple adjustments in polymerization parameters can tune hydrogel relaxation behavior for mechanobiological applications.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Magnetic hyperthermia is a medical procedure for treating cancerous tumors that are medically unsuitable for resection or other treatments. It involves injecting magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) into the cancerous tissue and applying an external alternating magnetic field (AMF) to induce heat in the target tissue. Under the influence of an AMF at radiofrequency range, eddy currents are generated, and MNPs are heated in the tumor's volume, resulting in apoptosis or necrosis. The purpose of this study is to numerically analyze the power losses generated by MNPs, such as specific loss power (SLP) and intrinsic loss power (ILP), as well as the temperature distribution during magnetic hyperthermia concerning a tumor placed in an anatomical model of the female breast. Methods: The AMF source was a helical induction coil with an excitation current surrounding the female breast phantom. Numerical analysis was based on the solving the Helmholtz equation for the magnetic vector potential coupled with the modified Pennes equation, using the finite element method (FEM). The numerical model under consideration included the power dissipation generated by MNPs based on the linear response theory, proposed by Rosensweig, and the Joule heating generated by eddy currents. Results: Comparison of the effects of MNPs concentrations on the outcome thermal profiles of irregularly shaped breast tumors is presented. Additionally, tumor temperature profiles and SLP/ILP parameters are determined in the case of mobilized and immobilized MNPs. Conclusions: MNPs immobilization within the tumor microenvironment significantly diminishes magnetic losses, with a corresponding reduction of approximately 30% in specific SLP/ILP parameter values.",

Methods: The study included 60 boys with Down syndrome and mild intellectual disability aged 11-13 years, assigned to the study group (trained football at the Futbol+ Sports Academy) and the control group (untrained peers). Research tools was the Eurofit Special test. The data were analyzed based on the using chi-squared test, Student's t-test for independent variables, or Mann-Whitney U-test, Pearson's linear correlation or Spearman's rank correlation. Results: Young male football players with Down syndrome scored better for Standing Long Jump ( p < 0.001), Bent Knee Sit-ups in 30 seconds ( p < 0.001), 2 kg Medicine Ball Forward Push with one hand ( p < 0.001), and Walking on a Gymnastic Bench in the Upright Position ( p = 0.001), while for 25 m Run from a High Start, boys from the control group achieved better results ( p < 0.001). There were no statistically significant relationships of Eurofit Special test results with age and BMI. Conclusions: Football training improves physical performance of boys with Down syndrome and mild intellectual disability, especially dynamic balance, muscle strength of the lower limbs, upper limbs and abdomen. It can therefore be assumed that these characteristics are the most important indicators of the effectiveness of football training in these individuals. Age and BMI should not be considered as determinants of motor fitness in children and adolescents with Down syndrome and associated mental retardation.",

Related plantar pressure data including maximum pressure, maximum force, contact area and center of pressure were recorded with Footscan pressure platform.Two types of gait termination have significant differences in the plantar pressure distribution. Maximum pressure and maximum force in the lateral metatarsal increased significantly during UGT, compared to PGT. At the same time, data from the current study suggested that there might be a correlation between the muscle strength levels of individual and the stability during the gait termination, especially between the muscle power and UGT, which means that the more excellent muscle power an individual has, the more stable the body is when UGT is performed.The findings suggest that different muscle strength levels could affect stability during unplanned gait termination.",

Intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles may play a role in postural control, which may be investigated by comparing loading tasks with differing postural demands. The objective of this study was to investigate the interaction of MLA flexibility and loading task on muscle activation. Methods: Twenty healthy adults completed two instrumented single-foot loading tasks: controlled external load of 50% body weight while sitting and bilateral standing. Fine-wire intramuscular and surface electromyography collected flexor hallucis brevis, abductor hallucis, tibialis posterior, flexor hallucis longus, tibialis anterior, and peroneus longus activation. MLA deformation was measured as a percent change in navicular height with loading. Results: During seated external loading, greater MLA deformation was associated with greater muscle activation for all instrumented muscles (R 2 = 0.224–0.303, p &lt; 0.05) except for tibialis anterior. During bilateral stance, there were no correlations between MLA deformation and muscle activation. Activation of all extrinsic muscles except for tibialis anterior were greater during bilateral standing than during external loading (p = 0.002–0.013), indicating activation of these muscles was caused by postural demands of the standing task, not simply load.

However, there is a loosening effect over a long period usage. Therefore, the present study aimed to increase life of an implant by its surface modification. Methods: In present study, sol-gel process has been applied to create tantalum pentoxide (Ta 2 O 5 ) layer coating on Ti-substrate. In this technique, polyethylene glycol (PEG) plays an important role to form uniform porous coating, which can have potential application in formation of strong bonding to the natural bone. Results: Microstructural, elemental, structural and binding energy results showed that the material with 100% PEG-enhanced sol-gel Ta 2 O 5 with spin coating onto Ti substrate followed by an optimized sintering temperature (500 °C) has better porous structure than that of 5% PEG-enhanced sol-gel Ta 2 O 5 coating, and would be suitable for tissue in-growth properties. Conclusions: Therefore, it was concluded that the present spin coated 100% PEG-enhanced Ta 2 O 5 coating onto Ti, having the most suitable morphology with enhanced roughness, could be noteworthy for potential tissue in-growth and it could provide desired bonding at the interface of Ti-implant coating and host tissues in biomedical applications.",

Methods: The study used single kinematic screw-rod pairs made of titanium alloy Ti6Al4V. Mechanical tests (cyclic loads) simulated the stabilizer's operation under conditions similar to actual use. A microscopic evaluation was conducted, analyzing abrasive wear based on measured abrasion areas. Numerical simulations were performed for the standard joint system and for a structural change (an additional insert to increase contact area between the rod and sliding screw cap). Results: The study evaluated the abrasive wear of the mating elements of the stabilizer. Mechanical tests showed an increase in the force observed (11.74 ± 2.52 N) with the increasing number of load cycles. Microscopic evaluation showed abrasion of the caps and rods in two areas (upper and lower). Numerical simulations indicated the highest stresses in the standard system were on the mating elements, i.e., the rod and the cap (15.6 MPa). In the modified joint, stress distribution differed, concentrating on the surface of the insert and the rod, with maximum values of 6.0 MPa (PE insert) and 12.4 MPa (PEEK insert). Conclusions: Comparing the stress distributions obtained in the numerical simulations and the abrasive wear effects produced in the mechanical tests, a similar mechanism was observed (the destruction of the top layer of the mating elements of the stabilizer).",

Methods: The porous fibres with different morphology were manufactured by the electrospinning method from ternary systems composed of PLA and selected solvents. Fibres morphology was examined using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM), their structure was analyzed by FT-IR ATR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Changes in the drug release profile were measured using ICP/UV-Vis methods and the resulting bactericidal or bacteriostatic properties were tested by two-layer disk diffusion test in relation to various drug incorporation methods. Results: The porous fibres can be applied to produce drug-bearing membranes. The spectroscopic studies confirmed incorporation of gentamicin into the fibres and the presence of ethacridine lactate on their surface. Bimodal fibres distribution (P3) promoted faster release of gentamicin and ethacridine lactate from P3G and P3R materials. The electrospinning process coupled with the vapor induced phase separation influenced the glass transition temperature of the porous polymer fibres. The pre/post-electrospinning modification influenced the glass transition, maximum temperature of cold crystallization and melting point of the porous membrane, compared to the neat polymer. The polylactide fibres with gentamicin showed strong bactericidal effect on Gram-positive bacteria, while fibres with ethacridine lactate were bacteriostatic. Conclusions: The obtained fibres with complex surface morphology can be used as a membrane in active dressings as they make it possible to control the release profile of the active compounds.",

Models were run assuming isotropic and elasto-plastic material properties of connecting devices and cortical bone.

Methods: Biopsy procedure including entry and endpoints of needle insertion was planned preoperatively having regard to the resection region segmentation and safety margin definition. Biopsy procedures were performed by two users using an intraoperative optical navigation module on a specially prepared brain phantom. Two visualization techniques were compared: an accurate augmented reality one, where a virtual plan is superimposed onto surgical field by using optical see-through HMD together with personalized calibration method and visualization on the external display. Results: Averaged errors from 24 trials using external display were 2.04 ± 0.83 mm for the first user and 2.69 ± 1.11 mm for the second one, while applying HMD 2.50 ± 0.93 mm (the first user) and 2.17 ± 0.82 mm (the second user), respectively. Conclusions: Proper usage of HMD visualization preceded by the personalized calibration allows the user to perform navigated biopsy procedure with comparable accuracy to its equivalent with the external display. Additionally, augmented reality visualization improves ergonomics and enables focusing on the surgical field without losing a direct line of sight with the field of view as it happens for external displays. However, ensuring high accuracy of augmented reality visualization still requires proper calibration and some user experience, which is challenging.",

Methods: Twenty-seven female adolescent basketball players aged 12.1 ± 0.9 years completed 10 BS trials from a frontal position of 4.75 m and 5.75 m from the basket. Nine anatomical markers were placed on the participants’ dominant side to assess the kinematic variables. The following variables were analyzed: angle, velocity, and height at ball release; centre of mass horizontal displacement and maximum height attained; maximum hip height and hip height at release; shoulder, elbow, and knee angular position and velocity at ball release; deepest knee flexion during the preparatory phase; the peak of the angular velocity of the shoulder, elbow, and knee joints. Results: At release, the angle decreased while velocity increased significantly at 5.75 m. During the release, greater shoulder flexion and increased joint (shoulder and knee) angular velocity were observed. The deepest knee flexion and the centre of mass horizontal displacement were accentuated at 5.75 m. The ball release occurred before the peak of the jump phase. Conclusions: To compensate for the long ball trajectory to the basket, participants perform a set of adjustments in the body segmental organization to increase the ball velocity at release. The coaches’ feedback should focus on the shooting arm’s positioning and in the jump phase (to jump as close to vertical as possible). Also, a consistent shooting technique should be acquired close to the basket before expanding the shooting range.",

A secondary aim was to investigate the correlations between vertical jump height and handgrip strength. Methods Twenty young (21.5 ± 2.8 years) and twenty older (67.0 ± 5.5 years) healthy women participated in this study. Handgrip contractions were used to assess strength measurements of peak force and rate of force development at different time intervals. Vertical jumps were performed on a jump mat. The jump mat measured vertical jump height based on flight time. Results The older women had lower vertical jump height (P &lt; 0.001) and handgrip peak force (P = 0.028) and rate of force development values (P = 0.003-0.016) than the younger women. A larger difference was observed between the groups for vertical jump height (41%) than handgrip peak force and rate of force development (12-17%). Of all the strength measurements, handgrip rate of force development at 200 ms in the young (r = 0.502, P = 0.024) and older (r = 0.446, P = 0.049) women exhibited the strongest correlation with vertical jump height. Conclusions This investigation showed significantly lower vertical jump height and handgrip peak force and rate of force development values in older compared to younger women. Interestingly, the difference between age groups was larger for jump height than handgrip peak force and rate of force development. This suggests that vertical jump performance may be more severely affected by age than handgrip strength characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Rapid development of manufacturing technology allows producing complex, physical 3D models based on a very accurate medical data. The aim of Rapid Prototyping (RP) is to reproduce most exactly “3D reality” within a solid, physical model. This paper presents the meaning of medical modelling, the process of manufacturing with the selected RP method (stereolitography), advantages of medical modelling to doctors and patients. It also reviews briefly the most common Rapid Prototyping methods. The term medical model stands for a physical reproduction of tissues, models of prostheses, implants and the other auxiliary equipment useful for planning and performing surgical treatments, for training and improving medical attendance and rehabilitation [11]. Medical models are created with Rapid Prototyping (RP) techniques. In terms of technological application, Rapid Prototyping refers to fabrication of prototype model, based on a three-dimensional digital data prepared in a CAD software. The RP technology enables manufacturing realistic physical models in each scale and form using various materials and colours. Compared to the traditional labor techniques, creating new models with RP is much less time-consuming. Medical modelling is more and more commonly used to facilitate the doctor’s work. It is employed both in diagnostics and in the planning of complicated operations. It is also used for designing implants, bone transplants, external prosthetic appliances, specialized surgical instruments and dental patterns. This method also serves as a form of training. An actual model of an object under examination facilitates the diagnosis of the problem and simplifies the study of the shape, location and size of an anatomic structure. For better understanding of the problem, the models or their fragments can be coloured. In some cases, sterilized models are used as tools during operations or are applied as means of visualizing a planned procedure.",

For this reason we carried out a lot of different laboratory tests to analyse the mechanical parameters of the aneurysm wall.

Time-dependent flexion/extension following a cyclic laterally directed torque was measured at all six degrees of freedom by a highly precise custom-made 6D apparatus. In order to enhance the localizing resolution of IHA migration as the function of the flexional/extensional angle, small ranges of motion (ROM) were used at several degrees of pre-extension. 4 L3/L4, 3 L4/L5 and 2 T2/T3 human segments were investigated. In extensional motion, wide dorsal IHA-migrations were measured in lumbar segments and correlated with the distinct asymmetric shapes of the characteristics in extensional motion. The respective increase of differential stiffness could mainly be traced back to the enlarging geometrical moment of inertia of the segments by the dorsally migrating IHA. Both thoracic segments showed a predominant IHA-migration in cranial/caudal direction. A simple model makes it evident that the opposite curvature morphology of lumbar and thoracic joint facets conditions the different directions of IHA migration.",

Recordings were analysed using the SkillSpector programme.Boys swam faster (F: 1.24 m/s, M: 1.35 m/s), overcame a greater distance during one cycle (F: 0.67 m, M: 0.74 m), performed movements with higher toes amplitude (F: 0.58 m, M: 0.63 m), obtained higher amplitude and frequency product (F: 1.05, M: 1.15) and smaller ankle joint range of motion (F: 64 °, M: 57 °). In both groups, relationships between velocity and: maximal ankle joint extension, distance covered during one cycle and backward toes shift during downward movement were found. The results were statistically significant ( p < 0.05).Girls and boys differed in kinematic indicator level, but UUS velocity depends on identical kinematic variables, meaning UUS technical training can be performed without gender-division.",

Methods: Sixty male and female adult volunteers (aged 20–40) were recruited into the study. They were equally divided into 30 normal subjects (BMI = 18.5–22.9 kg/cm 2 ) into group I and 30 obese subjects (BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/cm 2 ) into group II, according to their BMI. Results: There were statistically significant differences between normal and obese subjects in foot length, width, and pressure distribution in the hindfoot, midfoot, forefoot, and toes. There was a statistically significant increase in the plantar pressure of all measured areas in obese persons in comparison with the normal subjects. In addition, all measures of foot pressure showed statistically significant differences between the same sex of both groups, while the obese subjects of both genders have higher foot pressure in all measured areas. High positive correlations were detected between BMI, peak pressure, foot contact, and foot width in both groups, but there was a weak positive correlation between normal BMI and foot contact area. Conclusion: The distribution of plantar foot pressure is different in adult obese subjects than in normal adult subjects during walking activity. The obese persons have larger foot length, width, higher peak pressure, and contact area. This study can help physical therapists to understand the differences of foot pressure between normal and obese subjects, and consequently, to detect any expected foot abnormalities accompanied by obesity.",

As a result, there are efforts made to develop a methodology for selecting fins that meet the proposed criteria. In the present study, an analysis on the two types of fins most popular within the commercial market was conducted. The experiment took place in a test water tunnel fully equipped with a measuring system and strain gauges for recording forced interaction between the moving fin and flowing water. The tested fins rested on an artificial leg, which moved respectively, thereby developing movement algorithms. This forced fluid flow was implemented by a pump that was able to control the fluids velocity, and a non-invasive method involving an ultrasonic flow meter was used to measure the fluids velocity. Finally, the fin efficiency was calculated as the ratio of multiplication of generated thrust to electrical energy consumption whilst also considering the mechanical efficiency of the leg manipulator. The results of these experiments are discussed in depth and a method is created for the subsequent stage in which a new type of fins called biomimetic is to be analyzed and compared.",

With the development of smart wearable devices, smart wearable devices can provide real-time center of pressure position-assisted balance control, which is beneficial to maintain physical balance. Methods: Forty healthy college students (20 male, 20 female) participated in this study, and the posture balance actions of left-leg stance non-visual feedback, left-leg stance visual feedback, right-leg stance non-visual feedback, and right-leg stance visual feedback were performed. Visual feedback provided smart insoles matching Podoon APP on a tablet computer with the COP position displayed by a dot as real-time visual feedback. Results: The experimental results show that the displacement, velocity, radius, and area of the COP decreased significantly in the left-leg stance visual feedback/right-leg stance visual feedback, the test compared the parameters in the left-leg stance non-visual feedback/right-leg stance nonvisual feedback (P &lt; 0.05). Providing visual feedback through intelligent insoles can reduce the movement of the center of mass and maintain physical stability for healthy young people of different genders. In the one leg visual/non-visual in standing, the COP maximum anteroposterior displacement, COP anteroposterior velocity, COP radius, and COP area in women are significantly smaller than in men (P &lt; 0.05). Women have better real-time balance control ability than men with smart insoles. Conclusions: The simple intelligent wearable assisted devices can immediately increase the control ability in static stance of men and women, and women have better real-time balance control ability than men.",

Methods: In this study, a bubble-fluid-solid coupling system was established through combination of finite element method. The stress, strain and permeability of the vessel wall were theoretically simulated for different ultrasound frequencies, vessel radius and vessel thickness. Results: the bubble oscillation induces the vessel wall dilation and invagination under a pressure of 0.1 MPa. The stress distribution over the microvessel wall was heterogeneous and the maximum value of the midpoint on the inner vessel wall could reach 0.7 MPa as a frequency ranges from 1 to 3 MHz, and a vessel radius and an initial microbubble radius fall within the range of 3.5–13 μm and 1–4 μm, respectively. With the same conditions, the maximum shear stress was equal to 1.2 kPa and occurred at a distance of ±5 μm from the midpoint of 10 μm and the maximum value of permeability was 3.033 × 10 –13 . Conclusions: Results of the study revealed a strong dependence of biomechanical effects on the excitation frequency, initial bubble radius, and vessel radius. Numerical simulations could provide insight into understanding the mechanism behind bubble-vessel interactions by UDM, which may explore the potential for further improvements to medical applications.",

Methods: Forty-seven female subjects underwent a 20-minute virtual reality session. The mean age of the subjects was 70.12 years. As an immersive source, we used a relaxing virtual reality game with a head-mounted display device. The postural stability test was conducted using a Nintendo Wii force plate. Participants completed a set of three 30-s trials in which they took a quiet bipedal eyes-open stance while standing on a hard surface: before the virtual reality session, immediately after the virtual reality session, and 2 minutes after the virtual reality session. Centre of pressure parameters were analysed in the sagittal and frontal planes. Results: Analysing the results obtained immediately after the virtual reality session, significant differences were observed in almost all examined parameters. In the sagittal plane, centre of pressure path velocity increased by 10% (p &lt; 0.01) and path standard deviation by 15% (p &lt; 0.05). In the frontal plane, centre of pressure path velocity increased by 14% (p &lt; 0.01). After 2 minutes, all examined parameters showed no significant difference compared to before the virtual reality session. Conclusions: Immediately after the virtual reality session, there was an increase in almost all examined parameters. However, after 2 minutes, all examined parameters had returned to baseline. Therefore, to reduce fall risk after a virtual reality session, it is recommended that the subject spend at least 2 minutes in a sitting position.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The friction characteristics at the interface between prosthetic socket and liner have an important influence on the walking function and wearing comfort of amputees. The frictional behavior at the prosthetic socket/liner interface can provide theoretical guidance for the design and selection of prosthetic materials. So it is of great significance to study the friction behavior at prosthetic socket/liner interface. Methods: The surface roughnesses of the prosthetic socket and liner materials were measured by a laser confocal microscope. The frictional behavior at the prosthetic socket/liner interface was studied on a UMT TriboLab Tribometer by simulating the reciprocating sliding contact mode. An infrared camera was used to take thermal images and then calculated the temperature increase at the socket/liner interface. Results: The coefficient of friction of the silicon rubber fabric are significantly smaller than that of the foam liner materials. The frictional energy dissipation at the liner/acrylic socket interface is the smallest, while it is greater for 3D-printed socket materials. Meanwhile, the temperature increase has a positive correlation to the coefficient of friction and frictional energy dissipation. Conclusions: The three kinds of 3D-printed materials with high surface roughness have higher interface coefficient of friction and energy dissipation than acrylic material. The stiffness and energy consumption play an important role in the interface friction characteristics of the prosthetic liner materials. The appropriate coefficient of friction at the surface between prosthetic socket and liner is essential. A type of the reinforcement fiber has influence on the friction behavior of the 3D-printed reinforced nylon.",

Heat transfer in the skin tissue was assumed to be transient and one-dimensional. Thermophysical parameters of successive skin layers are different, at the same time in subdomains of dermis and subcutaneous region the internal heating resulting from blood perfusion and metabolism is taken into account. The degree of the skin burn can be predicted on the basis of the so-called Henriques integrals. The paper deals with the sensitivity analysis of these integrals with respect to the thermophysical parameters. In numerical computations, the boundary element method has been used. In the final part of the paper, the results of computations are presented. The skin is treated as a multi-layer domain in which one can distinguish the epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous region, with blood perfusion and metabolic heat source in the latter two regions. The skin surface is subjected to an external heat flux which is a function of time. Heat transfer in the skin tissue is assumed to be transient and one-dimensional. In the paper, the mathematical model and also the numerical algorithm based on the boundary-element method are presented. This model allows us to predict the skin temperature and time that passes till the appearance of the symptoms of the first-, second- and third-degree burns due to external heat flux effect. Because thermophysical parameters of the skin vary widely from person to person, the analysis of the sensitivity of temperature field and burn predictions to these variations is also carried out.

Thirty male cross-country skiers were sagittaly filmed on an uphill portion of the 1.2-km classic race of the world cup (2004) using a digital camera. The main body joints, skis and poles were digitised frame by frame. Results indicated higher SV and SR for similar SL compared to longer distance races with a similar slope. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between SV and SR but not between SV and SL contrary to the other distance races. SL results showed that in spite of the high SR, skiers maintained an effective leg and pole thrusts. The high SR in KO sprint presented a mechanical advantage by minimising the decrease of velocity during the cycle. The importance of SR in the velocity production could be useful for practitioners to optimise the training program for this type of race. It seemed notable that the skiers had to improve temporal factors while conserving a long SL.",

Methods: Thirty-nine breast cancer survivors were divided into two groups: a study group (n = 19) that performed Nordic walking, and a control group (n = 20) that performed a standard general exercise programme. Body posture was assessed using Moiré photogrammetry and trunk muscle (flexors and extensors) endurance at 120°/s was measured isokinetically. Statistical analyses were based on two-way ANOVA with Scheffe post hoc tests and Pearson’s r correlation tests. Results: Women who completed the 8-week Nordic walking intervention showed significant improvements in average power and total work, irrespective of the muscle group investigated. Following training intervention, greater strength-velocity values of the trunk muscles were observed in the study group, compared to the control group. There were no significant changes in postural parameters or correlations for trunk muscle function within spinal curvatures before and after the training interventions. When both groups were combined (Nordic walking + general exercises), functional-postural correlations following the intervention showed a statistically significant tendency toward a reduced inclination of the upper thoracic section, together with increases in all tested functional parameters of the trunk flexor and extensor muscles (r = –0.33 to r = –0.37). Conclusions: Compared to a standard general exercise programme, Nordic walking is more effective for improving isokinetic trunk muscle endurance in women after breast cancer. However, no changes in sagittal spinal curvatures were observed after the 8-week Nordic walking and general exercise interventions.",

Hypothesis: The H/Q ratio is a diagnostic tool for monitoring of the effectiveness of the 6- month PH after ACLR. Methods: Twenty males 6 months after ACLR (ACLR group) and 20 male controls underwent IT and PT (60°/s and 180°/s) bilateral measurements of H and Q muscles. The IT and PT were normalized to body mass, and expressed as relative IT (RIT) and relative PT (RPT). The RIT and RPT H/Q ratios, and Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) were calculated. Results: In the ACLR group, the RIT for the H and Q, the RIT for the H/Q ratio and most of the RPT, as well as the H/Q ratio, ROM and LSI values of the operated knee, were not significantly different (NSD) than those of the non-operated side (NOS) or the control group. The between-group comparison of the H/Q ratio for RIT and RPT weren’t NSD. The isokinetic test at 180°/s showed lower RPT, H/Q ratio and LSI values for the Q muscle than those of the NOS (p = 0.042, p = 0.001). Conclusions: The H/Q ratio, in combination with the RIT, RPT and LSI, is a useful diagnostic tool for monitoring the effectiveness of 6-month PH after ACLR. Restoring the correct H/Q ratio can reduce the risk factor for ACL graft rupture.",

Further examination included the influence of all gathered anaerobic strength indices on the results of 100-m front crawl race. Methods: The study involved 26 male swimmers (age: 19.8 ± 2.48 years). Fat-free mass, total body water and muscle mass of arms, legs, and trunk were measured. Dry-land average work, maximal power generated in 40-second arm-cranking test, and work generated in 20 countermovement jumps were evaluated. The forces generated separately by arms and legs were assessed during 40-second tethered swimming. All indices of body composition were found strongly correlated with indices of average work and maximal power generated by arms and legs in dryland tests. Results: Muscle mass of arms and trunk moderately and strongly (r = 0.44–0.64) influenced the force generated by arms in tethered swimming. There was no significance in the relationship of leg muscle mass and force generated by legs in tethered swimming. Significant relationships were observed between the results of the 100-m front crawl and the muscle mass of the arms, trunk, legs, as well as the average work and maximal power in the arm-cranking test (r: 0.39–0.54). The average impulse of arm force and maximal leg force in tethered swimming moderately and significantly correlated with 100-m swimming results. Conclusions: The study concludes the relevance of developing muscle mass balanced to the body size, which is involved in propulsion force production in sprint front crawl swimming.",

The aim of this study was to examine CoP regularity in both yoga instructors and novices during the performance of four yoga poses, and to verify the sensitivity of linear and nonlinear methods for assessing postural stability. Methods: The dynamic characteristics of CoP fluctuations were examined using linear and nonlinear methods on a group of 22 yoga instructors (Y) and 18 age-matched non-practitioners of yoga (NY). The study involved maintaining a balance for 20 seconds while performing four yoga poses. Results: Conventional analysis of CoP trajectories showed that NY and Y exhibited similar control of postural sway, as indicated by similar CoP path-length and area values observed in both groups. These results suggest that the special balance yoga training received by Y may not have an impact on less challenging balance conditions, such as the poses used in this experiment. Interestingly, nonlinear dynamical analysis of CoP showed that Y exhibited less CoP regularity and more complex signal than NY, as evidenced by higher values of sample entropy and fractal dimension. Conclusions: The results shed light on the surplus values of CoP trajectories in the nonlinear dynamical analysis to gain further insight into the mechanisms involved in posture control.",

Methods: Skilled dancers (n = 16) performed single-turn pirouettes in jazz and classic styles. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected using the Vicon system and Kistler plates. The joint reaction forces and muscle forces were calculated using a musculoskeletal model in the AnyBody Modeling System. Results: No statistically significant differences were found for the duration of the turn in both pirouettes. The range of motion in all joints of supporting leg in sagittal plane and in hip joint in frontal plane for non-supporting leg were significantly higher in classic pirouette. The ankle joint was the most loaded joint in both pirouettes and its maximal value was significantly higher in classic pirouette. The force generated by ankle plantar flexors muscles was significantly greater in the jazz pirouette in turn phase. For the nonsupport limb, external hip rotators generated significantly greater force when performing the classic pirouette. Conclusions: It seems that early stage dancers may start their lessons with jazz pirouettes, where necessary joint mobility is lesser. They also are supposed to increase muscle strength and body awareness with such proceedings. A better awareness of the mechanical loads on the musculoskeletal system which a dancer performing pirouettes faces should have an impact on the way dance classes are conducted and choreographic elements are sequenced.",

Dynamometer and limb order were randomized among participants while peak moment of each set was used for data analysis.The Isokinetic Knee Dynamometer had excellent relative reliability, comparable to the System 4, and both systems displayed acceptable absolute reliability. Proportional biases were observed favoring the System 4 during knee extension of both limbs at 60 °/s and the dominant limb at 180 °/s, and fixed biases favoring the Isokinetic Knee Dynamometer in seven conditions. Relative agreement between systems was good across all test conditions with the majority demonstrating excellent agreement.These data support the Isokinetic Knee Dynamometer as a reliable and valid knee isokinetic testing system. Due to its reduced system complexity, space requirements, and production cost, the Isokinetic Knee Dynamometer may increase the clinical utilization of isokinetic knee assessments. Finally, these data fill an existing isokinetics literature void with the results supporting similar and acceptable measurement properties jointly for dominant and non-dominant limbs and at the higher testing velocities considered.",

The main aim of this study was to assess muscle fatigue during the Biering–Sorensen Test in people with chronic low back pain who underwent the McKenzie treatment. Methods: Tests were conducted on 19 men (mean age of 41.4 years) with chronic non-specific lumbar-sacral pain syndrome, working in the seated position in front of a computer. Assessment of changes in fatigue of erector spinae, gluteus maximus and biceps femoris using surface electromyography during the Biering–Sorensen Test and subjective pain assessment using Visual Analog Scale were conducted on three test dates. Time-frequency representation of the electromyographic signal (Fourier transform) was used for the examination of muscle fatigue. The McKenzie method of diagnosis and therapy was applied before and between the tests. Results: The McKenzie therapy resulted in increased endurance (test duration) of the examined spinal muscles between the 1st and 3rd test date (p = 0.043), and a systematic decrease in pain assessment on the three test dates (p = 0.000–0.004). Correlations were obtained between slope coefficients of the simple regression of median frequency of electromyographic signals on the one hand and duration of the BST (p = 0.000–0.012) and anthropometric parameters (body mass, height and body mass index, p = 0.001–0.020) on the other.

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study examined the use of nonlinear measures – sample entropy (SampEn), fractal dimension (FD), and the Lyapunov exponent (LyE) – to evaluate postural control in adults during standing on an unstable surface, with and without visual feedback. Methods: 14 healthy young adults (24.07 ± 7.32 years) completed bipedal standing trials on an unstable-plate Biodex Balance System (BBS) connected to a Vicon system, with eyes open and closed. Each trial lasted 20 sec. Analysis was performed based on the center of mass (CoM), for which the three nonlinear measures were calculated. Results: Excluding visual feedback was found to cause a significant increase in linear and nonlinear parameters. Moreover, SampEn and FD values were found to be significantly higher in the PD direction, compared to AP or ML, whereas LyE values in this direction were minimal. Conclusions: Results show that the three nonlinear measures provide a useful way of evaluating postural control in healthy adults. Moreover, it seems that introducing an unstable surface meant that the projection of the CoM was not perpendicular to the surface, but rather set at a certain continually changing angle, forcing the whole system to adapt to chaotic and unpredictable conditions. Such refined changes in conditions can be evaluated in a precise way only by using nonlinear measures.",

Methods: 83 healthy people (56 females, 27 males, age years 21 SD = 1.3 years) participated in the research. Measurements were performed with open and closed eyes and in the virtual environment with two sceneries oscillating at four frequencies. The results determined in the time and frequency domains were analyzed in relation to the results calculated with the use of stock exchange indicators for which the Trend Change Index was formulated. Performed measurements made it possible to determine the average COP speed, the average COP speed and range of movement towards AP, power spectral density PSD and stock exchange indices. Results: In the case of PSD values for the ranges above and below 0.5 Hz, statistically significant differences occurred for most measurements. Obtained values of TCI coefficient were similar and no statistically significant differences were observed. The maximum values of the PSD medians were obtained in trials with the oscillating scenery. Conclusions: Conducted analyzes showed that use of stock exchange indicators broadens the interpretative possibilities of COP measurements by determining the number of consecutive skips (changes in the direction) of the COP and prioritizing according to the times between them. The applied stock market analysis methods also filtered out changes in the position resulting from noises that could not be removed with the use of standard low-pass filters.",

In the next steps, the selected limb positions will be used to determine the maximum values of isometric forces of the individual muscle heads based on the Hill model. Methods In order to determine the sought muscle activation, an electromyograph was used. Measurements of the isometric contraction were carried out for seven series of tests. Isometric contraction was performed as 100% MVC. Results For the long head of the biceps muscle, in the case of bending in the shoulder joint, selected angle of 75 degrees, and for abduction in the shoulder joint, the angle of 90 degrees. Internal rotation in the shoulder joint was omitted because of lower activation values. For the short head of the biceps muscle, the angle characterized by the greatest activity of the head, is the angle of 115 degrees in flexion at the elbow joint. The selected angle is 30 degrees for shoulder extension and 110 degrees for shoulder adduction. For the lateral head of the triceps brachial muscle, measurements showed that the angle at which the lateral head is most activated is 115 degrees. Conclusions The presented research and results concern one specific person for whom a personalized numerical model will be developed. The performed tests can also be a preliminary assessment of the upper limb positions, for which wider conclusions could be drawn in the case of measurements on a larger number of participants.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the performed tests and static measurements was to determine the torque and to determine the activity curve for individual muscle heads during the flexion-extension movement in the elbow joint.Both heads of the biceps branchial muscle and the triceps muscle of the arm - long head and lateral head - were examined. Static measurements were carried out for four selected positions of the upper limb. For each pose, a measurement series consisting of five attempts of ten seconds of effort was performed. Isometric contraction was performed as 100% of the maximum voluntary MVC contraction. Dynamic measurements were carried out when working in isokinetic conditions. In both stages, an EMG and a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer were used.During the analyses, it was assumed that the average value of the torque is equal to the approximate value of the torque of a given head under static conditions. The value of the torque of the biceps brachial muscle, long head was 48.04 Nm and for the short head - 45.82 Nm. For the triceps muscle of the long head, this value was 52.52 Nm and for the lateral head - 38.06 Nm. On the basis of dynamic measurements, four activation curves were determined for each of the heads during the 7-second task. For the curves, the sum value of muscle activity in a given period of time was calculated as the area under the curve.Both parts of the series of articles present a series of experimental studies conducted in order to determine the parameters for one patient, for whom a personalized numerical model of the upper limb was ultimately created. Static measurements were carried out to determine the maximum values of the moments of forces. Dynamic measurements allowed for the determination of activity curves during the movement of the upper limb.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Physical activity (PA) is a well-known, simple and effective preventive and therapeutic intervention for low back pain (LBP). In spite of the growing interest in active lifestyles and its benefits, more needs to be known about the relationship between energy expenditure, body mass and lumbar-pelvic kinematics during the forward bending movement in a group of young asymptomatic people who met PA guidelines. Young people can be identified as a future risk group of civilisation diseases and lumbar-hip kinematics can be considered as a predictor of LBP occurrence. The aim of this study was to identify the association of sex, self-reported energy expenditure, body mass index, and lumbar-hip kinematics in young people. Methods Sixty-four students at pre-employment stage participated in the study. They declared moderate-to-high PA and activity-induced energy expenditure (AEE) was self-reported. Kinematic data of the lumbar spine, pelvis, and hip were collected during forward bending using a 3D motion capture system. Results Sex was found to be associated with pelvis (β=-0.38 p=0.002) and lumbar mobility (β=0.49, p&lt;0.001) during forward bending and BMI was related only to lumbar mobility (β=-0.41, p=0.001). Recreation AEE significantly predicted hip flexion mobility (β =0.38, p=0.002). Conclusions This study showed that among a sample of physically active young people, BMI, self-reported AEE, and sex can partially predict lumbar-hip kinematics during trunk flexion. Recreational PA can be regarded as improving hip mobility and thus making forward bending more effective and less prone to injury.",

Methods The cylinder-shaped samples were prepared in a special form of a pellet, 2 mm thick and 5 mm in diameter. Specimens were cured with a use of the Bluephase Style 20i lamp (IvoclarVivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). Afterwards, they were immersed in the studied solutions.

Microhardness measurements were carried out using microhardness tester CSM MicroCombi Tester™ and Indentation 5.21 software. Scanning electron micro-scope (SEM) were created on an FEI Nova NanoSEM 230 microscope (Hills-boro, OR, USA). The magnification was set to 2500x. Results Based on the results, both materials showed similar mechanical properties (microhardness), however cumulated release of F- after 7 days was notably higher from Vitremer in all artificial saliva solutions (1-7). Conclusions Therefore, we can assume that Vitremer has better remineralization potential and it may constitute more effective method of tooth decay prevention.",

Methods Measurements were made during passive motion on five different surfaces often found in public spaces. Two tests were carried out during the measurements. In the first test, the sensor was located directly on the surface of the wheelchair seat. In the second test, a polyurethane cushion was placed on the seat, on which the measuring sensor was then placed. Results The study showed that regardless of the surface on which the wheelchair user moves, the threshold defined in the ISO standard for frequencies in the range from 4 to 40 Hz is exceeded. However, thanks to the use of polyurethane cushions, vibration damping is visible for frequencies ranging from 10 to 40 Hz. The impact of the user’s weight on the magnitude of the perceived vibrations was also observed. Conclusions Studies show that wheelchair users are exposed to whole body vibration that can negatively affect their health. Cushions made of polyurethane seems to be a promising solution to reduce whole body vibration in the frequency range that is burdensome and harmful to human health.",

    "abstract": "This treatise deals with sagittal in vivo motions of the human mandible. The concept of a “movable hinge axis”, which is commonly used in dentistry, was scrutinised theoretically and empirically. We wondered whether a “movable hinge axis”‐ or better a mandibularly fixed hinge axis (MFHA) ‐ was actually used by subjects with sound temporomandibular joints. To answer this question we first showed that the assumptions of a MFHA would comprise that of the neuromuscular apparatus of the stomatognathic system piloting the mandible by solely two kinematical degrees of freedom (DOF). We spatially recorded in vivo motions of mandibles with high-precision ultrasonic devices. The subjects were asked to guide their mandibles in sagittal movements so that the lower incisal edges ran along the Posselt diagrams. The mathematical procedure is described in detail, hence a possible use of two DOF by a subject could quickly be puzzled out from a set of motions. These analyses revealed that the quasi-plane mandibular movements were approximately piloted by two kinematical DOF in subjects with sound temporomandibular joints. The grade of approximation was measured. Thus, the ensemble of possible positions of the moved body (mandible) can be described by a coordinate system, which is inherent in the stomatognathic system. Lacking precision and poor reproducibility in using only two variables for mandibular position control yield hints that the subject has clinical problems in his stomatognathic system.",

The study covered 58 subjects aged between 24 and 85, who were treated for impingement syndrome in the years 2004-2006. The average duration of the disease was 40 months. The following muscles were tested for bioelectric activity using surface myography: deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, latissimus dorsi, greater pectoral and biceps brachii on the healthy and the diseased sides. A significant drop in activity of the deltoid and the infraspinatus muscles on the diseased side was observed. The following muscles showed comparable activity on both sides: the supraspinatus, latissimus dorsi and the greater pectoral muscle. The activity of the biceps brachii muscles grew during resisted movements. The drop in the activity of the deltoid and the infraspinatus muscles on the affected side is an important factor responsible for changes of the active mobility of the shoulder and for the development of instability of the shoulder joint. A similar activity of the latissimus dorsi, greater pectoral and biceps brachii muscles on both sides indicates a development of the compensatory mechanisms and the role of those muscles in the dynamic stabilisation of the shoulder joint.",

Results: Significant improvement in respiratory reserve was observed in the intervention group compared to control group through prolonged EMG onset of accessory breathing muscles. Moreover, increase of MVV, chest expansion and decrease in pain intensity were observed. Conclusions: This research suggests that breathing patterns and chest expansion should be considered within the physical assessment of breathing retraining, and that chest wall mobilization offers clinically important improvements in patients with chronic neck pain.",

Methods: The study was conducted on 130 school children aged 8–10: girls (n = 68, body mass = 22.8 ± 6.0 kg, body height = 129.3 ± 7.5 cm) and boys (n = 62, body mass = 31.1 ± 6.5 kg, body height 134.4 ± 7.3 cm). The study involved 2 trials. At first, children stood on the platform assuming a natural position. Then, they put on a 5-kg backpack and stood on the platform once more. Results: The results indicate that after backpack loading, for the total research group of girls and boys, statistically significant differences were found in the distribution of foot force on the ground in the left forefoot (p = 0.008), metatarsus (p = 0.000) and heel areas (p = 0.002). While in the right foot, these differences were noted for the forefoot (p = 0.024) and metatarsus (p = 0.000). The results of balance testing were also statistically significant. They concerned measurements of the body barycentre area (cop-bars p = 0.003), the barycentre area of the left foot (l-bars p = 0.034) and the parameter comparing distance to surface ratio (cop-lsf p = 0.000). Conclusions: It may be concluded that prolonged overloading with backpacks affects movement patterns, which may further lead to the acquisition and consolidation of postural defects.",

The impact of exercise on bone treated with diclofenac (DF) has reminded elusive. In the present study, we assayed the combined impact of exercises and DF on mouse femur. Methods: The femur samples we obtained from 30 days treated C57BL/6J female mice. The training group ran on a horizontal treadmill at 12 m/min by 30 min a day (5% grade/slope). The group of ten mice treated with DF received the drug subcutaneously every day (5 mg/kg of body weight/day). The combined group ran on the treadmill and obtained DF. After 30 days, we sacrificed mice and studied their femurs using microcomputed tomography (µCT), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and nanoindentation. Results: We observed that treadmill running and DF decreased trabecular bone volume and mineral density. Combined effect of training and DF was not additive. A significant interaction of both parameters suggested protective effect of training on bone loss provoked by DF. The femur cortical bone shell remained untouched by the training and treatment. The training and the DF treatment did not alter the storage modulus E' significantly. The unchanged storage modulus would be suggesting on the unaltered bone strength. Conclusions: We concluded that even relatively short time of training with concomitant DF treatment could be protective on trabecular bone. Although viscoelastic properties of the entire femur were not modulated, femur trabecular tissue was thinned by treatment with DF and protected by training.",

Methods: Firstly, a novel modeling approach of using hollow structures (HS) to simulate the mechanical properties of soft tissues under impact loading was proposed and evaluated. Then, an FE pedestrian model was developed, employing this modeling approach based on the Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS) pedestrian model, named as THUMS-HS model. Finally, the biofidelity of the THUMS-HS model was validated against cadaver test data at both segment and full-body level. Results: The results show that the proposed hollow structures can simulate the mechanical properties of soft tissues and the predictions of the THUMS-HS model show good agreement with the cadaver test data under impact loading. Simulations also prove that the THUMS-HS model has high computational efficiency and stability. Conclusions: The proposed modeling approach of using hollow structures to simulate the mechanical properties of soft tissues is plausible and the THUMS-HS model could be used as a valid, efficient and robust numerical tool for analysis of pedestrian safety in vehicle collisions.",

Many researchers propose objective methods, which have numerous limitations, by attaching markers or sensors to the child’s limbs. The purpose of this study is to attempt to develop objectified numerical indices to describe the limb movements of infants without interfering with spontaneous activity. Methods: 20-minute video recordings of three infants’ movements who were purposively selected from 51 subjects were included in the study. The procedure of automatic calculation of head position time in 3 positions was applied. Movement features were determined to allow for the delineation of coefficients describing the movement in numerical values. Results: Presented parameters describe three infant’s movement aspects: quality (strength), distribution of postural tonus and asymmetry in relation to head position, described as four independent values. Estimated parameters variability over time was weighted up according to expert observations. The presented method is a direct reflection of infants' observation, currently performed by highly educated and experienced therapists. Conclusions: The interpretability and usefulness of the presented parameters were proved. All parameters estimation is fully automated. The conducted research is a prelude to future work related to creating an objective and repeatable tool, initially monitoring and ultimately supporting early diagnosis for differentiating normal and abnormal motor development.",

Also, the method of determining the ground reaction forces' distribution during the biped robot's dynamic stable walk is described. The method was developed by the authors. Following the description of equations characterizing the dynamics of robot's motion, the values of the components of ground reaction forces were symbolically determined as well as the coordinates of the points of robot's feet contact with the ground. The theoretical considerations have been supported by computer simulation and animation of the robot's motion.

    "abstract": "Purpose This study aimed to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics and trajectory behavior of badminton shuttlecocks, focusing on the effects of design factors such as porosity, flexibility, and feather geometry on flight performance. The main research question was how shuttlecock design influences aerodynamic forces and resulting trajectories. Methods Wind tunnel tests were conducted on two feather and two synthetic shuttlecocks to measure drag, lift, and pitching forces across speeds of 10-50 m/s and angles of 0°-20°. Empirical correlations for drag and lift coefficients were derived via regression analysis. The effects of gaps and rotation were evaluated by modifying shuttlecocks. Trajectories were simulated by numerically integrating the equations of motion using the empirical force correlations and validated against high-speed video of players hitting shuttlecocks. Results Premium shuttlecocks displayed lower drag and higher lift than budget models. Feather shuttlecocks maintained higher rotation rates at high speeds compared to synthetic ones. Sealing gaps reduced drag by up to 10% for 75% sealed gaps. Stiffening synthetic skirts improved performance closer to feather shuttlecocks. Simulations matched experimental trajectories within 5% deviation for key metrics across different shots and shuttlecock types. Conclusions Shuttlecock design significantly impacts aerodynamic forces and flight trajectories. Factors such as porosity, skirt flexibility, and feather shape play crucial roles in performance. The developed simulation methodology can aid players in optimizing shots and manufacturers in designing better shuttlecocks. This research enhances understanding of shuttlecock aerodynamics and provides a foundation for future equipment innovations in badminton.",

The study was carried out with a view to potential future utilization of its results for constructing retentive elements of implanted prostheses. Changes in the friction force were recorded while removing titanium specimens placed between two silicone counter specimens made of Ufi Gel. The influence of the titanium specimen movement speed in relation that of to the counter specimens and the influence of clamping force on the friction force were assessed. Additionally, the surface roughness of titanium specimens differed; in one case, titanium was coated with polyethylene. The effect of introducing artificial saliva between the cooperating surfaces on the friction force and friction coefficient was analyzed as well. Based on the characteristics recorded, the possibilities of shaping the friction coefficient have been assessed, since it is the friction coefficient that determines effective operation of a friction couple through increasing the titanium specimen roughness. The artificial saliva being introduced between the specimens reduces considerably the friction coefficient through a change of the phenomenon model. An increase in the pressure force for the specimens of high roughness entails a reduction of the friction coefficient. The study carried out allows us to identify the roughness parameters, which in turn will enable obtaining the prescribed retention force for friction/membrane couplings.",

Methods: 50 children with JIA were enrolled into the study. 35 healthy volunteers were enrolled into the study for a comparison. Spatiotemporal and kinematic gait parameters were obtained using a movement analysis system. The Gait Deviation Index (GDI) was calculated. The assessment was performed three times: on the day of admission to the rehabilitation center, after the end of a 4-week treatment period and 9 months later. Results: With regard to the majority of spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters, differences in their distribution were highly statistically significant between the study group and the control group (p &lt; 0.001). In two subsequent tests, differences were less significant when compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.01). In the study group, ranges of motion in the sagittal plane in the hip (p &lt; 0.01), knee (p &lt; 0.001) and ankle joints (p &lt; 0.01) increased significantly between tests 1 and 2, and 1 and 3.

The data were analyzed based on Student’s t-test, Mann–Whitney U-test and Pearson Chi-square test. Results: Statistically significant inter-gender differences were in the values of angles determining inclination of lumbosacral section of the spine (p &lt; 0.001), the lumbar lordosis curvature (p &lt; 0.001) as well as the compensation ratio (p = 0.002). Statistically significant dependences between the types body posture and gender (p = 0.005) were noted. Conclusions: Women practicing ballroom dancing are distinguished with increased inclination of lumbosacral section of the spine and deeper lumbar lordosis, while men are characterized with shallowed lumbar lordosis. Women are more likely to have lordotic body posture while men are characterized by balanced body posture. The prevalence of body posture subtypes is not dependent on gender.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The study aimed to determine which of the five classical ballet positions is the most demanding regarding muscular activity, values of external rotation in the hip joints, angular values of foot progression as well as the inclination (tilt) of the pelvis in the sagittal plane. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 14 female pre-professional ballet dancers (aged 11–16) participated. Participants were tasked with the sequential adoption of five classical ballet positions (CP1–CP5). The electromyographic activity of the muscles of the trunk and the lower limb was recorded with surface electrodes. Kinematic data including hip and knee external rotation, foot progression angle and pelvic tilt were collected using a motion capture system. Results: Symmetric positions CP1 and CP2 were not as demanding as asymmetric CP3–CP5. Higher values of hip and foot external rotation without greater muscular effort in CP2 than CP1 was noticed. Considering asymmetric positions, CP3 did not trigger a greater activity of hip or foot muscular groups than CP4 and CP5. CP4 was characterised by the greatest pelvic anterior tilt and the lowest activity of GM in the forward lower limb. In CP5, forward lower limb entailed a higher activity of muscles supporting the foot than in the remaining positions. Conclusion: In terms of biomechanics, the most demanding classical ballet position in pre-professional dancers is CP4, followed by CP5, CP3, CP1 and CP2. This finding can be applied in educational methodology of dancers, figure skaters, synchronized swimmers, acrobatic gymnasts, rhythmic gymnasts or cheerleaders.",

Methods: The article presents in detail a mathematical algorithm of a new comprehensive method of evaluating gait pathology. Input data for the algorithm are the kinematic parameters of gait. The method is based on the determination of the following parameters: standardized angular variables (W ji ), kinematic indicators of gait (KI j ), gait cycle indicators (GCI i ), Gait Kinematic Index (GKI), Gait Deviations Profile (GDP, GDP j ), Global Symmetry Index (GSI) and Symmetry Indices (SI j ) for kinematic gait values. The algorithm is based on the determination of the difference between results obtained in relation to the kinematics of movement of a given patient and the average value obtained in relation to the standard in each percentage of a gait cycle. The proposed method was tested using results obtained for 59 healthy persons and one patient with locomotor function disorder. Results: The GKI values for the reference group amounted to 0.89 ± 0.23. Information which can be obtained using the proposed gait assessment method was presented using an example of a patient with the disorder of locomotor functions. Areas of gait deviations, which were identified on the basis of the determined indicators, were presented in a graphic form using GDP. Conclusions: The new gait assessment method makes it possible to identify gait using a single numerical value, evaluate movements in individual joints and in subsequent moments as well as to assess the symmetry of gait.",

The use of so-called alloys, as a new generation of materials, enables us to find the golden mean in the arena widely known as implantology. The use of the surface layer, using the chosen Atomic Layer Deposition method, is to be the basis for minimizing the risk of an organism reactions. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to observe the impact of physicochemical properties of the surface layers (bactericidal) on the processes that occur on the implants surface made of titanium biomaterials used in bone structures. The study also attempted to evaluate the physicochemical properties of the ZnO coatings, deposited on the substrate of one of the new generation Ti13Nb13Zr alloys, using the ALD method. Included in the assessment of the physicochemical properties of the surface layers formed in this manner, we perform pitting corrosion resistance tests, scratch tests, tribological tests and surface wettability tests. Based on the obtained data, the differing physicochemical properties of the alloy with ZnO coatings are found to be dependent on the applied surface modification. For the conducted tests, differences are determined for the tests on the corrosion resistance, surface wettability and the abrasion resistance for samples with and without the ZnO coating. In addition, tests show that the coating applied to the alloy, which is previously subjected to the sand-blasted process, is characterized by improved adhesion.",

Methods: 11 healthy individuals were tested, two [A1] were identified as more susceptible to the introduced disturbance, and one reported having dizziness, car sickness and fear of heights. Measurements of center of pressure (COP) and head positions were performed in the real and in the virtual environment. The beginning of the simulation was either unexpected or preceded by a signal. The analysis included standard parameters determined in time domain as well as the amplitude of the first harmonic from the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Results: The analysis did not reveal statistically significant differences between results obtained: in real and virtual environments, with and without the warning signal. It was possible to notice the effect of virtual disturbance in the three selected individuals; this was particularly evident in the analysis of the first harmonic of the FFT. Conclusions: The conducted tests revealed that the limitation of the analyses exclusively to the time domain could be insufficient for a comprehensive interpretation. The effect of introduced disturbance was particularly noticeable in the analysis of the first harmonic for head movement. The application of this parameter could enable a more accurate investigation of a strategy aimed at maintaining balance.",

Methods: The study enrolled 51 healthy women aged 18–25. Balance assessment was carried out according to the M-CTSIB protocol and Single Leg Stance Test (with eyes open and closed) using the Biodex Balance System. An isokinetic evaluation conducted at 30 °/s and an isometric evaluation of the hip abductors were performed with the Humac Norm system. Results: Regression analysis for Sway Index (SW) and Stability Index (ST) in bipedal standing showed a significant importance of the presence of visual feedback (RSW EO = –0.922; p &lt; 0.0001; RST EO = –0.613; p = 0.0493), and unstable surface (RSW US = 1.253; p &lt; 0.0001; RSW US = 2.547; p &lt; 0.0001).

Conclusions: Physiological activation of the hip abductors may be important for physiological maintenance of postural balance in young people, in both leg standing as well as in single-leg stance.

Methods: Nineteen male swimmers took part in this study (age: 13.5 ± 0.44 years, height: 168.6 ± 7.77 cm, body mass: 56.9 ± 10.57 kg). Measurements of physiological parameters were conducted using expired air analyzer (Start 2000 MES, Poland) during step-test in water flume. Kinematic indices were computed while analyzing video recording of 400-m front crawl race. To check for possible influence of biological age (BA) diversity in studied group, partial correlation with age control was computed. Results: Swimming to exhaustion in water flume defined as speed at maximum oxygen uptake and anaerobic threshold (VO2 max V &amp; and VAT) occurred to be strongly positively correlated with 400-m race speed. Speed in surface swimming zones (Vsurface) was related to ability of kinematics adjustment and significantly correlated with stroke index (SI). Vsurface at the beginning and the end of the race, i.e., at 1st, 7th and 8th lap interplayed with stroke rate (SR) measured at corresponding laps. Conclusions: Our study showed that 400-m front crawl performance of young male swimmers is strongly dependent on swimming efficiency developed with aerobic conditioning. Significant role of proper pacing strategy was also identified, which indicates that race pace training should be implemented.",

All of them were recorded on camera while performing to music. All the trials of each couple were evaluated by 6 international adjudicators as to the technical quality component from the Absolute Judging System. A device for measuring triaxial rotational angular velocities was mounted on the dorsal part of the pelvic girdle and on the back of the chest of each athlete.

Methods The morphology of base plate of impact R test was developed using a vacuum powder sintering of commercial purity titanium powder (CP-Ti) on Ti6Al7Nb substrate. The finite volume method (FVM) and disperse particle method (DPM) were applied to develop the target model of a roughness impact R test. The morphology of modified surfaces was documented with digital microscope and SEM (scanning electron microscopy). Results The impact R test developed using the two phase blood model performed on regularly structured base plate resulted in shear stress values higher than the analogous for the model lacking such modification. The most significant reduction in maximum values of shear stress occurred in case of the DPM model and especially in the model with regular structures.

This study aimed to investigate the acute effect of short-duration SS exercises on dynamic balance following different recovery durations in youth female volleyball players. Methods: Thirteen volunteers U-14 female players were included. Eight random assessments were carried-out on separate days. They consisted of 2D-kinematic analysis of frontal and/or sagittal balance of the center of mass (COM) displacement, velocity, and acceleration on wobble board conducted without SS, immediately after and following 2 and 10 minutes of SS. Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant difference between conditions in the velocity (p = 0.002 to 0.049; d = 0.844 to 2.200) and the acceleration (p = 0.014 to 0.021; d = 1.532 to 1.657) of the COM in both frontal and sagittal planes sway. Post-hoc analysis revealed decreased COM velocity (p = 0.001 to 0.030; d = 2.501 to 6.750) and acceleration (p = 0.001 to 0.030; d = 2.501 to 6.750) in the frontal plane, regardless of the recovery time. The most prominent decrease in both parameters was observed immediately after SS (p = 0.001 to 0.013; d = 2.907 to 6.750). However, in the sagittal balance, we observed an immediate increase in COM acceleration following SS (p < 0.001; d = 4.223). Conclusion: Short-duration SS leads to improved dynamic balance, particularly on the frontal plane, with the most favorable effect observed immediately after stretching. Practically speaking, short-duration SS appears to be an effective exercise modality for inducing acute enhancements in dynamic balance among youth female volleyball players.",

Methods: Utilizing the phase field finite element method, the study analyzed three bone unit models with varying microarchitecture: one without lacunae, one with lacunae and one including perilacunar zones, to assess their effects on cortical bone's biomechanical properties. Results: The presence of lacunae was found to increase microcrack initiation risk, acting as nucleation points and accelerating microcrack propagation. Proximity to Haversian canals exacerbated stress concentration, speeding microdamage progression. Conversely, perilacunar zones mitigated both initiation and propagation. An elevated critical energy release rate correlated with slower crack growth and reduced damage severity. Conclusions: The research sheds light on the intricate mechanisms governing microcrack behavior in compact bone, highlighting the significant role of bone's microarchitectural features in its biomechanical response to microdamage. These insights are valuable for the development of strategies to prevent and treat bone-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to quantify the impact of smartphone use while sitting on the toilet on the spinal flexion angles and the time effect. Methods: Measurements of the spinal flexion angles in the sagittal plane were made by thirty participants while they sat on the toilet for 10 min, using a smartphone in either one, both, or neither hand. The individual's forehead, cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal areas were each fitted with five different inertial motion sensors. SPSS 26.0 software was used to statistically evaluate all of the data. Results: People who used smartphones with both hands had considerably larger (P < 0.05) cervical and spinal flexion angles than those who did not. A statistically significant (P < 0.001) association was observed by regression analysis between time and spinal flexion angle (r = 0.747 for no smartphone, r = 0.793 for a smartphone used in one hand and r = 0.855 for a smartphone used in both hands). Consequently, when using the smartphone with both hands, the flexion angle of the spine entered a more stable state of angles. Conclusions: The results showed that the cervical region's flexion angles change when using a smartphone while sitting on the toilet. Even when not using a smartphone, the flexion angle of the spine when sitting on the toilet will progressively increase.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial infections pose a serious threat to human health. For many years, there has been a search for materials that would inhibit their development. It was decided to take a closer look at various elastomeric materials with the addition of chitosan. Mixtures based on silicone, silicone with a platinum catalyst, acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, natural rubber, and ethylene-propylene-diene rubber were developed and tested for antibacterial and physico-mechanical properties. The dispersion of chitosan in the elastomer was also investigated using a scanning electron microscope. Of the tested mixtures, three were selected, characterised by the best antibacterial and physico-mechanical properties and a very good dispersion of chitosan in the matrix. The mixtures were based on silicone, silicone with a platinum catalyst and natural rubber. Tests were performed to measure the release of compounds into water for these mixtures. Furthermore, cytotoxicity with L929 cells and cytocompatibility in direct contact with MG63 cells were investigated for silicone samples. The results showed that these materials were not toxic to mammalian cells and supported their growth. The best bactericidal properties against E. coli and S. aureus strains compared to the other tested materials (>99.0-99.9% of killed bacteria) were shown by samples made of silicone and silicone with a platinum catalyst and added chitosan. At the same time, the best physico-mechanical properties were found for the samples with chitosan based on silicone with added platinum and natural rubber. Developed materials appeared to be good candidates for manufacturing medical equipment on which the adhesion and growth of bacteria should be prevented.",

This study focuses on the influence of material properties, specifically Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio, on the crystalline lens overshooting amplitude during rapid eye rotation. Methods The Finite Element Method (FEM) is employed to explore various material property scenarios, and sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess their impact on the mechanical displacement of the crystalline lens apex. The measurements were made of three output parameters: maximum displacement, time of maximum displacement appearance , and stabilization time. Results The results highlight the significance of fine-tuning of the zonule’s material properties, particularly Young’s modulus, in achieving a reliable model. They suggest that fine-tuning of these parameters can lead to a highly reliable model, enabling in-depth research in the opto-dynamic simulations. Conclusions Having a complete examination of crystalline lens displacement in ex vivo porcine eye models and detailing crucial factors for accurate modeling will open the path for future studies especially in conditions affected by dynamic aspects of the crystalline lens or in in vivo research.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Monitoring and assessing the level of lower limb motor skills using the Biodex System plays an important role in the training of football players and in post-traumatic rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to build and test an artificial intelligence-based model to assess the peak torque of the lower limb extensors and flexors. The model was based on real-world results in three groups: hearing (n = 19) and deaf football players (n = 28) and non-training deaf pupils (n = 46). Methods: The research used a 4-layer forward CNN neural network with two hidden layers with typical normalization for small data sets and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based on MatlabR2023a software with Neural Networks and Deep Learning toolkits and semiautomated learning algorithm selection using ML.NET. Results: The 70-90% accuracy shown in the article is sufficient here. AI provides a highly accurate, objective and efficient means of assessing neuromuscular performance, which can improve injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies. Conclusions: The high accuracy shows that AI-based models can help with this, but their wider practical implementation requires further cross-disciplinary research. AI, and in particular MLP and CNN can support both training methods and various gaming aspects. The contribution of the research is to use an innovative approach to derive computational rules/guidelines from an explicitly given dataset and then identify the relevant physiological torque of the lower limb extensors and flexors in the knee joint. The model complements existing methodologies for describing physiology of peak torque of lower limbs with using fuzzy logic, with a so-called dynamic norm built into the model.",

Methods: Two research models were developed. Model 1 - the one-sided lever system consists of a flat bar with, an axis of rotation, used to determine the weight and torque at a given point on it. Model 2 - the two-sided lever system consists of a flat bar imitating a tilted body counteracted by the Achilles tendon, and a platform imitating a foot. The centre of gravity was determined without considering \"the foot\". Results: When the centre of gravity of the human body tilts, the foot does not participate in the tilt of the rest of the body, because it tilts on the axis of rotation of the upper ankle joint, and not on the plantar side of the foot. The further the point of gravity is from the axis of rotation, the smaller the weight, but the moments of gravity are the same. The apparent weight loss when lifting it with one-sided support (getting up from a squatting position) is a real decrease in the gravitational moment and the lifting moment counteracting it. Conclusions: When analysing human biomechanics, focusing on real rotational force (not only the forces of muscle and gravity) is necessary (muscle moments balancing gravitational moments). The research may help develop effective rehabilitation methods, surgical procedures and sports training.",

Therefore, it is essential to explore the muscle synergy patterns in individuals with APTA. Methods: This study recorded sEMG data during stop-jump tasks in 8 APTA and 8 healthy amateur male basketball players in a simulated basketball game. Muscle synergies were extracted using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization and K-Means clustering. Results: Three synergies were identified in both groups. In Synergy 1, tibialis anterior, semitendinosus and vastus lateralis weights primarily influenced the waveform. In Synergy 2, biceps femoris, vastus lateralis and medial gastrocnemius weights primarily influenced the waveform. In Synergy 3, peroneus longus, vastus medialis and vastus lateralis weights primarily influenced the waveform. Key findings include higher vastus medialis weight in the APTA group during P1 and P2, and higher semitendinosus weight in P3 and P4. Additionally, the gastrocnemius and biceps femoris showed significant differences between groups across phases. Conclusions: The APTA group exhibited different muscle synergy patterns under specific phases and load accumulation conditions, particularly in the vastus medialis, medial gastrocnemius, biceps femoris and peroneus longus. The APTA group demonstrated distinct synergy patterns, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to reduce patellar tendon load, potentially increasing knee injury risk. This finding provides new guidance for clinical assessment and intervention strategies for the training and rehabilitation of APTA individuals.",

Methods The subjects of the study were oesophageal fragments of white Pekin ducks with a length of approximately 50 mm. Mechanical uniaxial tensile tests were carried out on fragments of the oesophagus and the effect of long-term tissue loading on the ability to permanently elongate was investigated. All measurements carried out were performed under laboratory conditions imitating the tissue environment. Results Force-elongation characteristics and stress-strain characteristics were determined from the experimental tests. The mean value of the ultimate tensile force in uniaxial tensile test was 45.32 ± 6.67 N. Mean ultimate tensile strain of 0.41 ± 0.02 and mean ultimate tensile stress of 2.04 ± 0.83 MPa were also determined. Tests carried out on the effect of a constant tensile force showed that the average value of permanent strain observed was 32.17 ± 2.26 %. Conclusions The conducted research allowed to characterise the biomechanics of white Pekin duck oesophageal tissue. The analyzed range of the elongation force provides satisfactory permanent tissue strain. Within the force range studied, no effect of the loading force value on the strain capacity of the oesophageal tissue was demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "A body when moving in a fluid is to withstand drag that is proportional to the drag coefficient, the frontal surface area, and the square of the body velocity relative to the fluid velocity (VOGEL [14]). The aim of our study was to determine the relationships between the drag coefficient (CD) and the Reynolds number (Re) for a high-level swimmer. In TAIAR et al. [12], three most propulsive butterfly positions have been defined: the end of the external sweep (beginning of the cycle), the end of the internal sweep (middle of the cycle), and the end of the thrust (end of the cycle). These three positions were reproduced using real-size mannequins articulated in realvelocity conditions. Experiments have been done in the large-scale hydraulic flume of the University of Nantes. Two types of the curves CD (Re) were obtained: for the “best swimmer” and for “other swimmers”. Following the swimming of the ex-word champion Pankratov during the World Championship in Rome (1994) the mannequin representing the “best swimmer” has been positioned similarly to the ex-world champion at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of cycle. The body positions of Pankratov have been obtained using the image analysis software Schleihauf4.0. In order to obtain the curves CD (Re) representing “other swimmers”, the body positions of lower-level swimmers have been used at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of swimming cycle. The two types of curves show well the gap between the techniques of the “best swimmer” and “other swimmers”. Our study shows the importance of the body position during the swimming cycle to minimizing the drug and to assuring better propulsion, i.e. better performance. The results show that the most effective swimmers optimise the body positions in order to reduce the frontal surface and therefore to minimize the drag.",

The aim of the study was to analyze the electromyographic activity of the gluteus medius muscle in patients with hip osteoarthritis and after arthroplasty in various static weight bearing conditions, both on the affected and contralateral side. Methods: The prospective study involved 70 patients qualified for hip replacement. Patients underwent a surface electromyography of the gluteus medius muscle which involved the Trendelenburg test. The normalized results were obtained for both hips, preoperatively and 6 months after arthroplasty. Results: The only muscle activity differences were found at a full load condition of lower limb. In the preoperative assessment, the activity of the gluteus medius muscle was greater on the side qualified for surgery. After arthroplasty and the rehabilitation period, the muscle activity on the operated side decreased and significantly increased on the contralateral side. Detailed analysis of the contralateral side revealed relationship with osteoarthritis. Previous hip arthroplasty of that side resulted in lower muscle activity, similar to fully functional joints. Conclusion: The activity characteristics of the gluteus medius muscle vary depending on the condition of the joint, and the characteristics change as a result of the surgical procedure performed on both the operated and contralateral sides. These dependencies should be taken into account in the rehabilitation process, especially at the side opposite to the operated one.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) is a biopolymer, but storing products from P3HB causes the deterioration of their properties leading to their brittleness. P3HB has also low thermal stability. Its melting point almost equals its degradation temperature. To obtain biodegradable and biocompatible materials characterized by higher thermal stability and better strength parameters than the unfilled P3HB, composites with the addition of polyurethanes were produced. Methods: The morphology, thermal, and mechanical property parameters of the biocomposites were examined using scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, standard differential scanning calorimetry, and typical strength machines. Results: Aliphatic polyurethanes, obtained by the reaction of 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate and polyethylene glycols, were used as modifiers. To check the influence of the glycol molar mass on the properties of the biocomposites, glycols with a molecular weight of 400 and 1000 g/mol were used. New biocomposites based on P3HB were produced with 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt. % content of polyurethane by direct mixing using a twin-screw extruder. The following property parameters of the prepared biocomposites were tested: degradation temperature, glass transition temperature, tensile strength, impact strength, and Brinell hardness. Conclusions: Improvement of the processing property parameters of P3HB-biocomposites with the addition of aliphatic polyurethanes was achieved by increasing the degradation temperature in relation to the degradation temperature of the unfilled P3HB by over 30 °C. The performance property parameters have also been improved by reducing the brittleness compared to the P3HB, as evidenced by the increase in impact strength and the decrease in hardness with an increase in the amount of polyurethane obtained by the reaction of 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate and polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 400 g/mol (PU400) as modifier.",

Nine months after the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and just before initiating the full training process, the maximal peak torque of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles were measured at 60 and 180 degrees/ second using isokinetic dynamometry. Obtained peak torques were used for calculating hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio, limb symmetry index, and to estimate maximal torque capacity using a two-velocity method (i.e., linear torque-velocity relationship modeled considering peak torque obtained at 60 and 180 degrees/second).No differences were found between hamstring-to- -quadriceps ratios of the injured and non-injured leg ( p = 0.165), nor between limb symmetry index of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles ( p = 0.985), regardless of the angular velocity applied during tests. The two-point method revealed significant differences between quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups both in the injured and non-injured leg ( p < 0.001; maximal estimated torque was higher for quadriceps compared to hamstring muscles), while the differences between same muscle groups of the different legs were not significant.Collectively, these findings indicate that 9 months were enough for reaching a certain strength level of the injured leg that permits a safe return to play.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The research aimed to assess the influence of vibration therapy on acceleration of muscles regeneration process after physical effort. Verification of the pace of motor capabilities recovery in fatigued muscles was performed with the use of the measurement method applying shear-wave elastography. It took into account an alteration in muscle stiffness affected by created passive stresses and accompanying deformations connected with muscles work above their resting length. Methods: The research included 42 young males aged 20–24. They all were a homogeneous group regarding body build indices (body height 175.4 ± 8.1 cm; body mass 75.5 ± 8.32 kg) and the level of physical activity. Muscles of lower limbs (hip and knee joints extensors and flexors plantaris) were subject to submaximal exercise of the auxotonic muscle work character after a 90 s warm-up. The exercise comprised 20-fold overcoming the load at the level of 75% of maximal strength abilities without rest, by alternating between extension and flexion of lower limbs joints at the leg press placed at 45° angle upward and monitoring of angle setting of lower limbs joints. The post-exercise restitution used a vibration stimulus of variable frequency ranging from 20 to 50 Hz and amplitude of 0.5 mm, and passive resting in the control group. For an objective assessment of the applied vibration effect, a 5-fold measurement of rectus femoris muscles stiffness of both limbs at the middle of venter took place after each stage of the experiment. Results: After warm-up, a considerable increase of the examined muscles stiffness, that did not vary significantly, was observed. In the DW experimental group (vibration massage), where post-exercise restitution was enhanced by vibration, significantly lower values of muscle stiffness were registered after each of the post-exercise regeneration stages in relation to the DB control group (passive rest). After the I regeneration stage, a value of the Δσ_r1-s variable (p &lt; 0.05) lower by 16% was noticed in favour of the group enhanced by vibration. Whereas, values of muscles stiffness after the II stage of regeneration, Δσ_r2-s were by 14% lower in favour of DW group (p &lt; 0.005). Conclusions: Enhancement of the post-exercise relaxation of muscles by vibration treatment significantly lowered the values of post-exercise muscles stiffness and turned out to be a more effective method of restitution than passive resting. Recovery of the level of muscles stiffness from before the exercise was much slower in the control group than in the one enhanced by vibration. The improved method of muscle stiffness measurement with the use of shear-wave elastography with a special head attachment turned out to be a useful tool to assess post-exercise muscles restitution.",

Therefore, the present study investigated the dura mater's mechanical and basic morphological properties to learn more about the biomechanical behaviour of this fibrous membrane.Tissue strips, oriented in the longitudinal and circumferential directions, were cut from the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae parts of the porcine spinal cord. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed using a device with a speed of 4 mm/min until rupture of the sample.It was demonstrated that the dura mater is a heterogeneous, anisotropic material. The longitudinal excised specimens showed the highest values of mechanical properties (ultimate force (FU), the stiffness coefficient (k), ultimate tensile strength (σUTS), and Young's modulus (E)) compared to those of the circumferentially. Confocal microscopy and sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay enabled us to visualise collagen and elastin elements more efficiently without a need for sample fixation.The spinal dura mater mechanical properties are not uniform along the entire length of the spinal cord, but, in the case of morphological features, no major differences were noticed. The utilisation of SRB occurred to be a non-destructive, fast, and efficient tool for visualising even the smallest elastic fibres on different depths of examined samples. The mechanical and morphological properties of the dura mater provided by this study can be further used in computational modelling to understand injury mechanisms better and help develop injury prevention strategies.",

The wires made of zinc with the addition of a small amount of magnesium (pure zinc, ZnMg 0.0026, ZnMg 0.0068, and ZnMg 0.08) have been investigated. The wires were produced using a technology based on extrusion and subsequent drawing. The resulting wires with a diameter of 0.8-1.0 mm are designed to be used in surgical operations related to bone joints. For cytotoxicity studies, we have selected human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSC) as the cell population representing normal osteoprogenitor cells. Considering that, after bone surgeries, the chance of osteosarcoma increases, we have compared the results obtained in hDPSC to those obtained with Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cell line. Cultured cells were exposed to the extracts obtained from the materials incubated in culture medium for 24 h with and without preincubation. Extracts of different ratios were examined. The results showed that the extracts obtained from wires made of ZnMg 0.0026 alloy exhibit high toxicity to Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells and low toxicity to hDPSC cells. This was in contrast to all reference materials, i.e., commercial surgical sutures made of steel and polymers, that did not display cytotoxicity toward osteosarcoma cells. Thus, the detected phenomenon for the ZnMg 0.0026 alloy can become the basis for creating biodegradable Zn-Mg surgical wires with antitumor activity.",

The ThermaCAM® P640 thermal imaging camera was used for measurement of drilling temperatures. After the holes were drilled, each rib was examined using the 1172 SkyScan microtomograph, Bruker®, to compare the geometry of the machined holes. The presented study proved that larger diameter drill bits (Hiossen® drill bits) generate more heat during the machining process, as evidenced by higher temperatures obtained for the Hiossen system in each case. It was proved that rotational speed, drill bit diameter and cooling system have a significant effect on the amount of heat generated during bone tissue preparation. The density and type of bone tissue in which the hole is prepared are significant factors affecting the amount of heat generated.",

A 45-degree osteotomy was made in a whole bone composite femoral shaft, this was internally fixed with either a conventional 4.5 mm AO/ASIF cortical lag screw or the differentially pitched cortical screw and the compressive force generated at the fracture site measured on an Instron 8874 Axial/Torsion Servohydraulic Testing System. The mean interfragmentary compression generated by the differentially pitched screw was 81.4% of that generated by the 4.5 mm AO/ASIF cortical lag screw. The 4.5 mm AO/ASIF cortical screw produces a steep rise in compression per turn of the screw. The screw based on the differential pitch design creates a more gradual increase to peak compression. The resistance to torque was greater for the AO screw than for the differential pitch screw. Maximal interfragmentary compression is achieved within 4 180 degrees turns after the head engages the near cortex for the 4.5 mm AO/ASIF screw but required 5 180 degrees turns for the differentially pitched screw. Interfragmentary compression is achievable in cortical bone using differential pitch technology. A differentially pitched screw offers obvious advantages over a conventional screw allowing independent placement of lag screw and neutralisation plate, without needing additional exposure of the fracture site, limiting the insult to local fracture biology. It is proposed as an adjunct to osteosynthesis in long bone fractures.",

The fatigue trial was based on modified Short-Term Fatigue Protocol. Static stabilography was performed with the use of HUR platform. Results Results showed an increase in the value of COP trace length after fatigue test in study population I. The level of COP trace length Z before fatigue was significantly lower than after fatigue. Subjects from study population I had higher levels of COP trace length Z in comparison with the control group. The main effect for the group also proved to be significant. Study population I had higher levels of COP trace length Z in comparison with the control group. For the measurement after fatigue there was significant difference only between the study population I and the control group. Conclusions 1. The incidence of structural ankle instability was not correlated with functional instability. Subjects with ankle instability, or “copers”, had good functional levels, enabling them to perform sports activities. 2. “Copers” had weakened proprioception in static stabilography tests.",

Whole-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were recorded, and the data of eleven non-rearfoot strikers were used for the analysis. Ankle and knee joint negative and positive work was calculated by integrating each joint's torque power. Friedman test was used for statistical comparisons. Results Minimalist shoes induced significantly greater ankle joint negative and positive work than in other shoes. Maximalist shoes induced significantly lower ankle joint positive work and greater knee joint negative work than in other shoes, and significantly greater knee joint positive work than in minimalist shoes. Conclusions Our results indicated that non-rearfoot strikers redistributed joint negative and positive work from the knee to the ankle when using minimalist shoes or from the ankle to the knee when using maximalist shoes. It is recommended that future research employs more rigorous study designs, such as randomised controlled trials and longitudinal studies, to provide a more accurate assessment of the effect of these shoes on injury rates.",

Exercise rehabilitation after stenting emerges as a promising and practical therapeutic strategy to improve the clinical performance of this therapy, although it remains controversial. The present study aims to explore the impact of exercise training on hemodynamic performance after vascular stent implantation. Methods Different 3-dimensional computational models based on the patient-specific carotids were constructed to calculate hemodynamic parameters, including flow velocity, time-averaged wall shear (TAWSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and relative residence time (RRT). Results The results demonstrated that exercise training increased TAWSS but decreased OSI and RRT in some cases after the intervention, and high-intensity exercise would further suppress the adverse blood flow. However, exercise training would remarkably reduce TAWSS and elevate OSI and RRT in patients with mild stenosis at upstream of stented segment. Additionally, we discovered that the hemodynamic environment change induced by exercise training was not significant compared to the stent position in some cases. Exercise would have a less beneficial impact on the disturbed blood flow after the distal common carotid artery (CCA) stenting. Conclusions These findings highlight that exercise-induced hemodynamic changes differ under different conditions. The exercise training for the intervention patients should only be performed after a comprehensive vascular function assessment.",

This study aimed to the effect of pedicle screw internal fixation on the mechanical characterization of lumbar multi-segmental vertebra under various loading conditions. Methods Porcine lumbar multi-segmental vertebral samples were tested with three pedicle screw fixation groups including rigid fixation, mixed fixation and dynamic fixation under four loading conditions of flexion, posterior extension, left-side bend, and right-side bend at bending moments of 3 N⋅m, 4 N⋅m, 5 N⋅m and 6 N⋅m, respectively. The stability and flexibility of the segmental motion were statistically analysed. Results The flexibility of joint activities increased using one-way dynamic pedicle screws with the range of motion for mixed fixation and dynamic fixation increased by 30% and 47% in left side bend and by 25% and 73% in right side bend, respectively. The range of motion for lumbar vertebra increased with higher moments. Conclusions The flexibility of joint activities was improved using one-way dynamic pedicle screws and the mixed fixation was considered moderate providing larger flexibility in right and left side bend without compromising stabilization. The results of this study are useful for providing theoretical reference for clinical selection of surgical plans.",

    "abstract": "The loads acting on the hip joint during daily activities contribute to the failure of the fixation of cemented hip stems. An in vitro analysis of newly designed prostheses is necessary prior to in vivo clinical trials. In vitro pre-clinical testing procedures up to now have consisted in simulating only one or two conditions. The goal of this work was to define a procedure to assess the long-term effect of the most stressing activities on the integrity of the cement mantle. Thus, a cyclic load of constant amplitude is not acceptable. All activities inducing high loads need to be included, so as to replicate the most critical scenario from a fatigue point of view. The following activities were included in the load history: stair climbing and descending, car entry and exit, bathtub entry and exit, and stumbling. Load values and direction were assigned to each activity, based on the literature. A typical week was defined for a patient, based on statistics from the literature. An in vitro simulation running for 2 weeks was able to replicate the load peaks occurring in 24 years of patient activity. Stem-cement elastic micromotion and permanent migration are continuously recorded at 5 locations. The cement mantle is inspected by means of dye penetrants after test completion to quantify the fatigue damage in the cement mantle. The load history was successfully applied to two different designs and is therefore ready for future applications to evaluate the long-term performance of the new prostheses and the effects of daily activities on implant outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Increased reaction time and asymmetrical force generation in muscles may elevate the risk of falling among seniors. Therefore, it seems useful to analyze the symmetry of strength and amplitude parameters that evaluate neuromuscular control. The aim of the study was to evaluate force parameters for the quadriceps and biceps femoris muscles in young and older women performing maximal voluntary contraction.Fifty women (1 group in their twenties and the other in their sixties) participated in the study. The study used surface electromyography methodology and measured peak torque under static conditions. Electromyographic signals and peak torque were recorded separately in knee extensors and flexors of the right and left lower limbs after a visual signal. The following parameters were selected for analysis: 1) maximum the electromyographic amplitude signal; 2) peak torque; 3) rate of torque development; 4) relative force; and 5) \"flexor-extensor\" ratio.The analysis demonstrated a decrease in the values of all parameters in the elderly group and symmetry in EMG amplitude in both the younger and older women. Asymmetry was found in the group of elderly women for peak torque and the relative force for knee flexors and \"flexor-extensor\" ratio.The decline in values of force parameters in knee flexors and their asymmetry (not extensors) revealed in the elderly group might prove an important factor in the assessment of risk factors for falling among the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Magnesium alloys are well known for their biocompatibility and biodegradable properties [9], [27] owing to the fact that magnesium is a mineral crucial for human body, especially for bone tissue. There are studies [17] on using WE43 additively manufactured magnesium scaffolds for full bone and soft tissue regeneration. Moreover, magnesium implants in bones were investigated as having higher bone-implant interface strength than titanium ones [3]. In this paper, the results of the studies on MAP21 magnesium powder selective laser melting process optimization as a starting point for further bioapplications are presented. MAP21 magnesium alloy owing to its high mechanical properties, excellent vibration damping characteristic and good creep resistance is a promising material to be tested for scaffold structures. The study for the first time shows successful SLM manufacturing of dense samples made of MAP21 alloy. Using an algorithm based on design of experiment (DoE) method [21], the SLM process parameters were designated. The porosity was investigated as a SLM process optimization parameter. High density of produced sample, up to 99%, was achieved. Microstructure and oxidation level after selective laser melting (SLM) manufacturing were characterized. Fine grain microstructure and three kinds of precipitations were found Nd (Gd, Zr, Mg), Mg (Nd, Gd, Zr) and Mg (Zr, Nd, Gd, Zn)). In order to determine the mechanical properties of MAP21 alloy processed with SLM technology, static tensile tests and microhardness tests were conducted, resulting in mechanical properties (Rm = 167 MPa, E = 38.6 GPa, 63-74 HB) comparable with as-cast alloy. A discussion was held on further research opportunities for biomedical use of SLM-ed MAP21 alloy.",

All participants underwent a total of three measurements: before surgery, 3 and 6 months after the surgery. Using the 3D kinematic analysis system, the patients’ gait was recorded during each measurement session and kinematic analysis was carried out. The parameters that were monitored included the sagittal range of motion while walking in the ankle, the knee and the hip joints of the operated and the unoperated limb, and the range in the hip joint’s frontal plane, the rotation of pelvis in the frontal and transverse planes, as well as the speed of walking and the walking step length. Results: Significant increases were found in sagittal range of motion in the operated hip joint, sagittal range of motion in the ankle joint on the unoperated side and in the walking step length of the unoperated limb. Conclusions: During walking after a THR, the sagittal range of motion in the ankle of the unoperated limb increases. Also, the range of motion in the sagittal plane on the operated joint increases, which is related to the lengthening of the step of the unoperated lower limb.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The effectiveness of inhaled drugs is strictly related to areas reachable by drug particles. Unless particles reach the desired part of the bronchial tree, their influence might not meet the expectations. Consequently, the disease progress might not be stopped or even slowed down. Therefore, the primary objective of this research was to analyze the airflow patterns and particle deposition of a standard inhaled drug using computational fluid dynamics. Methods: The study was devoted to the analysis of the particle Diameter influence on their deposition areas within the entire respiratory tract. Two patient-specific respiratory tract models, for 6 and 12-year-old patients, were reconstructed based on the computed tomography examinations. Numerical analyses were carried out as stationary ones with the constant inflow of the particles of various diameters (within the range of 1–50 μm). It was proven that depending on the particle size, their deposition within the respiratory tract varies significantly. Results: The vast majority of the particles with diameters over 20 μm is gathered on the walls of the throat, whereas particles of diameters 5–15 μm are accumulated mainly on the trachea walls, leaving the alveoli insufficiently supplied with the drug particles. Conclusions: The inhaled drug size cannot be treated as negligible factor during the drug spraying. An improper distribution of the particles might not inhibit the symptoms of the asthma. Numerical simulations may improve drugs selection and visualize their distribution along the airways, which might accelerate asthma treatment personalization.",

A small testing machine intended for three-point bending and equipped with instruments registering low forces was constructed for the needs of the experiment. The machine was used to perform numerous bending tests of wings of three species of insects (obtained from a breeding farm): Attacus atlas , Vespa crabro , Libellula Depressa at various air-humidity conditions. Values of the force and displacement obtained in the course of the tests were used to calculate Young’s modulus. In order to do so, it was also necessary to obtain the moment of inertia of the wing cross-section. These values were measured on the basis of the images obtained with a SEM microscope. Obtained results were averaged and presented with a breakdown by air-humidity conditions. It was observed that Young’s modulus decreased with an increase of humidity, hence the calculations of the percentage decrease of this mechanical parameter were performed. Obtained results were compared with the observed structure which was also presented under light microscope. It transpired that the construction of a wing does not only influence the mechanical values but also it influences their susceptibility to the changes occurring in the environment. Thereby, differences between Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera insects were indicated also within the aspect discussed in this paper.",

Methods: For the analysis, work activities and the value of applied force were selected. Among the analyzed 24 work activities were those during which there was a symmetrical load, as well as those during which the applied force or the assumed position of the body caused a lack of load symmetry. Results: The results show that the REBA method differentiates 24 cases of unit load into six levels, while the other two methods provide 24 different values between cases. Cases differing in load even over 100%, when assessed according to the 3DSSPP or ShiftBack do not differ in the assessment of REBA. Differences in the assessment of the same tasks between the results obtained from 3DSSPP and ShiftBack that were above 15% concern only 7 cases. Conclusions: A comparative analysis of the assessment of the lumbar part of the back using three methods indicates strong correlations between the results of the assessment carried out using 3DSSPP and ShiftBack. Smaller relationships were demonstrated by comparing these two methods with the REBA method.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Failure of anterior cruciate ligament often occurs in young sports personnel hampering their career. Such ACL ruptures are quite prevalent in sports such as soccer during dynamic loading which occurs at more than one rate of loading. In this work, a structural constitutive equation has been used to predict the forces acting on ACL for different rates of loading. Methods: Ligaments with distal femur and proximal tibia were subjected to tensile loading to avoid crushing of tissue ends and slipping at higher rates of strain. Custom designed cylindrical grippers were fabricated to clamp the distal femur and proximal tibial bony sections. To estimate parameters for the model, eighteen fresh cadaveric femur-ACL-tibia complex (FATC) samples were experimented on by pure tensile loading at three orders of rates of strain viz., 0.003, 0.03, and 0.3 s –1 . The experimental force-elongation data was used to obtain parameters for De-Vita and Slaughter’s equation. The model was validated with additional tensile experiments. Results: Statistical analysis demonstrated failure stress, Young’s modulus and volumetric strain energy to vary significantly as a function of rate of strain. Midsection failure was observed only in samples tested at 0.03 s–1. Femoral or tibial insertion failure were observed in all other experiments irrespective of rate of strain. Conclusion: Human FATC samples were tensile tested to failure at three rates of strain using custom-designed cylindrical grippers. A structural model was used to model the data for the ACL behaviour in the linear region of loading to predict ligament behaviour during dynamic activities in live subjects.",

Methods: The experimental technique is based on single- or two-chamber inflation-deflation tests in which temporal changes in limb circumference under the test chamber for cyclic loading are registered. Simplified models for fast undrained deformation and slow creep of oedematous tissue with squeezing out interstitial liquid were considered. Finite element simulations of the chamber test within a finite deformation poroelastic model were elaborated. Results: Formulas necessary to estimate the shear modulus and permeability of subcutaneous tissue were derived and then tested or calibrated using the results of poroelastic simulations. An example of application of the derived formulas for clinical data obtained from the chamber test was discussed. Conclusions: A simple in vivo methods of estimation of the hydromechanical properties of lymphedematous tissue (shear modulus and permeability) were proposed. The strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methodology were discussed.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Sports surface is one of the known external factors affecting running performance and injury. To date, we have found no study that examined the lower extremity stiffness in habitual forefoot strikers running on different overground surfaces. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate lower extremity stiffness and relevant kinematic adjustments in habitual forefoot strikers while running on different surfaces. Methods: Thirty-one male habitual forefoot strikers were recruited in this study. Runners were instructed to run at a speed of 3.3 m/s (±5%) on three surfaces, named synthetic rubber, concrete, and artificial grass. Results: No significant differences were found in leg stiffness, vertical stiffness, and joint stiffness in the sagittal plane during running on the three surfaces (p &gt; 0.05). Running on artificial grass exerted a greater displacement in knee joint angle than running on synthetic rubber (p = 0.002, 95% CI = 1.52–7.35 degrees) and concrete (p = 0.006, 95% CI = 1.04–7.25 degrees). In the sagittal plane, peak knee moment was lower on concrete than on artificial grass (p = 0.003, 95% CI = 0.11–0.58 Nm/kg), whereas peak ankle moment was lower on synthetic rubber than on concrete (p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 0.03–0.07 Nm/kg) and on artificial grass (p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 0.02–0.06 Nm/kg). Among the three surfaces, the maximal ground reaction forces on concrete were the lowest (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: This study indicated that running surfaces cannot influence lower extremity stiffness in habitual forefoot strikers at current running speed. Kinematic adjustments of knee and ankle, as well as ground reaction forces, may contribute to maintaining similar lower extremity stiffness.",

Moreover, the level of muscle stiffness can be crucial to assessment muscle adaptation to exercise. However, stiffness of flexor muscles in rock climbers has never been investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the myofascial stiffness of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) in the rock climbers. Methods: The group of rock climbers (n = 16) has been compared to the non-climbers group (n = 16), matched in terms of anthropometric measures and an average level of physical fitness. Moreover, the impact of the one-time rock climbing training on FDS stiffness was assessed in the rock climbers group. The measurement of myotonometric myofascial stiffness of FDS muscles was performed, when the elbow was flexed and fully extended. In both positions, the measurements were taken with the hand open and closed. Results: It has been shown that rock climber’s FDS muscle stiffness before training was significantly higher (from 15 to 20%) compared to non-climbers group. Moreover, after climbing myofascial stiffness of FDS muscles increased significantly from 25 to 40%. Conclusions: Rock climbers have significantly higher stiffness of FDS muscles after rock climbing training. Moreover, the increased stiffness in the FDS differentiates rock climbers from the active and healthy control group. Results may indicate that decrease of muscle stiffness of FDS can be an important factor for the improvement of the climbing effectiveness and prevention of overload in the forearm flexor muscles and their recovery.",

Methods: The study consisted of 56 inactive females aged 71.77 ± 7.43 (SD). They were divided into groups according to age and obesity. Results: Obesity separately affects FRI12-6, static indicators with eyes closed (OSI EC, APSI EC, MLSI EC), and age affects FRI12-6 and static indices with eyes open (OSI EO, APSI EO). After considering design factors (age and obesity), there were statistically significant differences in OSI EO (p = 0.027), APSI EO (p = 0.034), FRI12-6 (p = 0.0002) between obese and non-obese participants in the age groups. There were no statistical differences between non-obese old and obese-young participants (p = 0.863). The interaction between obesity and age in the FR in static indices and in FRI12-6 (p = 0.73047) was not significant. Conclusions: Age and obesity affect the stabilographic parameters individually, but there is no interaction effect between them. The presence of only one of the above risk factors may increase the FR. Obesity affects stability, while age depends on other factors. If older people are not obese or fit, involutional changes could be reversed. The type of obesity and the location of the fat tissue should be taken into account in FR assessment.",

For binary solutions of non-electrolytes containing a solvent and one solute, these equations include the Peusner resistance coefficients. The aim of the study was to assess the transport properties of biomembranes on the basis of the concentration characteristics of the coefficients: resistance, coupling, energy conversion efficiency and degraded and free energy fluxes. Methods: The subject of the study were polymer biomembranes used as a membrane dressing (Bioprocess) and used in hemodialysis (Nephrophan, Ultra-flo) with the coefficients of hydraulic permeability (Lp), reflection (σ) and diffusion permeability (ω) for aqueous glucose solutions. The research method was the R version of the KKP network equations for binary solutions of non-electrolytes. Results: We developed a procedure for evaluation the transport properties of membranes. This procedure requires the calculation of the dependence of the following coefficients: Peusner resistance, Kedem–Caplan–Peusner coupling, Caplan–Peusner energy conversion efficiency, Peusner coupling, and the dissipated energy and free energy fluxes on the mean glucose concentration. Results show that the values of the Peusner resistance coefficients, the Kedem–Caplan–Peusner coupling, the Caplan–Peusner energy conversion efficiency, and the Peusner coupling depend on the mutual relationship between the coefficients Lp, σ, ω and C. In turn, the value of the dissipated energy and free energy fluxes it is also determined by the values of the volume and diffusion fluxes. Conclusions: The presented procedure for evaluation transport properties of membranes can be helpful in explaining the mechanisms of membrane transport and conducting energy analyzes of membrane processes. Therefore, this procedure can be used for selection of a suitable membrane for practical (eg., industrial or medical) applications.",

Results: Among the boys, the load on the left or right shoulder showed a statistically significant difference in the analyzed features, apart from the angle of inclination of the lumbosacral segment for the load on the right shoulder. In the girls, significant differences were observed in all of the analyzed features. Conclusions: The mode of carriage of school items may cause significant adaptation changes in the skeletal, muscular, and nervous system. Overall fitness affects the size of postural changes. The method of carriage of school supplies with asymmetric loading of the body trunk should not be practised among 7-year-old children of both sexes. The load should be smaller to affect the posture symmetrically.",

A novel hybrid (serial-parallel) robot manipulator was proposed in this paper for rehabilitation of upper limb and its kinematics are studied systematically. This robot manipulator intends to perform wrist flexion, wrist extension, wrist radial deviation, wrist ulnar deviation, elbow flexion, elbow extension, elbow pronation and elbow supination motions. The contemporary mechanical designs especially the kinematic structure of upper limb exoskeleton robots have a unique feature that is, almost all of them use serial manipulators, and few others used parallel manipulators. The kinematic structure of the proposed robot is that of a hybrid manipulator (two parallel manipulators connected in series) which has 4-degrees-of-freedom. It is composed of an upper 3SPS-type parallel manipulator and 2SPR-type parallel manipulator connected in series. Methods: The Jacobian and Hessian Matrix method was used to derive the manipulator kinematic formula for solving the displacement, velocity and acceleration. Results: A 3D model of the robotic arm was constructed and analyzed by simulation. The positioning workspace of manipulator was constructed and analyzed. Conclusions: The 3SPS-type parallel manipulator has good kinematic characteristics while performing wrist motions. The 2SPR-type parallel manipulator produced singular configuration, while performing the desired rehabilitation elbow motions, it was found to not be suitable for usage in performing rehabilitation therapy in stroke-affected patients.",

First, a model with a human body and a car was established, and the muscle function was activated in lower extremity of human model. Second, the deceleration pulse with a peak of 186 m/s2 was applied to the car to simulate the frontal crash. Then, four sets of simulations with different contact stiffness are conducted to obtain the lower limb responses. Results indicate that the maximum loading of the left and right legs during the impact was 1.29 and 1.22 kN, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum moment were 28.82 and 52.17 Nm, respectively. The maximum stress of lower extremity was 87.35 MPa, and the maximum tibia index was 0.230. It was demonstrated that the injury risk of the femur in the groups with equipment of knee cushion and foot cushion was low, but the injury risk of the tibia increased at the same time.

P3HB is a natural metabolite in the human body and, therefore, it could replace the synthetic, hard-to-degrade polymers used in the production of implants. However, P3HB is a brittle material with limited thermal stability. Therefore, in order to improve its mechanical properties and processing parameters by separating its melting point and degradation temperature, P3HB-based composites can be produced using, for example, linear aliphatic polyurethanes as modifiers. The aim of the study is a modification of P3HB properties with the use of linear aliphatic polyurethanes synthesized in reaction of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and polypropylene glycols (PPG) by producing their composites. Prepared biocomposites were tested by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TGA). Furthermore, selected mechanical properties were evaluated. It has been confirmed that new biocomposites showed an increase in impact strength, relative strain at break, decrease of hardness and higher degradation temperature compared to the unfilled P3HB. The biocomposites also showed a decrease in the glass transition temperature and the degree of crystallinity. Biocomposites obtained with 10 wt. % polyurethane synthesized with polypropylene glycol having 1000 g · mole–1 and HDI have the best thermal and mechanical properties.",

In addition, the wide feet setting significantly affected not only the feet loading symmetry but also the strategy (high LyE), the amount of irregularities (high SampEn) and the CoP time-series roughness complexity (high FD). It has been shown that as the base of support grew, the asymmetry index grew. Conclusions: The wide squat is less stable, requiring more complex postural control behavior and more flexibility.

The secondary aim of the study was to determine the effect of Newtonian/non-Newtonian fluid flow assumption on blood flow directly behind the trileaflet valve. Methods: The geometrical model of the whole system consist of the left ventricle, fragment of the aorta and mechanical valves. A representation of pulsatile flow was obtained by measuring blood flow velocity (Doppler ultrasound examination). We have assumed turbulent blood flow. We considered two blood models, Newtonian and non-Newtonian (Carreau model). The valves’ performance was assessed using the reduced stress in the valves, the shear stress in the aortic wall, flow velocity field and the effective orifice area. Results: The maximum von Mises stress for the bileaflet valve leaflets was 0.3 MPa and for the trileaflet valve – 0.06 MPa. The maximum flow velocity for the bileaflet valve was 4.52 m/s for 40° and for the trileaflet valve – 5.74 m/s. Higher shear stress was present in the bileaflet (151.5 Pa) than for the trileaflet valve (49.64 Pa). Conclusions: The results indicate that central blood jet for the trileaflet valve contributes to more physiological blood flow and decreases the risk of haemolysis. The central flow minimises the risk of leaflet dislocation. In addition, lower stresses extend the durability of the valve. However, the trileaflet valve geometry has also disadvantages, for instance, small peripheral streams or relatively low effective orifice area.",

Methods: Individuals of both sexes were studied: 15 women [age 25 ± 5 years] and 19 men [age 25 ± 4 years] with bilateral asymptomatic flatfoot, as well as 16 women [age 26±4 years] and 14 men [age 24 ± 3 years] with normal feet on both sides. A threedimensional VICON motion analysis system coupled with KISTLER dynamometric platforms was used to perform kinetic gait analysis. Results: Women with flatfoot showed significantly lower maximal relative moments in the ankle in the sagittal plane (p &lt; 0.05) and significantly lower maximal relative moments in the knee in the sagittal plane in the Terminal Stance (p &lt; 0.001). In men, a significant difference was found in terms of hip rotation moment in the transverse plane in the Mid Stance (p &lt; 0.01): men with normal feet showed moments of external rotation, while men with flatfoot generated internal rotational moments. Moreover, men with flatfoot showed significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01) maximal relative moments in the knee in the transverse plane in the Mid Stance. Conclusions: Women with flatfoot have a weakened lower limb propulsion mechanism, whereas, in men with flatfoot, there is a change in the mechanics of the lower limb in the transverse plane. Our findings cast some doubt on flatfoot as a putative risk factor for stress injuries and degenerative changes in lower-limb structures, and suggest that gender differentiation should be taken into account in the analysis and therapy of flatfoot.",

Each model consisted of two vertebrae divided into three bony parts, two endplates, an intervertebral disc and five ligaments. The flexion, extension, lateral bending and rotation loading conditions were simulated, and the ranges of motion were measured and plotted. Results: In flexion, compared to the baseline intact model, the most significant increase in the range of motion was experienced by the isthmic spondylolisthesis model, while in extension, a reduction in the range of motion was measured in both prolonged pars and unilateral pars defect and healthy disc models. In degenerated disc results, the unilateral pars defect and degenerative spondylolisthesis models had the lowest range of motion. No large differences were noticed in lateral bending results. Lastly, in axial rotation, the most significant increase in the range of motion was measured in the isthmic spondylolisthesis model, followed by the spondylolysis model and similarly, in the degenerated disc models. Conclusions: The isthmic spondylolisthesis displayed hypermobility in flexion and rotation. Moreover, the model with unilateral pars defect showed hypermobility in axial rotation only. Finally, hypomobility in all movements was noticed with the degenerative spondylolisthesis model.",

    "abstract": "Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has enticed significant research interest and are acknowledged among the principal volume of synthetic polymers that have been fabricated globally for nearly one century. This is as a result of their excellent attributes which dictated its wide-ranging usage in a range of applications, chiefly in medical field. The investigation is aimed at preparing PVP/PVA hydrogels using freeze drying technique for its characterization and accessing the biodegradability of the prepared hydrogel.Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were employed for the description of the morphology and chemical composition of the prepared hydrogels. More characterization studies were implemented by measurement of apparent density, porosity, swelling ratio and crystallinity of the fabricated hydrogel with the use of X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The biodegradability of the prepared hydrogel was also carried out in vitro in phosphate buffered saline.As the PVP content increased the percentage of porosities from 45.00 ± 1.00% to 81.80 ± 0.20%, which was also accompanied by an increase in density. The prepared hydrogel showed increase in swelling ratio as the PVP content increased, the highest swelling ratio was found in PP4 with 95.58% with the least swelling time of 4 minutes.To sum it up, PVP plays a role as network and performance regulator in this sort of anisotropic hydrogels. This investigation offers a fascinating means of regulating morphology and general characteristics of the PVA-based anisotropic hydrogels.",

The three run-up steps used are a chassé step, glissade, and assemblé.Seven high-level rhythmic female gymnasts participated in this study. Three run-up steps (i.e., chassé step, glissade and assemblé) were used randomly to perform a stag ring leap with throwing a ball on the jump take-off. 2D kinetic and kinematic analysis was conducted.The results indicated that the assemblé step used in the run-up technique generated greater values of the rate of force development, the highest values of vertical velocity, and the best vertical displacement. In addition, the assemblé step allows for the best opening angle of the split leap and the best closest angle of the ring leg. The same was noted for the front leg's angular velocity.We concluded that the assemblé step used in the run-up technique appears to favor a greater stag ring leap that meets the Code of Points' condition for admitting the jump, as well as numerous studies that focus on improving jumping abilities in rhythmic gymnastics.",

Contact surfaces were defined between the temporomandibular disc and the mandibular condyle and between the temporomandibular disc and the fossa eminence on the skull. Between contact surfaces a finite sliding was allowed. Stresses in the TMJ components (disc, mandible condyle and the fossa eminence on the skull) were obtained.

Measurements of sportsmen anthropometric parameters, including swimmers, are usually carried out in a static anatomic position using standard anthropometric method. In the present study, this common method is compared with a new approach which enables us to carry out the anthropometric measurements using numeric images collected both in static and in real swimming conditions. This method offers two advantages: the results are obtained in real dynamic conditions and the measurements are characterized by a high precision and repeatability.

    "abstract": "The pelvic bone was considered to be the part of hip joint in the case of loading corresponding to the conditions of stance phase during gait cycle. For that load the model of bone adaptation processes was analyzed. Computer simulations were performed for different stimulating factors in bone remodelling equation. The following stimulators were considered: Huber von Misses stress, principal stresses and strain energy density. Bone density distributions were compared and analyzed. MIMICS and ABAQUS software were applied in order to determine non-homogeneous bone material properties and characteristic, to calculate stresses and strains and to simulate bone adaptation procedure. Computer-aided calculations are indispensable in the “custom design” process of total hip joint arthroplasty (THA). The most important task is to investigate the reasons of failures leading to revision surgery. Bone density is the physical factor that determines changes in the bone structure. The tool commonly used is numerical modelling based on FEM method, but the results of calculations are greatly dependent on modelling assumptions, i.e., geometrical and material structure and boundary conditions. The main goal of this work was to investigate the results of the simulation of remodelling processes, depending on various stimulating factors. The object of simulation was pelvic bone model, obtained by reconstruction bone structure in situ. The procedure of processing data from CT images to non-homogeneous 3D numerical model was performed using CT data of young man’s pelvic bone and software: MIMICS and MIMICS-FEA and ABAQUS. Numerical calculations, applying realistic bones properties and boundary conditions, allowed the stress and strain energy density to be obtained. Principal stress components, Huber von Misses stress and strain energy density were applied as the stimulating factors in remodelling model.",

The foot screening included the assessment of foot posture index, which evaluates the degree of pronated, supinated and neutral position of the foot, gait speed and the last part of the procedure consisted of a short questionnaire, providing the information about the type of housing, age, and the usage of orthotics.A low correlation between body composition and some of the foot posture index criteria was observed. The mean foot posture index score in athletes with ID was observed to be slightly pronated, as also described in the general population, with no statistically significant difference between female and male athletes. The gender differences were observed only in body composition.The high body weight and body fat percentage observed in this study highlight the need for healthy lifestyle education in athletes with ID.",

This preliminary study investigated the acute effect of attaching mass to the upper arm on the distance achieved in a modified javelin throw. The aim was to identify the optimum upper arm mass that maximizes throw distance. Methods: Three well-trained adult male athletes performed maximum-effort throws with an 800-g javelin training ball. A wide range of masses (0–1.5 kg) were attached to the upper arm and a 2D video analysis was used to obtain measures of the projection variables for each attached mass. Results: All three athletes showed an effect of attached arm mass on throw distance, and with the optimum mass the athlete’s throw distance was increased by 2.2 m, 1.2 m, and 0 m (7%, 4%, and 0%) respectively. The optimum mass was specific to the athlete (0.6 kg, 0.2 kg, and 0 kg) and changes in throw distance were mostly due to changes in release velocity rather than changes in release angle or release height. The experimental results were broadly similar to those obtained using a simple 2D mathematical model of throwing. Conclusions: These results indicate that some javelin throwers might see an increase in throwing performance when a mass is attached to their upper arm. However, the relationship between upper arm mass and throwing performance should be investigated further with studies on more athletes, projectiles of different mass, and other throwing events.",

Methods: A human body lower limb FE model representing midsize Chinese adult male anthropometry was employed with different upper body weight attachments being evaluated by comparing the predictions to those of a full body pedestrian model in vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions considering different front-end shapes. Results: The results indicate that upper body mass has a significant influence on pedestrian lower limb injury risk, the effect varies from vehicle front-end shape and is more remarkable to the femur and knee ligaments than to the tibia. In particular, the upper body mass can generally increase femur and knee ligaments injury risk, but has no obvious effect on the injury risk of tibia. The results also show that a higher attached buttock mass is needed for isolated pedestrian lower limb model for impacts with vehicles of higher bonnet leading edge. Conclusions: The findings of this study may suggest that it is necessary to consider vehicle shape variation in assessment of vehicle pedestrian protection performance and leg-form impactors with adaptive upper body mass should be used for vehicles with different front-end shapes, and the use of regional leg-form impactor modeling the local anthropometry to evaluate the actual lower limb injury of pedestrians in different countries and regions.",

From the orthopaedic and patient point of view, after the treatment, an assessment should be carried out of the biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system. The aim of this study was to assess the body balance of patients treated with the Ilizarov method for tibial nonunion. Methods: The research group included 24 individuals with a mean age of 55 years, who were treated for aseptic tibial nonunion with the Ilizarov method. The control group was matched to the study group in terms of gender and age, and consisted of 32 subjects with a mean age of 50.5 years and no significant medical history. This study evaluated the balance of patients with the use of pedobarography. Results: In the control group, a statistically significantly shorter path of centre of gravity was observed. There were no statistical differences between the study and control groups for the field area of the centre of gravity. There were no statistical differences between the study and control groups for the minor axis length or major axis length of the centre of gravity. There was a relationship between the centre of pressure path length and the age of the participants in both the control group and the study group. Conclusions: Treatment of patients with tibial nonunion with the Ilizarov fixator achieves similar balance to healthy volunteers.

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyse differences in postural stability between athletes with ID competing in Alpine and Cross country (XC) skiing to assess the effect of special sports training on postural stability in persons with ID. Methods: Athletes with ID were divided into four groups by their discipline: Alpine skiers (n = 9), XC skiers 2.5 to 10 km (n = 10), XC skiers 500 to 1000 m (n = 18) and XC skiers 50 and 100 m (n = 10). All participants were asked to stand barefooted on the Zebris FDM platform (Medical GmbH, Germany) with their eyes open and closed. To compare differences between groups one-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD test was used. To compare the difference between the eyes open and closed, t-test was used. Results: Statistical analysis showed no significant differences between Alpine and XC skiers in analysed variables. The analysis of COP velocity showed superior postural stability in XC skiers 2.5 to 10 km compared to XC skiers 500 and 1000 m. In XC skiers 500 and 1000 m, XC skiers 2.5 to 10 km and Alpine skiers a significant increase in COP velocity was observed when having the eyes closed. In XC skiers 50 and 100 m, no statistically significant differences between the eyes open and closed conditions were observed. Conclusions: Despite different sports training, no difference between Alpine and XC skiers in postural stability was observed. When comparing XC skiers, better postural stability was observed in skiers running longer distances, suggesting that this sports training enhances balance skills needed in everyday life.",

Aerodynamic characteristics and dimensionless aerodynamic forces' coefficients were calculated. The tests were carried out for various configurations of the jumper's body. A universal mathematical model of a parachute jumper's body was prepared, thus enabling the analysis of the jumper's movement with a closed parachute in any position. In order to build the model, a digitized model of a jumper allowing changing the body configuration, making appropriate changes of the moment of inertia, distribution of the center of mass and the aerodynamic characteristics was adopted. Dynamic movement equations were derived for a jumper in a relative reference system. The mathematical model was formulated for a jumper with a variable body configuration during the flight, which can be realized through a change of the position and the speed of the parachute jumper's limbs. The model allows analyzing the motion of the jumper with a closed parachute. It is an important jump phase during an assault with delayed parachute opening in sports type jumping, e.g., Skydiving and in emergency jumps from higher altitudes for the parachute's opening to be safe.",

Current treatments for cartilage repair are less than satisfactory, and rarely restore a full function or return the tissue to its natural state. The leading strategies in the treatment are aimed at the transplantation of cells and/or the use of various biological grafts, bioactive agents, or biologically compatible implant matrices. The insertion of a crushed autologous bone graft has been reported as a possible therapy. However, the regenerative quality of the tissue was less than 70% of healthy cartilage for fragments and controls. The implantation of cycloolefin-blend 3D-cylinders with hydrogel scaffolds on their proximal parts and with the applications of type I collagen films is one of several surgical therapies. The replacement and continuous biomechanical properties of the subchondral bone play an important role in the morphology and the quality of chondrogenesis. The initial biomechanical stability of COC-blend polymer replacements in the subchondral bone contributes to the formation of a new cartilage tissue. The initial bearing capacities of the implanted tissue/replacements and vertical positions of the replacements have a principal influence upon both the quality and the quantity of new articular cartilage.",

The practical aspect of the modelling of the monofin swimming technique is apparent, since the interpretation of the propulsion as such is much less complicated than it is in the case of traditional swimming. Assuming that the technical level of the swimmers participating in the study is high (elimination of the redundant degree of freedom in the chain of swimmer’s body‐monofin) the analysis was limited to the calf, foot and monofin movements. The model of the neural network allowed identifying the differences in the structure of the movements phases, pointing to extra margin that can be used to generate propulsion while making an upward movement and, simultaneously, paving the way to optimize the monofin swimming technique.",

One hindlimb of growing rat was immobilized for two weeks with the Achilles tendon in extension. Tensile failure test was performed post-mortem at a rate of 10 mm/min without any preconditioning. Immobilization caused reduction of the elastic range of deformation both considering force and extension. The stiffness of tendons was decreased, especially at small strains in an inelastic “toe” region. However, the plastic range was broader and the maximum load similar compared to these of normal tendons. It was revealed that immobilization, even under constant tension, changes significantly mechanical properties of tendons in the range of small strains encountered during physiological loading. The changes may alter the behaviour of a joint after restoration of a normal activity.",

The aim of the research is to develop a method of computer simulation of static and dynamic interactions between the archer, bow and arrow system in order to provide archery with practical recommendations. A model of an archer’s body is presented as a mechanical system composed of a few solid bodies, which are connected to each other and to the ground with viscoelastic elements. Mechanical and mathematical model of bow and arrow geometry in vertical plane in braced and drawn situations is investigated. An asymmetrical scheme, rigid beams, concentrated elastic elements and elastic string are the main features of the model. Numerical results of computer simulation of archer, bow and arrow interactions are presented in graphical form, which makes the methods easy to use by sportsmen and coaches. During a rapid motion an arrow is in common motion space with a bow and an archer. The main motion in the vertical plane is caused by the bow‐grip‐limbs‐string system. Simultaneously the arrow through the string nock point is involved by the whole system in deflection out of the vertical plane. This rapid motion causes arrow deflection in the lateral plane. Rigorous three-dimensional analysis of the space system is very complicated and with the other assumptions is not essential. The main part of potential energy, stored in bow‐limbs, is transformed to kinetic energy of the longitudinal motion of the arrow and the string common motion. Some negligible part of energy is transformed and deflects the motion of the arrow. Although the arrow is in a space motion of the whole system, the problem can be idealised and reduced to two separate systems. The first one is in the vertical plane, and the second is in the lateral plane.",

Parametric modelling and multivariate analysis are used in order to define synthetic variables (indices) describing kinematic and morphometric parameters. The possibility of predicting the performance V100 (mean velocity over 100 m butterfly) using morphology variables is tested. The results showed that the parametric model proposed describes well the performance. The selected kinematic parameter Xhip, (instantaneous hip displacement) varies little among the swimmers, whereas for the parameter k (describing the variation of the displacement patterns) highly different values have been obtained. Hip displacements vary essentially according to their shapes high k values corresponding to swimmers acceleration at the end of the cycle, and low k values corresponding to swimmers with more regular displacements. Thus, k was selected as the only parameter to describe the hip displacement patterns. A negative relation between the performance and the hydrodynamic variables has been obtained confirming that every increase of flow resistance get worse performance. A positive relation between the performance and the individual morphological data has been found, i.e. light and sharp swimmers have in general higher performance. No relation between k and the morphology has been observed. On the contrary, a negative relation between the hydrodynamic variables and the morphology has been obtained.",

The purpose of the work was to develop a transparent mathematical model which can be used to assess contact stress in the hip from imaged structures of pelvis and proximal femora, in large population studies and in clinical practice. Methods: We upgraded a previously validated three-dimensional mathematical model of the human hip in the one-legged stance HIPSTRESS by introducing parameters independent from the size of the structures in the images. We validated a new parameter – dimensionless peak stress normalized by the body weight and by the radius of the femoral head (p max r 2 /W B ) on the population of 172 hips that were in the childhood subjected to the Perthes disease and exhibited increased proportion of dysplastic hips. Results: The dimensionless parameter p max r 2 /W B exhibited smaller number of indecisive cases of hip dysplasia predicted by the model than the previously used parameter p max /W B (6% vs. 81%, respectively). A threshold for an increased risk of early coxarthritis development by the HIPSTRESS parameter H = p max r 2 /W B was found to be 2. Conclusions: We proposed a dimensionless peak stress on the load bearing area with the border value of 2 as a decisive parameter over which hips are at risk for early development of degenerative processes and presented a method for determination of biomechanical parameters with the use of nomogram.",

Effect of the specific local hemodynamic environment around an atherosclerotic plaque on the thrombosis formation does not remain quite clear but is believed to be crucial. The aim of this study is to uncover the flow effects on plaques formation. Methods: To study the mechanically regulated plaque formation, the flow fields in artery blood vessels with different stenosis rates at various Reynolds numbers were simulated numerically with the two-dimensional axisymmetric models, and the hemodynamic characteristics around the plaque were scaled with stenosis rate and Reynolds number. Results: The results showed that increases of both Reynolds number and stenosis rate facilitated the occurrence of flow separation phenomenon, extended recirculation zone, and upregulated the maximum normalized wall shear stress near the plaque throat section while downregulated the minimal normalized wall shear stress at the front shoulder of plaque, as it should be; in the atherosclerotic plaque leeside of the recirculation zone, an obvious catch bond region of wall shear stress might exist especially under low Reynolds number with stenosis rate smaller than 30%. This catch bond region in the plaque leeside might be responsible for the LBF (low blood flow)-enhanced formation of the atherosclerotic plaque. Conclusions: This work may provide a novel insight into understanding the biomechanical effects behind the formation and damage of atherosclerotic plaques and propose a new strategy for preventing atherosclerotic diseases.",

Social Latin American dances (salsa, bachata) require dancers to do a characteristic figure, however, they are not trained as intensively as dancing sports. The aim of the study was to assess the static and dynamic balances of dancers, who are regularly dancing those selected Latin American dances, by comparison with those who do not. Methods: The study was conducted among 34 dancers from a Krakow Dancing School and, 37 students of the Jagiellonian University, aged 21–35. A SIGMA balance platform was used to measure static and, the Y-Balance Test platform to assess dynamic balance. The Student’s T-test, Mann– Whitney U-test and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient were used in statistical analysis. Results: There were neither significant differences between right and left lower limbs of dancers, nor between values of tilts on the YBT platform in both investigated groups. Non-dancers, however, showed a slightly higher positive correlation between the deviations in the sagittal and frontal planes and the surface area, as well as between the path length and the surface area on the SIGMA platform when compared to dancers. Conclusions: The level of dynamic and static balances of dancing people is similar, when compared to non-dancers. The influence of practicing Latin American dances on the sense of balance require further studies.",

Surgery within the abdominal cavity or elsewhere almost always involves cutting through the skin, after which a medical procedure is conducted, followed by wound closure. The suture provides temporary mechanical support during the natural healing process of the affected tissues. Not only does it stimulate the primary wound healing, but also provides mechanical protection against wound dehiscence.This analysis is intended to juxtapose the basic factors that contribute to a change in suture strength and the possible failure of surgical sutures, which may affect the wound healing process and increase the risk of postoperative complications.The preliminary search criteria used in the databases included keywords such as: \"strength of suture materials\", \"strength of surgical sutures\", \"surgical knot strength\". Five key articles were ultimately selected from a pool of 336 articles first identified based on these search criteria. Next, a meta-analysis of the literature data was performed, taking into account factors such as the type of suture materials used, biological conditions and model conditions used in research, having a significant impact on the mechanical properties of surgical sutures.This comparison revealed considerable variations in the suture strength between different sutures of the same size, it also demonstrated that the decrease in suture strength strongly depends on the finished suture and the thread type.",

In this study, the Ti6Al4V coaxial scaffolds with five types of beam angles and three types of pore sizes were designed using CAD and fabricated with the use of SLM. The porous characteristics and mechanical properties of scaffolds were investigated systematically. The results show that the porosity of the coaxial scaffolds is 63–69%, and the pore size is 480–700 m. Meanwihle, the elastic modulus and compressive strength of the coaxial scaffolds were 1.08–1.85 GPa, 40–88 MPa, respectively. Moreover, the fatigue strength of the coaxial scaffolds with 500–40°, 600–40°, 700–40° were 1387, 1110 and 420 MPa, respectively. The pore size and porosity of the coaxial scaffolds in our study satisfied the size requirements for bone cells growth. Meanwhile, the low elastic modulus and high fatigue strength of the scaffolds also met the bio-mechanical bearing requirements of cancellous bone implants. Our study provided a reference for the design of biomimetic cancellous bone implants with good dynamic load-bearing mechanical properties.",

The rate of perceived exertion and heart rate values were also evaluated.A fast start in the first 50-100 m, then a constant speed in the middle of the race and an end-spurt during the last 50-100 m was the pacing pattern adopted by the majority of the swimmers. Significant main effects of time were observed for 400 m time ( p = 0.001; ES 3.39; very large). Results revealed significant pre-to-post improvements from 328 ± 26.3 s to 317 ± 19.4 s in the experimental group and from 329 ± 25.2 s to 321 ± 21.1 s in the control group.All the swimmers adopted almost the same parabolic pacing strategy before and after the training program with some differences in seconds that have made the strategy of the experimental group better balanced during the post-training test. Both training methods induced significant improvements in 400 m performance, to a greater extent for the training using intensities near 400 m race pace.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study investigated the immediate after-effects of clothing shape on tandem gait performance. Methods: Nineteen healthy men (21.8 ± 1.8 years) performed tandem gait tests while blindfolded under three clothing conditions: only half or short tights, a cotton cloth wrapped around the waist and draped to the middle point of the lower leg (DC), and tracksuit bottoms (TS). Participants performed pre- and post-gait tests at their fastest possible speed while wearing tights. Between the pre- and post-tests, participants practiced the same tandem gait, but at their own chosen speed while wearing DC or TS. Results: The practice with the DC increased gait speed and decreased lateral shift during the post-gait test compared to the pre-gait test. The practice while wearing the TS also reduced lateral shift but did not increase gait speed. Conclusions: These results suggest that some clothing shapes are more effective for motor learning of balance control during tandem gait by enhancing the feedback for body orientation. Clothing that has a certain amount of space between the material and the body and that makes contact with the body as it moves may be more effective.",

Relationship between parameters in the laboratory anaerobic test and the handgrip test was checked. Methods: The 30-second Wingate Anaerobic Test (peak power, mean power, relative peak power, relative mean power, time to achieve peak power, fatigue index) on the arm-crank ergometer (LODE ANGIO), the FUTREX 6100 (Futrex, Gaithersburg, USA) and the handgrip test were used in amputee football players (n = 23). Anthropometric measurements were collected. Results: There were no differences in anaerobic results between players considering types and levels of limb impairment. Forwards had significantly higher relative mean and peak power (p = 0.049, d = 0.82; p = 0.049, d = 0.81), and lower amputation-adjusted body mass index (p = 0.001, d = 1.50) than defenders. For peak power, 19 out 23 achieved, and for relative peak power, 22 out 23 achieved results from “average” to “elite”. Peak power strongly correlated to handgrip strength results. Conclusions: Amputee football requires a high level of power from players. Maintaining appropriate body composition is important for amputee football players to have better anaerobic performance during the game. The 30-second Wingate Anaerobic Test can be used to assess anaerobic performance in AF players. Sport-specific anaerobic performance laboratory tests and field-based tests using in indirect upper limbs’ peak power monitoring would be beneficial for coaches.",

The understanding of thermodynamic phenomena occurring during polymerization process is necessary to limit harmful cement influence on human body. Thus the description of the heat release due to chemical reactions is especially important. The paper deals mainly with the description of the heat source and temperature field in the surgical cement layer. Characteristics of the heat source in the cement were described.

Before a proper study, the aerobic capacity of the subject was evaluated. The test consisted of two walking efforts performed on a mechanical treadmill. The subject was walking for 12 minutes with shoe orthoses at constant speed (12 km/h) and then the rest phase allowed for the total covering of the oxygen debt. Then the trial was repeated without orthoses. Simultaneously with measuring physiological variables, there was made 3D recording of the athlete's movements on the treadmill applying the Vicon system. There were chosen vertical oscillations of the body center of gravity and work of the subject's system of motion connected with kinetic and potential energy changes regarding the movements of COM during gait. The energy cost of walking at speed related to anaerobic threshold (starting) using shoe orthoses was slightly lower compared to energy expenditure during gait without improvement. No significant differences were noticed in the range of summary vertical COM oscillations during walking in both variants of the measurement. However, considerable asymmetries appeared in the value of COM kinetic energy changes that were lower for the right leg. This testifies to a strongly fixed asymmetrical scheme of individual athlete's technique.",

During unipedal hopping, control of limb stiffness and limb length are paramount.The purpose of this study was to compare two methods of measuring movement variability that provide information at the task level, and their capacities to illuminate the neuromotor control system's response to change in hopping rate.The typical task-level movement variability measure of the standard deviation of vertical limb length was compared to uncontrolled manifold analysis. We examined the relationship between change scores in deviation from spring-mass model-type behavior and these two variability measures for the shift from typical (2.3 Hz) to slow (1.7 Hz) hopping.The change scores for deviation from spring-mass model-type behavior and vertical limb length standard deviation demonstrated no correlation ( p = 0.784, R = 0.051). In contrast, the change scores for deviation from spring-mass model-type behavior and the uncontrolled manifold analysis measure demonstrated a moderate correlation ( p = 0.004, R = 0.502).Uncontrolled manifold analysis considers not just variability in the sense of error, but illustrates how the neuromotor control system distributes movement variability into performance-irrelevant and performance-destabilizing subspaces. As such, this type of analysis may be more effective at illuminating global control aspects of movement variability than the typical variability measure of limb length standard deviation.",

Not only can it detect the physiological state of the digestive tract, but also can conduct clinical operations. As a result, it’s of great significance to make clear the relationship between the clinical operation and the complications. Methods: Considering the difficulty in measuring the contact force and determining the stress distribution in real time during endoscopy, a specific-patient finite element model for the frictional behavior at the endoscope-esophagus interface was built in current study. By collecting the CT data of the patient, a 3D esophagus model was built and divided into three characteristic regions (narrow region, thoracic region and abdominal region) according to the physiological structure. Results: Results showed that the radius of the narrowest position was the dominant factor for the maximum von Mises stress when the endoscope passed through the narrow region. For abdominal region and thoracic region, with the increasing coefficient of friction (COF) and amplitude, the total force duo to frictional force (CFSM), frictional dissipation (FD), strain energy (SE) and maximum von Mises stress (Max) all increased correspondingly. Meanwhile, the region of stress concentration gradually approached the initial contact stage. Conclusions: The results can provide theoretical basis and technical support for clinical application and offer some suggestions for medical workers during endoscopy as well.",

However, the use of inextensible tape may lead to a decline in movement performance as a result of limited foot joint mobility and a change in vertical stiffness due to the passive stiffening of the tarsus and metatarsus. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of low-Dye taping on sport movement performance observed during a hopping task. Methods: The study was carried out on a group of 11 male handball players. The Myotest accelerometer was used to evaluate the effect of low-Dye taping on jumping height, ground contact time and vertical stiffness during the hopping test. Each study participant performed four series of 5 hops (hopping test): two series before low-Dye taping and two after. Results: No statistically significant differences were found between the values recorded before and after low-Dye taping for the variables that describe the hopping task: mean jump height, mean ground contact time and mean vertical stiffness. Conclusions: Low-Dye taping can be successfully used in handball players since it has a preventive effect that reduces the risk of injury to the foot and does not influence vertical stiffness or jump height to a significant extent.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The present study aims to investigate the effect of incline and decline walking on ground and joint reaction forces (JRF) of lower extremity and plantar fascia strain (PFS) under certain surface inclination angles. Methods: Twenty-three male subjects walked on a customized platform with four different surface inclinations (i.e., 0, 5, 7.5 and 10°) with inclined and declined directions. The motion of the ten reflective markers was captured using Qualysis motion capture system (Qualysis, Gothenburg, Sweden) and exported to a visual three-dimensional (3D) software (C-motion, Germantown, USA) in order to analyze the GRF, JRF and PFS. Results: The results found that the peak vertical GRF is almost consistent for 0 and 5° inclination slope but started to decrease at 7.5° onwards during decline walking. The most affected JRF was found on knee at medial-lateral direction even as low as 5 to 10° inclination for both walking conditions. Furthermore, the findings also show that the JRF of lower extremity was more affected during declined walking compared to inclined walking based on the number of significant differences observed in each inclination angle. The PFS was found increased with the increase of surface inclination. Conclusions: The findings could provide a new insight on the relationship of joint reaction forces and strain parameter in response to the incline and decline walking. It would benefit in providing a better precaution that should be considered during hiking activity, especially in medial-lateral direction in order to prevent injury or fall risk.",

Methods: Electrospinning scaffolds were produced as PVA/GE/GA crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GA) and freeze/dried scaffolds crosslinked with genipin (GP) were divided into two groups as PVA/GE/GP5 and PVA/GE/GP8. The scaffolds were investigated in terms of pore morphology, swell ratio, biodegradation, and biocompatibility. The biocompatibility of the material was tested in vitro by MTT assay on 1, 2, and 3 days to test the cell viability of 3T3 cells. Results: It was observed that Se triggered the excellent cell growth and proliferation on electrospinning and freeze drying PVA/GE scaffolds. Conclusions: Selenium with PVA/GE scaffolds can be a promising candidate for wound healing application, as it significantly increases cell viability on scaffolds. It is thought that the synergistic effect of selenium with genipin may be an important step in tissue engineering applications. The preliminary study can be supported by in vivo studies in the future.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the stress distribution in a synthetic femur that was implanted with a fully hydroxyapatite-coated stem using thermoelastic stress and finite element analyses, and to clarify the differences in the stress distributions between these two methods. Methods: Thermoelastic stress analysis is a stress-analysis technique that employs the thermoelastic effect. Sinusoidal vertical loads were applied to the head of the stem placed on the synthetic femur, and surface stress distribution images were acquired using an infrared stress measurement system. The finite element model for the synthetic femur and stem were set up similarly to the thermoelastic stress analysis experiment, and vertical load was applied to the head of the stem. Surface stress distribution and stress values obtained via these two methods were compared. Results: Thermoelastic stress analysis showed that compressive and tensile stresses were distributed from the proximal femur to the diaphysis, not only on the medial and lateral surfaces, but also on the anterior and posterior surfaces. However, finite element analysis showed that compressive stress was not distributed on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the femoral intertrochanter. The stress values of thermoelastic stress analysis tended to be higher in the proximal femur than that obtained via the finite element analysis. Conclusions: The surface stress distribution obtained by these two methods were different specifically in the proximal femur. Our results imply that thermoelastic stress analysis has a better potential than finite element analysis to show the surface stress distribution that reflects the stem design.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether three different measurement position yield divergent results in ROM using a goniometer, and how is it affected by anthropometrical factors. Methods: We measured the range of rotation in the hip joint in healthy participants aged 21.6 ± 1.88, seeking to determine how the distribution of internal vs. external rotation (RI) within the total range of mobility (TR) was influenced by the measurement position used, the gender of the participant, and the dominant lower limb. Results: We found that not only gender and limb dominance, but also the body position in which hip joint’s range of motion is measured significantly affects the values of TR and RI. We found that TR achieves the highest values in the prone position – PrP (males: 95.35 ± 12.44 and 93.15 ± 12.49; females: 103.75 ± 14.87 and 106.25 ± 15.56) and the lowest values in supine position – SuP (male: 62.65 ± 8.51 and 57.85 ± 9.60; female: 59.5 ± 12.27 and 55.85 ± 8.54). The analysis shows that CERD occurs 1.72 RI in women (StP), and &gt;2.08 RI in men (PrP). Conclusions: Due to the similarities between asymmetry of internal/external rotation in the hip joint and asymmetry in the rotation of the shoulder found in Glenohumeral Internal Rotation Deficit (GIRD), we propose the concepts of Coxal Internal Rotation Deficit (CIRD) and Coxal External Rotation Deficit (CERD) as tools to indicate the possibility for injury to the hip joint, and propose threshold rotation index values serving as indicators of these deficits.",

In this case, the stage and type of the disease can significantly affect the hemodynamic parameters of the left ventricle of the heart. In turn, these parameters can significantly influence the mode, type and strategy of clinical treatment. The aim of the study was to analyze and map the hydrodynamic conditions of the heart using a hybrid-digital model of the circulatory system. Methods: The tests performed using the circulatory system model allowed for the simulation of the failure of both heart’s left ventricle and a set of arteries in the systemic circulation. Furthermore, the changes in hemodynamic parameters for valvular anomalies at various heartbeats were obtained. Results: The results suggested that a higher heartbeat should be sustained in such cases of complex mitral-aortic anomalies in the clinical practice. When observing low aortic pressures, heartbeat should be increased to compensate for the valvular insufficiencies. Conclusions: Extending the already conducted research could result in constituting a wide database for clinicians who are treating the insufficiency of the left ventricle of the heart. Moreover, the information included in this paper may be used for a comparison of the clinical anomalies, which facilitates a correct diagnosis. The test-stand used in the research can be applied to predict the anomalies of the circulation system for a quick and precise analysis of a clinical anomaly of a patient without physical presence.",

Patellofemoral joint (PFJ) stress is believed to contribute to PFPS alterations through knee joint rotation alignment, but the influence of knee joint rotation conditions on PFJ stress is unclear. We aimed to investigate the influence of sex and knee joint rotation alignment on PFJ stress. Methods Simulation ranges were set to knee joint flexion angles of 10°-45° (common to both sexes) and extension moments of 0-240 Nm (males) and 0-220 Nm (females). The quadriceps force and effective lever arm length at the quadriceps muscle were determined as a function of the knee joint flexion angle and extension moment. The PFJ contact area, which is specific to sex, and knee joint rotation was calculated from cadaver data, and PFJ stress was estimated. Results In all knee joint rotation conditions, PFJ stress was higher in females than in males. Additionally, PFJ stress in males and females was the largest under neutral conditions compared with other rotation conditions. Conclusions The results may be useful for understanding the underlying mechanisms contributing to the differences in PFPS in males and females.",

Methods Vehicle-to-pedestrian crashes at the impact speeds of 40km/h (reference set) and 70km/h (analysis set) were simulated employing FE models of a sedan front and an SUV front together with a pedestrian FE model developed using hollow structures. The predictions from crash simulations of different vehicle types and impact speeds were compared and analyzed. Results In crashes at 70km/h, pedestrian head-vehicle contact velocity is about 20-30% higher than the vehicle impact speed; the peak head angular velocity exceeds 100rad/s and is close to the instant of head-vehicle contact; brain strain appears two peaks and the second peak (after head contact) is obviously higher than the first (before head contact), and AIS4+ head injury risk is above 50%; excessive thorax compression induces rib fractures and lung compression; both sedan and SUV cases show a high risk (&gt; 70%) of AIS3+ thorax injury, and the risk of AIS4+ thorax injury is lower than 40% in the sedan case and higher than 50% for the SUV case. Conclusions Pedestrians in vehicle crashes at 70km/h have a higher AIS3+/AIS4+ head and thorax injury risk, high vehicle impact speed is more easily to induce a high head angular velocity at the instant of head-vehicle contact, brain strain is strongly associated with the combined effect of head rotational velocity and acceleration, and pedestrian thorax injury risk is more sensitive to vehicle impact speed than the head.",

We tested for differences between the positions, and for the potential influence of participant's sex and ROM asymmetry.The measured peak muscle torque was affected not only by sex and the value of hip flexion affect, but also by the position in which it is measured. Subjects with restricted external rotation of the hip joint (CERD) had significantly higher flexor peak muscle torque compared to subjects with restricted internal rotation (CIRD), in all but the supine position. For CERD, the results were: Supine (SuP) 1.02 ± 0.26; Sitting (StP) 1.32 ± 0.58; Standing (SP) 1.53 ± 0.47; and for CIRD, the results were: Supine (SuP) 1.05 ± 0.17; Sitting (StP) 1.05 ± 0.40; Standing (SP) 1.47 ± 0.53.Overall, measurement position and passive ROM significantly influence the peak muscle torque in isometric conditions. Moreover, an imbalance in thigh rotation movement significantly determines the magnitude of muscle torque of the hip flexion movement. Individuals with increased internal-toexternal rotation achieved significantly higher values for flexor muscle torque force moments. Overall, these findings are of importance for interpreting or comparing any reported values for muscle torque force moments.",

The Microsoft Kinect V2 sensor was used to obtain the coordinate data of lower extremities and trunk during gait. The coordinate data obtained were processed using the software. Walking speed, stride length, stride time and cadence were calculated as spatiotemporal variables of walking. Forward trunk tilt angle (FTT), hip flexion and extension, and knee flexion and extension were measured as peak angles during one-gait cycle. Participants were categorized into five groups according to age by five years. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed to compare the spatiotemporal and kinematical data among groups.Significant differences among age groups were noted in terms of the walking speed and stride length. Significant differences were also observed in the FTT and hip extension angle.Increased gait changes, increased peak FTT and decreased peak hip extension angle were observed with an increase of age. These altered symptoms may contribute to the screening of older adults at risk of declined physical function at an early stage.",

Currently used titanium (Ti) alloys, such as Ti6Al4V and Ti6Al7Nb, are being replaced by materials with better biocompatibility, such as vanadium (V) or niobium (Nb), allowing for creation of the so-called new generation alloys. These new alloys, with the incorporation of zirconium (Zr), iron, and tantalum, possess Young's modulus close to that of a bone, which further improves the improves the biomaterial's. biocompatibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the physicochemical properties of a Ti13Nb13Zr alloy used for elements in the skeletal system. As the temperature and the number of cycles vary, the results demonstrate that the surface area of the samples changes. The uncoated Ti13Nb13Zr alloy exhibits hydrophilic properties. However, all coated specimens improve in this respect and provide improved clinical results. after the applied modification, the samples have a smaller contact angle, but still remain in the range of 0-90°, which makes it possible to conclude that their nature remains hydrophilic. Coating the specimens decreased the mineralization risk of postoperative complications. As a result, the biomaterials demonstrated improved effectiveness, decreased complication indicators, and improved patient well-being.",

This study aimed to develop a wearable sensor that tracks balance continuously and provides haptic biofeedback to its user through real-time vibration stimulus to assist patients with balance and postural control impairments such as cerebral palsy. Methods Twelve children with cerebral palsy and 12 age-matched typically developed children used the sensor during walking at a self-selected speed. The lower extremity joint kinematics, center of mass, and spatial-temporal parameters were recorded with Xsens MVN during “with” and “without” biofeedback conditions. Results The sensor did not disturb healthy gait. Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Root Mean Square Error techniques showed that biofeedback regulated the gait parameters and trunk stability of the CP group when biofeedback was given. The extended stance percentage (without BF: 73.91% ± 10.42, with BF: 63.53% ± 2.99), step width (without BF: 0.20m ± 0.05, with BF: 0.18m ± 0.07), and step time (without BF: 1.55s ± 1.07, with BF: 0.73s ± 0.14) parameters decreased; similarly, cadence and walking speed increased. Conclusions Obtained results indicated that this wearable sensor can be integrated into the physical therapy and rehabilitation process of children with balance and postural control impairments to improve motor learning and balance control.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of different foot strike patterns and cutting angles on knee kinematics and kinetics. Methods Twenty healthy male team sports athletes performed cuts with maximum speed at three angles (45°, 90°, and 135°) with different foot strike patterns (rearfoot strike [RFS] and forefoot strike [FFS]). A three-dimensional motion capture system combined with a force plate was used to collect makers trajectory and ground reaction force (GRF). Vertical GRF, and knee joint angles and moments were compared among these cutting tasks. Results Regardless of foot strike patterns, increased knee flexion angle, knee valgus moment, and knee internal rotation moment were observed during cutting to sharper angles (p &lt; 0.001). At 90° and 135°, the FFS condition remained in a varus position and showed lower knee flexion moment than the RFS condition (p ≤ 0.004). However, no significant differences in knee kinematic and kinetic variables were found between foot strike patterns during cutting to 45°. Conclusions These findings suggest that sharper cutting angles potentially increase the risk of ACL injury. Compared with the RFS pattern, the FFS pattern induces a slight knee varus angle and a lower knee flexion moment at sharper angles, which might further reduce the load placed on the knee.",

These conditions included small and large amplitude, low and high frequency, and different age groups. Results The results found that high amplitude snoring suppressed the disturbed flow at the stented segment, while the downstream region of ICA became more chaotic, accounting for in-stent intimal restenosis and thrombosis. Furthermore, local blood flow patterns of elder groups with snoring symptoms were more likely to be changed due to low-speed flow, increasing the possibility of vascular remodeling and thrombosis. Besides, increased snoring frequency hardly influenced the local disturbed flow. Conclusions Therefore, older adults should receive medical treatment actively after stenting for high amplitude snoring as soon as possible to avoid potential adverse events.",

Methods The study included handball players participating in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The study material consisted of data on athletes' body height, body weight, age, and BMI. The collected study material was analyzed about the position of the game, quarter and semester of the birth, continental location of the country, and geographical region. In parametric distribution, Student’s t-test and ANOVA were used. In non-parametric variables, the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used. Results The highest average heights, weights, and BMIs are found in players playing in the pivot position, while the lowest are found in wing players. Interactions were shown within the body weight and BMI of the athletes. Players from Europe have the highest weight and BMI in the second semester of birth, while other players' highest results were in the first semester. Conclusions The factors that most strongly differentiate body height, body weight, and BMI are playing position. Factors that differentiate height and weight are the continental location and region of the country represented.",

Special attention was paid to polyacrylamide preparations with different molecular weights and concentrations. Methods Tribological tests were conducted using the Al2O3– CoCrMo friction pair in the presence of investigated lubricants. Confocal microscopy was used to analyze and assess of volume, depth, and width of wear traces. Moreover, the viscosity and viscoelasticity tests of analyzed solutions were carried out. The rheological measurements were focused on the oscillatory tests, which allowed us to determine the elasticity modulus (G ') and viscosity (G''). Results Viscoelastic nature of the tested preparations depends on the strain rate. It has been shown that elastic properties dominate at higher frequencies. The molecular weight of the polymer has a particular influence on these properties. The most promising results were obtained for 6% and 8 % high molecular weight polyacrylamide compositions. Conclusions However, all tested polyacrylamide solutions show better rheological and tribological characteristics than commercial preparation based on hyaluronic acid.",

Methods Three mastoidectomy surgical methods, CWU, CWD and CWD-MO, were simulated on the freshly dissected cadaver heads. Then, the finite element (FE) models corresponding to these surgical methods were established by micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) and reverse engineering technology, and the accuracy of the models was verified. Finally, the FE Models were used to analyze the effects of different surgical methods on the sound transmission characteristics of the human ear. Results For CWU, since the integrity of the outer wall of the ear canal is ensured, the sound pressure (SP) gain of the ear canal and the stapes footplate displacement (FPD) gain after this operation are close to normal values. For CWD, due to severe damage to the outer wall of the ear canal, a negative gain of the ear canal SP occurs in the high-frequency range, and the resonance frequency is significantly reduced. For CWD-MO, the frequency range of SP negative gain in the ear canal is reduced due to the addition of fillers in the ear canal to reduce the degree of damage, and the resonance frequency is increased compared to CWD. Conclusions The impact of three types of mastoidectomy, including CWU, CWD, and CWD-MO, on the sound transmission characteristics of the human ear after surgery is relatively small.",

It is unclear whether patellofemoral joint stress (PFJS) is the highest (or lowest) when the knee joint flexion angle and extension moment are in combination under the condition that vastus medialis (VM) activation decreases. This study aimed to investigate the effects of changes in the PFJ contact area by decreasing the activation of the VM muscle on PFJS. Methods A PFJ sagittal model was used to quantify PFJ reaction force and PFJS. The PFJ model and mathematical modelling procedure were used to quantify PFJS based on previous studies. The simulation ranges were set to knee joint flexion angles of 10–45 degrees and extension moments of 0–240 Nm. PFJS was calculated for the normal condition (NC) and decrease condition (DC) in VM activation. Results When the knee joint angle and knee joint moment were at the maximum, the PFJS showed the maximum value under both conditions (NC; 14.9 N/cm2, DC; 16.4 N/cm2). PFJS was found to be higher in DC than that in NC for all simulation ranges. Conclusions Decreased VM activation may be involved in the mechanism of patellofemoral pain syndrome. In addition, the results of this study provide evidence that clinicians can enhance VM to relieve pain in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.",

The goal of our work was to assess the surface free energy (SFE) and the surface roughness (Ra) of three commercial flowable dental composites: everX Flow (bulk), everX Flow (dentin) and Flow-Art. Methods Surface roughness, contact angle and surface free energy were determined for tested composites. Two surface states (control and roughened) were compared. Roughness was measured with the use of the 3D optical profilometer. The contact angle (CA) was determined through the sessile drop method with the use of four different probing liquids. This enabled to apply two surface free energy approaches (Owens–Wendt (O-W) and van Oss–Chaudhury–Good (LWAB)). Additionally, Zisman’s approach (γC) was used. Results The water contact angle values were similar for Flow-Art (67.56±1.49°) and everX Flow (bulk) (68.94±2.72°) compared to higher value for everX Flow (dentin) (74.39±2.05°). SFE was in the range from 43 to 50 mJ/m^2 for O-W and from 47 to 62 mJ/m2 for LWAB. The γC was from 37 to 45 mJ/m^2. Conclusions Roughening composites’ surface influenced on increasing the CA value. All approaches of surface free energy calculations provide useful data for predicting interactions between flowable composites and dental tissues. Tested composites showed good wetting for initial state of surface after polymerization. These influence on better adhesion of the material to the bonding system during dental restoration.",

Computational schemes for the determination of reaction forces in the hip, knee and ankle joints are also reported/developed and discussed from the view-point of their effectiveness and applicability. = model of human body was developed, aimed at describing planar movements such as standing long jumps, vertical jumps and jumps down from a height, in which both the lower and upper extremities are moving parallel to each other in the sagittal plane. Since the attention is focused on lower limb control and loadings, a hybrid model of the control u that creates movements in the k = 8 joints of the musculoskeletal system was proposed ‐ the motor control moments in the hip, knee and ankle joints are modelled by a set of mF = 15 muscle forces treated as control inputs, while the actuation in the other k ‐ 3 = 5 joints is simplified to 5 = τ m torques representing the respective muscle action.

Finite element method was used for solving the governing equations for two-dimensional, steady, laminar flow of an incompressible, non-Newtonian fluid in that geometry. The accuracy with which the governing equations were solved using the finite element method was not examined quantitatively in the present study due to a lack of published data. Numerical results were found to be in excellent agreement with Womersley theory and with laser Doppler anemometry velocity data obtained for steady flow in a human model. The distributions of the velocity profile, wall shear stress and pressure along vessel during the cardiac cycle are shown. The results were compared to known values, and peaks were found. The shape of velocity distribution is strongly disturbed by the stenosis, and disturbance is clearly evident whatever instant of the cardiac cycle was considered. The general flow features were accurately predicted based on the finite element flow model, which allows the conclusion that computational fluid dynamics can be used to facilitate improvement of the medical research of cardiovascular physiology.",

In this paper, the available risk curves of BrIC were re-evaluated with the use of reliability analysis and new risk curves were constructed for different injury types based on literature data of tissue-level tolerances. Moreover, the comparison of different injury metrics and their corresponding risk curves were performed. Methods: Tissue-level uncertainties of the effect and resistance were considered by random variables. The variability of the tissue-level predictors was quantified by the finite element reconstruction of 100 frontal crash tests which were performed in Simulated Injury Monitor environment. The applied tests were scaled to given BrIC magnitudes and the injury probabilities were calculated by Monte Carlo simulations. New risk curves were fitted to the observed results using Weibull and Lognormal distribution functions. Results: The available risk curves of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) could be slightly improved, and combined AIS 4+ risk curves were obtained by considering subdural hematoma and contusion as well. The performance of several injury metrics and their risk curves were evaluated based on the observed correlations with the tissue-level predictors. Conclusions: The cumulative strain damage measure and the BrIC provide the highest correlation (R 2 = 0.61) and the most reliable risk curve for the evaluation of DAI. Although the observed correlation is smaller for other injury types, the BrIC and the associated reliability analysis-based risk curves seem to provide the best available method for estimating the brain injury risk for frontal crash tests.",

Methods: Viscoelastic response in the low, transition and high physiologic strain (3, 6 and 9%) with consideration of simulated biological environment (0.9% saline solution, 37 °C) was measured in relaxation tests. Preconditioning of tendons was considered in the testing protocol and the applied range of load was obtained from tensile testing. The quasi-linear viscoelasticity theory was used to fit experimental data to obtain constants (moduli and times of relaxation), which can be used for description of the viscoelastic behavior of tendons. The exponential non-linear elastic representation of the stress response in ramp strain was also estimated. Results: Differences between stress relaxation process can be seen between tendons stretched to the physiological strain range (3%) and exceeding this range (6 and 9%). The strains of 6% and 9% showed a similar stress relaxation trend displaying relatively rapid relaxation for the first 70 seconds, whereas the lowest strain of 3% displayed relatively slow relaxation. Conclusions: Results of the model fitting showed that the quasi-linear viscoelastic model gives the best fit in the range of low physiological strain level.",

Methods: Single-layer (with different strut widths) and multi-layer (with a different number of struts) stent models divided into three porosity groups, with porosities of 72.3, 60.5, and 52.4%, were modeled for a comparison of their hemodynamic isolation and flexibility performance via computational fluid dynamics and finite element methods. Results: The velocity and timeaveraged wall shear stress decreased more noticeably with multi-layer stent interventions. A higher oscillatory shear index and relative residence time occurred at the aneurysmal sac wall after multi-layer stents were employed. Time-averaged wall shear stress on the aneurysmal wall decreased with an increase in the number of struts or a decrease in pore size, but oscillatory shear index and relative residence time increased as the number of struts increased or the pore size decreased. Besides, all stents affect the branch patency slightly. In the bending test, when the porosity exceeded 60.5%, multi-layer stents were more flexible. Conclusion: The number of struts or pore size of stent dominated the isolation in the management of the aneurysm and affected the flexibility significantly when the porosity was below 60.5%. These findings may contribute to the special design of the stent in the treatment of such types of aneurysms.",

This design was firstly investigated numerically, realizing a Finite Element Model of the device anchored to two swine tendons stumps, to simulate its application on a severed tendon. Two different hook designs, both bio-inspired, were tested while retaining the same device geometry and anchoring strategy. Then, the applicability of a 3D-printed prototype was tested on swine tendons. Finally, the device-tendon stumps ensemble was subjected to uniaxial tensile tests.The results show that the investigated device enables a better load distribution during the immobilized limb period in comparison to standard suture-based approaches, yet it still presents several design flaws.The current implantable solutions do not ensure an optimal result in terms of strength recovery.

Methods: The peculiarity of the dental organ is emphasised, associated with a specific autonomic environment, next to the external environment, resulting from the impact of the organism on the dental organ. The autonomic environment increases the number of relations between elements in the dental organ and hinders its examination. Results: The characteristics of the dental organ are described. Its main elements, their properties, and the relationships between them are identified, and the system’s functions, inputs and outputs are presented. The systems approach addresses these difficulties, enabling the analysis of the dental organ and its tribological characteristics. Conclusions: The dental organ has an “autonomic” environment, which significantly increases the number of tribological relationships and complicates their analysis. Knowledge of the tribological attributes of the dental organ can be useful in studying detailed aspects of the function of the dental organ.

Both implants were evaluated in vitro with the use of porcine femur (6 bones for each implant). ARAMIS vision system was used to measure strains in selected area of bone shaft, generated when putting an axial load on the implants to simulate static load bearing exercises performed during rehabilitation activities in primary stabilisation.Obtained maps revealed high concentrations of strains, located near to distal part of the implant, during using a typical press-fit design with relatively low strain around the implant's shaft. In the case of proposed design, noticeable strains occurred in the entire examined area of bone, with stronger concentration towards the proximal direction.Presented experimental results suggest that proposed design provides more appropriate implant-bone load transfer than typically used press-fit design.

Methods: The tests involved the analysis of a total of 60 expressive elements of modern dance performed by 5 soloists. The tests involved the recording of the vertical component of GRF (GRFz) vector using Kistler platform in the landing phase following the performance of modern dance jumps.

After each performance, the dancers watched a course of GRF and films showing the recorded landing phase. Results: Applying of a proposed didactic laboratory session led to: extension of contact time and of time preceding the obtainment of the maximum value of GRFz, reduction of the maximum values of the vertical components of the GRF, reduction of the loading rate of the ground reaction force, increase of an impulse of the vertical component of GRF in the entire stance phase and in the shock absorption phase.

Conclusions: Presence of a decreased handheld dynamometry-mass normalized-hamstring strength result at hyper-flexion after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in men may indicate self-reported knee function disorder",

Radial head arthroplasty is an alternative way of the treatment. As the implantation could end up with complications, thus new and better designs are constantly looked for. One of such designs is modal/bipolar radial head endoprosthesis. The aim of this paper is to assess the functional outcome following the implantation of this endoprosthesis using movement analysis system. Seven patients participated in the study: 5 after implantation of endoprosthesis and 2 after surgical reconstruction of the radial head. The upper extremity movements with EMG were assessed during gait and pronation/supination movements with and without the external load. The functional abilities of patients with radial head endoprosthesis do not differ from those of the patients after the elbow reconstruction. This allows the patients normal, daily activity, with no restrictions and pain.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the growth and the changes in the shape of a femoral head in dog puppies with dislocated and unstable hip joints. Ten 5-week-old, mountain shepherd puppies were divided into two subgroups. In five animals, the femoral head was dislocated, and in the other five dogs, femoral head was reduced after the dislocation procedure, making the joint congruent but unstable. After 4 weeks the animals were euthanised. The optical method of contour measurement of the femoral head sphericity was used. The shape of the dislocated femoral head differed from the normal one. The medial part was extended into beard-like form. The overgrowth of the femoral heads was significant and from 38% to 61% larger compared with the normal contralateral head. The unstable head of the second group did not differ in the shape nor in its size from the contralateral normal one. The large adaptive and deforming changes of shape in the dislocated femoral heads in our study show the pronounced malformation of the joint. The shape of beard-like deformity may be explained by the enlargement of contact surface between the medial part of the head and illiac bone. The restricting modelling role of the acetabulum, the minor vascular impairment during the surgery and the short time of follow-up were possible factors contributing to the minimal changes of the affected femoral head in the unstable but congruent hip joint.",

This study aimed to assess the local hemodynamic alterations in VA-ECMO patients through simulation analyses. Methods: In this study, a 0D-3D multiscale model was developed, wherein resistance conditions were employed to define the flow-pressure relationship. An idealized model was employed for the aorta, and simulations were conducted to contrast the hemodynamics supported by two configurations: VA-ECMO combined with IABP, and VA-ECMO combined with Impella. Results: In relation to VA-ECMO alone, the combination treatment had the following differences: (1) overall mean mass flow rate increased significantly when combined with Impella and did not change significantly when combined with IABP. Blood flow pulsatility was the strongest in ECMO + IABP, and blood flow pulsatility was significantly suppressed in ECMO + Impella; (2) for all arterial inlets, HI was decreased with ECMO + Impella and increased with ECMO + IABP; (3) the flow field did not change much with ECMO + IABP, with better blood flow compliance, whereas the flow field was relatively more chaotic and disorganized with ECMO + Impella; (4) the difference between shear stress values in ECMO + IABP and ECMO alone was small, and ECMO + Impella (P6) had the largest shear stress values. Conclusions: Variances in hemodynamic efficacy between VA-ECMO combined with IABP and VA-ECMO combined with Impella may underlie divergent prognoses and complications. The approach to ventricular unloading during ECMO and the degree of support should be meticulously tailored to individual patient conditions, as they represent pivotal factors influencing vascular complications.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study explores how thoracic orientation affects lung pressure and injury outcomes from shock waves, building on earlier research that suggested human posture impacts injury severity. Methods: A layered finite element model of the chest was constructed based on the Chinese Visual Human Dataset (CVH), including the rib and intercostal muscle layers. The dynamic response of the chest under 12 different angle-oriented shock waves under incident pressures of 200 kPa and 500 kPa was calculated. The correspondence between lung pressure at various angles, chest wall motion velocity and lung stress, and differences in pressure/stress of lung tissue behind ribs and intercostal muscle were analyzed. Results: The dynamic response of the chest can be roughly divided into four processes. High local intrapulmonary pressure areas were primarily in the anterior lobe margin and the lung's central region. A 500 kPa incident wave at 0° could cause slight lung injury, whereas at 240°, the pressure was non-harmful. Lung tissue pressure and stress induced by chest wall movement were significantly higher behind the intercostal muscles than behind the ribs, with a difference of about 2-3 times. Conclusions: This layered model provides a cost-effective tool for large-scale shock wave impact simulations on the chest. Chest wall movement velocity strongly correlates with lung stress distribution. The significant density and sound velocity differences among ribs, intercostal muscles and lungs cause an acoustic impedance mismatch, leading to \"striped bleeding\" marks in post-impact lungs. This research enhances understanding of chest and lung injury mechanisms and informs the development of protective measures.",

Despite extensive research into its material properties, the impact of solution environments on the mechanical behaviour of brain tissue remains limited. This knowledge gap affects the biofidelity of head modelling. This study aimed to investigate the effect of solution environments on brain tissue under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. Methods Porcine brain tissue was characterized in compression through quasi-static nonlinear testing and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis under various environments: air, physiological saline, and artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Frequencies from 0.1 to 40 Hz were applied to determine dynamic behaviour, while brain samples were compressed up to a 0.3 strain level to obtain nonlinear response. The effects of strain, frequency, and solution environment on the mechanical response of brain tissue were statistically evaluated. Results As environmental conditions transitioned from air to artificial cerebrospinal fluid, the average stress of brain tissue increased by approximately 1.3, 1.3, and 1.4 times at strain levels of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. A statistically significant increase in dynamic storage and loss moduli was observed between air and artificial cerebrospinal fluid environments. At frequencies above 18 Hz, the tan delta in air was significantly lower. Conclusions The mechanical characterization of brain tissue exhibited a dependency on solution environment under both quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. Brain tissue showed higher stress levels and dynamic modulus in solution environments compared to an air environment. The results of this study are valuable for improving head simulations and brain material models.",

Methods The study involved 44 men, aged 30 to 50 years, practising long-distance running. Two rounds of tests were conducted in the Laboratory of Biokinetics of the AWF in Cracow. The first measurements were carried out in January 2020, and the second ones - after a 6-month therapeutic intervention in July 2020. The measurements of the distribution of foot pressure on the ground in static conditions and during barefoot running were performed with the use of the FOOTSCAN 7.111 podobarographic platform. Parameters showing the distribution of pressure in the individual foot areas and the trajectory of force distribution during the contact of feet with the ground were measured. Results After the completion of the physiotherapy protocol, the FAI group differed significantly from the n-FAI group in relation to the Max F range in the areas of the first, fourth and fifth metatarsal bones and as far as the impulse in the areas of the first, fourth, and fifth metatarsal bones and in the big toe area. Conclusions A comparison of the results of the first and second run of tests showed more positive changes in the FAI group than in the n-FAI group. This demonstrates a favourable effect of the conservative physiotherapy protocol in people with FAI – it can be an effective alternative to the surgical treatment.",

Results The VORT for the COM and the swing foot in the anteroposterior direction were significantly lower at slow speeds than at normal speeds. The VORT of task-relevant segment angles affecting COM control in the vertical direction was significantly higher at slow speed compared to normal speed. Additionally, the ΔV in segment angle variance impacting swing foot control in the anteroposterior direction was significantly greater at slow speed than at normal speed. Conclusions The findings suggest that descending stairs at reduced speed promotes enhanced coordination of lower limb segments for controlling the swing foot in the anteroposterior direction, while concurrently increasing segmental variability that destabilizes the vertical COM.",

Results The transmissibility from the floor to the headrest frame, the cushion surface, the headrest surface, the seat back frame, and the seat back surface all exhibited a principal peak frequency within 4-5 Hz. With the exception of the cushion frame, the principal peak frequency and the peak transmissibility in transmissibilities to all positions decreased with increasing vibration amplitude, indicating the non-linearity within the occupant-seat system. It was also found modifying seat track positions minimally affected the seat transmissibility to either the surface or the frame of the seat. Conclusions Polyurethane foam amplified vibration at peak frequency, simultaneously enhancing static sitting comfort and reducing the vertical vibration transmission above peak frequency.",

This study addresses the computational cost and complexity associated with traditional viscoelastic models by incorporating neural network algorithms, thereby augmenting the predictive capability of soft tissue modeling. Methods To address these challenges, the present study proposes a novel biomechanical modeling approach. The approach establishes a relaxation prediction model based on the backpropagation (BP) neural network and optimizes it using an enhanced sparrow search algorithm (ISSA). This hybrid method leverages the dynamic characteristics of forceps to predict the relaxation force of soft tissues more accurately. The ISSA optimizes the model by integrating chaos mapping, nonlinear inertia weight, and vertical-horizontal crossover strategy, which helps overcome the issue of local optima and boosts the predictive performance. Results The experimental results demonstrated that the R² values reached 0.9956 for the pig kidney and 0.9896 for the pig stomach, indicating the model's exceptional precision in predicting relaxation forces. Conclusions The relaxation force prediction model based on ISSA-BP neural network provides excellent predictive performance, offering a new and effective strategy for biomechanical modeling of soft tissues in virtual surgical systems.",

This increases high demand on implant manufacturing due to the uniqueness of each patient’s anthropometry. Which creates a surge in the implant design and its performance study. This work employed finite element analysis to evaluate the efficacy of Interbody cage fusion in combination with different biostructures and biomaterials. Methods The Lumbar Model was created by incorporating a surgical implant cage that featured three different lattice architectures using Boolean operations. We constructed four models, one model that was not altered and three models that underwent surgical procedures. The surgical models consist of three types of lattice implants are Double Diamond (DD), Double Diamond Centre Support (DDCS), Double Diamond Side Support (DDSS). Results The results indicate that the Double Diamond (DD) lattice-structured polyether ether ketone (PEEK) material implant experiences the most deformation, measuring 0.67 mm, when subjected to axial rotation motion. An analysis indicates the implant made with the DDCS lattice structure and Ti-6Al-4V material is subjected to the least stress – it stood at 75.47 MPa as the smallest stress level recorded. Conclusions The result of endplate von mises stress shows the PEEK material with DDCS lattice structured implant have low stress. Ti-6Al-4V and Stainless steel having high stress of 20 MPa on endplates. Comparatively Ti-6Al-4V having very good response with literature data.

This study aims to investigate the effects of different backpack loads on shoulder strap tension during walking and running, using a spring-loaded shock-absorbing backpack. Methods Fifteen healthy male adolescents participated in the study. Each carried a backpack with loads of 3.5 kg, 7 kg, and 10.5 kg while walking at 2 m/s and running at 4 m/s. Shoulder strap tension was measured using custom-made tension sensors, and kinematic data were collected with a 3D motion capture system. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) was applied to analyze tension variations across different gait phases. Results Shoulder strap tension increased significantly with heavier loads during both walking and running (p &lt; 0.001). The tension varied throughout the gait cycle, with distinct patterns observed between walking and running. During walking, tension peaked at mid-stance, while in running, tension decreased during the absorption phase and increased sharply during propulsion. Significant differences between 7 kg and 10.5 kg loads were noted at specific gait intervals (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Backpack load significantly influences shoulder strap tension, with variations closely linked to gait phases. These findings highlight the importance of ergonomic backpack design, particularly for reducing shoulder strain in adolescents.",

This issue has only been described to a small degree among adolescent swimmers. The objective is to determine kinematic differences in various parts of the swimming start to the front crawl among adolescent swimmers performing a start with flat (FT) or deep underwater trajectory (DT). Methods The study comprised 32 male swimmers aged 16-19 (average World Aquatics score=556±88 points). The trials were recorded using two cameras (above- and underwater). A kinematic analysis of the time from start to attain 5m was performed. Results The maximum submersion depth was 0.94±0.09 m (FT) and 1.21±0.11m (DT). Between-group differences were observed for FT and DT, respectively, in: attack angle at the submersion (38.37±6.85° and 44.90±6.08°), the distance of maximum submersion depth (5.24±0.36m and 5.58±0.50m) and underwater angles of attack during submersion (angle of the shoulders at the of submersion: 29.40±3.90° and 34.30±4.14°, angle of the hips at the submersion: 21.70±4.52° and 26.49±5.05°). Conclusions It was found that swimmers can successfully use different start variants. The underwater trajectory is primarily influenced by the body position at the moment the fingers contact with the water and during submersion, and not only by the manner of performing the push-off. The authors conclude that the characteristics of the start should not be based on one variable or its selected start phase - the description of the technique should comprise a set of kinematic indices from its different parts.",

No consensus has been reached in the literature reviewed, as concerns the impact of posture defects upon the occurrence of muscle imbalance, faster development of degenerative changes in the joints, and pain intensity. Thus, it needs to be defined clearly in which cases the diagnosis of (LPHC) asymmetry in adults provides the basis for starting rehabilitation. The aim of the study is to determine whether in the case of this asymmetry changes in the viscoelastic and biomechanical properties of LPHC muscles occur. Methods The study comprised 64 adults, divided into two groups on the basis of physical examination: pelvic symmetrical (n=34),and pelvic asymmetrical (n=30). Myotonometric measurements of output parameters: tension, stiffness and elasticity were carried out to assess the mechanical properties of LPHC muscles in both groups. Results Tension, stiffness and elasticity of the examined muscles, namely: abdominal muscles, rectus femoris muscle, erector muscle of the spine, and biceps femoris muscle were measured; the pelvic symmetrical group, and the pelvic asymmetrical group did not differ with statistical significance as regards the comparison between the left and right sides of the body of the subjects. Also, no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of pain were found between the study groups . Conclusions Our findings have important clinical implications. The asymmetry of LPHC, commonly diagnosed in adults during functional examination for the purpose of physiotherapy, should not provide the basis for starting rehabilitation, in the absence of pain.",

This study analyzed the effects of different factors on the chest response of far-side occupants in oblique side impacts. Methods In this study, a simplified sled model was developed. After that, five factors, namely, impact velocity, impact angle, seat friction coefficient, seatbelt friction coefficient, and seatbelt force-limiting were considered as uncertain variables and randomly sampled. Sixteen sets of impact simulations with different parameters were performed using the sampled results to evaluate the farside occupant chest response. Results Results showed that the impact velocity was positively correlated with the chest deflection and chest acceleration, with correlation coefficients 0.77 and 0.92, respectively, and the impact angle was negatively correlated with the chest deflection and chest acceleration, with correlation coefficients -0.83 and -0.54, respectively. The seatbelt friction coefficient and force limiting value were positively and negatively correlated with the occupant’s chest response, respectively.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Toe flexor strength (TFS) has been determined to evaluate the toe flexor muscle function. However, it is unclear how strength and size relationships of toe flexor muscles vary depending on the toes intended for force production. We aimed to clarify this by examining the relationship between TFS and toe flexor muscle size, and hypothesized TFS produced by all toes (TFS-All), the great toe (TFS-Great) and lesser toes (TFS-Lesser) would be specifically associated with the size of the muscles specialized in each corresponding toe flexion. Methods: The maximal anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSAmax) of each toe flexor muscle was measured by magnetic resonance imaging in twenty healthy young men. The three types of TFS were measured using a custom-made toe push dynamometer. Results: TFS-All was significantly associated with ACSAmax of the adductor hallucis transverse head (ADDH-TH) (r = 0.58, P = 0.01) and flexor hallucis brevis (FHB) (r = 0.56, P = 0.01). TFS-Great and TFS-Lesser were not significantly correlated with ACSAmax of any analyzed muscles, except for a significant correlation between TFS-Lesser and dorsal/plantar interosseous muscle (r = 0.48, P = 0.03). Conclusions: The size of two plantar intrinsic foot muscles, FHB, anatomically specialized for the great toe flexion, and ADDH-TH, supplementary flex the great toe, may be the determinant for TFS-All. However, TFS-Great and TFS-Lesser are not associated with the size of the muscles anatomically specialized in each corresponding toe flexion, perhaps due to difficulty in maximally and separately activating individual muscles (i.e., neural/anatomical reasons) during the TFS-Great and TFS-Lesser production.",

The present study aims to elucidate the influence of two different sintering methods on fluoride-substituted apatite properties. Methods: For this purpose, a two F-substituted apatites were produced by heat treatment in different ways called \"rapid sintering\" and \"slow sintering\". Physicochemical properties of the obtained materials were analyzed using infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Cytotoxicity of materials was assessed using MTT test. Results: Sintering conditions significantly influenced some porosity parameters of the materials. The samples subjected to \"rapid sintering\" showed a larger total pore area and mercury intrusion volume, while the samples subjected to \"slow sintering\" showed higher average pore diameter. Other porosity parameters did not differ significantly between the tested materials. The crystalline phases and chemical compositions of both materials were the same. Both materials appeared to be non-toxic since their extracts did not caused reduction in the viability of MC3T3-E1 cells compared to control cells and the results obtained were similar for both materials. Conclusions: Sintering is an important step in the apatite synthesis process. The way apatite is sintered is a factor that influences its physicochemical properties. The study performed on fluoride-substituted apatite showed that sintering conditions influenced some porosity parameters but had no effect on composition, chemical structure or crystalline phase. The cytotoxicity of both materials was at the same level, indicating that both were non-toxic.",

    "abstract": "From a current perspective, it is understood that body posture is influenced by individual asymmetries, cultural context, habitual body patterns, etiological factors and psychosocial factors allocated to the individual. Clarifying the musculoskeletal cause that originated the postural alteration is considered the clinical challenge in the treatment of pain or discomfort. Recent studies have shown the influence of changes in body weight on the distribution of plantar pressure and foot pain, emphasizing the importance of understanding these relationships. Integrating body composition with plantar pressure analysis presents an opportunity to explore gender differences and their associations with plantar pressure distribution. There is currently a lack of research integrating body composition, plantar pressure distribution and gender comparison to elucidate the complex interaction between these variables. Therefore, the main objective of this investigation is to evaluate body composition through BIA (bioimpedance) and the distribution of plantar pressure in the subjects' feet through pressure platform analysis with a specific focus on comparisons between the genders and the associations between these variables. The study employed an observational cross-sectional design. A total of 77 participants (n = 77) aged between 18 and 91 years were assessed, the majority of whom were female (n = 53, 68.83%), while 24 participants (n = 24, 31.17%) were male. The average age of the participants was 60.717 years for males and 54.33 years for females. Baropodometry and bioimpedance tests were carried out. Significant differences with a medium effect were recorded only for the three indicators, while the rest of the values showed a large effect. Significant negative correlations were found between age and height ( p < 0.05) and positive correlations between age and other factors such as BMI, fat mass, lean mass and various foot-related metrics. The results of this study showed that plantar pressure characteristics differ according to gender and are related to body composition and pain level.",

Results: Before rehabilitation, the average values of PROM ( p = 0.006), AROM ( p = 0.005), FROM average ( p < 0.001) and maximal velocity ( p < 0.001), JPS 30° ( p = 0.002), JPS 60° ( p = 0.002) and JPS 80° ( p < 0.001) were significantly worse in the paretic limb than in healthy people. The applied rehabilitation contributed to improving the PROM and AROM and the average and maximum speed of rapid movement in the knee joint. Proprioception (JPS) also improved. Only the average ( p < 0.001) and maximum speed ( p < 0.001) in the FROM test in the knee joint of the paretic limb after rehabilitation significantly differed from the values in healthy people. The patients' performance (functional tests) improved after rehabilitation (TUG ( p < 0.001) and FTSST ( p < 0.001)), but it did not reach the level of healthy people. Conclusions: The function of the knee joint in the paretic limb is significantly impaired and requires inclusion in the therapy plan in the early period after stroke.",

    "abstract": "Soccer is a sport being performed in a very dynamic manner. It requires soccer players to be able to develop high muscle force in a very short period of time. The aim of the study was to evaluate the strength and jumping abilities of young soccer players playing in different positions on the field. The study included 49 adolescent soccer players: 6 goalkeepers, 15 defenders, 17 midfielders and 11 strikers. We measured peak torques (PT), total work (TW), and average power (AP) developed by the knee flexors and extensors under isokinetic conditions at angular velocities of 60°⋅s-1, 180°⋅s-1 and 300°⋅s-1 on a Biodex dynamometer, and jump height (H) and maximum power (P max) on a force plate. PT, AP, TW, and P max scores were normalized relative to body mass. There were no statistically significant differences between measurements of basic somatic characteristics (body height and body weight), age and biological age as well as PT, AP, TW, H, and P max in players from different positions on the field. Unlike defenders, midfielders showed a significant correlation of isokinetic tests indices with jump height (r = 0.54÷0.84) and maximum relative power (r = 0.55÷0.76). The differences in correlations are probably due to the different tasks and activities that players in different positions on the field perform during the game.",

A typical accident (minivan-toeBike) from the FASS database was selected for accident reconstruction. WordSID thorax module has been employed to evaluate e-Bike rider thorax injuries and its kinematic difference has been investigated as well. The e-Bike rider was simulated by THUMS (Total Human Model for Safety). The kinematic data of THUMS thorax obtained from the accident reconstruction were used as the boundary conditions of WorldSID dummy thorax to simulate the collision between thorax and accident vehicle, and the deflection of WorldSID dummy thorax was outputted and compared with THUMS rib deflection. The accident reconstruction results using the THUMS model match the human thorax injury conditions. The WorldSID thorax module can effectively replicate the motion of the thorax and predict thorax injury conditions in the minivan-to-eBike collision, but it does not reflect the bending of the spine during the e-Bike rider impact process, nor does it consider the impact of forces on the head, neck, and lower limbs. Therefore, further improvements are still necessary.",

Methods: Modal analysis, harmonic response analysis and transient dynamics of a full spine model inverted by the finite element method using Abaqus. Results: The first-order axial resonance frequency of 4.51 Hz produced a maximum axial displacement of 30.15 mm. Comparison of the five frequencies indicated that the 10 Hz frequency response curve was smoothest, while the amplitude-frequency curve at 4 Hz showed the greatest fluctuations accompanied by resonance phenomena. At the resonance frequency, the maximum axial displacement of the thoracic spine was at T1, being 31.17 mm, while that of the lumbar spine was at L1, with 0.56 mm. The maximum stress of the intervertebral discs was located between T4 and T5, representing 3.496 MPa, the maximum stress in the small joints was located in the concavity between T7 and T8, with 19.97 MPa and the maximum axial displacement was 54.31 mm, located in the convexity between T6 and T7. Conclusions: The first-order axial resonance frequency was the most harmful to the patient. The uneven stress distribution in the spine was closely related to the degree of spinal deformity, with the thoracic spine being more sensitive to low frequencies than the lumbar spine. The concave side of the spinal deformity was more prone to stress concentrations while the convex side was more prone to deformity, indicating that disc degeneration and small-joint disease are more likely to occur at the most deformed part of the spine.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Measuring the pedal force vector during bicycle pedaling has recently become easy, and research has been conducted using mechanical efficiency (the ratio of an effective driving force to total pedaling force); however, the relationships between these forces were not considered. This study aimed to show that the relationship between these forces can be linearly regressed under gradually increasing load conditions and propose that the slope parameter can serve as a new index for evaluating pedaling skills. Methods Twenty-eight participants performed the experiment in which the load was increased every minute until the maximum load was exerted. Using sensors installed on both bicycle cranks, the pedaling force vector was divided into tangential and radial components to determine the total pedaling and effective driving forces per minute. The maximum load force and efficiency index were calculated. Results The results showed a strong linear relationship (coefficient of determination: 0.982, 95 % CI 0.909–0.996) between the total pedaling and effective driving force. The slope parameters from this regression exhibited significant correlations (-0.560 and -0.674) with the maximum load force and efficiency index during maximum exertion, respectively. These correlations highlight the slope parameter potential for capturing pedaling characteristics. Conclusions Conclusively, the slope parameter derived from the linear regression between the total pedaling force and effective driving force reflects individual pedaling characteristics. This parameter stands out as a promising new index for evaluating pedaling motion, offering insights into participant-specific pedaling behaviors. Consequently, this novel index could be instrumental in assessing and analyzing pedaling skills.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Critical-size bone defects (CSBD) are a serious challenge in current orthopaedics. Natural healing processes are insufficient, leading to complications such as muscle atrophy, joint stiffness, impaired limb function and reduced quality of life. Currently used autologous or allogeneic bone grafts have disadvantages, such as long surgery time, secondary injuries and immunological reactions. A promising alternative in the treatment of CSBD is the use of a scaffold. The key element of the effective use of scaffolds is their proper anchoring in the bone defect. The article presents numerical analyses of the effectiveness of selected anchoring methods of the scaffold in the bone. Methods Scaffolds were placed in a 60 mm long CSBDs. Four methods of anchoring the scaffold in the bone were selected: locking plate, external ring, intramedullary nail and double anti-rotation wedge. A simulation of the forces generated during the entire gait cycle was performed. The parameters obtained were: Huber Mises Hencky (HMH) max stress, strain energy density (SED), sliding distance, frictional stress and bone-scaffold gap. Results Based on the conducted research, it was determined that the most effective of the evaluated solutions, in terms of load transfer, were the use of external ring or double anti-rotation wedge. Conclusions The conducted research confirm that in the treatment of CSBD, an effective solution is the use of a scaffold, which effectiveness can be improved with appropriate anchoring method.",

Methods The research sample consisted of 16 men aged 21.6±0.62 years. The tests were conducted at 02:00,10:00,18:00,22:00, included measurements of bioelectric tension (sEMG) of the vastus lateralis muscle of the right and left limbs during maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVC), the Jumping test—vertical jump with (CMJ) and without arm swing (ACMJ), a 10-second cycle ergometer test. The tests were repeated after 24 hours. Results The level of bioelectric tension recorded during MVC did not show significant circadian variability. However, in dynamic exercises, significant variability (p&lt;0.05) in bioelectric tension of the muscle of the left limb during the CMJ was observed between 22:00 and 18:00. A tendency to achieve higher average amplitude values was observed at 10:00 in both limbs, with the lowest values observed at 02:00 am.

At the same time it assures mechanical protection of the tissues situated beneath. This study aimed to clarify the comprehensive mechanical properties and microscopic structure of human fascia lata to understand its mechanical behaviour better. Methods The pathologically unchanged fascia lata used in this study were collected post-mortem from adult males of different age. The mechanical properties of the samples were determined under the uniaxial tensile test in two directions (longitudinal and transverse to collagen bundles arrangement). The structure observations were performed using a light and scanning electron microscope. Results The mechanical tests have shown the anisotropic properties of the examined tissue. The values of the particular mechanical parameters were determined. The maximum failure force, stiffness coefficient, tensile strength, and Young's modulus values were higher for longitudinal than transversal samples. Before the uniaxial tensile test, the collagen bundles within each layer of examined samples were aligned parallel to each other, showing a regular, wavy architecture (crisped pattern). The elastin fibres within these layers were much less numerous than collagen fibres. The applied mechanical forces disrupted the intact, regular collagen pattern, making the majority of collagen bundles loosely and irregularly oriented. Conclusions Knowledge of the mechanical and structural properties of the human fascia lata is an important issue in the context of clinical applications, tissue engineering as well as numerical modelling.",

Multiscale models make it possible to study bone remodeling, inducing bone adaptation by using information of bone multiple scales.

This technique is capable to define the homogenized microscale mechanical properties of the trabecular bone highly heterogeneous medium. Methods: In this work, a morphology - based fabric tensor and a set of anisotropic phenomenological laws for bone tissue was used, in order to define the bone micro-scale mechanical properties. To validate the developed methodology, several examples were performed in order to analyze its numerical behavior. Thus, trabecular bone and fabricated benchmarks patches (representing special cases of trabecular bone morphologies) were analyzed under compression. Results: The results show that the developed technique is robust and capable to provide a consistent material homogenization, indicating that the homogeneous models were capable to accurately reproduce the micro-scale patch mechanical behavior. Conclusions: The developed method has shown to be robust, computationally less demanding and enabling the authors to obtain close results when comparing the heterogeneous models with equivalent homogenized models. Therefore, it is capable to accurately predict the micro-scale patch mechanical behavior in a fraction of the time required by classic homogenization techniques.",

Recognition of the function-structure interrelation in foot at the early stage of valgus alignment of first metatarsophalangeus joint (1stMTPJ) would help explain the etiology of HV. Methods: The frequency of weight-shifting patterns during walking and the body mass index (BMI) were assessed relative to goniometric measurements of the 1stMTPJ angle in adolescents. Weight-shifting patterns were identified with a plantar pressure analysis, performed with the Gaitline-Maxline Distance method. Results: As the 1stMTPJ angle widened, the frequency distributions of identified weight-shifting patterns became increasingly lopsided, due to the favoring or disfavoring of one pattern at the expense of the other. The two sexes showed opposite trends in the weight-shifting patterns that were favored/disfavored, relative to participants with a 0º 1stMTPJ angle. The clear predominance of a central-shift pattern, at the expense of a medial-shift, occurred with the largest (20º) 1stMTPJ angle among girls. Additionally, the BMI distributions associated with 1stMTPJ angle characteristics showed opposite trends between the sexes. Conclusions: Valgus alignment of 1stMTPJ among adolescents were associated with limitations in weight-shifting freedom of the foot during walking, that could be involved in maintaining balance. An 1stMTPJ angle of 20º, where distinct limitations were observed, might serve as a criterion of HV pathology.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The optimal execution of decompressive craniectomy in terms of the size and location of the skull opening is not straightforward. Our main goals are twofold: (1) constructing a design optimization method which can be applied to determine optimal skull opening for individual patient-specific cases and (2) performing a large-scale parametric optimization study to give some guidance in general about the optimal skull opening in case of oedematous brain tissue. Methods: A large number of virtual experiments performed by finite element simulations were applied to determine tendencies of tissue behaviour during surgery. The multiobjective optimization is performed by Goal Programming and Physical Programming methods. Results: Our results show that the postoperative pressure has an approximately linear dependence on the preoperative pressure and the skull opening area, while the damaged brain volume could have a more complex nonlinear dependence on the input data. Based on the averaged results of the parametric optimization study, the optimal skull opening has been determined in the function of the preoperative pressure and the relative importance of the pressure reduction. These results show that the optimal size of the unilateral skull opening is usually between 130–180 cm 2 and these openings are more beneficial than the currently analysed bifrontal openings. Conclusions: The optimal skull opening is patient-specific and depends on several input data. The presented methodology can be applied to optimize surgery based on these input parameters for different injury types. Based on the results of large-scale parametric study generally applicable approximate results have been provided.",

Methods: A total of 88 human brain aneurysm specimens of 41 patients obtained from surgery were processed in this work based on the tests performed by the authors in a previous project. A novel algorithm was proposed and applied in this work to fit stress–stretch ratio curves for multiple measurement data using constrained optimization with hard conditions to comply with known mechanical behaviour. Results: The method produced parameters of stretch ratio–stress curves for a number of groups of the specimens representing the average as well as the extreme stresses, separately for male and female subsamples. Stretch range both in compression and in tension up to rupture was covered and material stability for the entire range was also verified. Conclusions: The fitted curves with recommended range of validity are directly applicable to numerical finite element or coupled simulations of aneurysms supporting preventive medical treatment or decision making",

Methods: The wear of friction joints in two lubricating solutions (acidic sodium lactate and distilled water) at stabilized temperature T = 38 C was studied. The wear of the polymeric cords was investigated through analyses of the chemical composition of the surface of the cords and microscopic examinations of the changes occurring on this surface.

Results: Metallic particles were found to be present in both lubricating solutions at each stage of the friction process. The largest amount of metallic particles was recorded after 5000 motion cycles. Conclusions: The presence of metallic wear products is an evidence of the wear of the harder metal rod due to its friction against the PE-UHMW cord.

This type of sliding joint is applied in spine stabilization systems that enable the treatment of early-onset idiopathic scoliosis. Methods: The friction tests included force measurements, followed by the determination of static and kinetic friction coefficients as a function of the number of the performed movement cycles, and static friction coefficient with regards to the string tension force FN in the range of 50–300 N. Additionally, the surface roughness and microscopic observations of the metal rods were made. The friction measurements were carried out at a stabilized temperature T = 38 °C in the presence of distilled water and acidic sodium lactate. Results: The measurements confirmed the impact of both the number of completed movement cycles and the value of the force loaded on the cord on the static friction coefficient. Similar values of kinetic friction force occur for the pairs with the titanium alloys rods, as well as for the pairs with the steel and CoCr rod. The type of lubricant affected the obtained measurement results unevenly: (Ti6Al4V and Ti6Al7Nb – slight impact, steel 316L and CoCrMo – large impact). During microscopic observations, numerous wear products, were visible, including harder than the base material large conglomerates. Conclusions: Susceptibility of polymer fibres results in its increased resistance to wear, but it can be also combined with an increase in wear of the surface of the metal rod.",

Methods: Sixteen males were considered (mean ± SD, age = 36.12 ± 6.40 years). Two familiarization sessions and one evaluation session were carried out where three force protocols were executed in the VL, one of them was isometric load (P1) and two of dynamic load (P2 and P3). SmO2 [%] and Hgb [g/dL] were measured before and after each of these protocols. For P1, three series of 8 s of maximum isometric strength with the rest of 60 s between each set, the average isometric strength (AIS), and the isometric peak strength (IPS) were also recorded. After five minutes, P2 was performed, with an initial load of 40% of AIS. Then, at 30 minutes, P3 was performed considering an initial load of 40% of IPS. Results: The results suggest (I) minimum levels of SmO2 (66.31 ± 9.38%) and Hgb (12.22 ± 0.55 g/dL) during P2, (II) no significant differences were observed between the average loads of the respective protocols for SmO2 and (III) muscle Hgb differed significantly between rest with P1 and P3. Conclusions: Exercises of increasing intensity and of short duration do not significantly modify SmO2. However, Hgb increases substantially compared baseline values.",

Bioelectrical activity of the right (R) and left (L) UT, LT, SA muscles was assessed during the following movements: elevation, flexion, abduction in the scapular and right coronal planes of the dominant (right) arm accompanied by three cervical spine positions (neutral, right rotation, left rotation).

Methods Thirty-two young, healthy participants performed a quiet standing task (30s) on a force platform with and without light touch. COP time-series were analyzed using standard postural sway measures (range, root mean square error, velocity), COP regularity was measured with Sample entropy. Results Participants demonstrated significantly smaller postural sway with a light touch, but only in the anteroposterior direction. The amount of sway with additional tactile information in the sagittal plane reached the level of sway in the frontal plane without this information. Similarly, COP fluctuations were more irregular during light touch condition only in the anteroposterior direction, as evidenced by significantly higher Sample entropy. Furthermore, COP regularity decreased in the sagittal plane and reached level in the frontal plane without light touch. Conclusions These results suggest that postural sway is mostly controlled in the sagittal plane and that in the mediolateral direction the control is mostly automated. In conclusion, our results support the notion that the light touch provides additional information which enhances postural stabilization. Our results expand the relation between COP regularity and the attention invested in posture in the touch domain and prove that light touch, as an attentional demanding task, leads to increased COP irregularity. Nonlinear measures of signal regularity (i.e. SampEn) provide surplus insight into human postural control and can be used as an useful tool to traditional balance measures.",

Plantar pressure distribution and postural balance were examined in women after one hour of wearing high-heeled shoes. Methods Foot arch measurements were conducted using EPSR1 mats. Based on these measurements, 18 of the 19 tested women were diagnosed with significant pes cavus. Results The experiment revealed a significant reduction in the excessively high metatarsal arch of both feet. The mean load on the metatarsus measured at rest was 0.0% in both feet, and it increased by 0.6% in the left leg (p ≤ 0.022; Z = 2.293) and by 2.7% in the right leg (p ≤ 0.023; Z = 2.271). These results suggest that excessive stretching of the plantar fascia and impaired function of the short muscles of the foot lead to a temporary reduction in the arch of the foot. This phenomenon can be compared to stretching a bowstring and its return to the shortest length under static conditions. A statistical analysis of the results of stabilographic measurements revealed significant changes only in the left foot barycenter. An analysis of the ability to maintain postural balance revealed that the observed changes contributed to postural destabilization at p ≤ 0.011 and Z = 2.535. Conclusions Further research involving electromyography tests is needed to examine plantar muscle tension during isotonic contractions. The duration of the exercise-induced reduction in pes cavus should also be determined for therapeutic purposes.",

Methods Seventeen female swimmers and seventeen male swimmers of an elite swimming sports school in Poland participated in the study. The parameters that were recorded and used in the analysis were the jump height and lower limb power in jump tests. In the test of 25 meters of dolphin kick in swimming at maximum pace, the results used in the analysis were the mean values of time, velocity, power, force, and work. Results were expressed as means ± standard deviations. Descriptive statistics of the groups were then compiled to finally perform Pearson correlation calculations. Results The highest correlations occurred between lower limb power during jumps and swimming speed, especially for men in the ACMJ (r=0.5468, p=.023) and SJ (r=0.5411, r=.025) tests. Jump height was not as often and strongly correlated with swimming time and speed as lower limb power. An important observation is that no statistically significant correlations were found for lower limb power, force, and work during dolphin kick with lower limb power and jump height. Conclusions The present study showed strong correlations between the performance variables of swimmers on dry land and in water. The most important finding is that the power during all the jumps (ACMJ, SJ, CJ30s, and CMJ) was strongly correlated with the time and speed of swimming using dolphin kick.",

Methods Trabecular bone was formulated as a non-linear viscoelastic material with Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic model to describe the purely elastic response of the bone tissue. Tests of the mechanical properties of the trabecular bone, resected from the femoral head of a 56-year-old patient, were carried out with two types of indenter: the spherical tip of a diameter of 200 µm and pyramid Vickers tip with 136º between plane faces. Tests with both indenters included loading and unloading phases with no hold at peak force and with hold time t=20 s and were conducted with a maximum load P_max = 500 mN and loading/unloading rate V = 500 mN/min. Results The formulated constitutive model describes the trabecula behaviour very well. The model curves match the experimental results in the loading phase, holding period and most of the unloading ramp. The purely viscoelastic material constants are very close in value for both considered tips, but purely elastic constants differ. Conclusions The results indicate that the constitutive model based on the indentation with the Vickers tip does not cover the plastic residual deformation. When a viscoelastic response of bone is expected, a model with constants calibrated for the spherical tip should be used, and the other set of parameters values (Vickers tip) when trabeculae may undergo plastic deformation.",

All participants were subject to three test condition trials (Tr): 1) subject did not know the nature and time of perturbation (Tr1); 2) subject knew the nature of perturbation but did not know time (Tr2); 3) both the time and nature of perturbation were known precisely (Tr3). The tests resulted in the determination of muscular activity connected with a postural adjustment as well as values of pressure exerted by the forefoot on the ground, and the angle of flexion in the knee joint. Results In terms of postural adjustments it was possible to observe statistically significant differences in muscular activity between Tr1 and Tr2 refer to Tr3. No statistically significant differences were identified in all phases as regards values of forefoot pressure and those concerning the angle of flexion in the knee joint. An increase in the muscle tone before perturbation was correlated with the displacement and the velocity of the COP after perturbation. Conclusions These data indicate that knowledge of the expected time of perturbation is responsible for postural adjustment. Furthermore, muscle tone resulting from an adjustment of perturbation and responsible for the stiffening of lower limbs triggered greater displacement of the COP after perturbation.",

It was also to verify whether tannic acid (TA), a natural cross-linking agent that stabilizes collagenous tissues by different mechanism than GA, may positively influence the strength of pericardium. Methods The samples were incubated at various temperatures (4, 22, and 37°C) and GA concentration solutions (0.6%, 1.5%, 3%) for 7 days. Three series were selected and additionally cross-linked with 0.3% TA for another 7 days. Mechanical properties of cross-linked pericardium samples, i.e. ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elastic modulus (E), were measured in uniaxial tensile testing. The hyperelastic model for incompressible materials – isotropic by Ogden and anisotropic by Fung was utilized to describe the mechanical behaviour of treated pericardium. Results The temperature has influence on cross-linking effects; the lowest values of UTS were reported for specimens cross-linked at 22°C, while the mechanical properties of series treated at 4°C or 37°C were comparable. At a particular temperature of incubation, the GA concentrations have not affected the mechanical properties of tissues. The dependence between mechanical parameters and agent concentration was only observed for specimens treated with GA at 37°C. Conclusions The conditions of the cross-linking process affect the mechanical properties of the porcine pericardium. Room temperature (22°C) and the concentration of 1.5% GA were ineffective. The mechanical properties of GA-treated pericardium were improved by an additional TA cross-linking.",

Each participant repeated measurements in standing on a stable and foam surface in six test conditions: two without eye tracking with eyes open and eyes closed, and four with eye tracking: with vertical, horizontal, star, and circle moving point. Each trial lasted 30 sec.Regression analysis for the Sway Index showed that there was no impact of eye tracking on test results (p = 0.4326), although detailed analysis showed a significant impact of tracking a point moving in a circle in standing on a foam surface (p 〈 0.001).The presented results show that eye-tracking does not influence the results of the balance test with exception of eye-tracking of the circle movement in standing on a foam surface. It suggests that eye movements may affect the test results when performing more difficult balance tests.",

This study aimed to investigate the rotational moment (internal rotation and external rotation) of the knee during gait and relationship between the rotational moments of the knee and other joints, including the free moment during gait.We included 18 patients with medial meniscus tears (MM group) and 10 asymptomatic participants in this study. We performed 3D gait analysis. The internal ankle, knee, and hip rotational moments as well as free moment were compared between the groups. Additionally, we investigated correlations between rotational moments of the knee and other joints during gait.The maximal knee external rotation moment in the MM group was smaller than that in the asymptomatic group ( p = 0.04, g = 0.76); however, there were no significant differences in the maximal internal rotation moment between the groups ( p = 0.97, g = 0.02). The internal rotation (external knee external rotation) moment positively correlated with the hip internal rotation moment ( p 〈 0.01, r = 0.69) in the MM group.The internal rotation (passive knee external rotation moment) did not decrease sufficiently, and correlation was observed between moments of the knee and hip in the MM group, especially during the late stance phase of gait. Reducing these abnormal moments during gait through rehabilitation may be important in patients with medial meniscus tears to prevent rapid progression of knee osteoarthritis.",

Therefore, the aim of the study was to identify the difference in the rate of heat dissipation by vessels present in the dental pulp. Methods Freshly extracted healthy and carious teeth were cut on a diamond saw and subjected to thermographic testing. Tooth samples were heated to 45±0,5°C using a lamp. A high-resolution thermal imaging camera was used to record the series of thermograms until the samples reached a temperature of 25±0,5°C. Results Thermographic examination of healthy and cariously changed teeth revealed areas of increased tissue fluid flow combined with heat release, which may indirectly indicate the existence of vessels in these areas. On a thermal imaging camera, variations in the rate of heating or cooling across several cross-sectional sections of the same tooth indicate changes in the dental structure's density. Conclusions In caries-affected teeth, intracanalicular fluid flows are different than those of healthy teeth. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pulp vessels enabling circulation of body fluids – blood and lymphatic – increases with the intensity of inflammation. Maintaining the homeostasis of the dental pulp depends heavily on the circulation of bodily fluids within the dental organ.",

This study aimed to use a finite element model to investigate the biomechanical environment within elbow capsule and its surrounding tissues at various stages after anterior capsule injury. Methods: A finite element model of the elbow joint, incorporating muscle activation behavior, was developed to simulate elbow flexion under normal condition (no injury) and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks following anterior joint capsular injury. The model was used to analyze von Mises stress distribution and changes within the elbow tissues. Results: At no injury condition, and 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks, the stress of the anterior articular capsule at 60° flexion were 2.62, 3.87, 4.40, 4.57 and 5.24 MPa, respectively. Under normal conditions, and at 2, and 4 weeks, the ulnar cartilage attained its peak stress at 75°. In normal conditions, the highest stress in the ulnar cartilage was 1.08 MPa, amounting to 1.02 times and 1.05 times the stress observed at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. At 4 weeks, compared with 6 weeks, the stress of the anterior bundle at 15, 30, 45 and 60° was reduced by 11.1, 22.6, 37.3 and 36.1%, respectively. At 6 and 8 weeks, the peak stress in the posterior articular capsule reached 11.5 and 11.7 MPa, respectively, showing minimal variation.

Methods Pedestrian head-to-vehicle collision simulations are defined by the distributions of pedestrian head-vehicle impact boundary conditions extracted from reconstructions of real-world accidents, where finite element (FE) models of a human body head and vehicle front-end are applied. Results In general, a higher rotational speed at the instant of contacting with vehicle structures leads to a higher skull and brain injury risk: an increase of 30 rad/s in head rotational speed increases the skull fracture risk on average by 2.1-2.6 times and the AIS2+ (Abbreviated Injury Scale) brain injury risk by 1.7-2.7 times in head-hood impacts; for the contacts on the windscreen, the AIS2+ brain injury risk is below 15%, the effect of head rotational speed could be ignored, though an increase of 30 rad/s in head rotational speed leads to 1.6-2.9 times increase in AIS2+ brain injury risk. Conclusions Head rotational speed has significant influences on both skull and brain injury risk. The effect of head rotational speed is always adverse for the risk of brain injuries and hood contact induced skull fractures. However, head rotational speed has no apparent effect on the skull injury risk for head-vehicle contacts at the windscreen.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of the orientation of the articular facets on the changes occurring in individual layers of the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc under the influence of the load causing extension. Methods: Numerical simulations were performed for five configurations of the functional spinal units: physiological, with moderate tropism, severe tropism, and segments in which non-physiological orientation was modelled of both processes with different ranges. Results: It can be concluded that severe tropism causes more significant changes in intervertebral disc bulging on the physiological side of the orientation of the articular facets. Furthermore, the value of stress on articular processes increases tenfold on the side of severe tropism compared to the physiological facet joint orientation. Conclusion: Facet joint orientation plays an important role in the transfer of loads by the spine and the posterior column provides important support for the spine during extension.",

The functional reach test (FRT) is widely used as a method to assess dynamic balance. Although there are several reports on the center of pressure (COP), there are few reports on muscle activity and no studies focus on muscle co-contraction during FRT at different distances. We aimed to clarify how the differences in reach distance affect the activity of the lower limb muscles by measuring COP and muscle activity during FRT at different distances. Methods: Eighteen healthy young adults performed FRT at different distances (maximum, 75%, and 50%) and measured COP and muscle activity of tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL). Postural control variables were calculated from the COP, and mean muscle activity and muscle co-contraction index (CI) were calculated from muscle activity. Each variable was compared between the reach distance conditions and the correlation between the variable was examined. Results: Most COP variables were significantly higher as the reach distance increased. A significant increase in muscle activity and CI was similarly observed with increasing distance. There was no consistent correlation between COP variables and CI, but there was a positive correlation between TA muscle activity and CI. Conclusions: The results of the present study showed that the young people used task-specific strategies by modulating lower limb muscle contraction and varying the degree of simultaneous muscle contraction during reaching movements at different distances.",

Methods: The study included 27 women aged 20 to 25. The Zebris FDM-2 dynamographic platform was used in foot pressure measurements. The load distribution was measured in three types of orthopaedic footwear: MedSurg, MedSurgPro and OrthoWedge. The full gait cycle was recorded. The Cavanagh masks were applied to the load distribution results processed into a graphic form. The data were analysed using Statistica v.13.1. Results: In the forefoot area, i.e. the metatarsal bones and toes 1–5, the lowest loads were reported in the shoes that off-load the forefoot (0.2 N/cm 2 , p &lt; 0.001). In the area of the first to fifth metatarsal bones and the hallux, the highest load was observed in the rocker shoe, accounting for 19.7 N/cm 2 (p &lt; 0.001). For comparison, high pressure in the flat shoe was found in the area of toes 2 to 5 (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: In the area of the metatarsal and toe bones, the pressure exerted was highest in the commonly used rocker shoe. The flat shoe provides an even and uniform load in all areas of the forefoot, while this type of shoe does not significantly reduce the pressure forces on the forefoot. The shoe that was the most effective in off-loading was the forefoot off-loading shoe (OrthoWedge). Barefoot walking puts less load on the forefoot compared to the flat and rocker shoes used after orthopaedic procedures.",

Methods: Two real world vehicle-to-pedestrian crashes with detailed information were selected. Then, a pedestrian model combining the HALL model and the upper body of the 50th% Chinese dummy model and vehicle front models were developed to reconstruct the selected real world crashes, and the predictions of the simulations were analyzed together with observations from the accident data. Results: The results show that the predictions of the HALL model for pedestrian lower limb long bone fractures match well with the observation from hospital data of the real world accidents, and the predicted thresholds of bending moment for tibia and femur fracture are close to the average values calculated from cadaver test data. Analysis of injury mechanism of pedestrian lower limb in collisions indicates that the relatively sharper bumper of minivan type vehicles can produce concentrated loading to the lower leg and a high risk of tibia/fibula fracture, while the relatively sharper and lower bonnet leading edge may cause concentrate loading to the thigh and high femur fracture risk. Conclusions: The findings imply that the HALL model could be used as an effective tool for predicting pedestrian lower limb injuries in vehicle collisions and improvements to the minivan bumper and sedan bonnet leading edge should be concerned further in vehicle design.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: During the dialysis process, hemolysis is the most frequently occurring problem to solve. Titanium dioxide nanotubes (TNTs) can be considered as a material preventing hemodialysis or blood species deposition thanks to their unique properties, i.e., hydrophilicity, smooth surface, and antibacterial. The purpose of this work was the electrochemical, chemical, and morphological characteristics of the TNTs and the evaluation of the possibility of using them as filter parts in dialysis techniques. Methods: The tests were carried out on as-formed TNTs with a diameter of 50 ± 5 nm and 1000 ± 100 nm in height, and TNTs thermally modified in air atmosphere temperatures ranging from 350 to 550 C. Electrochemical and microscopic analyses were performed both in the static and dynamic system of dialysis fluid (flow rate: 250 cm 3 /min). Additionally, deposition or damage of blood cells was specified during the ex vivo dialysis experiment. Results: Obtained results proved relationship between electrochemical properties of TNTs and the method of their modification. The results demonstrated that the TNTs annealed at 450 C TNTs can be potentially applied for constructions dialysis membrane in the hemodialysis area due to their most stable stationary potential in dialysate, the highest value of impedance modulus, and the most favourable electrokinetic properties. Additionally, it was confirmed that annealed process causes improvement of corrosion resistance and protective properties for TNTs in the dialysis fluid. Conclusions: The result allowed for the conclusion that annealing is responsible for reduction of adsorption properties of TNTs, though this titanium dioxide nanotube still can be used as filter part in haemodialysis.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to evaluate postural stability on the balance platform averagely 2 years following meniscal repair.This is a retrospective, case-control comparative analysis of patients who underwent surgical repair for the isolated longitudinal traumatic meniscal tear versus matched healthy controls. The study group consisted of 30 patients (mean age 29.93 years; averagely 2.3 years after surgery) and the control group - of 30 people. Following physical examination and completion of the IKDC, and the Lysholm questionnaires, the evaluation of the postural stability using two single-leg stabilometry tests was performed. In the static test, the analyzed variables included deviations from the horizontal, vertical axes and the length of the balance path travelled. In the dynamic test, the length of the path travelled and the time to complete task were recorded. Between-limb and between-groups comparison of collected stabilometry tests were performed. Additionally, the IKDC and the Lysholm questionnaires scores were compared between the study and heathy groups.No abnormalities were found on clinical examination in the study group nor any differences between the operated and contralateral knee ( p > 0.05). In stabilometry: (1) in the study group, the operated extremity scored worse than the contralateral limb (length of path traveled in: A) static test x = 56.7 cm SD = 37.91 cm vs. x = 21.6 cm SD = 9.06 cm; p = 0.002 and B) dynamic test x = 82.57 cm, SD = 50.43 cm vs. x = 53.32 cm, SD = 13.82 cm; p = 0.003); (2) In the control group, no leg-related differences were noted ( p > 0.05); (3) Between-group comparison revealed that the study group scored worse than the control group (length of path traveled in: A) static test x = 56.7 cm, SD = 37.91 cm vs. x = 17.23 cm, SD = 3.39 cm; p = 0.001 and B) dynamic test x = 82.57 cm, SD = 50.43 cm vs. x = 32.13 cm, SD = 9.41 cm; p < 0.001).

Materials: Apical resection was performed on 100 canals of 50 maxillary premolars in slaughtered pigs. The root end of 24 canals were retrogradely filled with Diaket™, 37 root canals with Super-EBA™ including 18 with Super-EBA™. Regular and 19 with Super-EBA™ fast, 20 canals with ProRoot® MTA and 19 canals with AH-Plus™. For quantitative examination, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis and for qualitative examination, microradiography was performed. Results: Diaket™ achieved an overall average of 4.872 microns gap value as the best result. The mean values of marginal gap widths of AH-Plus™ and Super-EBA™ were almost with 8.044 microns and 9.951 microns in about the same magnitude, followed by Super-EBA™ Regular with 11,560 microns. Highest marginal gap value was found for ProRoot® MTA with 18.343 microns (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Both in terms of its marginal integrity and material properties, Diaket™ is the most suitable material for retrograde obturation.

The primary motivation behind this work was to predict the material parameters of the cornea through numerical simulations and to assess the applicability of the ubiquitously accepted law of applanation tonometry – the Imbert–Fick equation. Methods: Numerical simulations of a few states of eyeball loading were run to determine the stroma material parameters. In the computations, the elasticity moduli of the material were related to the stress sign, instead of the orientation in space. Results: Stroma elasticity secant modulus E was predicted to be close to 0.3 MPa. The numerically simulated applanation tonometer readings for the cornea with the calibration dimensions were found to be lower by 11 mmHg then IOP = 48 mmHg. Conclusions: This discrepancy is the result of a strictly mechanical phenomenon taking place in the tensioned and simultaneously flattened corneal shell and is not related to the tonometer measuring accuracy. The observed deviation has not been amenable to any GAT corrections, contradicting the Imbert–Fick law. This means a new approach to the calculation of corrections for GAT readings is needed.",

The fundamental problem emerging during numerically simulated measurement of pressure on the eyeball, whose dimensions are considered to be calibrated, stems from the fact that the flattening of the cornea at the nominal intraocular pressure leads to a critical state in which the shell loses stability. The consequences are far-reaching. The Goldmann tonometer performs well at low intraocular pressure, but above the nominal pressure its readings are always understated. The cause of the error is not the tonometer itself (its readings can be even very accurate). It is shell “solution” called Imbert–Fick law which is faulty.",

Additionally group 0 covered 4 unexploited endoprostheses. We analysed the 2-4 mm2 surfaces of the Weller endoprosthesis stems, with the scan velocity of 500 mum/s. A decrease in stem amplitude parameters means some increase in stem microdisplacements in relation to cement. During the first three years, the decrease in the roughness of endoprosthesis surface was larger compared with that in further exploitation period.

The patients regularly performed exercises using the designed device according to the planned schedule. The progress of the correction was assessed by a medical examination and additional tests. Results Results: The cross-sectional area [cm2] of the abductor hallucis muscle in three-time points among I and II groups of patients with the Hallux Valgus was measured based on MRI images. The STIR examination showed among other the abductor hallucis muscle edema after exercises with the DPc device were carried out. It evidences that exercises with the new device activate the muscle. Alignment of the big toes of both feet in groups I and II were obtained with a statistically significant result (p&lt;0.05). The percentage progression of correction for HV and I/II IM was calculated. Conclusions Based on the new correction approach the alignment of the big toe phalanges and the remaining toes was obtained. The passive setup of the tendons with their distal inserts at the level of the big toe phalanges to the correct path of their course with the withdrawal of articular subluxations was obtained. Simultaneously, the big toe's passive correction was dynamically consolidated through a specially selected set of exercises.\\",

Methods An adaptation of stereo single-point active alignment method was proposed as the calibration procedure together with verification Three tests were performed: display of points in 3D space, on the plane, and on the surface of a skull phantom on inexperience users ( 5 participants) and experienced users ( 17 participants). Results The highest accuracy of visualization was obtained for skull phantom visualisation for an inexperienced user (3.00 mm, std 0.75 mm), while the lowest accuracy was obtained in a 3D visualisation test for an inexperienced user (22.95 mm, std 18.04 mm). The largest error was related to the depth component and amounted to 18.49 mm, std 18.10 mm for an inexperienced user. Conclusions It is possible to achieve relatively high visualisation accuracy (less than 5 mm for visualisation in space) for selected users but providing it for the group of inexperienced users seems to remain a major challenge. The accuracy of point indication can be substantially and statistically significantly increased by visualising objects on surfaces. The proposed methods and obtained results can serve as a basis for further implementation of augmented reality visualisation on an optical see-through head-mounted display in applications requiring high-quality augmented reality guidance of manual tasks.",

Methods In a study involving one professional and five amateurs, the mean EMG amplitudes from the quadriceps, gastrocnemius, biceps, and triceps brachii were analyzed during different phases of rowing. A comparison was made between the degree of muscle engagement during the exercise between the professional and inexperienced individuals, as well as among the different individuals during recordings obtained at different rowing speeds. The correlation coefficient between the values recorded using a strain gauge and the EMG amplitude recorded from the surface of the biceps and triceps brachii muscles was evaluated. Results The muscle activation pattern during rowing has a predictable character. A difference in the muscle activation pattern during rowing between the professional and amateurs was observed. The EMG signal is correlated with the force recorded by the resistive strain gauge only in the experienced rower at a pace of 20 and 25 cycles per minute. Conclusions Electromyographic analysis can be useful for assessing the correctness of rowing techniques. The activation pattern of muscles during rowing has a predictable nature. The force generated by the participants increases with an increase in rowing frequency.",

Methods Eleven male parkour athletes (age 22.53 ± 2.36 years; height 1.72 ± 0.08 m; weight 69.58 ± 3.72 kg) and seven male artistic gymnasts (age 21.96 ± 2.64 years; height 1.62 ± 0.02 m; weight 63.54 ± 1.35 kg) participated in this study. Each subject was asked to perform the SBTS in the same condition (i.e., first open-eyes then closed-eyes). 2D kinetic and kinematic analysis was conducted. Results The results showed significant interaction (i.e., vision and sport) obtained at the take-off angle (p &lt; 0.05 and d = 1.992), horizontal displacement (p &lt; 0.05 and d = 1.906) and technical execution (p &lt; 0.05 and d = 1.972). This interaction indicates that when vision is permitted, artistic gymnasts and parkour athletes were similar in all kinetic and kinematic parameters, and technical execution (p &gt; 0.05). However, the elimination of vision during SBTS only affected parkour athletes (i.e., landing angle, ground reaction force, vertical velocity and technical execution, p &lt; 0.05 and d &gt;1.20) while artistic gymnasts remain unchanged. Conclusions We conclude that the specificity of the practice in each of the two sports disciplines influences the kinetic and kinematic control of the SBTS and suggests that with closed-eyes, the integration of afferent information relating to the vestibular and proprioceptive systems is different and specific to each discipline’s goal. Artistic gymnasts seem to be better skilled in the mechanical and technical control of the SBTS than parkour athletes.",

The aim of the study has been to investigate the influence of involvement in sport activities in the form of CrossFit training by individuals of different age upon the mechanical properties of Achilles tendon. Methods 231 persons participated in the study. One group consisted of subjects who train CrossFit as amateurs, the other group comprised subjects who were not physically active. Achilles tendon was studied for various positions of the ankle joint: 0° DF/PF, 10° DF, 20° DF, 20° PF and 40° PF. The following mechanical and viscoelastic tendon properties were measured using MyotonPRO: frequency [Hz], stiffness [N/m], decrement [log], relaxation time [ms] and creep [De]. The results have been compared in reference to physical activity, BMI, age, and length of training history. Results Both the tension and stiffness increased with degree of Achilles tendon stretching and decreased as it contracted. Higher values have been noted in the group of people in training and with higher BMI values. The elasticity of Achilles tendon decreased with plantar flexion increase. Lower elasticity has been recorded in the group in training and with higher BMI. No significant influence of age and length of training history upon the parameters achieved has been noted. Conclusions The specificity of Crossfit training and accompanying mechanical load result in development of adaptation changes in Achilles tendon, in the form of its higher tone/tension and stiffness, as well as lower elasticity.",

In this research, viscoelasticity, anisotropy and location-dependence of mechanical properties of rabbit iris were investigated using uniaxial tensile test. Methods Iris strips were taken along three directions: inner-circumferential direction (ICD), outer-circumferential direction (OCD) and radial direction (RD), respectively. Quasi-static tensile tests and stress-relaxation tests were applied on the iris strips. Then the stress-stretch data was fitted with third order Ogden model; the stress-relaxation data was fitted with the third order Prony series model. Through comparing the tangent modulus and relaxation limit of the strips from different directions and locations, the viscoelasticity, anisotropy and location-dependence of mechanical properties of rabbit iris were explored. Results The tangent moduli of iris at the stretch of 1.05 along ICD, OCD, and RD were 3.2 ± 1.4 kPa, 4.2 ± 2.6 kPa and 1.5 ± 0.8 kPa, respectively. Iris strips in ICD and OCD were found to have almost the same stress-relaxation behavior, and both relaxed slower than iris strips in RD. Conclusions The mechanical properties of the iris were nonlinear, viscoelastic, anisotropic and location-dependent. The stress growth rate of the circumferential direction iris strip is significantly lower than that of RD, and the stress relaxation rate is significantly higher than that of RD. That is, the iris is more prone to deformation in RD. This study can provide more precise iris material parameters for exploring the mechanical causes of pupillary-block.",

Methods To compare the effects of different target positions on tooth movement and the periodontal ligament (PDL), two kinds of aligners were designed to provide displacements of 0.2 mm (Model A) and 0.3 mm (Model B). Different displacements of the maxillary second molar were simulated using the finite element (FE) method. Results The results of numerical simulations showed that the maximum stress was in the PDL of the distal surface and the palatal surface. The stress of the PDL in Model B was larger than Model A, with the displacement of the second molar 0.027 mm in Model A, by 44.9% lesser than that in Model B. Conclusions The aligner that provided a displacement of 0.2 mm was more suitable for pushing the second molar backward in the initial stage. During the tooth movement processes, the displacement of the crown was larger than that of the root, and the displacement decreased gradually from the crown to the root. In addition, the displacement and rotation of teeth during orthodontic treatment were measured and analysed.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Titanium and its alloys are widely used as biomaterials for long-term implants, but they are usually surface-modified due to their weak bioactivity and wear resistance. Laser processing was used to modify the surface layer, and elemental carbon was a component of the deposited coatings. This research aims to use a combination of both methods based on preliminary electrophoretic deposition of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNCTs) followed by pulse laser treatment. Carbon nanotubes were chosen due to their mechanical and chemical stability as well as their tubular shape, resulting in enhanced mechanical properties of laser-modified layers. Methods The pulse laser power and laser scanning speed were defined as variable process parameters. The microstructure, roughness Ra, nanohardness H, Young`s modulus E, and indent depth values were measured, and the H/E, H3/E2, and relative changes of all these values in comparison to MWCNTs-coated and non-coated surfaces, were calculated. Results The obtained results show that the best mechanical properties of MWCNTs-coated and laser-treated specimens are obtained at a laser power of 900 W and laser feed of 6 mm/s. The observed relations can be explained considering processes occurring on the surface such as deposition of carbon nanotubes, melting and re-crystallization of the surface layer, formation and possible partial decomposition of titanium carbides, and associated changes in local chemical composition, phase composition, and a level of residual stresses beneath the surface. Conclusions The developed process can substitute the time and money-consuming carbonization of titanium and its alloys.",

Methods Retrospective data of 31 children were investigated. Sixteen children were treated with serial casting combined with BoNT injection and 15 children were treated only with serial casting treatment. GAITRite was used to collect velocity, cadence, swing %, stance %, step length, stride length, and step time parameters to compare the outcomes of the treatments. Results Combined treatment group unaffected side swing % showed a statistically significant difference at completion (M = 35.16 ±1.21; M = 32.46 ± 1.38; t (15) = 2.12, p = 0.049). Unaffected side stance % at pre-intervention was statistically different for serial casting only and the combined treatment groups (M = 61.69± 0.73; M = 64.88±1.20; t (14) = -2.273, p = 0.039). Pre- and post-intervention hemiplegic side swing % comparison was statistically significant for the serial casting only group (M = 40.87± 0.57; M = 42.39±0.79, t (14) = -0.151, p = 0.032). The baseline velocity of the combined treatment group was slower than the serial casting-only group (88±11.2 vs. 107±14.4 (cm/s), p=0.007). Conclusions This investigation suggests that for patients, who have poor ambulation quality, abnormal spatiotemporal gait parameters, and significant spasticity at pre-intervention, BoNT in conjunction with serial casting is more effective for improving ambulation quality. Serial casting can be used in conjunction with botulinum neurotoxin, which is efficient in muscle morphology and function regulation by reducing spasticity.",

The presence of noise and different harmonic components in force production significantly influences the behaviour of the muscular system. Therefore, it is essential to consider these factors in numerical simulations. Methods This study aims to develop a rheological mathematical model that accurately represents the behaviour of the actual muscular system, taking into account the phenomena described by the stochastic model in the form of stationary processes. Stochastic disturbances were applied to simulate variable conditions, in which musculo-skeletal system operates. Numerical simulations were conducted for two dynamic tasks, where we calculated the internal force generated by the system (task 1), and its displacement (task 2). These simulations were performed using two different datasets sourced from the literature. In the next step, simulation results were compared with our own experiment. Results The considered mathematical model was successfully tuned and compared with both the literature data and our own experimental results. During the analysis of muscle model behavior, depending on the data source for model tuning, we observed distinct frequencies characterized by a sine-type pattern and a higher frequency marked by stochastic perturbations. Conclusions The proposed model can be customized to simulate systems of varying sizes, levels of maximum voluntary contraction, and the effects of perturbations, closely resembling real-world data. The presented approach can be applied to simulate the behaviour of the musculoskeletal system as well as of individual muscles.",

The aim of this paper is to investigate hemodynamics and rupture risk with a complicated IA model. Methods Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations were performed to quantify the hemodynamic characteristics of the established IA models. Hemodynamic parameters, including wall shear stress (WSS), flow velocity, and flow pattern, were calculated and analyzed. Results In this paper, the risk assessment of intracranial aneurysms focuses on the mechanical properties of blood flow and blood vessel walls. Vortex flow and concentrated impact field during blood flow play a decisive role in the rupture and development of aneurysms. The uneven distribution of wall shear stress on the vessel wall has a great influence on growth and rupture. By observing the simulation results of rigid walls, risks can be predicted efficiently and accurately. Conclusions This paper focuses on the relationship between hemodynamics and ruptures risk with a double intracranial aneurysms disease mode and provides a new perspective on the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.",

Swings from three golfers, one with apparent osteoarthritis in both knee joints, one with bilateral total knee replacement, and one healthy, were captured in a motion capture laboratory and simulated. Results The golf swing generated a high axial rotation in the knee joint (approximately 25°-31°). Ball impact represented the most critical time event, near which maximum loading of the lower extremity was observed, e.g., knee compression force raised to a maximum of 329% body weight. The fast rate of knee loading by large compression forces prior to ball impact was identified as a potential cause of knee injury for golfers.

    "abstract": "Purpose The continued development of microprocessor-based knee prostheses has improved the independence of people with a femoral amputation in many environments. This study aimed to describe the effect of slopes on kinematic joint variables and segmental asymmetry. Methods Ten individuals with transfemoral amputation fitted with microprocessor-controlled knees performed 5 sessions of treadmill walking at their preferred speed in an immersive virtual environment in 5 incline conditions (Level, 3° and 6° Uphill, and 3° and 6° Downhill). The Human Body Model was used to quantify kinematic joint variables from motion capture system data. The perimeter-to-area method was used to determine the symmetry ratio of the trajectory of the leg segments in the sagittal plane Results There was a significant effect of the Uphill conditions on step length and width on the intact side and on all kinematic joint variables on both sides, although the changes differed according to the phase of the gait cycle. The segmental symmetry index was significantly modified in all slope conditions compared with Level. Conclusions Kinematic joint variables are affected by slopes; the effect was greater for the Uphill than Downhill conditions compared with the Level condition. The perimeter-to-area symmetry ratio differed from the Level condition for all slope conditions. These results indicate that, although microprocessor knees improve the autonomy of prosthesis users, work is required to improve their capacity of adaptation to varied terrain to reduce kinematic asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Investigation of the relationship between changes in hip-joint center and hip loading pre- and post- total hip arthroplasty (THA) is important in evaluating the effect of surgery on motor function. However, few longitudinal studies comparing pre- and post-THA have been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of changes in hip-joint center pre- and post-THA on the magnitude and direction of hip-joint contact force during the gait cycle, using a patient-specific musculoskeletal model. Methods The simulation program AnyBody was used to create musculoskeletal models incorporating patient specific hip-joint shape and hip-joint center position for 17 patients. The relationship between the displacement distance of the hip-joint center and the amount of change in hip-joint contact force was examined by correlation analysis. Results A decrease in the medial force (p ≤ 0.049) and an increase in the anterior force (p ≤ 0.001) acting on the hip joint were observed during gait post-THA compared to pre-THA. Mediolateral displacement of the hip-joint center post-THA compared to pre-THA was significantly positively correlated with the difference in anterior hip-joint contact force, and negatively to hip-joint medial contact force. Conclusions Longitudinal observations revealed the effects of change in hip-joint center position induced by THA on the hip-joint contact force during gait. Therefore, the change of hip-joint center position during THA can be an important factor for estimating the improvement of motor function following THA.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The technical advancement of surgical stabilization of ribs often prevents the surgeons from fixation, despite the procedure`s documented improved outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate a less invasive approach involving a simplified monocortical rib fixation technique. Methods Eighteen frozen human ribs obtained intraoperatively from young individuals aged 13-18 were employed for this study. First, the ribs were fractured under three-point bending, with their intrathoracic side put under tensile stress. Following this, the ChM 4.0 rib fixation system was utilized. The specimens were categorized into two groups: bicortical fixation (n=9), monocortical fixation (n=9). Subsequently, bicortical and monocortical fixation groups underwent dynamic testing over 400,000 cycles under combined sinusoidal tensile bending and torsional loading (2 N-5 N at 3Hz). In the final stage, all samples were subjected to a destructive load to failure. Results Our analysis revealed that the fixation method did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in terms of preliminary bending stiffness (p=0.379). Similarly, undergoing a course of 400,000 cycles involving combined tensile and torsional loading did not constitute a statistically significant factor affecting the monocortical and the bicortical fixation groups (p=0.894). In the monocortical fixation group, all specimens failed due to screws pulled out from the bone. In contrast, all specimens in the bicortical fixation group exhibited failure attributed to fractures occurring just behind the plate. Nonetheless, the fixation method was not a significant factor affecting bending strength (p=0.863). Conclusions The monocortial fixation could be a reasonable option among younger populations with comparable stability of fixation.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Animals, especially dogs are nowadays treated like family members so that when their pet's health condition has deteriorated, they go with them to the veterinarian. Common reasons for emergency visits include injuries and a decrease in animal performance due to progressive disease. The dynamic development of veterinary medicine and manufacturing techniques allows implants to be made using additive techniques. As an innovative solution dedicated as a scaffold for bone tissue reconstruction are the implants proposed by Cabiomede made of PLA. These implants should have the right properties to ensure the right conditions for bone fusion. It is also important to determine the time of degradation, which is associated with a significant loss of mechanical properties. Methods Therefore, the study assessed the mechanical properties of polymer implants made by FDM printing technology. The static compression and three-point bending tests, material wettability, and macro and microscopic observations were carried out. The effect of steam sterilization on the change in the determined parameters was also determined. Results Hydrolytic degradation initiated by exposure to Ringer's solution resulted in a change in structure from amorphous to semicrystalline. This indicates a partial dissolution of the amorphous phase and thus an increase in the percentage of the crystalline phase which resulted in the brittleness of the material. Conclusions The compressive strength values of PLA implants are similar to those of cancellous bone.",

Methods The mechanical properties of the novel electrode were analyzed by finite element method, and then the temperature and thermal damage distribution of intestinal tissue during welding process were analyzed by electric-thermal-mechanical multi-field coupled finite element analysis. In ex-vivo experiments, the biomechanical strength of anastomotic area was assessed by indexes of tensile force and burst pressure. A thermocouple probe and an infrared thermal imager were used to monitor the temperature and thermal damage of the intestinal tissue in experiments. Furthermore, histopathological examination and transmission electron microscopy observation were used to observe the morphology and microstructural of anastomotic area. Results A slightly higher mean biomechanical strength is acquired with the tensile force and burst pressure results increasing from 9.7±1.47 N, 84.0±5.99 mmHg to 11.8±2.01 N, 89.6±6.79 mmHg respectively as well as the percentage of necrotic tissue caused by thermal damage decreasing from 89% to 33% for the novel electrode group, with compression force of 20 N, radiofrequency (RF) energy of 120 W and welding duration of 8 s applied to the target regions to achieve anastomosis. Moreover, tightly connected intestinal tissue with collagenic crosslink in the fusion area could be observed by histopathological examination and transmission electron microscopy.

    "abstract": "Purpose: The chewing trajectory in the dynamic analysis of dental prosthesis is always defined as a two-segmental straight polyline without enough consideration about chewing force and motion laws. The study was aimed to design a realistic human chewing trajectory for the dynamic analysis based on force and motion planning methods. Methods: The all-ceramic crown restored in the mandibular first molar was selected as the representative prosthesis. Firstly, a dynamic model containing two molar components and one flat food component was built, and an approximate chewing plane was predefined. According to the desired forces (25 N, 150 N and 25 N), three force planning points were calculated by using tentative trajectories. The motion planning was then executed based on four-segment cubic spline model. Finally, the new trajectory was re-imported into the dynamic model as the displacement load for evaluating its stress influence. Results: The maximum lateral velocity was 26.81 mm/s. Besides, the forces in the three force planning points were 14.11 N, 126.75 N and 13.56 N. The overall repetition rate of chewing force was 77.21%. The force and stress profiles were similar to the sine curve on the whole. The maximum dynamic stress of the crown prosthesis was 398.5 MPa. Conclusions: The motion law was effectively brought into the chewing trajectory to introduce the dynamic effect. The global force performance was acceptable, and the force profile was more realistic than the traditional chewing trajectory. The additional reliable characteristic feature of the stress distribution of the dental prosthesis was observed.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: A novel portable system has been used to evaluate spatial knee movement, but its accuracy and repeatability is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy and repeatability of the measurement. Methods: Ten healthy participants were included, and the knee motion trajectory during walking were assessed. Six evaluations were conducted (three days by two raters) for each participant. The motion parameters at the key points and the range of motion were statistically analyzed. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of the measurement (SEM), and the Bland–Altman method were used. Results: For intra-rater repeatability, 1) the ICC values range from 0.75 to 0.9 for rotations; and 0.64 to 0.96 for translations. Among the ICC values, 100% of rotations and 90% of translations were not less than 0.70; 2) among the SEM values, 100% of rotations were not more than 5°, while 73.3% of translations were less than 3 mm. For inter-rater repeatability, 1) the ICC values range from 0.68 to 0.99 for rotations; and 0.57 to 0.93 for translations. Among the ICC values, 95.6% of rotations and 82.2% of translations were not less than 0.70; 2) among the SEM values, 100% of rotations were not more than 5°, and 48.9% of translations were less than 3 mm. The Bland–Altman plots showed good agreement for intra- and inter- repeatability. Conclusions: The results indicated that the accuracy and repeatability of the measurement were acceptable, except for the inter-rater repeatability for translation. This may help researchers and physicians better interpret the measurement data.",

Main goals of the research were formulated on general and detailed levels. The first one was oriented towards the technical possibility and practical sense of physical modelling of medical procedures, whereas on the second level main hydraulic parameters of the process were investigated. The results of the research presented in the paper give the positive answers to both groups of problems. The method of physical modelling of the considered kind of processes seems to be quite reasonable. It allows us to establish the location of the inlets and outlets from the peritoneum during perfusion. Key word: intraperitoneal perfussion, process modelling",

The authors of this study strive to find a new intramedullary nail, which is intended for treating femoral bone fractures for canine patients. The purpose of this study was to analyze biomechanical parameters of the intramedullary nails, which use a new bolt system concept. Methods: Dissected femoral bones of a large breed dog were cut in order to simulate interfragmentary gap, and then the bones were stabilized using intramedullary nail with locking bolts. Bone-nail systems were subjected to cyclic loading using force which corresponds to the load on the femoral bone in the first few days after surgery. Micro-CT scans were taken of the bone samples around implant in order to determine deformation and structural parameters of bone tissue. Results: The calculation of the bone-nail system stiffness was done through analysis of the force displacement curves recorded during experimental studies. Using monocortical locking bolts resulted in smaller stiffness of the bone-nail system than using bicortical locking bolts. Conclusions: The results obtained in this study can indicate that the intramedullary nail could work well when used for treatment of bone fractures in dogs. The authors focused on using monocortical bolts which provides good stability and adequate biomechanical environment. Described fixation method is easily adjustable to a particular patient individual parameters.",

The ability of a bone to resist fractures under the influence of large muscles and physical activity depends on its established mechanical properties. This article discusses how exercise such as treadmill running and taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as diclofenac, affect the musculoskeletal system by modifying the elastic and thermal properties of the left femur of a mouse. Methods: The research was conducted using 9-week-old C57BL/6J female mice. In order to investigate the elastic and thermal properties of bones, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed. Results: The study of elastic properties, followed by in-depth statistical analysis, shows that taking diclofenac slightly reduces the elastic parameters of the bones under study. These changes are more pronounced in DSC studies, the shift of the observed endothermic peaks is on the order of several degrees with a simultaneous increase in the enthalpy of this process. Conclusions: The opposite effect of the applied factors – diclofenac and running – on the elastic properties of the bones of the examined mice was found. The external factors – running and diclofenac – modify the basic parameters of the endothermic process associated with the release of water.",

Methods: All aortas were collected from men (mean age: 48 ± 12 years, mean diameter of the aneurysm: 49 mm ± 4 mm). The mechanical properties were determined based on directional tensile test. The biomechanical assay was complemented by conducting histological analysis (hematoxylin and eosin, Mallory’s trichrome, Azan stain). Results: The highest values (median) of failure Cauchy stress, failure force, Young’s modulus and stiffness coefficient were obtained for the adventitia (max = 1.40 MPa, Fmax = 4.05 N, E = 26.11 MPa, k = 1.06 N/mm). Conclusions: The results indicate that the mechanical function of the adventitia in healthy tissue and dissected ascending aorta aneurysm is the same, i.e., it protects the vessel against destruction. The failure Cauchy stresses found in the media and intima are comparable and amounted to 0.23 and 0.21 MPa, respectively. The results indicate that dissection affects the mechanical properties of ascending aorta wall layers. The mechanical loads are probably transferred within the dissected aneurysmal wall not only through the media, but also through the intima.",

The analysis was performed in two aspects: to determine which material used for fabricating ureteral stents promotes encrustation and which part of the DJ stents is the most vulnerable for blockage. Methods: One hundred and twenty patients with an indwelling DJ stent duration between 7 and 78 days were included in this study. The encrustation of DJ stents was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the mechanical properties of DJ stents were examined using the standard MTS Micro Bionix tensile test. Results: This study showed that polyurethane catheters have a much higher affinity for encrustation than styrene/ethylene/butylene block copolymer. Obtained results indicated the proximal (renal pelvis) and distal (urinary bladder) part is the most susceptible to post-URS-L fragments and urea salt deposition. Both the DJ ureteral stents’ outer and inner surfaces were completely covered even after 7 days of implantation. Conclusions: Performed analysis pointed out that polyurethane DJ stents have a much higher affinity for encrustation of calculi and NaCl crystals compared to the silicone-based copolymer. The surface of the ureteral stents needs improvement to minimize salt and kidney stone deposition, causing pre-biofilm formation and the occurrence of defects and cracks.",

Methods The microprocessor-controlled measurement system applies pressure to the object (ultimately the limb) by pumping air into the cuff surrounding the object. Changes in pressure and air temperature in the cuff over time are recorded. The results supplemented with the calibration procedure allow to determine the changes in the volume of the object. Results Measurement-independent calibration and temperature correction of pressure changes in the system proved to be necessary components of the measurement procedure for volume changes. When comparing the device test results with the actual changes observed with the limb model, there was a discrepancy between 0.2 and 0.7 percent of the total volume under the cuff. Conclusions Studies have shown that the proposed air plethysmograph is useful for assessing the changes in the volume of the limb model within the range that are expected in the diagnosis of lymphedema. The solution is a cheaper and less complicated alternative to most of the available methods of measuring changes in the volume of edema tissue under controlled pressure.",

Aim of study. The aim of the study was to differentiate the strength of the muscles of the index and middle fingers when performing a basketball shot. Methods Material and method. Study group enrolled 122 male college basketball league students. The study included psychophysiological tests to determine indices of individual and typological characteristics of higher nervous activity, proprioceptive sensitivity tests of the fingers of the leading hand, and field tests to assess participants' shooting skills. The touch-based finger pressure sensing system measured the different levels of pressure exerted by the participants' main index and middle finger during grasping. Results For both the middle and index finger, the highest correlation with shot efficiency was found for a 120 g load g (p &lt; 0,01 for 2PS; 2PS40 suc; FT; 3PSO and 3,5mS). Furthermore, high reproducibility of proprioceptive sensitivity of the index and middle finger of the leading hand was found in basketball players. Conclusions The research indicates that it is possible to organize compensatory behavior between joints on the basis of proprioception, with the last compensatory movements of the kinematic chain being performed by the fingers of the hand. The demonstrated high proprioceptive sensitivity of the index and middle finger of the leading hand in basketball players at a weekly interval may indicate ability to maintain high repeatability of movements controlled by these fingers.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Performing effective actions requires the basketball player to balance factors such as motor variability, error minimalization and a complex sequence of coordination to determine the best action. Aim of study. The aim of the study was to differentiate the strength of the muscles of the index and middle fingers when performing a basketball shot. Methods Material and method. Study group enrolled 122 male college basketball league students. The study included psychophysiological tests to determine indices of individual and typological characteristics of higher nervous activity, proprioceptive sensitivity tests of the fingers of the leading hand, and field tests to assess participants' shooting skills. The touch-based finger pressure sensing system measured the different levels of pressure exerted by the participants' main index and middle finger during grasping. Results For both the middle and index finger, the highest correlation with shot efficiency was found for a 120 g load g (p &lt; 0,01 for 2PS; 2PS40 suc; FT; 3PSO and 3,5mS). Furthermore, high reproducibility of proprioceptive sensitivity of the index and middle finger of the leading hand was found in basketball players. Conclusions The research indicates that it is possible to organize compensatory behavior between joints on the basis of proprioception, with the last compensatory movements of the kinematic chain being performed by the fingers of the hand. The demonstrated high proprioceptive sensitivity of the index and middle finger of the leading hand in basketball players at a weekly interval may indicate ability to maintain high repeatability of movements controlled by these fingers.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this research is to study the trend of pedestrian lower extremity injuries during vehicle-pedestrian collisions. Methods: In this study, pedestrian’s age, collision angle and pedestrian’s position are considered influencing factors. Nine experiments using a novel lower extremity mechanical model are designed with the orthogonal experiment method. Results: Under the same collision angle, collisions in the left and right positions caused more serious tibia injuries than the middle position. As for the collision angle, the tibial injury at +45° is more significant than the tibial injury at −45°, and the injury of oblique collisions is slightly greater than that at 0°. Moreover, tibial injury is more sensitive to research variables than femoral injury. When the collision angle and position are changed, the difference ratio of tibia stress is by 483.2% higher than that of femur stress. The axial force and bending moment of the quadriceps tendon in the left-position collision reach peak values, which are 3.83 kN and 165.98 Nm, respectively. The peak quadriceps tendon axial force is captured with the collision angle of −45°, and the peak quadriceps tendon bending moment is obtained with a collision angle of +45°. Conclusions: The effects of differences in impact position and angle on lower extremity injury in the elderly were analyzed, and the results of this study can be used as a reference for research on lower extremity protection",

Methods: A vehicle-seat-occupant subsystem finite element (FE) model was developed using the a assembly of vehicle front seat and seat belt together with the THUMS (Total Human body Model for Safety) AM50 (50th% Adult Male) occupant model. Then the typical vehicle frontal crash pulses from different impact scenarios were applied to the vehicle-seat-occupant subsystem FE model, and the predictions from the occupant model were analyzed. Results: The modeling results indicate that the maximum sternal compression of the occupant caused by seat belt load is not sensitive to the peek of the crash pulse but sensitive to the energy contained by the crash pulse in the phrase before seat belt load reaching its limit. Injury risk analysis implies that seat belt load of the four crash scenarios considered in the current work could induce a high thorax AIS2+ injury risk (&gt;80%) to the occupants older than 70 years, and a potential injury risk to the spleen. Conclusions: The findings suggest that control of the energy in the first 75 ms of the crash pulse is crucial for vehicle safety design, and thorax tolerance of the older population and spleen injury prevention are the key considerations in developing of seat belt system.",

Removal of its contents through aspiration is often a necessary complement to treatment at various stages of the development of gonarthritis.The paper presented a procedure for needle automatic needle path planning in cyst aspiration in transverse plane. The method was based on optimization and used a custom objective function, which utilized cost maps obtained from preprocessed, segmented images of the knee. The optimization was carried out with Differential Evolution. Furthermore, a preliminary sensitivity analysis was carried out. The obtained paths were compared to the reference paths proposed by an experienced surgeon.The procedure was tested on 165 numerical simulations. In all of the obtained paths, the needle successfully avoided crucial objects, such as veins, arteries and nerves. Furthermore, the overall travel distance in the joint was also minimized. When compared to the reference from the surgeon, 90% of the paths were almost the same or only slightly different. Furthermore, the remaining 10% of the generated paths were viable but different.Based on the obtained results, the proposed solution could be a viable solution for planning the aspiration of Baker's cyst.",

Combined with the lack of ergonomics at home workplaces, the risk of discomfort has increased, especially around the cervical spine and upper limbs. Evaluation of the mentioned problem is the subject of the study.The study used an original questionnaire based on the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. The analysis used responses from people who reported discomfort in the form of tingling or numbness in the cervical spine, shoulder, elbow and wrist during the pandemic. Statistical analysis of the results was carried out to formulate conclusions. In addition, individual data were presented as percentages.Considering the working time exceeding 8 hours a day, discomfort in the wrist joint area was most often reported among people working remotely (15.1%). Shoulder complex discomfort was the most common symptom (22%) reported by people working more than 8 hours a day, under the age of 31. In young people, the risk of discomfort in the shoulder, hand and cervical spine area increased.Extended working time is conducive to the appearance of symptoms within the hands. In future studies, it will be necessary to analyze the ergonomic factors responsible for this phenomenon.",

The results of research concerning modifications of Zimmerman’s methods were obtained. They prove higher efficacy and selectivity of the solution proposed. The system of electroporation with changed geometry of electrodes and parameters of current is being proposed. The procedure is controlled entirely by microprocessor, from the stage of technology parameters’ control in incubators of initial cells to creation of appointed mixture of cells in a mixer, and then division into portions, pumping the mixture into hybridisation chamber and, after hybridisation, pumping the mixture over into separate sections of incubator. The hybridisation system was modified. Transparent water coat was constructed. It was connected to thermostat, on which transparent hybridisation chamber was installed. Lighting from underneath and gap lighting of chamber enable continuous observation of suspended cells by means of microscope lens being connected by picture channel to computer. The software analyses the picture with respect to hybrid selection. The cells marked are planimetrically analysed during the time which was programmed. When the morphometric criteria are met suspended cells are pumped over to separate sections of incubator, where selective breeding of hybrids is carried out. Selection of hybrids takes place in electroosmosis gradient under morphometric control of cells in microcapillary systems.",

Assessment on an amputee could also allow for the clinical usability of the digital scanner to be studied.To verify the accuracy of the system, the Bioscanner method was compared to the widely used standard anthropometric manual measurement technique (i.e., tape measure). One transtibial prosthetic user was recruited to conduct a walking activity at a normal walking pace for 5 to 15 minutes. Circumferential profiles of the participant were obtained digitally and manually during 2-5 minutes of resting walking intervals. The mean differences between the two methods were compared and percentage differences were calculated. The means were used to calculate the standard error measurement (SEM) and the 95% confidence intervals. Study of the limit of agreement between the two method was also used to validate the accuracy of Bioscanner.The findings showed that both measurements gave a general comparable linear pattern. The averaged results from both methods resulted in only small distinctive differences especially at circumference near the mid-patella tendon. Similarly, the pressure-sensitive areas of the limb resulted in only an average of 2.28% differences between the two measurement techniques. The system showed high reliability and SEM with <1 of 95% CI values and repeatability study gave ICC >0.9.Bioscanner appeared to be comparable with the standard manual method. The Biosculptor system provides the portability, fast, reliable, and high accuracy measurements of the transtibial residual limb circumference, thus, it can be considered as a valuable tool for daily measurement of amputee's residual limb and pre-prosthetic training.",

The Zebris pedobarographic platform was used to measure the distribution of body weight on the lower limbs. The study population was stratified by the time to syndesmotic screw removal (8-15 weeks versus 16-22 weeks) and the number of bone cortices involved in fixation (three [tricortical fixation] versus four [quadricortical fixation]).The weight distribution on the operated and healthy limbs in patients with tricortical syndesmosis fixation was asymmetrical, with the mean load on the operated and healthy limbs of 48.38% and 51.62%, respectively. The patients who underwent quadricortical syndesmosis fixation exhibited a symmetrical distribution of weight on the operated and healthy limb. There was a symmetrical distribution of the load of body weight on the operated and healthy limbs both in the group with different times to syndesmotic screw removal.Tricortical syndesmosis fixation is associated with an asymmetrical weight distribution on the operated and healthy limbs. In treating tibiofibular syndesmosis injuries, based on our pedobarographic research, quadricortical syndesmosis fixation and leaving the syndesmotic screw in place for up to 15 weeks, seems more beneficial to the patient.",

The statistical tests revealed that the value of the AI differed significantly in the reference group and in the group of professional folk dancers ( p = 0.05). The differences were also observed in the group of females ( p = 0.003). No statistically relevant differences were observed in relation to the group of males ( p = 0.116).

Additionally, the impact of changes in mandibular geometry on the values of occlusal forces and mandibular condyle loading was considered. The combined geometric and force analysis makes a valuable contribution to the operating conditions of the system affected by the changes.The considerations were based on elementary principles of analytical geometry and the analysis was performed for two craniofacial geometries.For the rotation of the proximal segment, the greatest differences in angular position concern the masseter muscle during roll rotation (11.7°). Significant changes in muscle length occurred during pitch rotation and amounted to 3.7 mm. Translation of the distal segment by 10 mm changed the angle of the pterygoid muscle by 30.2° in the coronal plane and 18.7° in the sagittal plane, simultaneously changing its direction to that of the opposite. Posterior translation (10 mm) caused an elongation of the muscle by 4.7 mm and anterior translation caused a shortening by 2.6 mm. For the mandible with elongated geometry, lower values of occlusion forces and increased reaction forces in the condyle were observed.The analysis revealed significant changes in the orientation and length of the masticatory muscles, and thus, their potential impact on the functioning conditions of the masticatory system.",

Methods: Data derived from previous studies performed in our laboratory were used for statistical analyses, which consisted of applying magnetic fields (1 and 2 mT) and electric fields (4 and 8 mV/cm) to chondrocytes. Data from cell proliferation and glycosaminoglycan expression were used to adjust and to validate each mathematical model. Results: The root square model efficiently predicted the chondrocyte dynamics, evidencing determination coefficients of R2 = 92.04 for proliferation and R2 = 70.95 for glycosaminoglycans when magnetic fields were applied, and R2 = 88.19 for proliferation and R2 = 74.79 for glycosaminoglycans when electric fields were applied. Conclusions: The reduced, interactive, quadratic and combined models exhibited lower R2 values, nevertheless, they were useful to predict proliferation and glycosaminoglycan synthesis, as the right-skewed distribution, determined by the F parameter, evidenced a F rejected &lt; F computed . The models are efficient since the prediction of chondrocyte dynamics is comparable to the cell growth and to the molecular synthesis observed experimentally. This novel formulation may be dynamic because the variables that fit the models may be modified to improve in vitro procedures focused on cartilage recovery.",
