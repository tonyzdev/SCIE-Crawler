    "abstract": "Abstract Lipid metabolism is a complex biochemical process that participates in the regulation of cell survival and death. Ferroptosis is a form of iron‐dependent regulated cell death driven by abnormal lipid metabolism, leading to lipid peroxidation and subsequent plasma membrane rupture. A variety of antioxidant systems and membrane repair pathways can diminish oxidative damage, enabling survival and growth in response to ferroptotic signals. Such impairment of ferroptosis machinery is implicated in various pathological conditions and diseases, especially cancer and tissue damage. It is discussed here how lipid metabolism pathways, including lipid synthesis, degradation, storage, transformation, and utilization, modulate ferroptosis sensitivity or tolerance in different models, especially cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As one of the iconic pathways in plant metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is commonly thought to not only be responsible for the oxidization of respiratory substrate to drive ATP synthesis but also provide carbon skeletons to anabolic processes and contribute to carbon–nitrogen interaction and biotic stress responses. The functions of the TCA cycle enzymes are characterized by a saturation transgenesis approach, whereby the constituent expression of proteins is knocked out or reduced in order to investigate their function in vivo. The alteration of TCA cycle enzyme expression results in changed plant growth and photosynthesis under controlled conditions. Moreover, improvements in plant performance and postharvest properties are reported by overexpression of either endogenous forms or heterologous genes of a number of the enzymes. Given the importance of the TCA cycle in plant metabolism regulation, here, the function of each enzyme and its roles in different tissues are discussed. This article additionally highlights the recent finding that the plant TCA cycle, like that of mammals and microbes, dynamically assembles functional substrate channels or metabolons and discusses the implications of this finding to the current understanding of the metabolic regulation of the plant TCA cycle.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The increasing exploitation of graphene‐based materials (GBMs) is driven by their unique properties and structures, which ignite the imagination of scientists and engineers. At the same time, the very properties that make them so useful for applications lead to growing concerns regarding their potential impacts on human health and the environment. Since GBMs are inert to reaction, various attempts of surface functionalization are made to make them reactive. Herein, surface functionalization of GBMs, including those intentionally designed for specific applications, as well as those unintentionally acquired (e.g., protein corona formation) from the environment and biota, are reviewed through the lenses of nanotoxicity and design of safe materials (safe‐by‐design). Uptake and toxicity of functionalized GBMs and the underlying mechanisms are discussed and linked with the surface functionalization. Computational tools that can predict the interaction of GBMs behavior with their toxicity are discussed. A concise framing of current knowledge and key features of GBMs to be controlled for safe and sustainable applications are provided for the community.",

    "abstract": "Cellular membranes exhibit a fascinating variety of different morphologies, which are continuously remodeled by transformations of membrane shape and topology. This remodeling is essential for important biological processes (cell division, intracellular vesicle trafficking, endocytosis) and can be elucidated in a systematic and quantitative manner using synthetic membrane systems. Here, recent insights obtained from such synthetic systems are reviewed, integrating experimental observations and molecular dynamics simulations with the theory of membrane elasticity. The study starts from the polymorphism of biomembranes as observed for giant vesicles by optical microscopy and small nanovesicles in simulations. This polymorphism reflects the unusual elasticity of fluid membranes and includes the formation of membrane necks or fluid 'worm holes'. The proliferation of membrane necks generates stable multi-spherical shapes, which can form tubules and tubular junctions. Membrane necks are also essential for the remodeling of membrane topology via membrane fission and fusion. Neck fission can be induced by fine-tuning of membrane curvature, which leads to the controlled division of giant vesicles, and by adhesion-induced membrane tension as observed for small nanovesicles. Challenges for future research include the interplay of curvature elasticity and membrane tension during membrane fusion and the localization of fission and fusion processes within intramembrane domains.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Certain metabolic interventions such as caloric restriction, fasting, exercise, and a ketogenic diet extend lifespan and/or health span. However, their benefits are limited and their connections to the underlying mechanisms of aging are not fully clear. Here, these connections are explored in terms of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Krebs cycle, citric acid cycle) to suggest reasons for the loss of effectiveness and ways of overcoming it. Specifically, the metabolic interventions deplete acetate and likely reduce the conversion of oxaloacetate to aspartate, thereby inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and upregulating autophagy. Synthesis of glutathione may provide a high‐capacity sink for amine groups, facilitating autophagy, and prevent buildup of alpha‐ketoglutarate, supporting stem cell maintenance. Metabolic interventions also prevent the accumulation of succinate, thereby slowing DNA hypermethylation, facilitating the repair of DNA double‐strand breaks, reducing inflammatory and hypoxic signaling, and lowering reliance on glycolysis. In part through these mechanisms, metabolic interventions may decelerate aging, extending lifespan. Conversely, with overnutrition or oxidative stress, these processes function in reverse, accelerating aging and impairing longevity. Progressive damage to aconitase, inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase, and downregulation of hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1 α , and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) emerge as potentially modifiable reasons for the loss of effectiveness of metabolic interventions.",

In hepatocyte cells, the concentration of calcium uptake is quite extensive from various agonists such as active subunit, active phospholipase C, free calcium in the cytosol, and endoplasmic reticulum. The overproduction and degradation of calcium signals can cause homeostasis, liver inflammation, and liver diseases. The spatiotemporal behavior of calcium oscillation reveals the physiological role of these cellular entities in understanding the process of production and degradation. No computational attempt has been registered to date on the compound calcium regulation of these cellular entities including the memory of cells. Hence, the authors proposed a fractional order compartmental model that systematically simulates the exchange of calcium intake in cellular entities. The nonlinear equations of the rate of changes in the active subunit, active phospholipase C, free calcium in the cytosol, and endoplasmic reticulum are coupled to form a nonlinear fractional order initial value problem. The existence and uniqueness, stability analysis of the model is performed that validate the theoretical results and explore the dynamic behaviour of calcium oscillation in each compartment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Prior work suggests influenza A virus (IAV) crosses the airway mucus barrier in a sialic acid‐dependent manner through the actions of the viral envelope proteins, hemagglutinin, and neuraminidase. However, host and viral factors that influence how efficiently mucus traps IAV remain poorly defined. In this work, how the physicochemical properties of mucus influence its ability to effectively capture IAV is assessed using fluorescence video microscopy and multiple particle tracking. Our studies suggest an airway mucus gel layer must be produced with virus‐sized pores to physically constrain IAV. While sialic acid binding by IAV may improve mucus trapping efficiency, sialic acid binding preference is found to have little impact on IAV mobility and the fraction of viral particles expected to penetrate the mucus barrier. Further, synthetic polymeric hydrogels engineered with mucus‐like architecture are similarly protective against IAV infection despite their lack of sialic acid decoy receptors. Together, this work provides new insights on mucus barrier function toward IAV with important implications on innate host defense and transmission of respiratory viruses.",

This review analyzes the current state of cornea chip technology, addressing fundamental challenges and exploring future directions. Recent advancements in biomaterials and fabrication techniques are discussed that aim to recapitulate the complex structure and function of the human cornea, including the multilayered epithelium, organized stroma, and functional endothelium. The review highlights the potential of the cornea chips to revolutionize ocular research by offering more predictive and physiologically relevant models for drug screening, disease modeling, and personalized medicine. Current designs, their applications in studying drug permeability, barrier function, and wound healing, and their limitations in replicating native corneal architecture, are examined. Key challenges include integrating corneal curvature, basement membrane formation, and innervation. Applications are explored in modeling diseases like keratitis, dry eye disease, keratoconus, and Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy. Future directions include incorporating corneal curvature using hydraulically controlled systems, using patient‐derived cells, and developing comprehensive disease models to accelerate therapy development and reduce reliance on animal testing.",

Xenohormetic phytochemicals such as flavonoids and phytoalexins modulate a range of human cell signaling mechanisms but functional correlations with human pathophysiology are lacking. Here, potent inhibitory effects of grapefruit‐derived Naringenin (Nar) and soybean‐derived Glyceollins (Gly) in human microphysiological models of bulk tissue vasculogenesis and tumor angiogenesis are reported. Despite this interference of vascular morphogenesis, Nar and Gly are not cytotoxic to endothelial cells and do not prevent cell cycle entry. The anti‐vasculogenic effects of Glyceollin are significantly more potent in sex‐matched female (XX) models. Nar and Gly do not decrease viability or expression of proangiogenic genes in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell spheroids, suggesting that inhibition of sprouting angiogenesis by Nar and Gly in a MPS model of the (TNBC) microenvironment are mediated via direct effects in endothelial cells. The study supports further research of Naringenin and Glyceollin as health‐promoting agents with special attention to mechanisms of action in vascular endothelial cells and the role of biological sex, which can improve the understanding of dietary nutrition and the pharmacology of phytochemical preparations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glaucoma, a blind‐leading disease largely since chronic pathological intraocular high pressure (ph‐IOP). Hitherto, it is reckoned incurable for irreversible neural damage and challenges in managing IOP. Thus, it is significant to develop neuroprotective strategies. Ferroptosis, initially identified as an iron‐dependent regulated death that triggers Fenton reactions and culminates in lipid peroxidation (LPO), has emerged as a focal point in multiple tumors and neurodegenerative diseases. Researches show that iron homeostasis play critical roles in the optic nerve (ON) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), suggesting targeted treatments could be effective. In glaucoma, apart from neural lesions, disrupted metal balance and increased oxidative stress in trabecular meshwork (TM) are observed. These disturbances lead to extracellular matrix excretion disorders, known as sclerotic mechanisms, resulting in refractory blockages. Importantly, oxidative stress, a significant downstream effect of ferroptosis, is also a key factor in cell senescence. It plays a crucial role in both the etiology and risk of glaucoma. Moreover, ferroptosis also induces non‐infectious inflammation, which exacerbate glaucomatous injury. Therefore, the relevance of ferroptosis in glaucoma is extensive and multifaceted. In this review, the study delves into the current understanding of ferroptosis mechanisms in glaucoma, aiming to provide clues to inform clinical therapeutic practices.",

Furthermore, skin condition significantly affects external beauty. In today's era, which is of material and spiritual prosperity, there is growing attention on skincare and wellness. Ultraviolet radiation is one of the most common external factors that lead to conditions like sunburn, skin cancer, and skin aging. In this review, several mechanisms of UV‐induced skin cell senescence are discussed, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which have their own characteristics and mutual effects. As an illustration, mitochondrial dysfunction triggers electron evasion and the generation of more reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which in turn causes mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) damage. Based on the current mechanism, suitable prevention and treatment strategies are proposed from sunscreen, dietary, and experimental medications respectively, aimed at slowing down skin cell aging and providing protection from ultraviolet radiation. The effects of ultraviolet rays on skin is summarized, offering insights and directions for future studies on mechanism of skin cell senescence, with an anticipation of discovering more effective prevention and cure methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract SIRT6 is a NAD + ‐dependent histone deacetylase with crucial roles in controlling DNA damage repair, telomere homeostasis, oxidative stress, autophagy, and other cellular processes, and it has long been recognized as a longevity‐associated protein. This review details its anti‐aging‐related mechanisms. First, SIRT6 facilitates DNA repair pathways and maintains genome stability by deacetylating histone H3 at K56, K9, and K18 residues, in addition to participating in DNA damage repair through mono‐ADP‐ribosylation and other mechanisms. Second, SIRT6 preserves telomere integrity and mitigates cellular senescence by reducing oxidative stress‐induced damage through the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibition of inflammation, and other pathways. Furthermore, SIRT6 promotes autophagy, slowing cellular senescence via the modulation of various signaling pathways, including AMPK, IGF‐Akt‐mTOR, H133Y, IL‐1β, and mitochondrial autophagy‐related proteins. Finally, SIRT6 regulates multiple signaling pathways, such asNF‐κB, FOXO, and AMPK, to counteract the aging process. This review particularly delves into the interplay between SIRT6 and various diseases, including tumors, cardiovascular diseases (e.g., atherosclerosis, heart failure), metabolic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, gluconeogenesis, osteoporosis), and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). Moreover, recent advancements in SIRT6‐regulated compounds (e.g., C3G, BZBS, Fisetin, FNDC5, Lycorine hydrochloride, and Ergothioneine) are discussed as potential therapeutic agents for these mediated diseases.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of YFJDT on lung cancer remain unclear. Bioinformatics analysis is conducted to identify potential targets of YFJDT. The impact of YFJDT on hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A), ferroptosis, and vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is investigated using xenograft tumor models and A549 cells. Additionally, A549 cells are stimulated with CoCl2 to mimic the hypoxic microenvironment of the tumor. The role of HIF1A overexpression in modulating ferroptosis is assessed. The effects of HIF1A and ferroptosis on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and VM in vitro are evaluated. Results: YFJDT treatment led to a concentration-dependent decrease in HIF1A levels in xenograft tumors and A549 cells. Overexpression of HIF1A counteractes the inhibitory effects of YFJDT on proliferation, EMT, and VM in transplanted tumors. Moreover, HIF1A overexpression attenuates YFJDT-induced lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation, indicating inhibition of ferroptosis in A549 cells. Hypoxia-induced alterations in EMT markers and VM are reversed by YFJDT but exacerbated by HIF1A overexpression. Molecular docking identified salicylic acid and psoralen as potential components of YFJDT targeting HIF1A. YFJDT exerts anti-tumor effects in lung cancer by downregulating HIF1A and promoting ferroptosis.",

Here, micrometer‐sized, bifunctional microgels are used as an experimental platform to investigate the interplay of cell‐free protein synthesis (CFPS) and in situ protein accumulation inside the microgel volume. In detail, microgels made of hyaluronic acid (HA) are first modified with different amounts of nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) moieties to characterize the capability and maximum capacity of binding His‐tag modified GFP. CFPS is optimized for the system used here, particularly when using a linear DNA template. Afterward, HA‐microgels are functionalized with the linear DNA template and Ni 2+ ‐activated NTA moieties to bind in situ synthesized GFP‐His. CFPS and parallel protein accumulation within the microgels are observed over time to determine the GFP‐His binding to the microgel platform. With this approach, the study presents the first steps for a platform to study the temporal‐spatial regulation of protein synthesis by tailored protein binding or release from the microgel matrix‐based reaction environment.",

    "abstract": "Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is the most common and severe complication in patients with Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) and is characterized by high morbidity, frequent recurrence and substantial mortality. The formation of macrophage extracellular traps (METs), a novel inflammatory mode of cell death, plays a significant role in the progression of various inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying METs formation and their role in the progression of HAEC remain unclear. Here, the findings indicate that METs formation induced by the pyroptotic microenvironment enhances inflammatory responses and induces colonic epithelial cells (CECs) injury in HAEC. Mechanistically, high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), derived from this pyroptotic environment, mediates METs formation through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-p38 MAPK/p65 NF-kB signaling pathways. Furthermore, incubation of CECs with METs induces suppression of cell viability, more production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pyroptosis. In conclusion, HMGB1 mediates the communication between pyroptotic microenvironment and METs formation, triggering enhanced inflammatory responses and damage to CECs. Targeting HMGB1 presents a potential therapeutic strategy for HAEC.",

In this study, a physiologically relevant 3D vascularized breast cancer micro-environment is developed comprising of metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells loaded in human dermal fibroblasts laden fibrin, representing the tumor stroma. The matrix, as well as stromal cell density, impacts the transcriptional profile of genes involved in tumor angiogenesis and cancer invasion, which are hallmarks of cancer. Cancer-specific canonical pathways and activated upstream regulators are also identified by the differential gene expression signatures of these composite cultures. Additionally, a tumor-associated vascular bed of capillaries is established exhibiting dilated vessel diameters, representative of in vivo tumor physiology. Further, employing aspiration-assisted bioprinting, cancer-endothelial crosstalk, in the form of collective angiogenesis of tumor spheroids bioprinted at close proximity, is identified. Overall, this bottom-up approach of tumor micro-environment fabrication provides an insight into the potential of in vitro tumor models and enables the identification of novel therapeutic targets as a preclinical drug screening platform.",

RhoA GTPase, or its upstream activator ARHGEF11, is fused to BcLOV4, a photoreceptor that can be dynamically recruited to the plasma membrane by a light‐regulated protein‐lipid electrostatic interaction with the inner leaflet. Direct membrane recruitment of these proteins induces potent contractile signaling sufficient to separate adherens junctions with as little as one pulse of blue light. Induced cytoskeletal morphology changes are dependent on the alignment of the spatially patterned stimulation with the underlying cell polarization. RhoA‐mediated cytoskeletal activation drives yes‐associated protein (YAP) nuclear localization within minutes and consequent mechanotransduction verified by YAP‐transcriptional enhanced associate domain transcriptional activity. These single‐transgene tools do not require protein binding partners for dynamic membrane localization and permit spatiotemporally precise control over RhoA signaling to advance the study of its diverse regulatory roles in cell migration, morphogenesis, and cell cycle maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Triacylglycerol (TG) metabolism is tightly regulated to maintain a pool of TG within circulating lipoproteins that can be hydrolyzed in a tissue-specific manner by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to enable the delivery of fatty acids to adipose or oxidative tissues as needed. Elevated serum TG concentrations, which result from a deficiency of LPL activity or, more commonly, an imbalance in the regulation of tissue-specific LPL activities, have been associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease through multiple studies. Among the most critical LPL regulators are the angiopoietin-like (ANGPTL) proteins ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, and ANGPTL8, and a number of different apolipoproteins including apolipoprotein A5 (ApoA5), apolipoprotein C2 (ApoC2), and apolipoprotein C3 (ApoC3). These ANGPTLs and apolipoproteins work together to orchestrate LPL activity and therefore play pivotal roles in TG partitioning, hydrolysis, and utilization. This review summarizes the mechanisms of action, epidemiological findings, and genetic data most relevant to these ANGPTLs and apolipoproteins. The interplay between these important regulators of TG metabolism in both fasted and fed states is highlighted with a holistic view toward understanding key concepts and interactions. Strategies for developing safe and effective therapeutics to reduce circulating TG by selectively targeting these ANGPTLs and apolipoproteins are also discussed.",

Evidence for heritability shows genetic components contributing to 40%–70% of obesity. Monogenic causes and obesity‐related syndromes are discussed and illustrated as well as biological pathways, gene interactions, and factors contributing to the obesity phenotype. Over 550 obesity‐related single genes have been identified and summarized in tabular form with approximately 20% of these genes have been added to obesity gene panels for testing by commercially available laboratories. Early studies show that about 10% of patients with severe obesity using NGS testing have a pathogenic gene variant. Discussion to help characterize gene–gene interactions and disease mechanisms for early diagnosis, treatment, and risk factors contributing to disease is incorporated in this review.",

Relying on their intrinsic tissue adhesion characteristics, ATES systems enable minimally invasive delivery of various scaffolds. This study investigates development of the first class of 3D bioprinted ATES constructs using functionalized hydrogel bioinks. Two ATES delivery strategies, in situ printing onto the adherend versus printing and then transferring to the target surface, are tested using two bioprinting methods, embedded versus air printing. Dopamine‐modified methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA‐Dopa) and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) are used as the main bioink components, enabling fabrication of scaffolds with enhanced adhesion and crosslinking properties. Results demonstrate that dopamine modification improved adhesive properties of the HAMA‐Dopa/GelMA constructs under various loading conditions, while maintaining their structural fidelity, stability, mechanical properties, and biocompatibility. While directly printing onto the adherend yields superior adhesive strength, embedded printing followed by transfer to the target tissue demonstrates greater potential for translational applications. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of bioprinted ATESs as off‐the‐shelf medical devices for diverse biomedical applications.",

The physiological function and bioenergetic capacity of mitochondria are connected to the structure, folding, and organization of its inner‐membrane cristae. During the aging process, mitochondrial dysfunction is observed, and the regulatory balance of mitochondrial dynamics is often disrupted, leading to increased mitochondrial fragmentation in aging cells. Therefore, it is hypothesized that significant morphological changes in BAT mitochondria and cristae will be present with aging. A quantitative 3D electron microscopy approach is developed to map cristae network organization in mouse BAT to test this hypothesis. Using this methodology, the 3D morphology of mitochondrial cristae is investigated in adult (3‐month) and aged (2‐year) murine BAT tissue via serial block face‐scanning electron microscopy (SBF‐SEM) and 3D reconstruction software for manual segmentation, analysis, and quantification. Upon investigation, an increase is found in mitochondrial volume, surface area, and complexity and decreased sphericity in aged BAT, alongside significant decreases in cristae volume, area, perimeter, and score. Overall, these data define the nature of the mitochondrial structure in murine BAT across aging.",

With the development of high-throughput technologies and artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) methods for discovering new lead peptides have been expanded and incorporated into rational drug design.

This paper comprehensively reviews computational models for PepPI and PPI predictions. It begins with an introduction of various databases of peptide ligands and target proteins. Then it discusses data formats and feature representations for proteins and peptides. Furthermore, classical ML methods and emerging deep learning (DL) methods that can be used to train prediction models of PepPI and PPI are classified into four categories, and their advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. To assess the relative performance of different models, different validation protocols and evaluation indexes are discussed. The goal of this review is to help researchers quickly get started to develop computational frameworks using these integrated resources and eventually promote the discovery of lead peptides.",

In planta experimental results show that under drought (15% PEG 6000, polyethylene glycol, mimicking drought stress, 96 h), compared with the control plants, 500 mg L −1 PMO (root application, 96 h) improves maize drought tolerance, showing an increase of root length (21.6%), shoot length (21.2%), fresh weight (7.8%) and total protein (67.2%) content. In addition, PMO significantly decreases the malondialdehyde (MDA) content by 74.7% in maize under drought, compared with the control group. Further, PMO treated maize root apex shows significantly increased mitotic index (MI, 35.5%), and decreased hydrogen peroxide (40.9%). Compared with the control under drought (15% PEG, 96 h), thr root apex of maize plants treated with PMO (500 mg L −1 , root application, 96 h) have significantly lower level of H 2 O 2 . Overall, the results show that PMO can alleviate drought‐inhibited cell mitosis activities via maintaining ROS (reactive oxygen species) homeostasis. In this study, it is not only shown that PMO can be a good nano‐regulator candidate to improve maize drought tolerance, but also that PMO has potential to modulate plant cell mitosis activities.",

Until recently, the main points of interest in the majority of studies have been to combine different materials to control cellular behavior and use different techniques to optimize tissue formation, from 3‐D bioprinting to in situ regeneration. However, with the increase of the understanding of the fundamentals of cellular organization, tissue development, and regeneration, has also come the realization that for the next step in tissue engineering, a higher level of spatiotemporal control on cell‐matrix interactions is required. It is proposed that the combination of artificial cell research with tissue engineering could provide a route toward control over complex tissue development. By equipping artificial cells with the underlying mechanisms of cellular functions, such as communication mechanisms, migration behavior, or the coherent behavior of cells depending on the surrounding matrix properties, they can be applied in instructing native cells into desired differentiation behavior at a resolution not to be attained with traditional matrix materials.",

    "abstract": "In May 2022, there is an International Regulatory and Pharmaceutical Industry (Innovation and Quality [IQ] Microphysiological Systems [MPS] Affiliate) Workshop on the standardization of complex in vitro models (CIVMs) in drug development. This manuscript summarizes the discussions and conclusions of this joint workshop organized and executed by the IQ MPS Affiliate and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A key objective of the workshop is to facilitate discussions around opportunities and/or needs for standardization of MPS and chart potential pathways to increase model utilization in the context of regulatory decision making. Participation in the workshop included 200 attendees from the FDA, IQ MPS Affiliate, and 26 global regulatory organizations and affiliated parties representing Europe, Japan, and Canada. It is agreed that understanding global perspectives regarding the readiness of CIVM/MPS models for regulatory decision making and potential pathways to gaining acceptance is useful to align on globally. The obstacles are currently too great to develop standards for every context of use (COU). Instead, it is suggested that a more tractable approach may be to think of broadly applicable standards that can be applied regardless of COU and/or organ system. Considerations and next steps for this effort are described.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In aging, the organism is unable to counteract certain harmful influences over its lifetime which leads to progressive dysfunction and eventually death, thus delineating aging as one failed process of adaptation to a set of aging stimuli. A central problem in understanding aging is hence to explain why the organism cannot adapt to these aging stimuli. The adaptation–maladaptation theory of aging proposes that in aging adaptation processes such as adaptive transcription, epigenetic remodeling, and metabolic plasticity drive dysfunction themselves over time (maladaptation) and thereby cause aging‐related disorders such as cancer and metabolic dysregulation. The central dilemma of aging is thus that the set of adaptation mechanisms that the body uses to deal with internal and external stressors acts as a stressor itself and cannot be effectively counteracted. The only available option for the organism to decrease maladaptation may be a program to progressively reduce the output of adaptive cascades (e.g., via genomic methylation) which then leads to reduced physiological adaptation capacity and syndromes like frailty, immunosenescence, and cognitive decline. The adaptation–maladaptation dilemma of aging entails that certain biological mechanisms can simultaneously protect against aging as well as drive aging. The key to longevity may lie in uncoupling adaptation from maladaptation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Breast cancer accounts for the highest cancer cases globally, with 12% of occurrences progressing to metastatic breast cancer with a low survival rate and limited effective early intervention strategies augmented by late diagnosis. Moreover, a low concentration of prognostic and predictive markers hinders disease monitoring. Circulating and exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently shown a considerable interplay in breast cancer, standing out as effective diagnostic and prognostic markers. The primary functions are as gene regulatory agents at the genetic and epigenetic levels. An array of dysregulated miRNAs stimulates cancer‐promoting mechanisms, activating oncogenes and controlling tumor‐suppressing genes and mechanisms. Exosomes are vastly studied extracellular vesicles, carrying, and transporting cargo, including noncoding RNAs with premier roles in oncogenesis. Translocation of miRNAs from the circulation to exosomes, with RNA‐binding proteins in stress‐induced conditions, has shown significant cooperation in function to promote breast cancer. This review examines cellular and exosomal miRNA biogenesis and loading, the clinical implications of their dysregulation, their function in diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of breast cancer, and in regulating cancer signaling pathways. The influence of cellular and exosomal miRNAs presents clinical significance on breast cancer diagnosis, subtyping, staging, prediction, and disease monitoring during treatment, hence a potent marker for breast cancer.",

Understanding the events that lead to metastasis is critical to develop better interventions for this disease. Alveolar macrophages are potentially involved in priming the lung microenvironment for OS metastasis, yet the mechanisms involved in this process remain unclear. Since extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a known actor in primary tumor development, their potential role in OS metastagenesis through macrophage modulation is explored here. The interaction of EVs isolated from highly metastatic (K7M2) and less metastatic (K12) osteosarcoma cell lines is compared with a peritoneal macrophage cell line. An EV concentration that reproducibly induced macrophage migration is identified first, then used for later experiments. By confocal microscopy, both EV types associated with M0 or M1 macrophages; however, only K7M2-EVs are associated with M2 macrophages, an interaction that is abrogated by EV pre-treatment with anti-CD47 antibody. Interestingly, all interactions appeared to be surface binding, not internalized. In functional studies, K7M2-EVs polarized fewer macrophages to M1. Together, these data suggest that K7M2-EVs have unique interactions with macrophages that can contribute to the production of a higher proportion of pro-tumor type macrophages, thereby accelerating metastasis.",

Ammonia has a dual role on autophagy, it acts as inducer at low concentrations and as inhibitor at high concentrations. However, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for this switch. Wnt/β‐catenin signalling is emerging for its role in the regulation of ammonia metabolizing enzymes and autophagosome synthesis through c‐Myc. Here, using Huh7 cell line, we show a modulation in c‐Myc expression under different ammonia concentrations. An increase in c‐Myc expression and in its transcriptional regulator β‐catenin was detected at low concentrations of ammonia, when autophagy is active, whereas these modifications were lost under high ammonia concentrations. These observations were also recapitulated in the livers of spf‐ash mice, a model of constitutive hyperammonaemia due to deficiency in ornithine transcarbamylase enzyme. Moreover, c‐Myc‐mediated activation of autophagy plays a cytoprotective role in cells under ammonia stress conditions as confirmed through the pharmacological inhibition of c‐Myc in Huh7 cells treated with low ammonia concentrations. In conclusion, the unravelled role of c‐Myc in modulating ammonia induced autophagy opens new landscapes for the development of novel strategies for the treatment of hyperammonemia.",

Due to the unknown underlying molecular mechanisms, in vivo murine models and in vitro human cellular models are developed to study the syndrome. These models are used to analyze various aspects of the pathology by replicating the conditions of the syndrome. Even though the complexity of polycystic ovary syndrome and the challenge of reproducing all its features leave several questions unanswered, studies conducted to date have elucidated some of the alterations in ovarian follicle molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the syndrome, and do not require the employment of complex and invasive techniques on human patients. This review examines ovarian functions and their alterations in polycystic ovary syndrome, explores preclinical in vivo and in vitro models, and highlights emerging research and medical perspectives. It targets researchers, healthcare professionals, and academics, including endocrinologists, cell biologists, and reproductive medicine specialists, studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the syndrome.",

Discussions are ongoing about the feasibility of addressing the organ shortage through measures like increasing organ donations, improving post‐transplant outcomes, and xenotransplantation. This paper examines the rationale, risks, and costs of xenotransplantation, such as xenozoonoses, creating a new form of industrialized animal farming, abandoning animal ethics principles, and the opportunity costs of investing finite research dollars in xenotransplantation instead of investing in more viable strategies. Alternative strategies that can ethically and effectively address the demand for heart, kidney, and other transplants are recommended: Improving disease prevention and management to reduce demand for transplant organs, improving transplantation methods, and systemic changes to donor policies and organ recovery methods to increase overall supply. Upon careful exploration of the full landscape of organ transplantation, it is considered whether these alternative strategies that do not impose the definite harms and significant risks of xenotransplantation are the most ethical and effective means to increase life‐saving options and improve clinical outcomes for patients in organ failure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bone metastasis is a devastating complication for advanced‐stage prostate cancer patients. Osteocytes, as the primary mechanosensors in bone, have been recently investigated for their role in prostate cancer bone metastasis. In vivo findings show potential benefits of exercise as a preventative intervention strategy for bone metastasis. In contrast, in vitro studies indicate direct prostate cancer‐osteocyte interactions under mechanical loading promote prostate cancer growth and migration. These findings are not consistent with in vivo results and may be more reflective of late‐stage metastatic colonization. Here, the role of flow‐stimulated osteocytes during early‐stage bone metastasis, particularly prostate cancer‐endothelial interactions, is examined. Flow‐stimulated osteocytes reduce PC‐3 prostate cancer cell adhesion and trans‐endothelial migration by 32.3% and 40% compared to static controls. Both MLO‐Y4 and primary murine osteocytes under mechanical loading regulate the extravasation distance and frequency of PC‐3 cells in a microfluidic tissue model. Application of vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM‐1) neutralizing antibody abolishes the difference in cancer cell adhesion, extravasation frequency, and number of extravasated PC‐3 cells between static and flow‐stimulated groups. Taken together, the role of osteocytes in early‐stage bone metastasis using PC‐3 cells as a model is demonstrated here, bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo findings.",

This study evaluated the roles of cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) after cartilage injury in both juvenile and adult mice and attempted to correlate these with cartilage progenitor cells and age-related differences in cartilage regeneration. Full-thickness cartilage defects were created in the femoral trochlea of knee joints in both 4-week-old (juvenile) and 8-week-old (adult) mice. Adult mice showed higher ROS peaks than juveniles at day 7 post-injury. Protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) significantly decreased after surgery, while interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels displayed no significant change. There were more cartilage progenitor cells together with more cell proliferation in juvenile versus adult mice, while there was much less apoptosis of cartilage progenitor cells in juvenile mice compared to adult mice. ROS inhibition enhanced cartilage regeneration in adult mice by promoting progenitor cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis, mimicking the regenerative pattern seen in juveniles. This study demonstrated that inhibiting ROS in adult mice promoted cartilage regeneration, possibly by enhancing proliferation and decreasing apoptosis of cartilage progenitor cells.",

The optimized process, compatible with a robotic liquid handling system (LiHa), reduces production time by half. Additionally, incorporation of an automated tissue dissociator‐based emulsification increases batch size 30‐fold while preserving SC characteristics. To assess SC quality and protein synthesis, artificial intelligence (AI)‐based image analysis is employed, allowing for automated, accurate and high‐throughput SC characterization. Large‐scale luciferase‐expressing SCs from a single homogeneous batch are administered to mice, allowing for real‐time monitoring of protein expression and reducing experimental variability.

To prevent undue activation of T cells, inhibitory molecules including PD-1 (programmed death 1) are induced and function as brakes for T cell signaling. In a steady state, the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC, CD273) maintains peripheral immune tolerance. However, the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and interaction with PD-1 on T cells dampen anti-tumor immunity. Therapeutic inhibitors of the PD-1 pathway have revolutionized tumor immunotherapy. Unfortunately, the majority of patients do not develop sustained anti-tumor responses. However, the knowledge about unique PD-1 interactions and their role in mediating PD-1 inhibitory signals is currently limited. Advances in the mechanistic understanding of the molecular and signaling integration of the PD-1 pathway could unleash the great potential in tumor immunotherapy by allowing the development of combinatorial approaches that target not only PD-1 and its ligands but also its unique downstream signal mediators. In this review, the current advances in understanding the mechanisms of extracellular and intracellular PD-1 interactions and their significance in potential future therapeutic approaches are discussed.",

Macrophages are regulated dynamically in response to environmental cues. However, the underlying mechanisms by which UMSC‐Exos regulate macrophage polarization are still not well understood. Herein, it is aimed to explore the effects of UMSC‐Exos on macrophage polarization and their roles in cardiac repair after myocardial infarction (MI). These results show that UMSC‐Exos improve cardiac function by increasing M2 macrophage polarization and reducing excessive inflammation. RNA‐sequencing results identify Plcb3 as a key gene involved in UMSC‐Exo‐facilitated M2 macrophage polarization. Further bioinformatic analysis identifies exosomal miR‐24‐3p as a potential effector mediating Plcb3 downregulation in macrophages. Increasing miR‐24‐3p expression in macrophages effectively enhances M2 macrophage polarization by suppressing Plcb3 expression and NF‐κB pathway activation in the inflammatory environment. Furthermore, reducing miR‐24‐3p expression in UMSC‐Exos attenuates the effects of UMSC‐Exos on M2 macrophage polarization. This study demonstrates that the cardiac therapeutic effects of UMSC‐Exos are at least partially through promoting M2 macrophage polarization in an inflammatory microenvironment. Mechanistically, exosomal miR‐24‐3p is found to inhibit Plcb3 expression and NF‐κB pathway activation to promote M2 macrophage polarization.",

However, the mechanisms in which the tumor‐adipocyte crosstalk may enable the properties and plasticity of macrophages remain unclear. The single‐cell RNA‐sequence profiling reveals that a subset of macrophages expressed CD163, CCL2, and CCL5 in TAME, exhibiting an immunosuppressive subtype. It is demonstrated that CD163 + macrophages aggregate to surround adipocytes in breast cancer tissues. The expressions of CCL2 and CCL5 are also elevated in TAME and enable the recruitment and polarize macrophages. Mechanically, the level of exosomal miRNA‐155 increased in the coculture of tumor cells and adipocytes, and then it promoted the generation and release of CCL2 and CCL5 from adipocytes by targeting the SOCS6/STAT3 pathway. Inhibition of exosomal miRNA‐155 in tumor cells reduced the CCL2 and CCL5 levels in tumor‐adipocytes coculture and further retarded tumor growth. Finally, the deletion of macrophages partially inhibited adipocyte‐induced tumor proliferation. Likewise, inhibiting chemokines and their receptors or suppressing the phosphorylation of STAT3 decreased tumor burden in preclinical models. These results demonstrate that the niche factors in TAME, such as exosomal miRNA‐155, regulate the function and polarity of macrophages to facilitate tumor progression.",

    "abstract": "In humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can cause medical complications across various tissues and organs. Despite the advances to understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, its tissue tropism and interactions with host cells have not been fully understood. Existing clinical data have revealed disordered calcium and phosphorus metabolism in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, suggesting possible infection or damage in the human skeleton system by SARS-CoV-2. Herein, SARS-CoV-2 infection in mouse models with wild-type and beta strain (B.1.351) viruses is investigated, and it is found that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) can be efficiently infected in vivo. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analyses of infected BMMs identify distinct clusters of susceptible macrophages, including those related to osteoblast differentiation. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 entry on BMMs is dependent on the expression of neuropilin-1 (NRP1) rather than the widely recognized receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The loss of NRP1 expression during BMM-to-osteoclast differentiation or NRP1 neutralization and knockdown can significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in BMMs. Importantly, it is found that authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection impedes BMM-to-osteoclast differentiation. Collectively, this study provides evidence for NRP1-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection in BMMs and establishes a potential link between disturbed osteoclast differentiation and disordered skeleton metabolism in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Brain tumors are devastating diseases of the central nervous system. Brain tumor pathogenesis depends on both tumor‐intrinsic oncogenic programs and extrinsic microenvironmental factors, including neurons and glial cells. Glial cells (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia) make up half of the cells in the brain, and interact with neurons to modulate neurodevelopment and plasticity. Many brain tumor cells exhibit transcriptomic profiles similar to macroglial cells (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) and their progenitors, making them likely to subvert existing neuron–glial interactions to support tumor pathogenesis. For example, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, a putative glioma cell of origin, can form bona fide synapses with neurons. Such synapses are recently identified in gliomas and drive glioma pathophysiology, underscoring how brain tumor cells can take advantage of neuron–glial interactions to support cancer progression. In this review, it is briefly summarized how neurons and their activity normally interact with glial cells and glial progenitors, and it is discussed how brain tumor cells utilize neuron–glial interactions to support tumor initiation and progression. Unresolved questions on these topics and potential avenues to therapeutically target neuron–glia–cancer interactions in the brain are also pointed out.",

Herein, a unique design is presented to develop a microfluidic site‐specific atherothrombosis‐on‐chip model, providing a universal platform for studying the crosstalk between blood cells and plaque components. The device consists of two interconnected microchannels, namely main and supporting channels: the former mimics the vessel geometry with different stenosis, and the latter introduces plaque components to the circulation simultaneously. The unique design allows the site‐specific introduction of plaque components in stenosed channels ranging from 0% to above 50%, resulting in thrombosis, which has not been achieved previously. The device successfully explains the correlation between vessel geometry and thrombus formation phenomenon as well as the influence of shear rate on platelet aggregation, confirming the reliability and the effectiveness of the design. The device exhibits significant sensitivity to aspirin. In therapeutic doses (50 × 10 −6 and 100 × 10 −6 m ), aspirin delays and prevents platelet adhesion, thereby reducing the thrombus area in a dose‐dependent manner. Finally, the device is effectively employed in testing the targeted binding of the RGD (arginyl‐glycyl‐aspartic acid) labeled polymeric nanoparticles on the thrombus, extending the use of the device to examine targeted drug carriers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neuropeptides are small regulatory molecules found throughout the body, most notably in the nervous, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. They serve as neurotransmitters or hormones in the regulation of diverse physiological processes. Cancer cells escape normal growth control mechanisms by altering their expression of growth factors, receptors, or intracellular signals, and neuropeptides have recently been recognized as mitogens in cancer growth and development. Many neuropeptides and their receptors exist in multiple subtypes, coupling with different downstream signaling pathways and playing distinct roles in cancer progression. The consideration of neuropeptide/receptor systems as anticancer targets is already leading to new biological and diagnostic knowledge that has the potential to enhance the understanding and treatment of cancer. In this review, recent discoveries regarding neuropeptides in a wide range of cancers, emphasizing their mechanisms of action, signaling cascades, regulation, and therapeutic potential, are discussed. Current technologies used to manipulate and analyze neuropeptides/receptors are described. Applications of neuropeptide analogs and their receptor inhibitors in translational studies and radio‐oncology are rapidly increasing, and the possibility for their integration into therapeutic trials and clinical treatment appears promising.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite current efforts in organ‐on‐chip engineering to construct miniature cardiac models, they often lack some physiological aspects of the heart, including fiber orientation. This motivates the development of bioartificial left ventricle models that mimic the myofiber orientation of the native ventricle. Herein, an approach relying on microfabricated elastomers that enables hierarchical assembly of 2D aligned cell sheets into a functional conical cardiac ventricle is described. Soft lithography and injection molding techniques are used to fabricate micro‐grooves on an elastomeric polymer scaffold with three different orientations ranging from −60° to +60°, each on a separate trapezoidal construct. The width of the micro‐grooves is optimized to direct the majority of cells along the groove direction and while periodic breaks are used to promote cell–cell contact. The scaffold is wrapped around a central mandrel to obtain a conical‐shaped left ventricle model inspired by the size of a human left ventricle 19 weeks post‐gestation. Rectangular micro‐scale holes are incorporated to alleviate oxygen diffusional limitations within the 3D scaffold. Cardiomyocytes within the 3D left ventricle constructs showed high viability in all layers after 7 days of cultivation. The hierarchically assembled left ventricle also provided functional readouts such as calcium transients and ejection fraction.",

However, it is difficult to unravel the causative relationship between glymphatic dysfunction, AQP4 depolarization, protein aggregation, and inflammation in neurodegeneration using animal models alone. There is currently a clear, unmet need for in vitro models of the brain's waterscape, and the first steps towards a bona fide \"glymphatics-on-a-chip\" are taken in the present study. It is demonstrated that chronic exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), amyloid-β(1-42) oligomers, and an AQP4 inhibitor impairs the drainage of fluid and amyloid-β(1-40) tracer in a gliovascular unit (GVU)-on-a-chip model containing human astrocytes and brain microvascular endothelial cells. The LPS-induced drainage impairment is partially retained following cell lysis, indicating that neuroinflammation induces parallel changes in cell-dependent and matrisome-dependent fluid transport pathways in GVU-on-a-chip. Additionally, AQP4 depolarization is observed following LPS treatment, suggesting that LPS-induced drainage impairments on-chip may be driven in part by changes in AQP4-dependent fluid dynamics.",

Intermittent fasting is a relatively new intervention that contributes to weight reduction. Considering the intimate relationship between obesity and inflammatory pathologies with gut microbiota alterations, a systematic review of the literature was herein conducted to elucidate the relationship between time‐restricted food intake and gut microbiota diversity in humans. Searches are carried out in three databases (PubMed, MedLine/OVID, and Academic Search Complete) between April 2019 and April 2022. Nine studies (all with longitudinal design) were identified as eligible by presenting data about the impact of intermittent fasting schemes on gut microbiota. At the phylum level, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increase throughout follow‐ups, while 16 bacteria genera change their abundance in response to intermittent fasting. Finally, some genera associated with clinical predictors such as weight change, abdominal circumference, and metabolic variables were reported. Changes induced by fasting schemes positively impact the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota and the biomarkers described here. However, the changes previously reported have been studied in short periods and some return to their basal state after fasting intervention.",

The different polymorphs show conformational changes in the macrocyclic core, as well as the cyclopropyl sulfonamide and methyl pyrazinamide substituents. Molecular docking shows that one of the conformations fits well into the active site pocket of the HCV non-structural 3/4A (NS3/4A) serine protease target, and can interact with the pocket and catalytic triad via hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. These results can provide further insight for optimization of the binding of acyl sulfonamide inhibitors to the HCV NS3/4A serine protease. In addition, this also demonstrates the opportunity to derive different polymorphs and distinct macrocycle conformations from the same experiments using MicroED.",

Despite cytotoxic lymphocyte activity against transformed cells, a tumor can escape immune surveillance and leverage chronic inflammation to maintain its own development.

Here, a comprehensive review of the formation of the immune profile in breast cancer patients is offered. The interplay between systemic and local immune reactions as self‐sustaining mechanism of tumor progression is described and the functional activity of the main cell populations related to innate and adaptive immunity is discussed. Additionally, the interaction between different functional levels of the immune system and their contribution to the development of the pro‐ or anti‐tumor immune response in BC is highlighted.

Neuronal somas and neurites form adhesions and F‐actin accumulations around the pillars indicating a close contact to the topography. In addition, higher pillars (400 nm) confine the growing neurites, resulting in greater neurite alignment to the topographical pattern compared to lower pillars (100 nm). A comprehensive analysis of growth cone dynamics during axon development shows that nanopillars induce earlier axon establishment and change the periodicity of growth cone dynamics by promoting elongation. This results in longer axons compared to the flat substrate. Finally, the increase in surface area available for growth cone coupling provided by nanopillar sidewalls is correlated with increased assembly of paxillin‐rich point contact adhesions and a reduction in actin retrograde flow rates allowing for accelerated and persistent neurite outgrowth.",

Yet, and despite the predominantly nonplanar geometry of these environments, the impact of tissue-size (milliscale) curvature on cell behavior is largely overlooked or underestimated. This study explores how concave, hemicylinder-shaped surfaces 3-50 mm in diameter affect the migration, proliferation, orientation, and differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Notably, these milliscale cues significantly affect cell responses compared with planar substrates, with myoblasts grown on surfaces 7.5-15 mm in diameter showing prevalent migration and alignment parallel to the curvature axis. Moreover, surfaces within this curvature range promote myoblast differentiation and the formation of denser, more compact tissues comprising highly oriented multinucleated myotubes. Based on the similarity of effects, it is further proposed that myoblast susceptibility to substrate curvature depends on mechanotransduction signaling. This model thus supports the notion that cellular responses to substrate curvature and compliance share the same molecular pathways and that control of cell behavior can be achieved via modulation of either individual parameter or in combination. This correlation is relevant for elucidating how muscle tissue forms and heals, as well as for designing better biomaterials and more appropriate cell-surface interfaces.",

In vitro reconstructions of alveolar‐capillary barrier supported on synthetic scaffolds closely resembling the fibrous and ultra‐thin natural BM are essential in mimicking the lung pathophysiology. Although BM topology and dimensions are well known to significantly influence cellular behavior, conventionally used BM mimics fail to recreate this natural niche. To overcome this, electrospun ultra‐thin 2 µm poly(caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibrous mesh is used to establish an alveolar‐capillary barrier model of lung endothelial/epithelial cells. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and permeability studies reveal integral tight junctions and improved mass transport through the highly porous PCL meshes compared to conventional dense membranes with etched pores. The chemotaxis of neutrophils is shown across the barrier in presence of inflammatory response that is naturally impeded in confined regions. Conventional requirement of 3 µm or larger pore size can lead to barrier disruption due to epithelial/endothelial cell invasion. Despite high porosity, the interconnected BM mimic prevents barrier disruption and allows neutrophil transmigration, thereby demonstrating the physiological relevance of the thin nanofibrous meshes. It is envisioned that these bipolar cultured barriers would contribute to an organ‐level in vitro model for pathological disease, environmental pollutants, and nanotoxicology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A continuous, sealed endothelial membrane is essential for the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to protect neurons from toxins present in systemic circulation. Endothelial cells are critical sensors of the capillary environment, where factors like fluid shear stress (FSS) and systemic signaling molecules activate intracellular pathways that either promote or disrupt the BBB. The brain vasculature exhibits complex heterogeneity across the bed, which is challenging to recapitulate in BBB microfluidic models with fixed dimensions and rectangular cross‐section microchannels. Here, a Cayley‐tree pattern, fabricated using lithography‐less, fluid shaping technique in a modified Hele‐Shaw cell is used to emulate the brain vasculature in a microfluidic chip. This geometry generates an inherent distribution of heterogeneous FSS, due to smooth variations in branch height and width. hCMEC/D3 endothelial cells cultured in the Cayley‐tree designed chip generate a 3D monolayer of brain endothelium with branching hierarchy, enabling the study of the effect of heterogeneous FSS on the brain endothelium. The model is employed to study neuroinflammatory conditions by stimulating the brain endothelium with tumor necrosis factor‐α under heterogeneous FSS conditions. The model has immense potential for studies involving drug transport across the BBB, which can be misrepresented in fixed dimension models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Approximately 90% of breast cancer related mortalities are due to metastasis to distant organs. At the metastatic sites, cancer cells are capable of evading death by exhibiting cellular or mass dormancy. However, the mechanisms involved in attaining dormancy at the metastatic site are not well understood. This is partly due to the lack of experimental models to study metastatic site‐specific interactions, particularly in the context of brain metastatic breast cancer (BMBC). Herein, an in vitro hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel‐based model is developed to study mass dormancy in BMBC. HA hydrogels with a stiffness of ≈0.4 kPa are utilized to mimic the brain extracellular matrix. MDA‐MB‐231Br or BT474Br3 BMBC spheroids are prepared and cultured on top of HA hydrogels or in suspension for 7 days. HA hydrogel induced a near mass dormant state in spheroids by achieving a balance between proliferating and dead cells. In contrast, these spheroids displayed growth in suspension cultures. The ratio of %p‐ERK to %p‐p38 positive cells is significantly lower in HA hydrogels compared to suspension cultures. Further, it is demonstrated that hydrogel induced mass dormant state is reversible. Overall, such models provide useful tools to study dormancy in BMBC and could be employed for drug screening.",

Through engineering cell fibers (which are fibers containing living cells) as living building blocks with the help of emerging “bottom‐up” biomanufacturing technologies, it is now possible to reconstitute/recreate the fiber‐like fascicle morphologies and their spatiotemporally specific cell‐cell/cell‐ECM interactions in vitro, thereby enabling the modeling, therapy, or repair of these fibrous tissues. In this article, a concise review is provided of the “bottom‐up” biomanufacturing technologies and materials usable for fabricating cell fibers, with an emphasis on electrospinning that can effectively and efficiently produce thin cell fibers and with properly designed processes, 3D cell‐laden structures that mimic those of native fibrous tissues. The importance and applications of cell fibers as models, therapeutic platforms, or analogs/replacements for tissues for areas such as drug testing, cell therapy, and tissue engineering are highlighted. Challenges, in terms of biomimicry of high‐order hierarchical structures and complex dynamic cellular microenvironments of native tissues, as well as opportunities for cell fibers in a myriad of biomedical applications, are discussed.",

By using purified FtsZ and its membrane‐binding protein FtsA or the gain‐of‐function mutant FtsA* expressed in PURE (Protein synthesis Using Reconstituted Elements) from a DNA template, it is shown in this study that cytoskeletal structures are formed, and yield constricted liposomes exhibiting various morphologies. However, the resulting buds remain attached to the parental liposome by a narrow membrane neck. No division events can be monitored even after long‐time tracking by fluorescence microscopy, nor when the osmolarity of the external solution is increased. The results provide evidence that reconstituted FtsA‐FtsZ proto‐rings coating the membrane necks are too stable to enable abscission.

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are key regulators of brain homeostasis, equilibrating ion, water, and neurotransmitter concentrations and maintaining essential conditions for proper cognitive function. Recently, it has been shown that the excitability of the actin cytoskeleton manifests in second-scale dynamic fluctuations and acts as a sensor of chemophysical environmental cues. However, it is not known whether the cytoskeleton is excitable in astrocytes and how the homeostatic function of astrocytes is linked to the dynamics of the cytoskeleton. Here it is shown that homeostatic regulation involves the excitable dynamics of actin in certain subcellular regions of astrocytes, especially near the cell boundary. The results further indicate that actin dynamics concentrate into \"hotspot\" regions that selectively respond to certain chemophysical stimuli, specifically the homeostatic challenges of ion or water concentration increases. Substrate topography makes the actin dynamics of astrocytes weaker. Super-resolution images demonstrate that surface topography is also associated with the predominant perpendicular alignment of actin filaments near the cell boundary, whereas flat substrates result in an actin cortex mainly parallel to the cell boundary. Additionally, coculture with neurons increases both the probability of actin dynamics and the strength of hotspots. The excitable systems character of actin thus makes astrocytes direct participants in neural cell network dynamics.",

Here, the U87 glioblastoma cell line in the presence/absence of primary astrocytes is studied. Thiolated hyaluronic acid (HA-SH) hydrogel reinforced with microfiber scaffolds is compared to Matrigel. Hyaluronic acid is a major extracellular matrix (ECM) component in the brain. Poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds are written by meltelectrowriting in a box and triangular shaped design with pore sizes of 200 µm. Scaffolds are composed of 10-layers of PCL microfibers. It is found that scaffold design has an impact on cellular morphology in the absence of hydrogel. Moreover, the used hydrogels have profound influences on cellular morphology resulting in spheroid formation in HA-SH for both the tumor-derived cell line and astrocytes, while cell viability is high. Although cocultures of U87 and astrocytes exhibit cell-cell interactions, polynucleated spheroid formation is still present for U87 cells in HA-SH. Locally restricted ECM production or inability to secrete ECM proteins may underlie the observed cell morphologies. Thus, the 3D reinforced PCL-HA-SH composite with glioma-like cells and astrocytes constitutes a reproducible system to further investigate the impact of hydrogel modifications on cellular behavior and development.",

The addition of lanthanum oxide nanoparticles facilitates good osseointegration coupled with simultaneous activation of proangiogenic properties to act as a bone mimicking material. The minimal level of reactive oxygen species and superior cytocompatibility help the as‐synthesized biomatrix in achieving capillary migration into the bone micro environment. The composite biomatrix upregulates the expression of VEGF, VEGF‐R2 genes in endothelial cells and osteopontin, osteocalcin in osteoblasts cells, respectively. The in vivo hard tissue repair experiment conducted in a rat model shows complete healing of the bone defect by eight weeks with the application of collagen‐ƙ‐carrageenan‐hydroxyapatite‐lanthanum oxide nanoparticle biomaterial when compared to the biomaterial made out of individual constituents alone. The biomaterial matrix gets biointegrated into the bone tissue and exerts its therapeutic value in bringing a faster osseo repair process. The study shows the feasibility of using rare‐earth metal nanoparticles in combination with protein‐polysaccharide biopolymers for bone regeneration.",

The expression of CD63 has been shown to get altered in several cancers, where it has been demonstrated to act as both a tumor promoter and tumor suppressor. The present review describes the mechanism of how CD63 promotes tumor formation in certain cancer types while inhibiting in some other specific cancers. Glycosylation, a post-translational process plays a significant role in regulating the expression and function of these membrane proteins. Being a crucial exosomal flag protein, CD63 has been found to get involved in endosomal cargo sorting as well as the production of extracellular vesicles. Increased expression of exosomal CD63 derived from advanced tumors has demonstrated its role in promoting metastasis. CD63 also regulates the characteristic and function of stem cells on which they get expressed. This particular tetraspanin has been discovered to participate in gene fusion to perform distinctive roles in certain specific cancer types like breast cancer and pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma. Furthermore, this review mentions twelve different microRNAs obtained from miRDB that might target CD63. A few theragnostic uses of this membrane protein are also discussed. Thereby, the review indicates that further studies on CD63 might prove it to be an effective therapeutic target in different cancers in the coming future.",

During iron starvation, HapX represses genes involved in iron consuming pathways and upon a shift to iron excess, HapX activates these same genes. SreA blocks the expression of genes needed for iron uptake during periods of iron availability. Both proteins possess cysteine‐rich regions (CRR) that are hypothesized to be necessary for the sensing of iron levels. However, the contribution of each of these domains to the function of the protein has remained unclear. Here, the ability of peptide analogs of each CRR is determined to bind an iron‐sulfur cluster in vitro. UV–vis and resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopies reveal that each CRR is capable of coordinating a [2Fe‐2S] cluster with comparable affinities. The iron–sulfur cluster coordinated to the CRR‐B domain of HapX displays particularly high stability. The data are consistent with HapX and SreA mediating responses to cellular iron levels through the direct coordination of [2Fe‐2S] clusters. The high stability of the CRR‐B peptide may also find use as a starting point for the development of new green catalysts.",

Small EVs, also called exosomes, are lipid-bound particles (≈30-150 nm) that play a role in healthy and pathophysiological interactions, including intercellular communication, by transporting bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Their ability to cross biological barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier, makes them ideal candidates for targeted therapeutic interventions. In the context of chronic diseases, exosomes can be engineered to deliver active agents, including small molecules and siRNAs to specific target cells, providing a novel approach to precision medicine. Moreover, exosomes show great promise as repositories for diagnostic biomarkers. Their cargo can reflect the physiological and pathological status of the parent cells, making them valuable indicators of disease progression and response to treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of exosomes in four chronic diseases: cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, and orthopedic disease, which significantly impact global public health due to their high prevalence and associated morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, the potential of exosomes as valuable tools for theranostics and disease management is highlighted.

Here, TP53 is knocked out in hPSCs using CRISPR-Cas9 and compared them with isogenic wild-type hPSCs and human germ cell tumor lines as models of malignancy. While no major changes in proliferation, pluripotency, and transcriptomic profiles are found, mutant lines display aberrations in some of the main chromosomal hotspots for genetic abnormalities in hPSCs. Additionally, enhanced clonogenic and anchorage-free growth, alongside resistance to chemotherapeutic compounds is observed.

Previous attempts at engineering secretion for synthetic cells have been confined to non‐specific cargo release via membrane pores, limiting the spatiotemporal precision and specificity necessary for selective secretion. Here, a protein‐based platform termed TEV Protease‐mediated Releasable Actin‐binding Protein (TRAP) is designed and constructed for selective, rapid, and triggerable secretion in synthetic cells. TRAP is designed to bind tightly to reconstituted actin networks and is proteolytically released from bound actin, followed by secretion via cell‐penetrating peptide membrane translocation. TRAP's efficacy in facilitating light‐activated secretion of both fluorescent and luminescent proteins is demonstrated. By equipping synthetic cells with a controlled secretion mechanism, TRAP paves the way for the development of stimuli‐responsive biomaterials, versatile synthetic cell‐based biosensing systems, and therapeutic applications through the integration of synthetic cells with living cells for targeted delivery of protein therapeutics.",

ACSM3 expression in OC tissues and cells is detected by real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, or western blot. The influences of ACSM3 on OC progression are assessed in vitro and in vivo experiments. Gene set enrichment analysis is performed to find significantly enriched pathways related to ACSM3. In this study, ACSM3 expression in OC tissues and cells is downregulated. ACSM3 inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Knockdown of ACSM3 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, inhibited cell apoptosis, and activated JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in SKOV3 cells, while overexpression of ACSM3 in A2780 cells led to the opposite results. Moreover, treatment with interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) in A2780 cells reversed the effects of ACSM3 on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, but IFN‐γ further enhanced the effects of ACSM3 knockdown on SKOV3 cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. In conclusion, ACSM3 inhibited OC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis by suppressing the IFN‐γ/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, which might provide a promising therapeutic target for OC treatment.",

This investigation compares 3D spheroids with 2D mono‐cultured iBCECs derived from two different hiPSC lines and two differentiation strategies. It is observed that spheroid properties vary depending on the differentiation strategy or type of hiPSC line applied for model generation. However, spheroids demonstrate in‐vivo like tight junction ultrastructure and, in comparison to 2D models, higher transcript expression of BBB specific genes. Furthermore, they possess characteristic barrier integrity, barrier functionality, and protein expression. It is inferred that hiPSC‐derived BBB spheroids hold a strong potential as a reliable future BBB in‐vitro test system.",

It plays a crucial role in the development of malignancies and therapy resistance. Since its discovery in eukaryotic cells more than half a century ago, the biological characteristics and functions of ecDNA have remained unclear due to limitations in detection methods. However, recent advancements in research tools have transformed ecDNA research. It is believed that ecDNA exhibits greater activity in the abnormal amplification of oncogenes, thereby driving cancer progression through their overexpression. Notably, compared to linear DNA, ecDNA can also function as a genomic element with regulatory roles, including both trans‐ and cis‐acting functions. Its critical roles in tumorigenesis, evolution, progression, and drug resistance in malignant tumors are increasingly recognized. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the evolutionary context of ecDNA and highlights significant progress in understanding its biological functions and potential applications as a therapeutic target in malignant tumors.",

The global prevalence of neurological diseases, such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease has seen a significant rise due to the increasing proportion of the aging population. The discovery of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) genome editing technique has paved way for universal neurological diseases treatment. However, finding a safe and effective method to deliver CRISPR gene‐editing tools remains a main challenge for genome editing therapies in vivo. Adeno‐associated virus (AAV) is currently one of the most commonly used vector systems, but some issues remain unresolved, including capsid immunogenicity, off‐target mutations, and potential genotoxicity. To address these concerns, researchers are actively encouraging the development of new delivery systems, like virus‐like particles and nanoparticles. These novel systems have the potential to enhance targeting efficiency, thereby offering possible solutions to the current challenges. This article reviews CRISPR delivery vectors for neurological disorders treatment and explores potential solutions to overcome limitations in vector systems. Additionally, the delivery strategies of CRISPR systems are highlighted as valuable tools for studying neurological diseases, and the challenges and opportunities that these vectors present.",

The BLCA data from TCGA and several external sources are utilized to generate a novel ligand, receptor, and transcription factor (LRT) associated molecular subtype and their corresponding score (LRT score). The LRT‐mediated molecular subtype is identified via unsupervised clustering. LRT score is measured by principal component analysis. Then, the association of LRT clusters to established MS, immunophenotypes, and medical endpoints, together with BLCA treatment strategies is investigated. Two LRT clusters (A and B) are identified. LRT cluster (LRT score) can precisely propose immunophenotypes, classical MS, clinical outcomes, and BLCA therapeutic strategies. Cluster B (Low LRT score) represent a basal subtype and inflamed phenotype specified by high immunity against tumors and unfavorable clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it is highly sensitive to cancer immunotherapy; however, it has low sensitivity to antiangiogenic and targeted therapies. The novel LRT clusters with a strong association with biological characteristics and precise BLCA treatment strategies are derived from the communication between cancer cells and cancer‐associated fibroblasts.

Histological AVF changes are analyzed using hematoxylin‐eosin. Western blot and quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) are utilized to detect prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 ( PTGS2 ) expression. In vivo, luteolin inhibits neointima formation and reduces vimentin, α‐SMA, MCP‐1, MMP‐9, TNF‐α, and IL‐6 levels. In vitro, under PDGF‐BB treatment, luteolin inhibits proliferation and migration and reduces TNF‐α, vimentin, α‐SMA, MCP‐1, MMP‐9, and IL‐6 levels in VSMCs. In rat AVF tissues, PTGS2 expression is increased. Luteolin inhibits PTGS2 expression in vivo and in vitro. PTGS2 overexpression reverses the role of luteolin in extracellular matrix protein expression, proliferation, inflammation, and migration in VSMCs treated with PDGF‐BB.

The aim of the present study was to comparatively evaluate dHAM‐E and dHAM‐S prepared by enzymatic and salt solution treatment respectively for their microstructure using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), in vitro biocompatibility with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and regenerative capability in full‐thickness wound model in mice. The SEM results revealed increased porosity in dHAM‐S and better MSC adhesion and proliferation as compared to dHAM‐E. Moreover, wound healing capability assessed at day 7 and day 14 by histological analysis of the regenerated tissues indicated that the dHAM treated groups achieved greater re‐epithelialization and remodeling than the untreated group. However, dHAM‐S treated samples presented a more remodeled regenerated skin than the other groups. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of the regenerated skin displayed a higher expression of anti‐inflammatory, proliferation, and keratinization marker genes in the dHAM treated groups. Overall, it was found that dHAMs are compatible with MSCs and improve wound healing. However, clear differences were observed in the bioactivity of the two dHAMs.",

After accounting for the relationship between body weight and lifespan, lifespan is negatively correlated with proteome size in birds and, to a weaker extent, in fish, and positively correlated with lifespan in mammals. Proteome composition varies amongst the four vertebrate classes, but there is no evidence that any specific amino acid correlated with lifespan.

An asymmetric 3D hydrogel bilayer platform is engineered with tunable physical constraints to mimic the regenerating MuSC niche. These results demonstrate that increased 3D confinement maintains Pax7 expression, reduces MuSC activation and proliferation, inhibits differentiation, and is associated with smaller nuclear size and decreased H4K16ac levels, suggesting that mechanical confinement modulates both nuclear architecture and epigenetic regulation. MuSCs in unconfined 2D environments exhibit larger nuclei and higher H4K16ac expression compared to those in more confined 3D conditions, leading to progressive activation, expansion, and myogenic commitment. This study highlights the importance of 3D mechanical cues in MuSC fate regulation, with 3D confinement acting as a mechanical brake on myogenic commitment, offering novel insights into the mechano-epigenetic mechanisms that govern MuSC behavior during muscle regeneration.",

The effect of IER3 on the glycolytic ability of OSCC cells is validated by detecting the extracellular acidification rate and oxygen consumption rate. Additionally, glycolysis- and wnt/β-catenin signaling-associated protein expressions are examined by western blot. Besides, a mouse tumor xenograft model is established to evaluate the effect of IER3 on tumor progression. IER3 expression is upregulated in OSCC cells and tissues. IER3 enhanced tumor cells' malignant behaviors and also promoted the glycolysis of OSCC cells. Moreover, IER3 is verified to promote the activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling in OSCC. Besides, rescue experiments further proved that IER3 knockdown can inhibit the malignant biological behavior of OSCC cells through inactivating wnt/β-catenin signaling.

These mechanisms are not inherently beneficial for the rate of enzymatic processes but can also inhibit a reaction. Similarly, some aspects of condensates are likely intrinsically inhibitory including retardation of diffusion, where the net effect of a condensate will be a trade‐off between inhibitory and stimulatory effects.

Research shows that EV cargo and function are influenced by factors including age, disease state, exercise, nutrition and sleep, and they may modulate various aging‐associated processes such as stem cell renewal, nutrient sensing, cell senescence, mitochondrial function, and insulin resistance. This perspective highlights, for a general audience, a selection of studies of EVs in aging and age‐related diseases, and their diverse roles in organ crosstalk. While current evidence indicates that EVs play multiple roles in aging, there are numerous challenges including methodological challenges and limitations, heterogeneous reports of EV cargo, limited reproducibility, and apparent context‐dependent effects of EVs and their cargo. Together, this limits the interpretation of these studies. This is proposed that EVs may act as fine‐tuners of cellular communication within the broader aging‐associated secretome and the importance of standardizing methods are emphasized.

The interaction between copper metabolism (including cuproptosis) and ferroptosis in cancer, as well as the roles of other trace metal elements (such as zinc, manganese, cobalt, and molybdenum) in ferroptosis are specifically focused. Furthermore, the applications of nanomaterials based on these metals in cancer therapy are also reviewed and potential strategies for co‐targeting ferroptosis and cuproptosis are explored. Nevertheless, in light of the intricate and ambiguous nature of these interactions, ongoing research is essential to further elucidate the “nonferrous” mechanisms of ferroptosis, thereby facilitating the development of novel therapeutic targets and approaches for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multifunctional cell surface receptor implicated in aging and the progression of chronic diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Its interaction with advanced glycation end products (AGEs) promotes cellular stress and inflammation, underscoring the diagnostic and therapeutic relevance of targeting RAGE. In this study, we explored the potential of nanobodiessingle‐domain antibodies known for high specificity, strong affinity, and deep tissue penetrationas molecular tools for RAGE‐targeted applications. Using a phage display library, a panel of RAGE‐specific nanobodies were isolated and characterized. Binding activity and affinity were evaluated through enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Among them, nanobody NbF8 demonstrated the highest affinity and specificity toward RAGE. In vitro, NbF8 selectively bound RAGE‐expressing cells, while in vivo imaging in renal carcinoma and Alzheimer's disease mouse models confirmed its targeted accumulation in RAGE‐overexpressing tumors and brain tissues. These findings highlight NbF8 as a promising molecular imaging agent for RAGE‐associated diseases. This study supports the potential of RAGE‐targeting nanobodies in both diagnostic imaging and therapeutic development, offering a novel approach for precision medicine in conditions driven by RAGE signaling.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Targeting glutamine metabolism has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer therapy. To attain clinical utility, a number of challenges must be overcome, including in vivo anti‐tumor activity, pharmacological toxicity, and clinical safety. Aside from glutamine‐addicted tumor cells, immune cells may also need glutamine to sustain physiological activities; thus, the current work used two immunological‐intact murine cancer models to assess the effects of glutamine antagonists on tumor cells and the immune milieu. To minimize potential off‐target effects, we developed a glutamine antagonist prodrug, JHU083, which is bioactivated selectively in cancer tissues. In both murine tumor models, we observed a significant anti‐tumor effect, resulting in reduced tumor burden and impeded tumor progression. Single‐cell RNA sequencing of tumor tissues demonstrated that JHU083 significantly hampered the immunosuppressive M2‐like macrophages but not the pro‐inflammatory M1‐like macrophages. Expression of Myc‐ and hypoxia‐regulated genes were also inhibited by JHU083. Ex vivo bone marrow‐derived macrophage cultures further confirmed that M2 macrophages were more sensitive to glutamine antagonist than M1 macrophages. Together, our findings indicate that JHU083 exerted its anti‐tumor activity not only through direct targeting of glutamine‐addicted cancer cells but also by shifting the M1/M2 macrophage landscape in favor of an immune‐stimulatory microenvironment .",

Sirt3 is located in mitochondria and interacts with Foxo3a to protect mitochondrial function against stress. Mitophagy is an important form of mitochondrial quality control. However, whether LUT regulates mitophagy to alleviate myocardial I/R injury via the Sirt3/Foxo3a pathway is rarely reported. In this study, 3‐(1H‐1,2,3‐triazol‐4‐yl) pyridine (3‐TYP) is used to inhibit the Sirt3/Foxo3a pathway. Male adult rats are divided into four groups: Sham group, I/R group, I/R+LUT group, and I/R+LUT+3‐TYP group. The I/R rats model is established by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min, then releasing the ligature for 24 h. Indexes of left ventricular function, myocardial damage, oxidative stress, and mitophagy are detected. It is found that LUT treatment activated Sirt3/Foxo3a pathway, improves left ventricular function, decreases myocardial infarction size, inhibits myocardial apoptosis and oxidative stress, and initiates mitophagy in I/R rats. Moreover, these protective effects of LUT are weakened when Sirt3 is inhibited. Together, LUT regulates mitophagy to alleviate myocardial I/R injury via the Sirt3/Foxo3a pathway.",

This study investigates RNA interference (RNAi) as a targeted gene silencing approach to manage H. halys populations. However, RNAi efficacy varies between insect orders, including hemipterans, due to factors such as the rapid degradation of double‐stranded RNA (dsRNA) by a DNA/RNA non‐specific nuclease (HhNSE) present in the saliva of H. halys . Notably, this study proves that double‐stranded DNA (dsDNA) can stabilise dsRNA in saliva, probably by competitively inhibiting HhNSE, which is highly expressed in salivary glands. In vivo tests targeting the clathrin heavy chain gene ( HhCHC ) demonstrate that a mixture of dsRNA‐CHC and dsDNA result in enhanced gene silencing when fed to H. halys , compared to dsRNA alone. While dsRNA‐CHC injection causes almost complete mortality, the dsDNA formulation do not significantly increase mortality when fed together with dsRNA‐CHC. These findings highlight the need to further investigate factors beyond nucleases such as dsRNA uptake and release mechanisms in the insect gut. Nevertheless, this study provides promising insights for improving RNAi delivery in H. halys , and perhaps other pests with such nucleases, in support of sustainable pest management solutions.",

These statistics have not changed despite 50 years of research and therapeutic development. Pancreatic cancer is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer mortality by the year 2030. Currently, the treatment options for pancreatic cancer are limited. This disease is usually diagnosed at a late stage, which prevents curative surgical resection. Chemotherapy is the most frequently used approach for pancreatic cancer treatment and has limited effects. In many other cancer types, targeted therapy and immunotherapy have made great progress and have been shown to be very promising prospects; these treatments also provide hope for pancreatic cancer. The need for research on targeted therapy and immunotherapy is pressing due to the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer, and in recent years, there have been some breakthroughs for targeted therapy and immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer. This review summarizes the current preclinical and clinical studies of targeted therapy and immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer and ends by describing the challenges and outlook.",

Endothelialized tissue‐engineered blood vessels (TEBVs) have previously been fabricated to recapitulate artery functionalities, including vasoconstriction, vasodilation, and endothelium activation. Here, the initiation of atherosclerosis is emulated by designing branched TEBVs (brTEBVs) of various geometries treated with enzyme‐modified low‐density‐lipoprotein (eLDL) and TNF‐α to induce endothelial cell dysfunction and adhesion of perfused human monocytes. Locations of monocyte adhesion under pulsatile flow are identified, and the hemodynamics in the brTEBVs are characterized using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Monocyte adhesion is greater at the side outlets than at the main outlets or inlets, and is greatest at larger side outlet branching angles (60° or 80° vs 45°). In PIV experiments, the branched side outlets are identified as atherosclerosis‐prone areas where fluorescent particles show a transient swirling motion following flow pulses; in CFD simulations, side outlets with larger branching angles show higher vorticity magnitude and greater flow disturbance than other areas. These results suggest that the branched TEBVs with eLDL/TNF‐α treatment provide a physiologically relevant model of early atherosclerosis for preclinical studies.",

Whereas, recent oncoimmunological approaches have focused its role in immune surveillance. In response to the emerging topics of lymphatic vascular biology, physiologically relevant human cell‐based in vitro model is in high demand. This study introduces a 3D in vitro model of human LV within tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) using an injection‐molded plastic array culture platform (Lymph‐IMPACT). Through spontaneous capillary flow‐driven patterning of 3D cellular hydrogel and optimized cellular composition, the platform enables robust and reproducible formation of self‐organized LV in vitro. This co‐culture model recapitulates cancer cell type‐dependent morphogenesis of LV in vitro. Moreover, the robustness of the model enables high‐content analysis on the effect of anti‐VEGFR3 drug depending on the existence of blood vessels or different types of cancer cells. By virtue of high perfusability of 3D lumenized in vitro LV, a trans‐endothelial migration of cytotoxic primary lymphocytes, which is one of the critical processes in anti‐tumor immunology, is recapitulated within reconstructed melanoma TIME. From drug testing to cellular migration assays using the high‐throughput platform, the Lymph‐IMPACT demonstrates its powerful potential to be applied on investigating lymphatic‐related strategies for cancer therapeutics.",

Recent years have seen a surge in mapping methods that use innovative and rediscovered organic chemistry in high throughput approaches. While this has brought about a leap of progress in this young field, it has also become clear that the different chemistries feature variegated specificity and selectivity. The associated error rates, e.g., in terms of false positives and false negatives, are in large part inherent to the chemistry employed. This means that even assuming technically perfect execution, the interpretation of mapping results issuing from the application of such chemistries are limited by intrinsic features of chemical reactivity. An important but often ignored fact is that the huge stochiometric excess of unmodified over‐modified nucleotides is not inert to any of the reagents employed. Consequently, any reaction aimed at chemical discrimination of modified versus unmodified nucleotides has optimal conditions for selectivity that are ultimately anchored in relative reaction rates, whose ratio imposes intrinsic limits to selectivity. Here chemical reactivities of canonical and modified ribonucleosides are revisited as a basis for an understanding of the limits of selectivity achievable with chemical methods.",

Interestingly, the brain and underlying neural circuits important for sleep regulation may respond uniquely to stress that leads to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and stress that does not. In stress that does not lead to PTSD, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) pathway is activated normally that results in sympathetic nervous system activation that allows the brain and body to return to baseline functioning. However, exposure to stress that leads to PTSD, causes enhanced negative feedback of this same pathway and results in long-term physiological and psychological changes.

Astrocytes are critical sleep regulatory cells and their connections to sleep and stress due to disturbed glucocorticoid signaling provide a novel mechanism to explain how stress leads to insomnia.

Nowadays, several efforts in cancer research and neuroscience are taking place to elucidate the mechanisms that drive tumor-associated innervation and nerve-tumor and nerve-immune interaction. Assessment of neurons and nerves within the context of the TME can be performed in situ, in tumor tissue, using several pathology-based strategies that utilize histochemical and immunohistochemistry principles, hi-plex technologies, and computational pathology approaches to identify measurable histopathological characteristics of nerves. These features include the number and type of tumor associated nerves, topographical location and microenvironment of neural invasion of malignant cells, and investigation of neuro-related biomarker expression in nerves, tumor cells, and cells of the TME.

It provides an alternative route for metastatic invasion and can exist independently in the absence of lymphatic or vascular invasion. It is a prominent characteristic of specific aggressive malignancies where it correlates with poor prognosis. The clinical significance of PNI is widely recognized despite a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis. The interaction between the nerve and the cancer cells is the most pivotal PNI step which is mediated by the activation or inhibition of multiple signaling pathways that include chemokines, interleukins, nerve growth factors, and matrix metalloproteinases, to name a few. The nerve–cancer cell interaction brings about specific changes in the perineural niche, which not only affects the regular nerve functions, but also enhances the migratory, invasive, and adherent properties of the tumor cells. This review aims to elucidate the vital role of adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix, and epithelial‐mesenchymal proteins that promote PNI, which may serve as therapeutic targets in the future.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, organoid and organs-on-chip technologies have significantly enhanced the ability to model human biology in vitro. For the pharmaceutical industry, this represents an opportunity to augment, or possibly replace, traditional preclinical animal studies with more clinically predictive tools. In the last few years, the marketplace for new human model systems has expanded rapidly. While pharma companies welcome the breadth of new options, ample choice can be paralyzing. Even for experts from the model developer community who are now filling the ranks in the industry, the pairing of the right model for a specific, fit-for-purpose biological question can be daunting. As a community, the adoption of these models can be hastened in the industry by publishing high dimensional datasets (e.g., multiomic, imaging, functional, etc.) on existing model systems, termed model-omics, and storing them in publicly accessible databases. This action will allow for quick cross-model comparisons and provide a sought-after rationale for either routine or fit-for-purpose use of organoids or organs-on-chip during drug development.",

    "abstract": "A functional immune system is crucial for a healthy life, protecting from infections, tumors, or autoimmune disorders; these are accomplished by the interaction between various immune cells. Nourishment, particularly micronutrients, are very important components in the immune system balance, therefore this review emphasizes the vitamins (D, E, A, C) and Dendritic cells' subsets due to vitamins' roles in immune processes, especially on dendritic cells' functions, maturation, and cytokine production. Current studies reveal significant benefits related to vitamins, including vitamin E, which can contribute to the control of dendritic cells' function and maturation. Furthermore, vitamin D plays an immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory role in the immune system. Metabolite of vitamin A which is called retinoic acid leads to T cells' differentiation to T helper 1 or T helper 17, so low levels of this vitamin exacerbate the menace of infectious diseases, and vitamin C has anti-oxidant effects on dendritic cells and modulate their activation and differentiation program. Additionally, the correlation between the amount of vitamin and the occurrence or progression of allergic diseases and autoimmunity disorders is discussed according to the results of previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tumoroids are 3D in vitro models that recapitulate key features of in vivo tumors, such as their architecture — hypoxic center and oxygenated outer layer — in contrast with traditional 2D cell cultures. Moreover, they may be able to preserve the patient‐specific signature in terms of cell heterogeneity and mutations. Tumoroids are, therefore, interesting tools for improving the understanding of cancer biology, developing new drugs, and potentially designing personalized therapeutic plans. Currently, tumoroids are most often established using basement membrane extracts (BME), which provide a multitude of biological cues. However, BME are characterized by a lack of well‐defined composition, limited reproducibility, and potential immunogenicity as a consequence of their natural origin. Synthetic polymers can overcome these problems but lack structural and biochemical complexity, which can limit the functional capabilities of organoids. Biohybrid hydrogels consisting of both natural and synthetic components can combine their advantages and offer superior 3D culture systems. In this review, it is summarized efforts devoted to producing tumoroids using different types of biohybrid hydrogels, which are classified according to their crosslinking mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex condition that is significantly influenced by oxidative stress and inflammation. It is also suggested that telomere shortening (TS) is regulated by oxidative stress which leads to various diseases including age‐related neurodegenerative diseases like PD. Thus, it is anticipated that PD would result in TS of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Telomeres protect the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes preserving them against fusion and destruction. The TS is a normal process because DNA polymerase is unable to replicate the linear ends of the DNA due to end replication complications and telomerase activity in various cell types counteracts this process. PD is usually observed in the aged population and progresses over time therefore, disparities among telomere length in PBMCs of PD patients are recorded and it is still a question whether it has any useful role. Here, the likelihood of telomere attrition in PD and its implications concerning microglia activation, ageing, oxidative stress, and the significance of telomerase activators are addressed. Also, the possibility of telomeres and telomerase as a diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker in PD is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cartilage injury is a common disease in daily life. Especially in aging populations, the incidence of osteoarthritis is increasing. However, due to the poor regeneration ability of cartilage, most cartilage injuries cannot be effectively repaired. Even cartilage tissue engineering still faces many problems such as complex composition and poor integration of scaffolds and host tissues. In this study, chondroitin sulfate, one of the main components of extracellular matrix (ECM), is chosen as the main natural component of the material, which can protect cartilage in a variety of ways. Moreover, the results show that the addition of chondroitin sulfate improves the mechanical properties of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel, making it able to effectively bear mechanical loads in vivo. Further, chondroitin sulfate is modified to obtain the oxidized chondroitin sulfate (OCS) containing aldehyde groups via sodium periodate. This special group improves the interface integration and adhesion ability of the hydrogel to host cartilage tissue through schiff base reactions. In summary, GelMA/OCS hydrogel is a promising candidate for cartilage regeneration with good biocompatibility, mechanical properties, tissue integration ability, and excellent cartilage repair ability.",

Linking the activity of a protein of choice to the conformational state of a photosensor domain through allosteric coupling represents a powerful method for engineering light‐responsive proteins. It enables the design of compact and highly potent single‐component optogenetic systems with fast on‐ and off‐switching kinetics. However, designing protein‐photoreceptor chimeras, in which structural changes of the photoreceptor are effectively propagated to the fused effector protein, is a challenging engineering problem and often relies on trial and error. Here, recent advances in the design and application of optogenetic allosteric switches are reviewed. First, an overview of existing optogenetic tools based on inducible allostery is provided and their utility for cell biology applications is highlighted. Focusing on light‐oxygen‐voltage domains, a widely applied class of small blue light sensors, the available strategies for engineering light‐dependent allostery are presented and their individual advantages and limitations are highlighted. Finally, high‐throughput screening technologies based on comprehensive insertion libraries, which could accelerate the creation of stimulus‐responsive receptor‐protein chimeras for use in optogenetics and beyond, are discussed.",

Currently, drug sensitivity assessment for solid tumors relies on imaging adherent cells or by flow cytometry of cells lifted from drug‐treated cultures after fluorescent staining for apoptotic markers. Subcellular apoptotic bodies (ABs), including microvesicles that are secreted into the culture media under drug treatment can potentially serve as markers for drug sensitivity, without the need to lift cells under culture. However, their stratification to quantify cell disassembly is challenging due to their compositional diversity, with tailored labeling strategies currently needed for the recognition and cytometry of each AB type. It is shown that the high frequency impedance phase versus size distribution of ABs determined by high‐throughput single‐particle impedance cytometry of supernatants in the media of gemcitabine‐treated pancreatic tumor cultures exhibits phenotypic resemblance to lifted apoptotic cells and enables shape‐based stratification within distinct size ranges, which is not possible by flow cytometry. It is envisioned that this tool can be applied in conjunction with the appropriate pancreatic tumor microenvironment model to assess drug sensitivity and toxicity of patient‐derived tumors, without the need to lift cells from cultures.",

Collagen–mineral arrangement has implications for bone function, aging, and disease. However, theories on collagen‐mineral arrangement have been confined to studies with low spatial and/or compositional resolution resulting in an extensive debate over the location of mineral with respect to collagen. Herein, a strategy is developed to extract a single mineralized collagen fibril from bone and analyze its composition and structure atom‐by‐atom with 3D sub‐nanometer accuracy and compositional clarity using atom probe tomography (APT). It is shown for the first time a method to probe fibril‐level mineralization and collagen–mineral arrangement from an in vivo system with both the spatial and compositional precision required to comment on nanoscale collagen–mineral arrangement. APT of leporine bone shows distinct and helical collagen fibrils with mineralized deposits both encapsulating and incorporated into the collagenous structures. This study demonstrates a novel fibril‐level detection method that can be used to probe the composition of bone and contribute new insights to the structure and organization of mineralized materials such as bones and teeth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The number of samples in biological experiments is continuously increasing, but complex protocols and human error in many cases lead to suboptimal data quality and hence difficulties in reproducing scientific findings. Laboratory automation can alleviate many of these problems by precisely reproducing machine‐readable protocols. These instruments generally require high up‐front investments, and due to the lack of open application programming interfaces (APIs), they are notoriously difficult for scientists to customize and control outside of the vendor‐supplied software. Here, automated, high‐throughput experiments are demonstrated for interdisciplinary research in life science that can be replicated on a modest budget, using open tools to ensure reproducibility by combining the tools OpenFlexure, Opentrons, ImJoy, and UC2. This automated sample preparation and imaging pipeline can easily be replicated and established in many laboratories as well as in educational contexts through easy‐to‐understand algorithms and easy‐to‐build microscopes. Additionally, the creation of feedback loops, with later pipetting or imaging steps depending on the analysis of previously acquired images, enables the realization of fully autonomous “smart” microscopy experiments. All documents and source files are publicly available to prove the concept of smart lab automation using inexpensive, open tools. It is believed this democratizes access to the power and repeatability of automated experiments.",

However, the vast majority of currently known acylation sites are of unknown function. Semi‐synthetic methods for installing lysine derivatives are ideally suited for in vitro experiments, while genetic code expansion (GCE) allows the installation and study of such lysine modifications, especially their dynamic properties, in vivo. An overview of the current state of the art is provided, and its potential is illustrated with case studies from recent literature. These include the application of engineered enzymes and GCE to install lysine modifications or photoactivatable crosslinker amino acids. Their use in the context of central metabolism, bacterial and viral pathogenicity, the cytoskeleton and chromatin dynamics, is investigated.",

Animal models played vital roles in understanding the mechanism of human diseases. However, the use of these models has been a subject of heated debate, particularly due to ethical matters and the inevitable pathophysiological differences between animals and humans. Current in vitro models lack the sufficient functionality and predictivity of human pharmacokinetics and toxicity, therefore, are not capable to fully replace animal models.

    "abstract": "Bone is a remarkable dynamic structure, which integrates mechanical and biochemical signaling inputs. Interstitial fluid in the intramedullary space transmits signals derived from compression-induced fluid shear stress (FSS) to stimulate osteoblasts for bone formation. Using a flow system and human osteoblasts, this study demonstrates how BMP/TGF-β signaling integrates stimuli derived from FSS and YAP/TAZ and confirms these findings by transcriptome analyses. Here, FSS positively affects the phosphorylation of both SMAD1/5 and SMAD2/3, the respective BMP- and TGFβ-R-SMADs. Increase in phosphorylated SMAD1/5 levels affects distinct target genes, which are susceptible to low levels of phosphorylated SMADs (such as ID1-3) or dependent on high levels of phosphorylated SMAD1/5 (NOG, noggin). Thus, FSS lowers the threshold for genes dependent on high levels of phosphorylated SMAD1/5 when less BMP is available. While the impact of FSS on direct BMP target genes is independent of YAP/TAZ, FSS acts cooperatively with YAP/TAZ on TGF-β target genes, which are shared by both pathways (such as CTGF). As mechanical stimuli are key in bone regeneration, their crosstalk to biochemical signaling pathways such as BMP and TGF-β and YAP/TAZ acts on different levels, which allows now to think about new and more specified intervention strategies for age-related bone loss.",

Discovering formulations that balance potentially competing for mechanical and biological properties in living hydrogels—for example, gel time of the hydrogel formulation and viability of the embedded organisms—can be challenging. In this study, a pipeline is developed to automate the characterization of the gel time of hydrogel formulations. Using this pipeline, living materials comprised of enzymatically crosslinked silk and embedded E. coli —formulated from within a 4D parameter space—are engineered to gel within a pre‐selected timeframe. Gelation time is estimated using a novel adaptation of microrheology analysis using differential dynamic microscopy (DDM). In order to expedite the discovery of gelation regime boundaries, Bayesian machine learning models are deployed with optimal decision‐making under uncertainty. The rate of learning is observed to vary between artificial intelligence (AI)‐assisted planning and human planning, with the fastest rate occurring during AI‐assisted planning following a round of human planning. For a subset of formulations gelling within a targeted timeframe of 5–15 min, fluorophore production within the embedded cells is substantially similar across treatments, evidencing that gel time can be tuned independent of other material properties—at least over a finite range—while maintaining biological activity.",

A separation protocol is developed to obtain monocultures of organoid‐derived endothelial cells (ODECs) and mural cells (ODMCs) from hiPSC vascular organoids. Shear stress responses of ODECs versus HUVECs and barrier function (by trans endothelial electrical resistance) are measured. PCL‐BU scaffolds are seeded with ODECs and ODMCs, and tissue organization and flow adaptation are evaluated in a perfused bioreactor system. ODECs and ODMCs harvested from vascular organoids can be cryopreserved and expanded without loss of cell purity and proliferative capacity. ODECs are shear stress responsive and establish a functional barrier that self‐restores after the thrombin challenge. Static bioreactor culture of ODECs/ODMCs seeded scaffolds results in a biomimetic vascular bi‐layer hierarchy, which is preserved under laminar flow similar to scaffolds seeded with primary vascular cells.

    "abstract": "Abstract Studying the immune system in vitro aims to understand how, when, and where the immune cells migrate/differentiate and respond to the various triggering events and the decision points along the immune response journey. It becomes evident that organ‐on‐a‐chip (OOC) technology has a superior capability to recapitulate the cell‐cell and tissue‐tissue interaction in the body, with a great potential to provide tools for tracking the paracrine signaling with high spatial‐temporal precision and implementing in situ real‐time, non‐destructive detection assays, therefore, enabling extraction of mechanistic information rather than phenotypic information. However, despite the rapid development in this technology, integration of the immune system into OOC devices stays among the least navigated tasks, with immune cells still the major missing components in the developed models. This is mainly due to the complexity of the immune system and the reductionist methodology of the OOC modules. Dedicated research in this field is demanded to establish the understanding of mechanism‐based disease endotypes rather than phenotypes. Herein, we systemically present a synthesis of the state‐of‐the‐art of immune‐cantered OOC technology. We comprehensively outlined what is achieved and identified the technology gaps emphasizing the missing components required to establish immune‐competent OOCs and bridge these gaps.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Representation of humans from diverse backgrounds in the drug development process is key to advancing health equity, and while clinical trial design has recently made strides toward greater inclusivity, preclinical drug development has struggled to make those same gains. One barrier to inclusion is the current lack of robust and established in vitro model systems that simultaneously capture the complexity of human tissues while representing patient diversity. Here, the use of primary human intestinal organoids as a mechanism to advance inclusive preclinical research is proposed. This in vitro model system not only recapitulates tissue functions and disease states, but also retains the genetic identity and epigenetic signatures of the donors from which they are derived. Thus, intestinal organoids are an ideal in vitro prototype for capturing human diversity. In this perspective, the authors call for an industry‐wide effort to leverage intestinal organoids as a starting point to actively and intentionally incorporate diversity into preclinical drug programs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aging is associated with loss of skeletal muscle regeneration. Differentially regulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A with aging may partially underlies this loss of regenerative capacity. To assess the role of VEGFA in muscle regeneration, young (12–14 weeks old) and old C57BL/6 mice (24,25 months old) are subjected to cryoinjury in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle to induce muscle regeneration. The average cross‐sectional area (CSA) of regenerating myofibers is 33% smaller in old as compared to young ( p &lt; 0.01) mice, which correlates with a two‐fold loss of muscle VEGFA protein levels ( p = 0.02). The capillary density in the TA is similar between the two groups. Young VEGF lo mice, with a 50% decrease in systemic VEGFA activity, exhibit a two‐fold reduction in the average regenerating fiber CSA following cryoinjury ( p &lt; 0.01) in comparison to littermate controls. ML228, a hypoxia signaling activator known to increase VEGFA levels, augments muscle VEGFA levels and increases average CSA of regenerating fibers in both old mice (25% increase, p &lt; 0.01) and VEGF lo (20% increase, p &lt; 0.01) mice, but not in young or littermate controls. These results suggest that VEGFA may be a therapeutic target in age‐related muscle loss.",

However, the evidence is weak, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. p38/extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK)/c‐Jun NH(2)‐terminal kinase (JNK) MAPK pathways participate in aging. Leydig cell (LC) senescence results in testicular aging. Whether prenatal DEHP exposure induces premature testicular aging by promoting LC senescence warrants further study. Here, male mice undergo prenatal exposure to 500 mg per kg per day DEHP, and TM3 LCs are treated with 200 µ m mono (2‐ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP). MAPK pathways, testicular toxicity, and senescent phenotypes ( β ‐gal activity, p21, p16, and cell cycle) of male mice and LCs are explored. Prenatal DEHP exposure induces premature testicular aging in middle‐aged mice (poor genital development, reduced testosterone synthesis, poor semen quality, increased β ‐gal activity, and upregulated expression of p21 and p16). MEHP induces LCs senescence (cell cycle arrest, increased β ‐gal activity, and upregulated expression of p21). p38 and JNK pathways are activated, and the ERK pathway is inactivated. In conclusion, prenatal DEHP exposure induces premature testicular aging by promoting LC senescence through MAPK signaling pathways.",

This study utilizes single‐cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA‐seq) to characterize the mid‐secretory endometrium of RIF patients. Stromal fibroblast‐enriched and epithelium‐enriched populations are collected using a two‐step dissociation process. After quality control, 25,315 individual cells from 3 RIF patients are analyzed. The analysis identifies 12 distinct cell types, including 6 subtypes of epithelial cells. Significantly, the study reveals the replacement of glandular epithelia with MAP2K6 + EPCAM DIM epithelia in the endometrial glands of RIF patients. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that endometrial gland organoids derived from RIF patients exhibit diminished responses to sex steroids compared to the controls. Single‐cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) analysis identifies cell‐specific cis ‐regulatory elements and constructed regulatory networks in both groups, showing alterations gene‐regulatory networks in RIF patients. Cell‐cell communication analysis distinguishes intercellular communication between the two groups, shedding light on disrupted cellular interactions associated with RIF. In summary, these findings provide valuable insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying RIF, highlighting the roles of epithelial cells in the implantation process.",

However, there is no effective treatment for SCIR. Melatonin exerts a neuroprotective effect in neurodegenerative diseases. However, whether pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis) is the primary cause of the massive neural death in SCIR is unknown, and if melatonin exhibits anti‐PANoptotic effect in rescuing the disastrous damage is to be decided. This study indicates that melatonin confers neuroprotection in SCIR, attenuating the loss of Nissl body and improving Basso, Beattie &amp; Bresnahan locomotor rating scale scores. Specifically, the apoptotic hallmarks in neurons are increased in SCIR injured spinal cord compared to the sham group. The upregulated trend is reversed by melatonin while the effect of melatonin is abolished by the administration of luzindole, a selective melatonin receptor antagonist. Moreover, similar patterns are found in the necroptotic markers in neurons, the pyroptotic indicators, and the interleukin‐1β staining in microglia. In conclusion, PANoptosis may underlie the mass neural death and paraplegia in SCIR, and melatonin confers neuroprotection to the spinal cord via inhibiting PANoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The peanut is an important worldwide cash‐crop for edible oil and protein. However, the kinetic mechanisms that determine gene expression and chromatin accessibility during leaf development in peanut represented allotetraploid leguminous crops are poorly understood at single‐cell resolution. Here, a single‐nucleus atlas of peanut leaves is developed by simultaneously profiling the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in the same individual‐cell using fluorescence‐activated sorted single‐nuclei. In total, 5930 cells with 50 890 expressed genes are classified into 18 cell‐clusters, and 5315 chromatin fragments are enriched with 26 083 target genes in the chromatin accessible landscape. The developmental trajectory analysis reveals the involvement of the ethylene‐AP2 module in leaf cell differentiation, and cell‐cycle analysis demonstrated that genome replication featured in distinct cell‐types with circadian rhythms transcription factors (TFs). Furthermore, dual‐omics illustrates that the fatty acid pathway modulates epidermal‐guard cells differentiation and providescritical TFs interaction networks for understanding mesophyll development, and the cytokinin module ( LHY / LOG ) that regulates vascular growth. Additionally, an AT‐hook protein AhAHL11 is identified that promotes leaf area expansion by modulating the auxin content increase. In summary, the simultaneous profiling of transcription and chromatin accessibility landscapes using snRNA/ATAC‐seq provides novel biological insights into the dynamic processes of peanut leaf cell development at the cellular level.",

The multi-disease complexities aggravate the situation and continue to be a constant concern for understanding atherosclerosis plaque development. Herein, a 3D hydrogel-based model that integrates disease-induced microenvironments is sought to be designed, allowing us to explore the early stages of atherosclerosis, specifically examining monocyte fate in multi-disease complexities. As a proof-of-concept study, murine cells are employed to develop the model. The model is constructed with collagen embedded with murine aortic smooth muscle cells and a murine endothelial monolayer lining. The model achieves in vitro disease complexities using external stimuli such as glucose and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Hyperglycemia exhibits a significant increase in monocyte adhesion but no enhancement in monocyte transmigration and foam cell conversion compared to euglycemia. Chronic infection achieved by LPS stimulation results in a remarkable augment in initial monocyte attachment and a significant increment in monocyte transmigration and foam cells in all concentrations. Moreover, the model exhibits synergistic sensitivity under multi-disease conditions such as hyperglycemia and infection, enhancing initial monocyte attachment, cell transmigration, and foam cell formation. Additionally, western blot data prove the enhanced levels of inflammatory biomarkers, indicating the model's capability to mimic disease-induced complexities during early atherosclerosis progression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most invasive type of breast cancer with high risk of brain metastasis. To better understand interactions between breast tumors with the brain extracellular matrix (ECM), a 3D cell culture model is implemented using a thiolated hyaluronic acid (HA‐SH) based hydrogel. The latter is used as HA represents a major component of brain ECM. Melt‐electrowritten (MEW) scaffolds of box‐ and triangular‐shaped polycaprolactone (PCL) micro‐fibers for hydrogel reinforcement are utilized. Two different molecular weight HA‐SH materials (230 and 420 kDa) are used with elastic moduli of 148 ± 34 Pa (soft) and 1274 ± 440 Pa (stiff). Both hydrogels demonstrate similar porosities. The different molecular weight of HA‐SH, however, significantly changes mechanical properties, e.g., stiffness, nonlinearity, and hysteresis. The breast tumor cell line MDA‐MB‐231 forms mainly multicellular aggregates in both HA‐SH hydrogels but sustains high viability (75%). Supplementation of HA‐SH hydrogels with ECM components does not affect gene expression but improves cell viability and impacts cellular distribution and morphology. The presence of other brain cell types further support numerous cell–cell interactions with tumor cells. In summary, the present 3D cell culture model represents a novel tool establishing a disease cell culture model in a systematic way.",

Clinical samples are collected to analyze the relationship between Fn abundance and microsatellite stability. Tumor cells are treated with Fn to detect the expression of proteins related to toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Myd88), mutS homolog 6 (MSH6), and nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) signaling pathways, respectively.

Fn treatment of CRC cells activated TLR4/Myd88/NF‐κB signaling pathway, transcriptionally activating miRNA‐155‐5p expression, thereby negatively regulating MSH6. Fn treatment accelerated the malignant progression of CRC in mice, and this process is inhibited by miRNA‐155‐5p antagomir.

Here, an electronic graphene field‐effect transistor (gFET) is reported, termed EV‐chip, for label‐free, rapid identification and quantification of exosomes (EV) associated with aging through specific surface markers, CD63 and CD151. Studies suggest that blood‐derived exosomes carry specific biomolecules that can be used toward diagnostic applications of age and health. However, to observe improvements in patient outcomes, earlier detection at the point‐of‐care (POC) is required. Unfortunately, conventional techniques and other electronic‐based platforms for exosome sensing are burdensome and inept for the POC distinction of aged blood factors. It is shown that EV‐chip can quantitatively detect purified exosomes from plasma, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 2 × 10 4 particles mL −1 and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 6 × 10 4 particles mL −1 . The sensitivity and compact electronics of the EV‐chip improves upon previously published electronic biosensors, making it ideal for a physician's office or a simple biological laboratory. The sensitivity, selectivity, and portability of the EV‐chip demonstrate the potential of the biosensor as a powerful point‐of‐care diagnostic and prognostic tool for age‐related diseases.",

Their secretome and exosome-based paracrine activity are considered as the main processes harboring their diverse therapeutic properties. Several investigations have examined the effects of MSC-derived exosomes on cancer growth, yet, controversial results have always emerged. Although MSC-derived exosomes are able to rigorously enforce the repression of cancer proliferation and progression, it is shown that MSCs exosomal activity displays numerous protumorigenic effects. This discrepancy over the dual effects of MSCs on cancer growth may be mediated by many factors including experimental design, stem cells origins, culture conditions, in addition to cancer-MSCs cross-talks. Despite the controversial effects of MSCs on carcinogenesis, scientists are able to overcome a number of obstacles by modifying MSCs to deliver antioncogenic miRNAs, anticancer drugs, and oncolytic viruses into tumor sites. This review discusses the controversial effects of MSC-derived exosomes on tumorigenesis, investigates the main causes that underlie this discrepancy, summarizes the pattern of engineered-MSCs, and finally highlights how future studies should advance the research in the field of MSCs-based cancer therapies in order to accelerate the transition from preclinical studies to clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Graphene is regarded as a viable bio‐interface for neuroscience due to its biocompatibility and electrical conductivity, which would contribute to efficient neuronal network signaling. Here, monolayer graphene grown via chemical vapor deposition is treated with remote hydrogen plasma to demonstrate that hydrogenated graphene (HGr) fosters improved cell‐to‐cell communication with respect to pristine graphene in primary cortical neurons. When transferred to polyethylene terephthalate, HGr exhibits higher wettability than graphene (water contact angle of 83.7° vs 40.7°), while preserving electrical conductivity (≈3 kΩ □ ‐1 ). A rich and mature network is observed to develop onto HGr. The intrinsic excitability and firing properties of neurons plated onto HGr appears unaltered, while the basic passive and active membrane properties are fully preserved. The formation of excitatory synaptic connections increases in HGr with respect to pristine graphene, leading to a doubled miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency. This study supports the use of hydrogenation for tailoring graphene into an improved neuronal interface, indicating that wettability, more than electrical conductivity, is the key parameter to be controlled. The use of HGr can bring about a deeper understanding of neuronal behavior on artificial bio‐interfaces and provide new insight for graphene‐based biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A 5‐d germination assay and a 14‐d hydroponic trial are performed to evaluate the impacts of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) on lettuce. Results show that GQDs are toxic to lettuce plants and that the effects are highly dependent on particle surface functionalization and plant growth stage. The germination rate is not affected by aminated GQDs (N‐GQDs) and carboxylated GQDs (C‐GQDs) but is reduced by hydroxylated GQDs (O‐GQDs) by 39–71%. During the hydroponic trial, N‐GQDs (50 mg L −1 ) increase the root dry weight by 34%, while C‐GQDs and O‐GQDs reduce it by 39% and 43%, respectively. Shoot dry weight is not affected by N‐GQDs but is reduced by C‐GQDs (44%) and O‐GQDs (36–55%) treatments. C‐GQDs and O‐GQDs cause oxidative damage, disruption of mineral and organic nutrients homeostasis, impairment of photosynthesis, and modulates the levels of phytohormones. Light‐triggered reactive oxygen species generation and oxidation of antioxidants in plants are the critical reason for the phytotoxicity and explain the difference between the different functionalizations. These findings suggest that GQDs may not be as safe as expected. Future studies should consider the modulation of surface chemistry to achieve optimal safety of GQDs, and more plant species should be tested over a longer‐term scale.",

Despite the widespread involvement of CCs in many pathologies, the mechanisms involved in their formation and their role in various diseases are still not fully understood. Current knowledge concerning the formation of CCs, as well as the molecular pathways activated upon cellular exposure to CCs, will be explored in this review. As CC formation is tightly associated with lipid metabolism, the role of cellular lipid homeostasis in the formation of CCs is highlighted, including the role of lysosomes. In addition, cellular pathways and processes known to be affected by CCs are described. In particular, CC-induced activation of the inflammasome and production of reactive oxygen species, along with the role of CCs in complement-mediated inflammation is discussed. Moreover, the clinical manifestation of embolized CCs is described with a focus on renal and skin diseases associated with CC embolism. Lastly, potential therapeutic measures that target either the formation of CCs or their impact on different cell types and tissues are highlighted.",

While the endocytic itinerary of the virus via cleavage of the spike protein of Sars-Cov-2 is well understood, the role of the remaining part of the spike protein subunit and ACE2 complex is still elusive. Herein, the possible effects of this complex are investigated by using synthetic spike proteins of Sars-Cov-2, human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC), and a culture device made of an arrayed monolayer of cross-linked nanofibers. hiPSCs are first differentiated into CMs that form cardiac tissue-like constructs with regular beating and expression of both ACE2 and gap junction protein Connexin 43. When incubated with the spike proteins, the hiPSC-CMs undergo a rhythmic fluctuation with overstretched sarcomere structures and dispersed gap junction proteins. When incubated with the spike proteins and supplementary angiotensin II, the damage of the spike protein on hiPSC-CMs is enhanced due to downregulated ACE2, chromatin margination, altered Connexin 43 expression, sarcomere disruption, and beating break. This discovery may imply latent effects of the spike proteins on the heart.",

Reassigning three TAGs with the same ncAA in mammalian cells has previously been achieved using translational machinery. However, simultaneous recoding of three nonsense codons with distinct ncAAs in mammalian cells remains a challenge due to low incorporation efficiencies. Here, three optimized aaRS/tRNA pairs (i.e., the E. coli ‐derived tyrosyl (EcTyr)/tRNA UUA , E. coli ‐derived leucyl (EcLeu)/tRNA CUA , and Methanosarcina mazei pyrrolysyl (MmPyl)/tRNA UCA pairs) are screened for ncAA incorporation. Furthermore, introduced combinations of eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) mutants (E55R, E55D, N129D, and Y125F) significantly improve the encoding efficiency of the three premature stop codons’ sites from 0.78% to 11.6%. Thus, site‐specific incorporation of three distinct ncAAs into a single protein is achieved in this study. This work markedly expands the potential for multiple site‐specific protein modifications within mammalian cells, thereby facilitating new in vivo applications.",

Circadian rhythm alterations are also present in preclinical stages of dementia, for example, in patients with mild cognitive impairments (MCI); thus, providing a unique window of opportunity for early intervention in neurodegenerative disorders. Nonetheless, there is a lack of studies examining the association between relevant changes in circadian rhythms and their relationship with cognitive dysfunctions in MCI individuals. In this review, circadian system alterations occurring in MCI patients are examined compared to healthy aging individuals while also considering their association with MCI neurocognitive alterations. The main findings are that abnormal circadian changes in rest‐activity, core body temperature, melatonin, and cortisol rhythms appear in the MCI stage and that these circadian rhythm disruptions are associated with some of the neurocognitive deficits observed in MCI patients. In addition, preliminary evidence indicates that interventions aimed at restoring regular circadian rhythms may prevent or halt the progress of neurodegenerative diseases and mitigate their related cognitive impairments. Future longitudinal studies with repeated follow‐up assessments are needed to establish the translational potential of these findings in clinical practice.",

Furthermore, the physiological roles of phase separation in cells, including molecules transport channel, gene expression and regulation, cellular division and differentiation, stress response, proteins refolding and degradation, cell connections, construction of skin barrier, and cell signals transmission, are highlighted. However, the disorder of phase separation leads to pathological condensates, which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). This relationship is considered the potential target for developing corresponded drugs and therapy.

External stimuli, such as sunlight, serve to synchronize physiological processes and cellular functions to a 24‐h cycle. The immune system is controlled by circadian rhythms, and perturbation of these rhythms can potentially alter the immune response to infections and tumors. The effect of circadian rhythm disruption on the immune response to tumors remains unclear. Specifically, the effects of circadian disruption (CD) on immunosuppressive cell types within the tumor, such as myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), are unknown. In this study, a shifting lighting schedule is used to disrupt the circadian rhythm of mice. After acclimation to lighting schedules, mice are inoculated with 4T1 or B16‐F10 tumors. Tumor growth is increased in mice housed under circadian disrupting lighting conditions compared to standard lighting conditions. Analysis of immune populations within the spleen and tumor shows an increased accumulation of MDSCs within these tissues, suggesting that MDSC mediated immunosuppression plays a role in the enhanced tumor growth caused by circadian disruption. This paves the way for future studies of the effects of CD on immunosuppression in cancer.",

In this study, a highly miniaturized droplet microarray (DMA) based high‐throughput screening system is established to screen over 2000 compounds for their antimicrobial properties against carbapenem‐resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The DMA consists of an array of hydrophilic spots divided by superhydrophobic borders. Due to the differences in the surface wettability between the spots and the borders, arrays of hundreds of nanoliter‐sized droplets containing bacteria and different drugs can be generated for screening applications. A simple colorimetric viability readout utilizing a conventional photo scanner is developed for fast single‐step detection of the inhibitory effect of the compounds on bacterial growth on the whole array. Six hit compounds, including coumarins and structurally simplified estrogen analogs are identified in the primary screening and validated with minimum inhibition concentration assay for their antibacterial effect. This study demonstrates that the DMA‐based high‐throughput screening system enables the identification of potential antibiotics from novel synthetic compound libraries, offering opportunities for development of new treatments against multidrug‐resistant bacteria.",

OSCC has higher rates of PNI than other cancer subtypes, with PNI present in 80% of tumors. Despite the impact of PNI on oral cancer prognosis and pain, little is known about the genes that drive PNI, which in turn drive pain, invasion, and metastasis. In this study, clinical data, preclinical, and in vitro models are leveraged to elucidate the role of neurotrophins in OSCC metastasis, PNI, and pain. The expression data in OSCC patients with metastasis, PNI, or pain demonstrate dysregulation of neurotrophin genes. TrkA and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) are focused, two receptors that are activated by NGF, a neurotrophin expressed at high levels in OSCC. It is demonstrated that targeted knockdown of these two receptors inhibits proliferation and invasion in an in vitro and preclinical model of OSCC, and metastasis, PNI, and pain. It is further determined that TrkA knockdown alone inhibits thermal hyperalgesia, whereas NGFR knockdown alone inhibits mechanical allodynia. Collectively the results highlight the ability of OSCC to co-opt different components of the neurotrophin pathway in metastasis, PNI, and pain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC) is the most common type of head and neck cancer; survival is poor, and response to treatment varies. Metastasis or recurrence in the regional lymph nodes is associated with poor survival. Consequently, overt or occult spread to the lymph nodes is used to identify patients who will receive adjuvant radiation therapy. Perineural invasion and the diameter of nerves exhibiting perineural invasion have also been suggested to be of prognostic significance. The explosion of interest in cancer neuroscience in the last two decades has led to novel biological insights into interactions between nerves and tumor cells. However, the criteria for defining perineural invasion have lagged behind current knowledge. It is important to re‐evaluate the concept of perineural invasion and identify other neural phenotypes in OSCC that can impact treatment selection and prognosis. In addition to perineural invasion, neural phenotypes that are of potential relevance to tumor progression include nerve‐tumor distance, nerve diameter, and nerve density.

It is reported that efferocytosis is severely impaired in fibroatheroma, especially in vulnerable thin cap fibroatheroma. However, there is a shortage of studies on efferocytosis defects in cell and animal models. Here, the impacts of oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox‐LDL) and glut 1 inhibitor (STF31) on efferocytosis of macrophages are studied, and an evaluation system is constructed. Through regulating the cell ratios and stimulus, three types of atherosclerotic spheroids are fabricated, and a necrotic core emerges with surrounding apoptotic cells. Rat models present a similar phenomenon in that substantial apoptotic cells are uncleared in time in vulnerable plaque, and the model period is shortened to 7 weeks. Mechanism studies reveal that ox‐LDL, through mRNA and miRNA modulation, downregulates efferocytosis receptor (PPARγ/LXRα/MerTK), internalization molecule (SLC29a1), and upregulates the competitive receptor CD300a that inhibits efferocytosis receptor‐ligand binding process. The foam cell differentiation has also confirmed that CD36 and Lp‐PLA 2 levels are significantly elevated, and macrophages present an interesting transition into prothrombic phenotype. Collectively, the atherosclerotic models featured by efferocytosis defect provide a comprehensive platform to evaluate the efficacy of medicine and biomaterials for atherosclerosis treatment.",

Through NBS, various IEMs can be screened using minute quantities of biofluids. Targeted metabolomics and genomic techniques are the main approaches used for NBS. However, lack of technical expertise and such high‐end “omics” based analytical facilities, and meager funding for healthcare in developing countries are the major reasons for unavailability of NBS programs. As it is reflected by only a handful reports about IEMs from Pakistan with population of ≈220 million and consanguinity rate of about 70%, which suggests an unmet need for an NBS program owing to reasonably high prevalence of inherited diseases. Around 200 IEMs are potentially treatable if diagnosed at an earlier stage through biochemical marker and genetic screening, so such patients can get benefit from the NBS program. This overview will help to persuade the stakeholders to setup NBS programs in developing countries including Pakistan, due to multitude of benefits for IEMs; timely diagnosis and early treatment can help the patients to live a nearly healthy life, reduced suffering of the family and minimal burden on society or national healthcare system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Opioids are one of the most potent drugs for treating moderate to severe pain. Despite irrefutable clinical application in chronic pain management, the long‐term use of opioids has been increasingly questioned due to undesired side effects that demand attention. Opioids such as morphine mediate clinically relevant effects primarily through the µ‐opioid receptor that go beyond their classical role as analgesics, causing potentially fatal side effects such as tolerance, dependence, and addiction. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that opioids affect immune system function, cancer progression, metastasis, and recurrence. Though a biological plausibility, the clinical evidence for the action of opioids on cancer is mixed, revealing a more complex picture as researchers struggle to establish a vital link between opioid receptor agonists, cancer progression, and suppression, or both. Thus, in light of the uncertainty of opioid effects on cancer, in this review, a focused overview of the role of opioid receptors in modulating cancer progression, their underlying signaling mechanisms, and the biological activity of opioid receptor agonists and antagonists is provided.",

Early evidence suggests that removal of senescent cells using senolytic drugs improves the aging phenotype in mice and may improve the health of individuals with chronic diseases. Signs of skin aging, including wrinkles, and sagging, occur largely due to the accumulation of senescent fibroblasts within the dermis; However, there is currently no skin treatment that eliminates senescent cells. In this study, human fibroblasts subjected to replicative aging and ionizing radiation exposure are used to screen plant extracts for potential senescent cell‐destructive and/or senescent cell‐forming activities. Angelica acutiloba —a traditional Chinese herbal medicine—selectively kills senescent cells without affecting the proliferating cells. Among the major components of this herb, ligustilide shows promising senescent cell‐destructive properties, and selectively eliminates senescent cells by inducing an apoptosis. Moreover, ligustilide markedly inhibits senescence‐associated secretory phenotypes. Administration of ligustilide to mouse skin eliminates senescent cells and increases dermal collagen density and subcutaneous adipose tissue content; it selectively promotes death of senescent cells without affecting non‐senescent cells. These results provide evidence that a natural compound—ligustilide—may exhibit therapeutic effects on the skin aging phenotype by specifically inducing apoptosis in senescent cells.",

However, previous research has mainly focused on the association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and individual macronutrients, while the effects of macronutrient composition on LTL remain unclear. This cross‐sectional analysis involved 4130 US adults (44.8 ± 17.0 years; 51% female) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1999–2002. A single 24‐h dietary recall is used to collect dietary data. The relationship between dietary macronutrient composition and LTL is examined using three‐dimensional generalized additive models. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, education, physical activity, BMI, and dietary quality, a three‐dimensional association of macronutrient composition with LTL (P = 0.02) is revealed. Diets lower in protein (5–10%), higher in carbohydrates (75%), and lower in fat (15–20%) are associated with the longest LTL corresponding to 7.7 years of slower biological aging. Diets lowest in protein (5%) and carbohydrate (40%), while highest in dietary fat (55%) are associated with the shortest LTL, corresponding to accelerated biological aging of 4.4 years. The associations appeared magnified with higher energy intake. These findings support a complex relationship between dietary macronutrients and biological aging independent of diet quality.",

Oridonin, commonly used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), exhibits significant anti‐inflammation activity. To explore the protective mechanisms of oridonin against the pathophysiological changes, the authors conducted single‐cell transcriptome (scRNA‐seq) analysis on septic liver models induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). They obtained a total of 63,486 cells, distributed across 11 major cell clusters, and concentrated their analysis on four specific clusters (hepatocytes/Heps, macrophages, endothelial/Endos and T/NK) based on their changes in proportion during sepsis and under oridonin treatment. Firstly, biological changes in Hep, which are related to metabolic dysregulation and pro‐inflammatory signaling, are observed during sepsis. Secondly, they uncovered the dynamic profiles of macrophage's phenotype, indicating that a substantial number of macrophages exhibited a M1‐skewed phenotype associated with pro‐inflammatory characteristics in septic model. Thirdly, they detected an upregulation of both inflammatory cytokines and transcriptomic factor Nfkb1 expression within Endo, along with slight capillarization during sepsis. Moreover, excessive accumulation of cytotoxic NK led to an immune imbalance. Though, oridonin ameliorated inflammatory‐related responses and improved the liver dysfunction in septic mice. This study provides fundamental evidence of the protective effects of oridonin against sepsis‐induced cytokine storm.",

This study examines the gut microbiota of Colombian athletes, specifically weightlifters ( n = 16) and road cyclists ( n = 13), compared to non‐athletes ( n = 15). Using Kruskal–Wallis tests, the physical activity level of a group of non‐athletic individuals and the sports experience of a group of professional athletes is analyzed. The median age of participants is 24 years, comprising 25 men and 19 women. The microbiota is collected using fecal samples. Participants provided these samples during their pre‐competitive stage, specifically during the concentration phase occurring two weeks prior to national competitions. This timing is chosen to capture the microbial composition during a period of heightened physical preparation. Questionnaire responses and microbial composition assessments identify disparities among groups. Microbial composition analysis explores core microbiome, abundance, and taxonomy using Pavian, MicrobiomeAnalyst 2.0, and GraPhlAn. ANCOM‐BC2 reveals differentially abundant species. Road cyclists exhibit decreased Bacteria and increased Archaea abundance. Phylum‐level variations included Planctomycetes, Acidobacteria, and Proteobacteria, while Bacteroidetes prevailed. Key families influencing gut microbiota are Bacteroidaceae, Muribaculaceae, and Selenomonadaceae. Weightlifters exhibit unique viral and archaeal community connections, while cyclists showed specialized microbial interplay influenced by endurance exercise. Correlation network analysis emphasizes distinctive microbial interactions within athlete groups, shedding light on the impact of physical activities on gut microbiota and athlete health.",

C57BL/6J mice are treated with OCA before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. The histopathology of the heart and assessment of FXR expression and mitochondria function are performed. To explore the underlying mechanisms, H9c2 cells, and primary cardiomyocytes are pre‐treated with OCA before LPS treatment, and extracellular signal‐regulated protein kinase (ERK) inhibitor PD98059 is used. LPS‐induced myocardial injury in mice is significantly improved by OCA pretreatment. Mechanistically, OCA pretreatment decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and blocked the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in cardiomyocytes. The expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (NRF‐2) increased in the case of OCA pretreatment. In addition, OCA improved mitochondria respiratory chain with increasing Complex I expression and decreasing cytochrome C (Cyt‐C) diffusion. Moreover, OCA pretreatment inhibited LPS‐induced mitochondria dysfunction via suppressing ERK1/2‐DRP signaling pathway.

    "abstract": "Abstract Multiple myeloma (MM) stands as a prevalent hematological malignancy, primarily incurable, originating from plasma cell clones. MM's progression encompasses genetic abnormalities and disruptions in the bone marrow microenvironment, leading to tumor proliferation, immune dysfunction, and compromised treatment outcomes. Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in MM progression, suggesting that targeting Tregs could enhance immune functionality and treatment efficacy. In this study, a notable increase in Treg proportions within MM patients' bone marrow (BM) compared to healthy individuals is observed. Additionally, it is found that the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitor JQ1 selectively diminishes Treg percentages in MM patients' BM and reduces TGF‐β1‐induced Tregs. This reduction occurs via inhibiting cell viability and promoting apoptosis. RNA sequencing further indicates that JQ1's inhibitory impact on Tregs likely involves upregulating STAT3 and suppressing PD‐1 expression. Collectively, these findings suggest JQ1's potential to modulate Tregs, bolstering the immune response in MM and introducing a promising avenue for MM immunotherapy.",

There is a need for new drug screening technologies that can parse drug candidates with increased likelihood of clinical utility early in development in order to increase the cost‐effectiveness of this pipeline. For example, during the COVID‐19 pandemic, resources were rapidly mobilized to identify effective therapeutic treatments but many lead antiviral compounds failed to demonstrate efficacy when progressed to human trials. To address the lack of predictive preclinical drug screening tools, PREDICT96‐ALI, a high‐throughput ( n = 96) microphysiological system (MPS) that recapitulates primary human tracheobronchial tissue,is adapted for the evaluation of differential antiviral efficacy of native SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern. Here, PREDICT96‐ALI resolves both the differential viral kinetics between variants and the efficacy of antiviral compounds over a range of drug doses. PREDICT96‐ALI is able to distinguish clinically efficacious antiviral therapies like remdesivir and nirmatrelvir from promising lead compounds that do not show clinical efficacy. Importantly, results from this proof‐of‐concept study track with known clinical outcomes, demonstrate the feasibility of this technology as a prognostic drug discovery tool.",

Here, the acidic pH typically found in acutely infected wounds can be effectively managed by incorporating a pH‐responsive Ag + loaded system within the hydrogel, thereby ensuring efficient drug use and preventing potential toxicity from the sudden release of silver ions. The antimicrobial composite hydrogel HAMA/GelMA‐CA/Ag + provides some tissue adhesion and accelerates wound healing. GelMA‐CA is synthesized by modifying gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) with caffeic acid (CA), while hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA) is introduced to prepare a double network hydrogel. Silver nitrate is then introduced to make it pH‐responsive through the formation of coordination between the polyphenolic structure of caffeic acid and the silver ions. The composite hydrogel exhibited excellent antioxidant properties and strong antimicrobial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Furthermore, the composite hydrogel accelerated the promotion of wound healing in a rat model of S. aureus‐infected wounds. In conclusion, the HAMA/GelMA‐CA/Ag + hydrogel is a promising bioactive material that can be used as a wound dressing to promote the healing of acutely infected wounds.",

Dopaminergic neural cells are encapsulated into graphene‐laden alginate microfibers using a microfluidic approach, which is unmatched for creating highly‐tunable microfibers. Incorporating graphene increases the conductivity of the alginate microfibers by 148%, creating a similar conductivity to native brain tissue. The cell encapsulation procedure has an efficiency of 50%, and of those cells, ≈30% remain for the entire 6‐day observation period. To understand how the microfluidic encapsulation affects cell genetics, tyrosine hydroxylase, tubulin beta 3 class 3, interleukin 1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor alfa are analyzed primarily with real‐time reverse transcription‐quantitative polymerase chain reaction and secondarily with enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, immediately after manufacturing, after encapsulation in polymer matrix for 6 days, and after encapsulation in the graphene‐polymer composite for 6 days. Preliminary data shows that the manufacturing process and combination with alginate matrix affect the expression of the studied genes immediately after manufacturing. In addition, the introduction of graphene further changes gene expressions. Long‐term encapsulation of neural cells in alginate and 6‐day exposure to graphene also leads to changes in gene expressions.",

The electrical data and equivalent circuit modeling are consistent with standard microscopy analysis and reveal that within the first 6 hours progenitor cells sediment and attach to the electrode within 40 hours. Between 40 and 120 hours, midbrain progenitor cells differentiate into midbrain neurons, followed by an electrochemically stable maturation phase. The ability to sense and characterize non‐invasively and in real time cell differentiation opens up unprecedented avenues for implantable therapies and differentiation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The generation of invasive fluctuating protrusions is a distinctive feature of tumor dissemination. During the invasion, individual cancer cells modulate the morphodynamics of protrusions to optimize their migration efficiency. However, it remains unclear how protrusion fluctuations govern the invasion of more complex multi‐cellular structures, such as tumors, and their correlation with the tumor metastatic potential. Herein, a reductionist approach based on 3D tumor cell micro‐spheroids with different invasion capabilities is used as a model to decipher the role of tumor‐associated fluctuating protrusions in cancer progression. To quantify fluctuations, a set of key biophysical parameters that precisely correlate with the invasive potential of tumors is defined. It is shown that different pharmacological drugs and cytokines are capable of modulating protrusion activity, significantly altering protrusion fluctuations, and tumor invasiveness. This correlation is used to define a novel quantitative invasion index encoding the key biophysical parameters of fluctuations and the relative levels of cell‐cell/matrix interactions, which is capable of assessing the tumor's metastatic capability solely based on its magnitude. Overall, this study provides new insights into how protrusion fluctuations regulate tumor cell invasion, suggesting that they may be employed as a novel early indicator, or biophysical signature, of the metastatic potential of tumors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nitrite and nitric oxide (NO) are two active nitrogen oxides that display similar biochemical properties, especially when interacting with redox‐sensitive proteins (i.e., hemoproteins), an observation serving as the foundation of the notion that the antibacterial effect of nitrite is largely attributed to NO formation. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that they are largely treated as distinct molecules by bacterial cells. Although both nitrite and NO are formed and decomposed by enzymes participating in the transformation of these nitrogen species, NO can also be generated via amino acid metabolism by bacterial NO synthetase and scavenged by flavohemoglobin. NO seemingly interacts with all hemoproteins indiscriminately, whereas nitrite shows high specificity to heme‐copper oxidases. Consequently, the homeostasis of redox‐sensitive proteins may be responsible for the substantial difference in NO‐targets identified to date among different bacteria. In addition, most protective systems against NO damage have no significant role in alleviating inhibitory effects of nitrite. Furthermore, when functioning as signal molecules, nitrite and NO are perceived by completely different sensing systems, through which they are linked to different biological processes.",

In vitro models are necessary for investigating mechanisms of angiogenesis and developing antiangiogenic therapies. Microfluidic cell culture models of angiogenesis are favored for their ability to recapitulate 3D tissue structures and control spatiotemporal aspects of the microenvironments. To capture the angiogenesis process, microfluidic models often include endothelial cells and a fibroblast component. However, the influence of fibroblast organization on resulting angiogenic behavior remains unclear. Here a comparative study of angiogenic sprouting on a microfluidic chip induced by fibroblasts in 2D monolayer, 3D dispersed, and 3D spheroid culture formats, is conducted. Vessel morphology and sprout distribution for each configuration are measured, and these observations are correlated with measurements of secreted factors and numerical simulations of diffusion gradients. The results demonstrate that angiogenic sprouting varies in response to fibroblast organization with correlating variations in secretory profile and secreted factor gradients across the microfluidic device. This study is anticipated to shed light on how sprouting dynamics are mediated by fibroblast configuration such that the microfluidic cell culture design process includes the selection of a fibroblast component where the effects are known and leveraged.",

Despite the fact that Schwann cells are cancer cells' early interaction partners, investigations on tumor progression and the molecular drivers of carcinogenesis do not place enough emphasis on them. Recent studies have shown that malignant cells and nerves interact on several levels during early carcinogenesis. For instance, the emergence of nerves in cancer, known as cancer neo-neurogenesis, is one important mechanism that contributes to cancer progression. Recent studies on Schwann cells brought the investigation of tumor-nerve interactions to a whole new level. Schwann cells make up the majority of glial cells in the peripheral nervous system, are outstandingly plastic cells, and serve a variety of roles in most organs. All these properties make Schwann cells excellent potential targets for tumor cells to exploit and turn them into promoters of carcinogenesis. In the present review, the distinctive features of Schwann cell-tumor cell interactions and the implications of this interaction on the tumor microenvironment are outlined. Further, this study points out the neglected aspects of Schwann cells in the tumor microenvironment and provides a potential new avenue for future research.",

Conventionally, intestinal monolayers grown on Transwell setups are used to test the effects of commensals/pathogens on the barrier integrity, both under homeostatic and pathophysiological conditions. While such models remain valuable for deepening the understanding of host-microbe interactions, often, they lack key biological components that mediate this intricate crosstalk. Here, a 3D in vitro model of the vertebrate intestinal epithelium, interfaced with immune cells surviving in culture for over 3 weeks, is developed and applied to proof-of-concept studies of host-microbe interactions. More specifically, the establishment of stable host-microbe cocultures is described and functional and morphological changes in the intestinal barrier induced by the presence of commensal bacteria are shown. Finally, evidence is provided that the 3D vertebrate gut models can be used as platforms to test host-microbe-parasite interactions. Exposure of gut-immune-bacteria cocultures to helminth \"excretory/secretory products\" induces in vivo-like up-/down-regulation of certain cytokines. These findings support the robustness of the modular in vitro cell systems for investigating the dynamics of host-microbe crosstalk and pave the way toward new approaches for systems biology studies of pathogens that cannot be maintained in vitro, including parasitic helminths.",

Genomic studies of PD patients have identified disease‐relevant monogenic genes, rare variants of significance, and polygenic risk‐associated variants. In this study, whole genome sequencing data from 90 young onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD) individuals are analyzed for both monogenic and polygenic risk. The genetic variant analysis identifies pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in eight of the 90 individuals (8.8%). It includes large homozygous coding exon deletions in PRKN and SNV/InDels in VPS13C , PLA2G6 , PINK1 , SYNJ1 , and GCH1 . Eleven rare heterozygous GBA coding variants are also identified in 13 (14.4%) individuals. In 34 (56.6%) individuals, one or more variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in PD/PD‐relevant genes are observed. Though YOPD patients with a prioritized pathogenic variant show a low polygenic risk score (PRS), patients with prioritized VUS or no significant rare variants show an increased PRS odds ratio for PD. This study suggests that both significant rare variants and polygenic risk from common variants together may contribute to the genesis of PD. Further validation using a larger cohort of patients will confirm the interplay between monogenic and polygenic variants and their use in routine genetic PD diagnosis and risk assessment.",

Increased matrix density means cells experience not only increased mechanical properties, but also a higher density of bioactive sites. Traditional in vitro ECM models like Matrigel and collagen do not allow these properties to be investigated independently. In this work, a poly(ethylene glycol)‐based scaffold is used which modifies with integrin‐binding sites for cell attachment and matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 sensitive sites for enzyme‐mediated degradation. The polymer backbone density and binding site concentration are independently tuned and the effect each of these properties and their interaction have on the proliferation, invasion, and focal complex formation of two different tumor cell lines is evaluated. It is seen that the cell line of epithelial origin (Hs 578T, triple negative breast cancer) proliferates more, invades less, and forms more mature focal complexes in response to an increase in matrix adhesion sites. Conversely, the cell line of mesenchymal origin (HT1080, fibrosarcoma) proliferates more in 2D culture but less in 3D culture, invades less, and forms more mature focal complexes in response to an increase in matrix stiffness.",

Streetlights filtering light through the windows and night dim light lamps are common sources of dim light at night (DLAN). The female population is susceptible to circadian disruption. The present study is aimed to determine the impact of DLAN on female Wistar rats circadian rhythms, metabolism, reproductive physiology, and behavior. After 5 weeks of DLAN exposure daily, oscillations in activity and body temperature of female rats are abolished. DLAN also decreases nocturnal food ingestion, which results in a diminishment in total food consumption. These alterations in the temporal organization of the body are associated with a significant decrease in melatonin plasmatic levels, reproductive disruptions, decreased exploration times, and marked anhedonia. This study highlights the importance of avoiding exposure to light at night, even at low intensities, to maintain the circadian organization of physiology, and denotes the great necessity of increasing the studies in females since the sexual dimorphism within the effects of desynchronizing protocols has been poorly studied.",

In vitro tumor models are considered reliable tools for drug screening and understanding cancer‐driving mechanisms due to the possibility of mimicking tumor heterogeneity. Herein, a 3D breast cancer model (3D‐BCM) is developed based on enzymatically‐crosslinked silk fibroin (eSF) hydrogels. Human MCF7 breast cancer cells are encapsulated into eSF hydrogels, with and without human mammary fibroblasts. The spontaneously occurring conformational change from random coil to β‐sheet is correlated with increased eSF hydrogels’ stiffness over time. Moreover, mechanical properties analysis confirms that the cells can modify the stiffness of the hydrogels, mimicking the microenvironment stiffening occurring in vivo. Fibroblasts support cancer cells growth and assembly in the eSF hydrogels up to 14 days of culture. Co‐cultured 3D‐BCM exhibits an upregulated expression of genes related to extracellular matrix remodeling and fibroblast activation. The 3D‐BCM is subjected to doxorubicin and paclitaxel treatments, showing differential drug response. Overall, these results suggest that the co‐culture of breast cancer cells and fibroblasts in eSF hydrogels allow the development of a mimetic in vitro platform to study cancer progression.

Moderate‐intensity exercise is an effective means to maintain cardiovascular redox homeostasis. Moderate‐intensity exercise reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by improving mitochondrial function and anti‐oxidative capacity. It also attenuates adverse cardiac remodeling and enhances cardiac function.

New lymphatic capillary growth can be triggered by fibrosis‐related tissue stiffening and soluble factors, but questions remain for how related biomechanical, biophysical, and biochemical cues affect lymphatic vascular growth and function. The current preclinical standard for studying lymphatics is animal modeling, but in vitro and in vivo outcomes often do not align. In vitro models can also be limited in their ability to separate vascular growth and function as individual outcomes, and fibrosis is not traditionally included in model design.

This review discusses fibrosis‐related lymphatic vascular growth and function in disease and the current state of in vitro lymphatic vascular models while highlighting relevant knowledge gaps. Additional insights into the future of in vitro lymphatic vascular models demonstrate how prioritizing fibrosis alongside lymphatics will help capture the complexity and dynamics of lymphatics in disease.

Using this novel bioassay, MSCs derived from multiple donors at different passages are co‐cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells and exhibit significant heterogeneity in angiogenic potency between donors and cell passage. Depending on donor source and cellular passage number, MSCs varied in their ability to stimulate tip cell dominant or stalk cell dominant phenotypes in angiogenic sprout morphology which correlated with expression levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). These findings suggest that MSC angiogenic bioactivity may be considered as a possible potency attribute in MSC quality control strategies. Development of a reliable and functionally relevant potency assay for measuring clinically relevant potency attributes of MSCs will help to improve consistency in quality and thereby, accelerate clinical development of these cell‐based products.",

In live cell electrospinning and bio‐electrospraying, cells are embedded in a polymer and subject to the process of mechanical and electrical stimulation of the process. The resulting nanofiber mats or droplets with embedded cells have several potential applications in tissue engineering. The nanofiber structure provides a supportive and porous environment for cells to grow and interact with their surroundings. This can be favorable for tissue regeneration, where the goal is to create functional tissues that closely mimic the extracellular matrix. However, there are also challenges associated with live cell electrospinning and electrospraying, including maintaining cell viability and uniform cell distribution within the nanofiber mat. Additionally, the electrospinning/electrospraying process can have an impact on cell behavior, phenotype, and genotype, which must be cautiously monitored and studied. Overall, the goal of this review paper is to provide a comprehensive and critical analysis of the existing literature on cell electrospinning and bio‐electrospraying.",

In this study, hydrogels are prepared by decellularization of human placental tissue using detergent and enzymes and by the subsequent creation of a homogenized acellular placental tissue powder (P‐ECM). A perfusion‐based decellularization approach is employed using detergent and enzymes. The P‐ECM with and without gamma irradiation is then utilized to prepare P‐ECM hydrogels. Physical and biological evaluations are conducted to assess the suitability of the P‐ECM hydrogels for biocompatibility. The decellularized tissue has significantly reduced cellular content and retains the major ECM proteins. Increasing the concentration of P‐ECM leads to improved mechanical properties of the P‐ECM hydrogels. The biocompatibility of the P‐ECM hydrogel is demonstrated through cell proliferation and viability assays. Notably, gamma‐sterilized P‐ECM does not support the formation of a stable hydrogel. Nonetheless, the use of HCl during the digestion process effectively decreases spore growth and bacterial bioburden. The study demonstrates that P‐ECM hydrogels exhibit physical and biological attributes conducive to soft tissue reconstruction. These hydrogels establish a favorable microenvironment for cell growth and the need for investigating innovative sterilization methods.",

However, the role of cellular senescence‐associated genes in the glomerulus in DN progression remains unclear. Therefore, this work aims to identify and validate potential cellular aging‐related genes in the glomerulus in DN to provide novel clues for DN treatment based on anti‐aging. The microarray GSE96804 dataset, including 41 diabetic glomeruli and 20 control glomeruli, is retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and cellular senescence‐related genes (CSRGs) are obtained from the GeneCards database and literature reports. Subsequently, PPI, GO, and KEGG enrichment are analyzed by screening the intersection between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and CSRGs. scRNA‐seq dataset GSE127235 is used to verify core genes expression in glomerulocytes of mice. Finally, db/db mice are utilized to validate the hub gene expression in the glomeruli, and high glucose‐induced mesangial cells are used to confirm key gene expression. This study reveals that FOS and ZFP36 may play an anti‐aging role in DN to ameliorate cell intracellular premature aging in mesangial cells of glomeruli.",

Therefore, tools that allow for the modulation of cell–cell interactions with high precision are of great interest to a better understanding of their roles and building tissue‐like structures. Herein, the green light‐responsive protein CarH is expressed at the plasma membrane of cells as an artificial cell adhesion receptor, so that upon addition of its cofactor vitamin B 12 specific cell–cell interactions form and lead to cell clustering in a concentration‐dependent manner. Upon green light illumination, the CarH based cell–cell interactions disassemble and allow for their reversion with high spatiotemporal control. Moreover, these artificial cell–cell interactions impact cell migration, as observed in a wound‐healing assay. When the cells interact with each other in the presence of vitamin B 12 in the dark, the cells form on a solid front and migrate collectively; however, under green light illumination, individual cells migrate randomly out of the monolayer. Overall, the possibility of precisely controlling cell–cell interactions and regulating multicellular behavior is a potential pathway to gaining more insight into cell–cell interactions in biological processes.",

Herein, the biodistribution of immunocyte‐based carriers, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and monocyte‐derived EVs are investigated in adult rhesus macaques using longitudinal PET/MRI imaging. 64 Cu‐labeled drug carriers are introduced via different routes of administration: intraperitoneal (IP), intravenous (IV), or intrathecal (IT) injection. Whole body PET/MRI (or PET/CT) images are acquired at 1, 24, and 48 h post injection of 64 Cu‐labeled drug carriers, and standardized uptake values (SUV mean and SUV max ) in the main organs are estimated. The brain retention for both types of carriers increases based on route of administration: IP &lt; IV &lt; IT. Importantly, a single IT injection of PBMCs produces higher brain retention compared to IT injection of EVs. In contrast, EVs show superior brain accumulation compared to the cells when administered via IP and IV routes, respectively. Finally, a comprehensive chemistry panel of blood samples demonstrates no cytotoxic effects of either carrier. Overall, living cells and EVs have a great potential to be used for drug delivery to the brain. When identifying the ideal drug carrier, the route of administration could make big differences in CNS drug delivery.",

Along with other constituent members, recent studies suggest the contribution of gut microbiota in maintaining host health, immunity, and development. Although the gut microbiota's role in maintaining barrier integrity is known, its function in early life development still needs to be better understood. To understand the details of gut microbiota's effects on intestinal integrity, epithelium development, and immune profile, the route of antibiotic‐mediated perturbation is taken. Mice on days 7(P7D), 14(P14D), 21(P21D) and 28(P28D) are sacrificed and 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis is performed. The barrier integrity, tight junction proteins (TJPs) expression, intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) markers, and inflammatory cytokines are analyzed. Results reveal a postnatal age‐related impact of gut microbiota perturbation, with a gradual increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and a reduction in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Significant barrier integrity disruption, reduced TJPs and IECs marker expression, and increased systemic inflammation at P14D of AVNM‐treated mice are found. Moreover, the microbiota transplantation shows recolonization of Verrucomicrobia, proving a causal role in barrier functions. The investigation reveals P14D as a critical period for neonatal intestinal development, regulated by specific microbiota composition.",

Therefore, the development of more effective anti‐cancer therapeutic strategies is imperative. Solid tumors exhibit a hyperglycolytic phenotype, leading to enhanced lactate production; and, consequently, its extrusion to the tumor microenvironment. Previous data reveals that inhibition of CD147, the chaperone of lactate transporters (MCTs), decreases lactate export in lung cancer cells and sensitizes them to phenformin, leading to a drastic decrease in cell growth. In this study, the development of anti‐CD147 targeted liposomes (LUVs) carrying phenformin is envisioned, and their efficacy is evaluated to eliminate lung cancer cells. Herein, the therapeutic effect of free phenformin and anti‐CD147 antibody, as well as the efficacy of anti‐CD147 LUVs carrying phenformin on A549, H292, and PC‐9 cell growth, metabolism, and invasion, are evaluated. Data reveals that phenformin decreases 2D and 3D‐cancer cell growth and that the anti‐CD147 antibody reduces cell invasion. Importantly, anti‐CD147 LUVs carrying phenformin are internalized by cancer cells and impaired lung cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Overall, these results provide evidence for the effectiveness of anti‐CD147 LUVs carrying phenformin in compromising lung cancer cell aggressiveness.",

Although fragmented MaSp molecules have been extensively produced in various heterologous expression platforms for biotechnological applications, complete MaSp molecules are required to achieve instinctive spinning of spidroin fibers from aqueous solutions. Here, a plant cell‐based expression platform for extracellular production of the entire MaSp2 protein is developed, which exhibits remarkable self‐assembly properties to form spider silk nanofibrils. The engineered transgenic Bright‐yellow 2 (BY‐2) cell lines overexpressing recombinant secretory MaSp2 proteins yield 0.6–1.3 µg L −1 at 22 days post‐inoculation, which is four times higher than those of cytosolic expressions. However, only 10–15% of these secretory MaSp2 proteins are discharged into the culture media. Surprisingly, expression of functional domain‐truncated MaSp2 proteins lacking the C‐terminal domain in transgenic BY‐2 cells increases recombinant protein secretion incredibly, from 0.9 to 2.8 mg L −1 per day within 7 days. These findings demonstrate significant improvement in the extracellular production of recombinant biopolymers such as spider silk spidroins using plant cells. In addition, the results reveal the regulatory roles of the C‐terminal domain of MaSp2 proteins in controlling their protein quality and secretion.",

The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the effect of different intensities of in vivo cold‐water immersion and in vitro cold exposure on autophagic and apoptotic signaling in young and older males. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are isolated at baseline, end‐cold exposure, and after 3 h of thermoneutral recovery. Additionally, PBMCs are treated with rapamycin and bafilomycin prior to in vitro cold exposure equivalent to in vivo core temperatures (35–37 °C). Proteins associated with autophagy, apoptosis, the heat shock response, and inflammation are analyzed via Western blotting. Moderate cold stress (0.5 °C decrease in core temperature) increased autophagic and heat shock protein activity while high cold stress (1.0 °C decrease in core temperature) augmented apoptosis in young males. In older males, minimal autophagic activation during both cold‐water exposures are associated with increased apoptotic and inflammatory proteins. Although in vitro cold exposure confirmed age‐related dysfunction in autophagy, rapamycin‐induced stimulation of autophagic proteins underlie the potential to reverse age‐related vulnerability to cold exposure.",

However, the contribution of actin filament integrity has never been studied directly. It is hypothesized that differences in nuclear deformability of cancer cells are influenced by the integrity of actin filaments. In this study, transparent micropatterned surfaces as simple tools to screen cytoskeletal and nuclear distortions are presented. Surfaces decorated with micropillars are used to culture and image breast cancer cells and quantify their deformation using shape descriptors (circularity, area, perimeter). Using two drugs (cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide), actin filaments are disrupted. Deformation of cells on micropillars is decreased upon drug treatment as shown by increased circularity. However, the effect is much smaller on benign MCF10A than on malignant MCF7 and MDAMB231 cells. On micropatterned surfaces, molecular analysis shows that Lamin A/C and Nesprin-2 expressions decreased but, after drug treatment, increased in malignant cells but not in benign cells. These findings suggest that Lamin A/C, Nesprin-2 and actin filaments are critical in mechanotransduction of cancer cells. Consequently, transparent micropatterned surfaces can be used as image analysis platforms to provide robust, high throughput measurements of nuclear deformability of cancer cells, including the effect of cytoskeletal elements.",

In this review, the recent advances are described on the design of genetic systems that can be stably inherited in the host cells and are responsible for important biological processes including DNA replication, RNA transcription, protein translation, and gene regulation. Their applications in synthetic biology are summarized and the future challenges and opportunities are discussed in developing such systems.",

The crosstalk between immune cells and tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) influences tumor progression and metastasis. Many studies have clarified the cellular and molecular events that can induce cancer cells to escape immune surveillance, including those involving tumor‐induced myeloid cell‐mediated immunosuppression. Emerging evidence indicates that tumor‐infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) accelerate tumor growth and induce angiogenesis, metastasis, and therapy resistance once converted into potent immunosuppressive cells. Here, how tumor infiltrating myeloid cells participate in tumor immune evasion and the prospects of these cells in cancer immunotherapy are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mesenchymal stromal cells from adipose tissue (AD‐MSCs) exhibit favorable clinical traits for autologous transplantation and can develop ‘Schwann‐like’ phenotypes (sAD‐MSCs) to improve peripheral nerve regeneration, where severe injuries yield insufficient recovery. However, sAD‐MSCs regress without biochemical stimulation and detach from conduits under unfavorable transplant conditions, negating their paracrine effects. Graphene‐derived materials support AD‐MSC attachment, regulating cell adhesion and function through physiochemistry and topography. Graphene oxide (GO) is a suitable substrate for human sAD‐MSCs incubation toward severe peripheral nerve injuries by evaluating transcriptome changes, neurotrophic factor expression over a 7‐days period, and cell viability in apoptotic conditions is reported. Transcriptome changes from GO incubation across four patients are minor compared to biological variance. Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene expression is unchanged from sAD‐MSCs on GO substrates, but NGF and GDNF protein secretion increase at day 3 and 7. Secretome changes do not improve dorsal root ganglia neuron axon regeneration in conditioned media culture models. Fewer sAD‐MSCs detach from GO substrates compared to glass following phosphate buffer saline exposure, which simulates apoptotic conditions. Overall, GO substrates are compatible with sAD‐MSC primed for peripheral nerve regeneration strategies and protect the cell population in harsh environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Interfacial cues in the tumor microenvironment direct the activity and assembly of multiple cell types. Pancreatic cancer, along with breast and prostate cancers, is enriched with cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that activate to coordinate the deposition of the extracellular matrix, which can comprise over 90% of the tumor mass. While it is clear that matrix underlies the severity of the disease, the relationship between stromal‐tumor cell assembly and cell‐matrix dynamics remains elusive. Micropatterned hydrogels deconstruct the interplay between matrix stiffness and geometric confinement, guiding heterotypic cell populations and matrix assembly in pancreatic cancer. Interfacial cues at the perimeter of microislands guide CAF migration and direct cancer cell assembly. Computational modeling shows curvature‐stress dependent cellular localization for cancer and CAFs in coculture. Regions of convex curvature enhance edge stress that activates a myofibroblast phenotype in the CAFs with migration and increased collagen I deposition, ultimately leading to a central “corralling” of cancer cells. Inhibiting mechanotransduction pathways decreases CAF activation and the associated corralling phenotype. Together, this work reveals how interfacial biophysical cues underpin aspects of stromal desmoplasia, a hallmark of disease severity and chemoresistance in the pancreatic, breast, and prostate cancers, thereby providing a tool to expand stroma‐targeting therapeutic strategies.",

Results from immunoassays applied to purified Nsp9 and neat saliva from coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) patients show that these nanobodies effectively and specifically recognize both recombinant and endogenous Nsp9. Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses supported by molecular dynamics reveal a composite Nsp9 oligomerization pattern and demonstrate that both nanobodies stabilize the tetrameric form of wild‐type Nsp9 also identifying the epitopes on the tetrameric assembly.

Chemical functionalization of silk by various chemistries can be leveraged to enhance and tune these features and enable the expansion of silk-based biomaterials into additional fields. Sugars are particularly relevant for intracellular communication, signal transduction events, as well as in hydrated extracellular matrices such as in cartilage, vitreous, and brain tissues. Multiple reaction pathways are demonstrated (carboxylation of serines followed by carbodiimide coupling with glucosamine, carboxylation of tyrosines followed by carbodiimide coupling with glucosamine; direct carbodiimide coupling of the inherent carboxylic acids of silk (aspartic and glutamic acid) with glucosamine) for the covalent conjugation of glucosamine onto silk with characterization by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR), liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS), water contact angle (WCA), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results indicate that different pathways substitute different amounts of glucosamine onto silk chains, with control over resulting material properties, including hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and biological responses. The aqueous processability of these conjugates into functional material formats (films, sponges) is assessed. These new classes of bio-inspired materials can lead to multifunctional biomaterials for potential applications in different fields of biomedical engineering.",

In this study, this question is assessed by analyzing the full genetic profile of MCF7 cells cultured either as 3D spheroids‐considered as “gold standard” for in vitro cancer research‐ or immobilized in 3D tumor‐like microcapsules, by RNA‐Seq and transcriptomic methods, allowing to discriminate at big‐data scale, which in vitro strategy can better resemble most of the malignant features described in neoplastic diseases. The results clearly show that mechanical stress, rather than 3D morphology only, stimulates most of the biological processes involved in cancer pathogenicity, such as cytoskeletal organization, migration, and stemness. Furthermore, cells entrapped in hydrogel‐based scaffolds are likely expressing other physiological hints described in malignancy, such as the upregulated expression of metalloproteinases or the resistance to anticancer drugs, among others. According to the knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to answer which 3D experimental system can better mimic the neoplastic architecture in vitro, emphasizing the relevance of confinement in cancer pathogenicity, which can be easily achieved by using hydrogel‐based matrices.",

Efficient genome‐level manipulation tools are vital to promote EET efficiency; thus, a powerful and rapid base editing toolbox in S. oneidensis MR‐1 is developed. Firstly a CRISPR/dCas9‐AID base editor that shows a relatively narrow editing window restricted to the “ − 20 to − 16” range upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) is constructed. Cas9 is also confined by its native PAM requirement, NGG. Then to expand the editable scope, the sgRNA and the Cas‐protein to broaden the editing window to “ − 22 to − 9” upstream of the PAM are engineered, and the PAM field to NNN is opened up. Consequently, the coverage of the editable gene is expanded from 89% to nearly 100% in S. oneidensis MR‐1. This whole g enome‐scale cytidine deaminase‐based base editing toolbox (WGcBE) is applied to regulate the cell length and the biofilm morphology, which enhances the EET efficiency by 6.7‐fold. WGcBE enables an efficient deactivation of genes with full genome coverage, which would contribute to the in‐depth and multi‐faceted EET study in Shewanella .",

    "abstract": "Abstract The anticancer property of silver–copper metallic nanoparticles (AgCu‐NPs) is of greater interest in cancer therapeutics; however, its off‐target toxicity limits its therapeutic application. Exosomes emerge as one of the leading idiosyncratic nanocarrier choices for cancer therapeutics due to their size, stability, and phenotypic diversity; however, to encapsulate NPs in extracellular vesicles (EVs) without disrupting their inherited functions is far from the expectations. Here, the loading strategy of AgCu‐NP conjugated with wheat germ agglutinin (AgCu‐NP‐WGA) in exosomes during biogenesis for the targeted delivery of anticancer therapeutics to breast cancer is reported. Based on the intrinsic mechanism of endocytosis of WGA, results show that internalization of WGA or AgCu‐NP‐WGA bypasses the lysosomal pathway and recycles in EVs. On the contrary, the transport of naked AgCu‐NPs to lysosomes; mechanistically, an acidic environment causes oxidation of AgCu‐NP. Next, the analysis of EVs harvested by differential centrifugation shows that only AgCu‐NPs‐WGA (Exo‐NP) retain their metallic state. Furthermore, Exo‐NP cytotoxicity results manifest that MCF10A‐derived Exo‐NPs are toxic to its homologous breast cancer cells (MCF‐7 and MDA‐MB 231) and nontoxic to heterologous cancers NC1‐1975 and MCF 10A. In conclusion, this study shows the self‐assembly of AgCu‐NP in exosomes to target and deliver therapeutics for breast cancer.",

The R472A mutant of the cyanobacterial phytochrome 1 (Cph1) is identified to confer the phytochrome‐based hydrogels with an increased dynamic range for the storage modulus but a different light‐response for the loss modulus compared to the original Cph1‐based hydrogel. Stiffness measurements of human atrial fibroblasts grown on these hydrogels suggest that differences in the loss modulus at comparable changes in the storage modulus affect cell stiffness and thus underline the importance of matrix viscoelasticity on cellular mechanotransduction. The hydrogels presented here are of interest for analyzing how mammalian cells respond to dynamic viscoelastic cues.

This appears to happen by two independent mechanisms, by inducing immunogenic cell death and separately by directly activating CD8. The use of TNIKi achieves complete tumor control in 50% of mice when combined with checkpoint inhibitor targeting PD‐1.

This study applies single‐cell RNA sequencing to profile CD45‐negative and CD45‐positive circulating epithelial cells (CECs) in nonmetastatic breast cancer patients. CECs are represented by transcriptionally‐distinct populations that include both aneuploid and diploid cells. CD45 − CECs are predominantly aneuploid, but one population contained more diploid than aneuploid cells. CD45 + CECs mostly diploid: only two populations have aneuploid cells. Diploid CD45 + CECs annotated as different immune cells, surprisingly harbored many copy number aberrations, and positively correlated to tumor grade. It is noteworthy that cancer‐associated signaling pathways areabundant only in one aneuploid CD45 − CEC population, which may represent an aggressive subset of circulating tumor cells. Thus, CD45 − and CD45 + CECs are highly heterogeneous in breast cancer patients and include aneuploid cells, which are most likely circulating tumor and hybrid cells, respectively, and diploid cells. DNA ploidy analysis can be an effective instrument for identifying tumor and hybrid cells among CECs. Further follow‐up study is needed to determine which subsets of circulating tumor and hybrid cells contribute to breast cancer metastasis.",

This study explores the role of NT5E in 33 tumor types using GEPIA, TIMER, Oncomine, BioGPS databases, and several bioinformatic tools. The findings reveal that the NT5E is abnormally expressed in a majority of the types of cancers and can be used for determining the prognosis prediction ability of different cancers. Moreover, NT5E is significantly related to the infiltration status of numerous immune cells, immune-activated pathways, and immunoregulator expressions. Last, specific inhibitor molecules, like NORNICOTINE, AS-703026, and FOSTAMATINIB, which inhibit the expression of NT5E in various types of cancers, are screened with the CMap.

    "abstract": "This study measures the uptake of various dyes into HeLa cells and determines simultaneously the degree of membrane lipid chain order on a single cell level by spectral analysis of the membrane-embedded dye Laurdan. First, this study finds that the mean generalized polarization (GP) value of single cells varies within a population in a range that is equivalent to a temperature variation of 9 K. This study exploits this natural variety of membrane order to examine the uptake as a function of GP at constant temperature. It is shown that transport across the cell membrane correlates with the membrane phase state. Specifically, higher membrane transport with increasing lipid chain order is observed. As a result, hypothermal-adapted cells with reduced lipid membrane order show less transport. Environmental factors influence transport as well. While increasing temperature reduces lipid order, it is found that locally high cell densities increase lipid order and in turn lead to increased dye uptake. To demonstrate the physiological relevance, membrane state and transport during an in vitro wound healing process are analyzed. While the uptake within a confluent cell layer is high, it decreases toward the center where the membrane lipid chain order is lowest.",

In recent years, studies have shown that ROS levels and redox status in adipose tissue are strongly associated with obesity and metabolic diseases. Although it was previously considered that excessive production of ROS and impairment of antioxidant capability leads to oxidative stress and potentially contributes to increased adiposity, it has become increasingly evident that an adequate amount of ROS is vital for adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis. In this review, by providing a systematic overview of the recent understanding of the key factors of redox systems, endogenous mechanisms for redox homeostasis, advanced techniques for dynamic redox monitoring, as well as exogenous stimuli for redox production in adipose tissues and obesity, the importance of redox biology in metabolic health is emphasized.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Physiological processes present daily oscillations of ≈24 h, called circadian rhythms. Motor performance, for example, reaches its peak in the afternoon, although this can be affected by chronotype. Certain motor activities, for example, walking, can also be affected by circadian rhythms. Healthy walking exhibits stride‐to‐stride fluctuations with a fractal‐like structure that enables adaptability. While pathology and aging are shown to lead to random‐like fluctuations; and, therefore, decreased adaptability; the influence of circadian rhythms remains unknown. This study investigates how these fluctuations present in healthy gait are affected by the time of day and chronotype. Eighteen young adults walk for 10 min every 2 h, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Footswitches are used to determine heel‐strike and calculate stride time. Then, detrended fluctuation analysis is used to calculate fractal scaling. A mixed‐model Analysis of Variance is used and followed by a backward stepwise elimination process. Tukey's tests are used for pairwise comparisons. The statistical model shows the effect of time during the day (12 p.m. exhibits a higher fractal scaling compared to 8 a.m.); and chronotype (evening‐types exhibit higher fractal scaling compared to morning‐types). This study reveals the influence of chronobiology on stride‐to‐stride fluctuations. These findings open new perspectives to integrate circadian medicine in biomechanics.",

The poor outcome of the treatment of nerve injury stems from the incomplete understanding of axonal biology and interactions between neurons and the surrounding environment, such as glial cells and extracellular matrix. Microfluidic devices, in combination with various injury techniques, have been applied to test biological hypotheses in nerve injury and nerve regeneration. The microfluidic devices provide multiple advantages over the in vitro cell culture on a petri dish and in vivo animal models because a specific part of the neuronal environment can be manipulated using physical and chemical interventions. In addition, single‐cell behavior and interactions between neurons and glial cells can be visualized and quantified on microfluidic platforms. In this article, current in vitro nerve injury models on a chip that mimics in vivo axonal injuries and the regeneration process of axons are summarized. The microfluidic‐based nerve injury models could enhance the understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of nerve tissues and simultaneously serve as powerful drug and biomaterial screening platforms.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis due to its aggressive nature and ability to metastasize at an early stage. Currently, its management is still a challenge because this neoplasm is resistant to conventional treatment approaches, among which is chemo-radiotherapy (CRT), due to the abundant stromal compartment involved in the mechanism of hypoxia. Hyperthermia, among other effects, counteracts hypoxia by promoting blood perfusion and thereby can enhance the therapeutic effect of radiotherapy (RT). Therefore, the establishment of integrated treatments would be a promising strategy for the management of pancreatic carcinoma. Here, the effects of joint radiotherapy/hyperthermia (RT/HT) on optimized chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) pancreatic tumor models are investigated. This model enables a thorough assessment of the tumor-arresting effect of the combined approach as well as the quantitative evaluation of hypoxia and cell cycle-associated mechanisms by both gene expression analysis and histology. The analysis of the lower CAM allows to investigate the variation of the metastatic behaviors of the cancer cells associated with the treatments. Overall, this study provides a potentially effective combined strategy for the non-invasive management of pancreatic carcinoma.",

However, it is still challenging to reproduce the physical and structural properties of native electroactive tissues due to the poor electroconductivity of current bioink systems as well as the limited printing resolution of conventional bioprinting techniques. In this work, an electro-conductive hydrogel is prepared by introducing poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene): poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) into an RGD (GGGGRGDSP)-functionalized alginate and fibrin system (RAF), and then electrohydrodynamic (EHD)-bioprinted to form living tissue constructs with microscale resolution. The addition of 0.1 (w/v%) PEDOT: PSS increases the electroconductivity to 1.95 ± 0.21 S m-1 and simultaneously has little effect on cell viability. Compared with pure RAF bioink, the presence of PEDOT: PSS expands the printable parameters for EHD-bioprinting, and hydrogel filaments with the smallest feature size of 48.91 ± 3.44 µm can be obtained by further optimizing process parameters. Furthermore, the EHD-bioprinted electro-conductive living tissue constructs with improved resolution show good viability (>85%). The synergy of the advanced electro-conductive hydrogel and EHD-bioprinting presented here may provide a promising approach for engineering electro-conductive and cell-laden constructs for electroactive tissue engineering.",

Herein, a reactive cell electrospinning strategy is described using hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate) precursor polymers that can create nanofibrous hydrogel scaffolds with controllable local cell gradients using a sequential all-aqueous process that does not require additives or external energy. Cells can be encapsulated directly during the fabrication process in different layers within the scaffold, enabling localized segregation of different cell types within the structures without compromising their capacity to proliferate (≈4-fold increase in cell density over a 14 day incubation period). This sequential reactive electrospinning approach thus offers promise to generate coculture fibrous hydrogel networks in which both the nanoscale architecture and the cell distribution can be controlled, as it is essential to recreate more complex types of tissues.",

Hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) and autophagy are reported to be upregulated in the AD specimens. However, the interaction between HIF‐1α and autophagy in the pathogenesis of AD remains to be explored. HIF‐1α and LC3 levels are evaluated in 10 AD and 10 normal aortic specimens. MDC staining, autophagic vacuoles, and autophagic flux are detected in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) under hypoxia treatment. CCK‐8, transwell, and wound healing assay are used to identify proliferation and migration under hypoxia treatment. Furthermore, 3‐MA is used to inhibit autophagy in hypoxia‐treated HASMCs. This study reveals that AD tissues highly express HIF‐1α and the LC3. Autophagy is induced under hypoxia in a time‐dependent manner, and autophagy is positively related to HIF‐1α in HASMCs. Moreover, the proliferation and migration of HASMCs are enhanced by hypoxia, whereas the knockdown of HIF‐1α attenuates this effect. Additionally, inhibiting autophagy with 3‐MA ameliorates hypoxia‐induced proliferation and migration of HASMCs. In summary, the above results indicate that HIF‐1α facilitates HASMC proliferation and migration by upregulating autophagy in a hypoxic microenvironment. Thus, inhibition of autophagy may be a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although a large amount of data consistently shows that genes affect immunometabolic characteristics and outcomes, epigenetic mechanisms are also heavily implicated. Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNA, determine gene activity by altering the accessibility of chromatin to transcription factors. Various factors influence these alterations, including genetics, lifestyle, and environmental cues. Moreover, acquired epigenetic signals can be transmitted across generations, thus contributing to early disease traits in the offspring. A closer investigation is critical in this aspect as it can help to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms further and gain insights into potential therapeutic targets for preventing and treating diseases arising from immuno‐metabolic dysregulation. In this review, the role of chromatin alterations in the transcriptional modulation of genes involved in insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, macrophage polarization, endothelial dysfunction, metabolic cardiomyopathy, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is discussed. An overview of emerging chromatin‐modifying drugs and the importance of the individual epigenetic profile for personalized therapeutic approaches in patients with immuno‐metabolic disorders is also presented.",

In this study, the human adipose tissue matrisome is profiled using quantitative sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra ‐ mass spectrometry (SWATH‐MS) proteomics across a cohort of 13 fat‐grafting patients, to provide characterization of ECM proteins within the tissue, and to understand human population variation. There are considerable differences in the expression of matrisome proteins across the patient cohort, with age and lipoaspirate collection technique contributing to the greatest variation across the core matrisome. A high abundance of basement membrane proteins (collagen IV and heparan sulfate proteoglycan) is detected, as well as fibrillar collagens I and II, reflecting the hierarchical structure of the tissue. This study provides a comprehensive proteomic evaluation of the adipose tissue matrisome and contributes to an enhanced understanding of the influence of the matrisome in adipose‐related pathologies by providing a healthy reference cohort and details an experimental pipeline that can be further exploited for future biomaterial development.",

Existing 3D brain models vary in reflecting the relative populations of different cell types present in the human brain. Most models consist mainly of neurons, while glial cells represent a smaller portion of the cell populations. Here, by means of a chemically defined glial-enriched medium (GEM), an improved method to expand the population of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes without compromising neuronal differentiation in bMPS, is presented. An important finding is that astrocytes also change in morphology when cultured in GEM, more closely recapitulating primary culture astrocytes. GEM bMPS are electro-chemically active and show different patterns of calcium staining and flux. Synaptic vesicles and terminals observed by electron microscopy are also present. No significant changes in neuronal differentiation are observed by gene expression, however, GEM enhanced neurite outgrowth and cell migration, and differentially modulated neuronal maturation in two different cell lines. These results have the potential to significantly improve functionality of bMPS for the study of neurological diseases and drug discovery, contributing to the unmet need for safe human models.",

Since there is no therapy for CADASIL the authors investigate whether the multi‐modal neuropeptide drug Cerebrolysin may improve outcome in a murine CADASIL model. Twelve‐month‐old NOTCH3 R169C mutant mice (n=176) are treated for nine weeks with Cerebrolysin or Vehicle and histopathological and functional outcomes are evaluated within the subsequent ten months. Cerebrolysin treatment improves spatial memory and overall health, reduces epigenetic aging, and prolongs lifespan, however, CADASIL‐specific white matter vacuolization is not affected. On the molecular level Cerebrolysin treatment increases expression of Calcitonin Gene‐Related Peptide (CGRP) and Silent Information Regulator Two (Sir2)‐like protein 6 (SIRT6), decreases expression of Insulin‐like Growth Factor 1 (IGF‐1), and normalizes the expression of neurovascular laminin. In summary, Cerebrolysin fosters longevity and healthy aging without specifically affecting CADASIL pathology. Hence, Cerebrolysin may serve a therapeutic option for CADASIL and other disorders characterized by accelerated aging.",

The methods to lose weight include exercise, diet, medicine, and surgery. Compared with other methods, diet regulation is safer and more effective. Hawthorn fruit has the effect of reducing weight, but the mechanism of effectiveness are not clear. In this study, obesity model rats are used to conduct scientific pharmacological research on hawthorn flavonoids. Hawthorn flavonoids can effectively improve the body weight, lipid accumulation, and lipid levels of obese rats. The contents of the colon of rats are analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing technology. The intestinal microflora in obese rats changed significantly after flavonoids treatment, and they tended to be the control group. Based on liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry, serum metabolomics showed that the metabolites in the serum changed significantly, after hawthorn flavonoids treatment. Hawthorn flavonoids are especially involved in the biological processes of grade bile acid biosynthesis, histidine metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the disorder of intestinal microorganisms is connected to changes in serum metabolites. These findings give a new idea about how hawthorn flavonoids help with obesity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract DNA methyltransferase is significant in cellular activities and gene expression, and its aberrant expression is closely linked to various cancers during initiation and progression. Currently, there is a great demand for reliable and label‐free techniques for DNA methyltransferase evaluation in tumor diagnosis and cancer therapy. Herein, a low‐background fluorescent RNA aptamer‐based sensing approach for label‐free quantification of cytosine‐guanine (CpG) dinucleotides methyltransferase (M.SssI) is reported. The fluorogenic light‐up RNA aptamers‐based strategy exhibits high selectivity via restriction endonuclease, padlock‐based recognition, and RNA transcription. By combining rolling circle amplification (RCA), and RNA transcription with fluorescence response of RNA aptamers of Spinach‐dye compound, the proposed platform exhibited efficiently ultrahigh sensitivity toward M.SssI. Eventually, the detection can be achieved in a linear range of 0.02–100 U mL −1 with a detection limit of 1.6 × 10 −3 U mL −1 . Owing to these superior features, the method is further applied in serum samples spiked M.SssI, which delivers a recovery ranging from 92.0 to 107.0% and a relative standard deviation &lt;7.0%, providing a promising and practical tool for determining M.SssI in complex biological matrices.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of malignant neoplasms in men all over the world. Against the background of increasing incidence, there is a high mortality rate from prostate cancer, which is associated with an inadequate treatment strategy. Such a high prevalence of prostate cancer requires the development of methods that can ensure early detection of the disease, improve the effectiveness of treatment, and predict the therapeutic effect. Under these circumstances, it becomes crucial to focus on the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Due to the development of molecular genetic methods, a large number of studies have been accumulated on the role of epigenetic regulation of gene activity in cancer development, since it is epigenetic changes that can be detected at the earliest stages of cancer development. The presence of epigenetic aberrations in tumor tissue and correlations with drug resistance suggest new therapeutic approaches. Detection of epigenetic alterations such as CpG island methylation, histone modification, and microRNAs as biomarkers will improve the diagnosis of the disease, and the use of these strategies as targets for therapy will allow for greater personalization of prostate cancer treatment.",

While there has been a major surge in modeling angiogenesis with microphysiological systems, they have not been rigorously optimized or standardized to enable the recreation of the dynamics of lymphangiogenesis. Here, a Lymphangiogenesis‐Chip (L‐Chip) is engineered, within which new sprouts form and mature depending upon the imposition of interstitial flow, growth factor gradients, and pre‐conditioning of endothelial cells with growth factors. The L‐Chip reveals the independent and combinatorial effects of these mechanical and biochemical determinants of lymphangiogenesis, thus ultimately resulting in sprouts emerging from a parent vessel and maturing into tubular structures up to 1 mm in length within 4 days, exceeding prior art. Further, when the constitution of the pre‐conditioning cocktail and the growth factor cocktail used to initiate and promote lymphangiogenesis are dissected, it is found that endocan (ESM‐1) results in more dominant lymphangiogenesis relative to angiogenesis. Therefore, The L‐Chip provides a foundation for standardizing the microfluidics assays specific to lymphangiogenesis and for accelerating its basic and translational science at par with angiogenesis.",

Delving into the monocyte/macrophage subclusters, 12 unique subclusters are identified and pathway enrichment analyses are conducted using KEGG and GO, discovering enriched pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation and antigen processing. Further GSVA and AUCell assessments show varied activation of interferon pathways, especially in subclusters 4 and 11. The clinical correlation analysis reveals genes significantly linked to survival outcomes. Additionally, cellular differentiation in these subclusters is explored. Building on these insights, the differential gene expression within these subclusters is specifically scrutinized, which reveal MYOF as a key gene with elevated expression levels in the survivor group. This finding is further supported by in‐depth pathway enrichment analysis and the examination of cellular differentiation trajectories, where MYOF's role became evident in the context of immune response regulation and sepsis progression. Validating the role of the MYOF gene in sepsis, a dose‐dependent response to LPS in THP‐1 cells and C57 mice is observed. Finally, inter‐cellular communications are analyzed, particularly focusing on the MYOF+Mono/Macro subcluster, which indicates a pivotal role in immune regulation and potential therapeutic targeting.",

In the study, the role of NAD + metabolism in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)‐evoked inflammatory pain and the underlying mechanisms are investigated. The study demonstrated that CFA induced upregulation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) without significant changes in the spinal cord. Inhibition of NAMPT expression by intrathecal injection of NAMPT siRNA alleviated CFA‐induced pain‐like behavior, decreased NAD + contents in DRG, and lowered poly‐(ADP‐ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) activity levels. These effects are all reversed by the supplement of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). Inhibition of PARP1 expression by intrathecal injection of PARP1 siRNA alleviated CFA‐induced pain‐like behavior, while elevated NAD + levels of DRG. The analgesic effect of inhibiting NAMPT/NAD + /PARP1 axis can be attributed to the downregulation of the NF‐κB/IL‐1β inflammatory pathway. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that the expression of NAMPT/NAD + /PARP1 axis is restricted to DRG neurons. In conclusion, PARP1 activation in response to CFA stimulation, fueled by NAMPT‐derived NAD + , mediates CFA‐induced inflammatory pain through NF‐κB/IL‐1β inflammatory pathway.",

Independent instrumental variables significantly associated with sedentary behaviors ( p &lt; 5 × 10 −8 ) are obtained from a genome‐wide association study (GWAS) of 422,218 individuals, and Frailty Index (FI) are derived from the latest GWAS dataset of 175,226 individuals. MR analysis is conducted using inverse variance weighting, MR‐Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode, supplemented by MRAPSS. Univariate MR revealed that sedentary behaviors such as watching television increased the risk of frailty (OR, 1.271; 95% CI: 1.202‐1.345; p = 6.952 × 10 −17 ), as sedentary driving behaviors are done (OR, 1.436; 95% CI: 1.026‐2.011; p = 0.035). Further validation through APSS, taking into account cryptic relatedness, stratification, and sample overlap, maintained the association between television viewing and increased frailty risk (OR, 1.394; 95% CI: 1.266‐1.534; p = 1.143 × 10 −11 ), while the association with driving dissipated.

This study indicates that televisio SB significantly increases the risk of frailty, suggesting potential biological heterogeneity behind specific sedentary activities.

Therefore, a 12‐month randomized, single‐blind, comparative effectiveness trial is conducted, in which 142 older adults at high risk for falls are randomized (1:1) to receive an evidence‐based Dalcroze Eurhythmics (DE) exercise program (once weekly, group‐based) or an evidence‐based multicomponent (MULTI) exercise program incorporating balance, functional, and strength training activities (twice weekly, group‐ and home‐based), for 12 months. The primary outcome is gait variability under dual‐task at 12 months. At 12 months, the DE group has significant improvements compared with MULTI group on gait under both dual‐task (adjusted β for stride variability: −2.3, 95%CI, −3.1 to −1.4; p &lt; 0.001) and single‐task, and on a variety of secondary physical and cognitive/executive function outcomes. The adjusted hazard ratio for falls is 0.58 (95%CI, 0.37 to 0.93) for the DE group compared with MULTI group. In conclusion, DE exercise is more effective than MULTI exercise in improving physical and cognitive function and reducing falls in older adults. The mechanisms underlying DE exercise‐induced benefits remain to be fully elucidated.",

They are transcribed by DNA‐dependent RNA polymerase II (Pol II) or III (Pol III), and undergo subsequent processing and 3′ end cleavage to become mature snRNAs. Numerous protein factors are involved in the transcription initiation, elongation, termination, splicing, cellular localization, and terminal modification processes of snRNAs. The transcription and processing of snRNAs are regulated spatiotemporally by various mechanisms, and the homeostatic balance of snRNAs within cells is of great significance for the growth and development of organisms. snRNAs assemble with specific accessory proteins to form small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) that are the basal components of spliceosomes responsible for pre‐mRNA maturation. This article provides an overview of the biological functions, biosynthesis, terminal structure, and tissue‐specific regulation of snRNAs.",

The objective of this study is to investigate whether erythropoietin hepatocellular receptor B2 (EPHB2) can regulate myocardial injury after MI and explore its regulatory pathways. EPHB2 is significantly overexpressed in the heart tissues of MI mice. The downregulation of EPHB2 alleviates the cardiac function damage after MI. Knockdown EPHB2 alleviates MI-induced myocardial tissue inflammation and apoptosis, and myocardial fibrosis in mice. EPHB2 knockdown significantly inhibits the activation of mitogen activated kinase-like protein (MAPK) pathway in MI mice. Moreover, EPHB2 overexpression significantly promotes the phosphorylation of MAPK pathway-related protein, which can be reversed by MAPK-IN-1 (an MAPK inhibitor) treatment. In conclusion, silencing EPHB2 can mitigate MI-induced myocardial injury by inhibiting MAPK signaling in mice, suggesting that targeting EPHB2 can be a promising therapeutic target for MI-induced myocardial injury.",

Despite its importance in both health and disease, there is a lack of in vitro platforms to study MET and little is known about the regulation of MET by mechanical cues. Here, hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels with dynamic and tunable stiffnesses mimicking that of normal and tumorigenic mammary tissue are synthesized. The platform is then utilized to examine the response of mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells to dynamic modulation of matrix stiffness. Gradual softening of the hydrogels reduces proliferation and increases apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Moreover, breast cancer cells exhibit temporal changes in cell morphology, cytoskeletal organization, and gene expression that are consistent with mesenchymal-epithelial plasticity as the stiffness of the matrix is reduced. A reduction in matrix stiffness attenuates the expression of integrin-linked kinase, and inhibition of integrin-linked kinase impacts proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression in cells cultured on stiff and dynamic hydrogels. Overall, these findings reveal intermediate epithelial/mesenchymal states as cells move along a matrix stiffness-mediated MET trajectory and suggest an important role for matrix mechanics in regulating mesenchymal-epithelial plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of delicate homeostasis is very important in various diseases because it ensures appropriate immune surveillance against pathogens and prevents excessive inflammation. In a disturbed homeostatic condition, hyperactivation of immune cells takes place and interplay between these cells triggers a plethora of signaling pathways, releasing various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), Interferon-gamma (IFNƴ), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), which marks cytokine storm formation. To be precise, dysregulated balance can impede or increase susceptibility to various pathogens. Pathogens have the ability to hijack the host immune system by interfering with the host's chromatin architecture for their survival and replication in the host cell. Cytokines, particularly IL-6, Interleukin-17 (IL-17), and Interleukin-23 (IL-23), play a key role in orchestrating innate immune responses and shaping adaptive immunity. Understanding the interplay between immune response and the role of epigenetic modification to maintain immune homeostasis and the structural aspects of IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23 can be illuminating for a novel therapeutic regimen to treat various infectious diseases. In this review, the light is shed on how the orchestration of epigenetic regulation facilitates immune homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Xinglou Chengqi decoction (XLCQD) is a Chinese formula that offers benefits in ischemic stroke. However, the underlying mechanism of the effects of XLCQD-mediated anti-ischemic stroke effects remains obscure. This study investigates the ferroptosis mechanism of XLCQD against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury using rat models of middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R). Ferroptosis differs from traditional cell death pathways and is linked to oxidative stress-induced lipid peroxidation and glutathione (GSH) depletion, which is essential to the development of ischemic stroke. In this study, it is shown that XLCQD improves brain infarction, neurological dysfunction, and histopathological changes caused by MCAO/R exposure, and improving I/R-induced oxidative damage through inhibition of ferroptosis via (Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 11) SLC7A11/ (glutathione peroxidase 4) GPX4 pathway. Interestingly, it is found that XLCQD-mediated protection in I/R is reversed by the silence of SLC7A11. XLCQD intervention significantly promotes GSH content and suppresses Reactive Oxygen Species(ROS), iron accumulation, as well as Malondialdehyde (MDA) generation, are markedly abrogated when SLC7A11 is knockdown by SLC7A11-shRNA transfection, indicating that SLC7A11 is the main target of XLCQD to further trigger intracellular events. In conclusion, XLCQD attenuates in vivo cerebral I/R injury by reducing ferroptosis via the SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sarcopenia is a geriatric condition characterized by a decrease in skeletal muscle mass and function, significantly impacting both quality of life and overall health. Mitochondria are the main sites of energy production within the cell, and also produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which maintain mitochondrial homeostasis‐mitophagy (clearing damaged mitochondria); mitochondrial dynamics, which involve fusion and fission to regulate mitochondrial morphology; mitochondrial biogenesis, which ensures the functionality and homeostasis of mitochondria. Sarcopenia is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that muscle mitochondrial function therapy should be investigated. Extrinsic therapies are extensively examined to identify new treatments for muscular illnesses including sarcopenia. Changes in muscle physiology and lifestyle interventions, such as pharmacological treatments and exercise, can modulate mitochondrial activity in older adults. This PubMed review encompasses the most significant mitophagy and sarcopenia research from the past five years. Animal models, cellular models, and human samples are well covered. The review will inform the development of novel mitochondria‐targeted therapies aimed at combating age‐related muscle atrophy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are components of the senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that influence cellular functions via their cargo. Here, the interaction between EVs derived from senescent (SEVs) and non‐senescent (N‐SEVs) fibroblasts and the immune system is investigated. Via endocytosis, SEVs are phagocytosed by monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells. Studies with the monocytic THP‐1 cell line find that pretreatment with SEVs results in a 32% ( p &lt; 0.0001) and 66% ( p &lt; 0.0001) increase in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐induced tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) production when compared to vehicle control or N‐SEVs respectively. Interestingly, relative to vehicle control, THP‐1 cells exposed to N‐SEVs exhibit a 20% decrease in TNF‐α secretion ( p &lt; 0.05). RNA sequencing reveals significant differences in gene expression in THP‐1 cells treated with SEVs or N‐SEVs, with vesicle‐mediated transport and cell cycle regulation pathways featuring predominantly with N‐SEV treatment, while pathways relating to SLITS/ROBO signaling, cell metabolism, and cell cycle regulation are enriched in THP‐1 cells treated with SEVs. Proteomic analysis also reveals significant differences between SEV and N‐SEV cargo. These results demonstrate that phagocytes and B cells uptake SEVs and drive monocytes toward a more proinflammatory phenotype upon LPS stimulation. SEVs may therefore contribute to the more proinflammatory immune response seen with aging.",

The use of three wavelengths allows the orthogonal control of the RAF/ERK and the AKT signaling pathway. Continuous exposure of cells to blue light leads to activation of AKT while simultaneous pulses of red and far‐red light enable the modulation of ERK signaling in cells with constantly active AKT signaling. The optimized, orthogonal multichromatic system presented here is a valuable tool to better understand the fine grained and intricate processes involved in cell fate decisions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The instability of recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a major disadvantage for its therapeutic use and means frequent applications to cells or tissues are required for sustained effects. Originating from silkworm hemolymph, 30Kc19α is a cell‐penetrating protein that also has protein stabilization properties. Herein, it is investigated whether fusing 30Kc19α to bFGF can enhance the stability and skin penetration properties of bFGF, which may consequently increase its therapeutic efficacy. The fusion of 30Kc19α to bFGF protein increases protein stability, as confirmed by ELISA. 30Kc19α‐bFGF also retains the biological activity of bFGF as it facilitates the migration and proliferation of fibroblasts and angiogenesis of endothelial cells. It is discovered that 30Kc19α can improve the transdermal delivery of a small molecular fluorophore through the skin of hairless mice. Importantly, it increases the accumulation of bFGF and further facilitates its translocation into the skin through follicular routes. Finally, when applied to a skin wound model in vivo, 30Kc19α‐bFGF penetrates the dermis layer effectively, which promotes cell proliferation, tissue granulation, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. Consequently, the findings suggest that 30Kc19α improves the therapeutic functionalities of bFGF, and would be useful as a protein stabilizer and/or a delivery vehicle in therapeutic applications.",

However, the growth conditions for efficient magnetite biomineralization in the synthetic R. rubrum “magneticum” , as well as the particles themselves (i.e., structure and composition), have so far not been fully characterized. In this study, different cultivation strategies, particularly the influence of temperature and light intensity, are systematically investigated to achieve optimal magnetosome biosynthesis. Reduced temperatures ≤16 °C and gradual increase in light intensities favor magnetite biomineralization at high rates, suggesting that magnetosome formation might utilize cellular processes, cofactors, and/or pathways that are linked to photosynthetic growth. Magnetosome yields of up to 13.6 mg magnetite per liter cell culture are obtained upon photoheterotrophic large‐scale cultivation. Furthermore, it is shown that even more complex, i.e., oligomeric, catalytically active functional moieties like enzyme proteins can be efficiently expressed on the magnetosome surface, thereby enabling the in vivo functionalization by genetic engineering. In summary, it is demonstrated that the synthetic R. rubrum “magneticum” is a suitable host for high‐yield magnetosome biosynthesis and the sustainable production of genetically engineered, bioconjugated magnetosomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oral cancer pain is attributed to the release from cancers of mediators that sensitize and activate sensory neurons. Intraplantar injection of conditioned media (CM) from human tongue cancer cell line HSC‐3 or OSC‐20 evokes nociceptive behavior. By contrast, CM from noncancer cell lines, DOK, and HaCaT are non‐nociceptive. Pain mediators are carried by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from cancer cells. Depletion of EVs from cancer cell line CM reverses mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. CM from non‐nociceptive cell lines become nociceptive when reconstituted with HSC‐3 EVs. Two miRNAs (hsa‐miR‐21‐5p and hsa‐miR‐221‐3p) are identified that are present in increased abundance in EVs from HSC‐3 and OSC‐20 CM compared to HaCaT CM. The miRNA target genes suggest potential involvement in oral cancer pain of the toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) and 8 (TLR8) pathways, as well as signaling through interleukin 6 cytokine family signal transducer receptor (gp130, encoded by IL6ST ) and colony stimulating factor receptor (G‐CSFR, encoded by CSF3R ), Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK/STAT3). These studies confirm the recent discovery of the role of cancer EVs in pain and add to the repertoire of algesic and analgesic cancer pain mediators and pathways that contribute to oral cancer pain.",

Mechanobiology, a cutting‐edge field that investigates how physical forces influence cell behavior, is now revealing new insights into cancer progression. This research focuses on two crucial players: RhoA and Rac1, small yet powerful proteins that regulate the structure and movement of cancer cells. RhoA controls cell adhesion and migration, while Rac1 drives cell movement and invasion. As CRC tumors grow and reshape the colon's mechanical environment, these pathways become disrupted, accelerating cancer progression. Examining the level of RhoA and Rac1 in CRC clinical samples under mechanical strain reveals their potential as diagnostic markers. Tracking the activity of these proteins can unlock valuable insights into cancer cell dissemination, offering new avenues for understanding and diagnosing CRC. This approach holds promise for earlier detection and better outcomes by offering key insights for more effective diagnostic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing focus of lifespan health research has predominantly centered on \"healthy aging\". This oversight may hinder the understanding of health across the lifespan, as disorders in earlier stages can substantially impact overall health and longevity. Aging, conceptually, begins at gestation. The trajectory of an individual's health is influenced from the earliest stages of life, where adverse conditions can set a foundation for lifelong health challenges. For example, suboptimal conditions during gestation leading to premature birth can predispose individuals to various health issues later in life. Additionally, precocious puberty defined as the onset of sexual maturity before eight years of age or early menopause-occurring before 50 years of age requires medical intervention and is indicative of atypical aging processes. To address these critical gaps in lifespan health research, the expansion of medical lexicons and research categorizations is advocated to include \"healthy gestation,\" \"healthy development,\" and \"healthy reproduction\" alongside \"healthy aging.\" This broader terminology will enable a more comprehensive investigation of disorders at all life stages. An integrative approach underscores the interconnectedness of all life stages and the continuous nature of aging, advocating for a seamless continuum in health research and interventions from gestation through late adulthood.",

Kinesin‐5 KIF11 has been discovered as a major causative gene for MCLMR. It has been well established that KIF11 is essential for microtubule organization, centrosome separation, and spindle assembly during mitosis. However, cellular and molecular mechanisms in the physiopathology of MCLMR remain largely unknown. In this study, KIF11‐inhibition mouse models are generated, which reveal that chemical inhibition of KIF11 results in defects in retinal development, the formation of rosettes, photoreceptor ciliary alterations, and vision loss. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that KIF11 is essential for the formation, organization, and maintenance of primary cilia in photoreceptor cells, which further contributes to the organization of photoreceptor cells and the development of the retina. Using the developing mouse embryos as a model, it is revealed that KIF11 inhibition induces the formation of monopolar spindle and mitotic arrest, which further results in tetraploidy and apoptotic cell death. These findings uncover cellular mechanisms underlying the loss‐of‐function of KIF11 and retinopathy in MCLMR and further support the functions of KIF11 in development.",

This research examines the effects of naringin and/or zinc on stomach and pancreatic tissues of streptozotocin‐induced diabetic rats. Type 2 diabetes is induced by intraperitoneal injection of nicotinamide and streptozotocin. Three weeks after diabetes induction, rats receive eight weeks of treatment. Malondialdehyde and total antioxidant capacity are estimated colorimetrically. Asprosin and P‐selectin levels are assessed via ELISA. Quantitative RT‐PCR analysis of nuclear factor kappa B (NF‐кB), peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma (PPAR γ), and nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (Nrf‐2) genes is carried out. Tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) is assessed immunohistochemically, and stomach and pancreatic tissues are examined histologically. Combined naringin and zinc treatment significantly reduces gastric Malondialdehyde, serum asprosin, and P‐selectin levels in serum, stomach, and pancreas compared to diabetic rats. Additionally, gastric NF‐кB expression is significantly lower, while PPAR γ and Nrf‐2 expressions are significantly higher compared to diabetic rats. Immunohistochemical analysis and histopathological examination confirm these findings. In conclusion, combined naringin and zinc treatment significantly improves gastric alterations in diabetic rats by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.

    "abstract": "Dysfunction in adipose tissue can cause serious health problems, including obesity, type-2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, significantly reducing human life expectancy. Differences in differentiation and lipid accumulation in adipocytes reflect their functional status, making it important to characterize adipocytes by monitoring biophysical changes during adipogenic differentiation. However, there is currently no specific cell surface marker to separate mature adipocytes from non-adipose cells based on their lipid content, and separation of mature adipocytes is challenging due to handling limitations without fixation, antibody staining, or particle conjugation. Here, we report a biomarker-free, magnetic levitation-based method to detect density changes and quantify the accumulation of lipid-rich droplets within differentiating adipogenic cells. Magnetic levitation revealed density changes within preadipocytes differentiating towards mature adipocytes, with density decreasing over time as cells accumulated lipids. We then used lipid droplets as an intracellular marker to quantify lipid accumulation in single adipocytes during adipogenesis. The significant density changes correlated with cell morphology and lipid droplet morphology within the cytoplasm. For the first time, free-floating lipid vesicle density was measured using magnetic levitation. This unique method enables efficient detection and quantification of dynamically evolving lipid droplets in cells, proving beneficial for modeling lipid storage-related diseases and drug screening applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The approval of JAK inhibitors, represented by baricitinib, for the treatment of alopecia areata (AA) has ushered in a new era. However, their excessive immunosuppressive effects have also raised numerous concerns. Therefore, the development of JAK inhibitors with different selectivities may enhance drug safety while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. CS12192, developed by our team, is a selective JAK3 inhibitor that also partially inhibits JAK1 and TBK1. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of CS12192 and baricitinib in a C3H/HeJ skin‐transplanted AA mouse model and conduct in‐depth analysis of the similarities and differences in the mechanisms of the two compounds using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and RNA‐seq technology. The results show that CS12192 could reverse hair growth inhibition in AA mice in a dose‐dependent manner, with the high‐dose group exhibiting comparable effectiveness to baricitinib but with better safety. Further research revealed that both compounds significantly reduced the infiltration of immune cells, particularly CD8 + T cells, in the skin of AA animals. CyTOF and RNA‐seq analysis revealed the mechanistic similarities between CS12192 and baricitinib in regulating AA‐related immune cells and signaling pathways. In conclusion, CS12192, as a novel selective JAK inhibitor, holds great potential for the treatment of AA.",

The involvement of peripheral factors in exercise‐mediated mental health is being appreciated. It is recently shown that the hepatic biosynthesis of lipocalin‐2 (LCN2) can respond to chronic restraint stress (CRS) and elicit anxiety‐like behaviors via inhibiting the neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here, it is found that 14‐day treadmill exercise training ameliorates anxiety‐like behaviors in these CRS‐treated mice. Further assays show that exercise intervention reduces the hepatic release of LCN2. Meanwhile, exercise training may also counteract the adverse effect of LCN2 via relieving the cortical microglial cell proliferation. The results collectively suggest that exercise training may modulate the liver‐brain axis to reshape the cortical activity for preventing anxiety disorders.",

Research has demonstrated that microglia (MG)‐mediated neuroinflammatory responses play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IS. Consequently, inhibiting MG activation and reducing the inflammatory response may be key strategies for the clinical treatment of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Edaravone (EDA), a potent anti‐inflammatory and antioxidant, is currently used in the clinical treatment of IS; however, its anti‐inflammatory mechanisms remain inadequately understood. To address this, network pharmacology (NP) analysis is employed to identify the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway as a potential mediator of the inflammatory response triggered by activated microglia following EDA treatment. In vitro oxygen‐glucose deprivation (OGD) is used to induce BV‐2 MG activation, and an in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model is established. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining are used to detect changes in the phosphorylation levels of pathway‐related proteins and the expression of inflammatory factors. Additionally, the PI3K pathway inhibitor LY294002 and a PI3K overexpression plasmid are introduced to further analyze the expression changes of these markers. The results suggest that EDA may alleviate the inflammatory response mediated by activated MG through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",

OA is induced in Lewis rats by medial meniscus transection and treatment with intra‐articular injections of EpiC. EpiC treatment reduces joint swelling and improves hindlimb weight distribution in MMT‐induced OA rats. Pathological changes in cartilage are observed and evaluated by the osteoarthritis research society international (OARSI) score and both EpiC groups have lower OARSI scores than the OA group. The EpiC groups also exhibit higher positive expressions of collagen II and aggrecan, and lower MMP13 and ADAMTS5 in the cartilage. RNA‐seq suggest that EpiC may attenuate MMT‐induced ECM degradation by inhibiting the JAK‐STAT pathway. EpiC promotes the gene expressions of Col2a1 and Acan , while inhibiting Mmp13 and Col10a1 in cartilage. EpiC reduces the phosphorylated STAT3 in human chondrocyte pellets stimulated with inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, EpiC demonstrates potential as an OA therapeutic by reducing pain and ECM degradation through p‐STAT3 inhibition.",

This study is to investigate the regulatory mechanism of over‐expression or knock‐down SIRT1 gene, alleviating hypoxia‐induced HK2 cell fibrosis in heart failure. The focus is on the SIRT1‐FoxO1‐FoxO3‐Autophagy pathway. In vitro experiments are performed by HK2cell line to simulate the normal oxygen state (Normoxia) and the hypoxia state (Hypoxia) caused by heart failure, SIRT1 gene over‐expression by transfected vectors, knock‐down and Rapamycin (RAPA)‐induced cellular autophagy, and the cell models are divided into four subgroups, named control group, oeSIRT1, siSIRT1 and siSIRT1+RAPA. Western blotting (WB), real‐time qPCR, immunofluorescence (IF), ELISA, and transmission electron microscopy are used to quantitatively or semi‐quantitatively analyze the expression of FoxO1, FoxO3, SIRT1, Beclin1, LC‐3, α‐SMA, E‐ Cadherin, and collagen‐I in cells or supernatants. It is demonstrated that activation of SIRT1 regulates the expression and activity of FoxO1 and FoxO3, thereby affecting autophagy. This modulation leads to a reduction in HK2 fibrosis markers (α‐SMA and E‐cadherin) and extracellular matrix deposition (collagen I), which ultimately attenuates renal tubular epithelial cell fibrosis. These findings provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies for treating heart failure‐induced renal tubular epithelial cell fibrosis by targeting the SIRT1‐FoxO1‐FoxO3‐Autophagy pathway.",

The alterations in pathology, Notch1 signaling, and macrophage polarization are detected. The results indicated that GLW promoted wound healing, cutaneous cell proliferation, and angiogenesis in DFU rats by inhibiting delta‐like (DLL) 4/Notch1 signaling. In addition, GLW inhibited M1 polarization and promoted M2 polarization in diabetic wounds. Seventeen chemical compounds in GLW‐medicated serum are identified.

Apoptosis‐related gene expression—including Bax, Bcl‐2, and Caspase‐9—was analyzed via quantitative PCR (qPCR). Chromatographic methods identified bioactive flavonoids, and molecular docking assessed their binding to cancer‐related proteins.

Gene expression indicated activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, with increased Bax and Caspase‐9 and decreased Bcl‐2 expression. Flow cytometry using Annexin V‐allophycocyanin (V‐APC) staining revealed selective cytotoxicity: significant apoptosis in A549 cells while preserving viability in BEAS‐2B normal lung epithelial cells.

    "abstract": "Abstract IFN‐γ and TNF‐α are two vital inflammatory factors elevated aberrantly in many diseases. Such an inflammatory microenvironment is detrimental to residual cells such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), yet the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. IFN‐γ and TNF‐α have distinct effects on the immunoregulatory properties of MSCs, and they have been proposed as optimal priming factors to enhance the immunosuppressive capacity of engineered MSCs. Thus, the overall effects of IFN‐γ and/or TNF‐α exposure on MSCs needs to be elucidated. Here, it is found that IFN‐γ and TNF‐α synergistically induce cell death of MSCs via necroptosis. When MSCs are exposed to both IFN‐γ and TNF‐α, their morphological features and biological functions are impaired. Mechanistically revealed by RNA‐Sequencing, the injured MSCs undergo a unique cell death process, namely necroptosis. Compared with controls, IFN‐γ synergized with TNF‐α to increase the expression of RIPK1 , RIPK3 , MLKL , and all other genes associated with necroptosis. Rescue experiments further demonstrate that this process can be reversed by RIPK3 and MLKL inhibitors but not by the RIPK1 inhibitor, suggesting a RIPK1 ‐independent pathway. Collectively, this study discloses an inflammatory injury mechanism of MSCs, which may shed new light on revealing the MSCs deficits in many inflammatory diseases with expectations to inspire potential targeted therapies. In addition, inflammatory impairment should be taken into consideration when delivering cell therapy based on MSCs primed with IFN‐γ and TNF‐α.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The axolotl ( Ambystoma mexicanum ) has a great capacity to regenerate its tissues; however, the fidelity and success of its regenerative process diminish with age. Retrotransposons make up the largest portion of the axolotl genome, and their expression may be involved in this age‐related decline. Through an integrative analysis of repetitive element expression using RNA sequencing, it is shown that Ty3 retrotransposons are highly upregulated in the axolotl as an effect of chronological aging. Other non‐long‐terminal‐repeat transposons, including long interspersed nuclear element 1, function as hubs of gene coexpression networks involved in muscle development and regulation of apoptosis and connective tissue replacement, which are also suppressed in adulthood. By contrast, it is found that during regeneration of the limb, these pathways and the expression of Ty3 retrotransposons are distinctly downregulated. Although the blastema can readjust most of the transposon differential expression in adulthood, several elements remain affected and may have an impact in the immune response during regeneration. This analysis provides a profile of retrotransposon expression through chronological aging and during limb regeneration in the axolotl and indicates that transposons are responsive to physiological changes in a tissue‐specific way and may participate in the gene coregulatory networks underlying the regenerative process.",

The study involved 232 patients with primary cerebral hemorrhage who met the inclusion criteria at the General Hospital of the Western Theater Command, PLA, between January 2018 and December 2023. Imaging and clinical features were compared, radiomic features were extracted from head CT scans, and a multivariate logistic regression model identified key imaging markers and clinical features. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used for dimensionality reduction of radiomic features and to develop a radiomic signature/model. Patients were split into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. Then, NCCT, clinical, radiomics, and combined NCCT‐clinical‐radiomics models were built, along with a nomogram. The AUC values for hematoma expansion prediction were as follows in the training set: NCCT model (0.758), clinical model (0.742), radiomics model (0.779), and combined model (0.872). In the validation set, the AUCs were: NCCT model (0.853), clinical model (0.754), radiomics model (0.778), and combined model (0.905). Calibration and decision curve analysis further confirmed the superior clinical utility of the combined model over the individual models. In conclusion, the combined NCCT‐clinical‐radiomics model significantly outperformed the individual models, leading to improved predictive accuracy, stability, and generalizability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study evaluated the therapeutic effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in rats. The study focused on the balance of T‐helper 17 (Th17) and regulatory T (Treg) cells, as well as the modulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. This study established a rat ARDS model using intranasal LPS instillation, administering interventions such as FMT, Treg cell depletion, and JAK inhibitors. Assessments included histopathological examination of lung and intestinal tissues, flow cytometry for Th17 and Treg cell proportions, qPCR and Western blot for gene and protein expression, ELISA for inflammatory cytokines, and correlation analysis using Spearman's method for cytokine‐immune cell interactions. Results indicated that FMT and JAK inhibitors significantly reduce lung damage induced by LPS, reduced alveolar destruction and inflammation, restored Th17/Treg balance, and inhibited JAK/STAT pathway activity. Notably, FMT decreased pro‐inflammatory cytokines (IL‐2, IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐17A, IL‐23, TGF‐β1) and increased anti‐inflammatory cytokines (IL‐10, IL‐35) in serum. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that FMT restored immune balance by modulating the interactions between cytokines and immune cells. In conclusion, FMT effectively alleviates lung and intestinal injury in LPS‐induced ARDS rat models by modulating Th17/Treg balance and inhibiting JAK/STAT pathway activity, demonstrating promising therapeutic potential for ARDS treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Krabbe disease (KD) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by severe neurodegeneration and demyelination. It is caused by mutations in the galactosylceramidase (GALC) gene, leading to the accumulation of psychosine, a neurotoxic metabolite. This study presents an optimized workflow for the production and characterization of recombinant murine GALC (rm‐GALC) from HEK293T cells, aiming to improve the feasibility of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for KD. An affinity chromatography protocol is refined to purify His‐tagged rm‐GALC, followed by buffer exchange and concentration steps to produce a stable and active enzyme suitable for subsequent in vitro applications. The purified rm‐GALC is characterized for enzymatic activity, purity, and stability using SDS‐PAGE, immunoblotting, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). In vitro assays reveal dose‐dependent enzymatic activity recovery in KD primary cells upon rm‐GALC administration, with no adverse effects on cell viability up to the physiological GALC dose. Additionally, GALC treatment at the physiological dose restored autophagic function in KD cells, as shown by LC3 and p62 marker analyses, confirming its compatibility with lysosomal‐autophagic pathways. Conversely, supra‐physiological GALC administration resulted in decreased viability and autophagy impairment. Finally, the feasibility of loading GALC into a polymeric nanovector based on stabilized reverse micelles is investigated. These findings highlight the critical importance of precise GALC dose regulation in developing a safe and effective enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) strategy for Krabbe disease (KD), further supporting the potential of a nanovector‐mediated ERT approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 850 million individuals worldwide, often progressing to stages requiring dialysis or kidney transplants. Central to kidney function is the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB), which selectively filters waste while retaining essential proteins. Traditional models, including animal studies and 2D cell cultures, fail to fully replicate the GFB's complexity, limiting CKD research. Recent developments in microphysiological systems (MPS), particularly microphysiological glomerular filtration barriers (MPGFB), provide more accurate in vitro models for studying kidney diseases and evaluating therapies. MPGFB systems use organ‐on‐chip technology to integrate podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells within confined microfluidic environments, closely mimicking GFB's dynamic in vivo conditions. This setup enables detailed permeability analysis, aiding in research on disease mechanisms and drug toxicity. Furthermore, using human‐induced pluripotent stem cells in MPGFB platforms allows patient‐specific studies, enhancing insights into genetic kidney disorders. This review first examines the GFB's structure and function, focusing on its cellular and extracellular matrix components. It then discusses biological and engineering approaches to MPGFB fabrication, covering materials, 3D design, and flow control. The review concludes with MPGFB applications in disease modeling and drug testing, and addresses improvements needed for refining MPGFB as a key tool in kidney disease research and treatment.",

Microcalcifications (&lt;50 µm) have been shown, in computational models, to affect the biomechanical stability of the cap. The current study aims to develop a tissue‐engineered model of the atherosclerotic fibrous cap with microcalcifications produced by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Human MSCs are seeded in fibrin gels and cultured for 2 weeks in medium supplemented with TGF‐β1 to induce smooth muscle cell differentiation and collagenous matrix formation. Afterward, mineralizing medium stimulates microcalcification formation for an additional 4 weeks. Tissue‐engineered structures are imaged after culture with second harmonic generation microscopy with a hydroxyapatite probe, showing collagenous matrix with microcalcifications. Mechanical characterization shows the effect of microcalcifications on global tissue mechanics, as the ultimate stress at rupture of the tissue is significantly lower compared to control tissues. The amount of calcification, determined by histological analysis, is correlated to the decrease in ultimate tensile stress, with a higher amount of microcalcification resulting in weakened mechanical properties. The developed tissue‐engineered plaque cap model with biologically formed collagenous matrix and microcalcifications offers valuable insight into the impact of microcalcifications on biomechanical stability.",

To enhance their regenerative properties, ASCs can be chemically stimulated using various in vitro protocols. However, unsatisfactory results persist, partly due to the relatively costly long‐term methods. Furthermore, current culturing techniques often rely on the use of xenogenic fetal bovine serum that can be immunogenic, limiting clinical translations. To facilitate clinical translation of ASCs‐derived therapeutics, the effect of different stimulation protocols on human ASCs cultured in a xeno‐free medium (PRIME‐XV MSC Expansion XSFM) is investigated. The xeno‐free medium was supplemented with stimulants (forskolin (FSK), basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet‐derived growth factor‐AA, neuregulin‐1) in combinations or individually. Stimulation for 72 h in FSK alone, or together with the growth factors, enhanced the production of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a serine protease involved in tissue remodeling processes. Conditioned medium derived from stimulated ASCs enhanced in vitro angiogenesis and endothelial cells migration. This study shows that pro‐angiogenic responses in human ASCs can be enhanced with a defined short stimulation protocol using a xeno‐free medium. The protocol, using readily available manufacturing cell therapy grade molecules, may boost the regenerative properties of ASCs secretome which could enhance their efficacy in clinical treatments.",

PARP inhibitor (PARPi) has shown great prospects in the treatment of tumors carrying homologous recombination (HR) deficiencies, such as germline BRCA1/2 mutations. PARPi leads to an increase in the expression of tumor neoantigen, interferon (IFN), and programmed cell death 1/programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1), which also regulate the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting a deeper anti‐tumor immunotherapy. ICIs targeting PD‐1/PD‐L1 and cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte‐associated protein 4 (CTLA‐4) have achieved impressive success in the treatment of malignancies. Considering PARPi do enhance the anti‐tumor response of ICIs, the combination of PARPi and ICIs has gradually become an alternative treatment option for individuals not receiving apparent efficacy from ICI monotherapy.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bis‐(3′‐5′)‐cyclic diguanylic acid (c‐di‐GMP), a ubiquitous secondary messenger, affects multiple biological characteristics, including biofilm formation in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC). C‐di‐GMP is synthesized by diguanylate cyclase harboring a GGDEF domain and degraded by phosphodiesterase harboring either an EAL or an HD‐GYP domain. However, the roles of PdeN, encoding a CSS‐EAL domain, are uncharacterized. In this study, it is demonstrated that lacking pdeN significantly promotes biofilm formation and reduces the motility of the clinically isolated APEC O2 serotype strain DE17. In addition, macrocolony morphotypes showed that the Δ pdeN strain exhibits increasing production of curli fibers and cellulose, which is consistent with the results of RNA‐seq and qPCR. Further exploration shows that lactose permease LacY and mannose permease subunit ManZ interact with PdeN. Infection experiments show that lacking pde N significantly reduced the release of LDH in HD‐11 cells and adhesion capacity to DF‐1 cells. In conclusion, c‐di‐GMP metabolic gene pdeN involves biofilm formation and pathogenicity of APEC. Besides, it interacts with LacY and ManZ. Those results provide a basis for the prevention and control of APEC from the perspective of biofilm and carbohydrate metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neuroblastoma represents a major challenge in pediatric oncology with over 50% of cases involving metastasis. High‐risk patients face an unfavorable prognosis, with survival rates below 40%. LIN28B plays a pivotal role in neuroblastoma development, being overexpressed in a subset of high‐risk patients with widespread metastases. Here, the effect of induced LIN28B (iLIN28B) expression on neuroblastoma cells is investigated with a focus on key aspects of the metastatic cascade including anchorage, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. iLIN28B cells show substrate‐selective adherence, coating‐dependent migration, and the context‐guided ability to degrade the extracellular matrix. In response to tumor cell‐derived IGF2, endothelial cells show enhanced motility and proliferation, while inhibition of IGF2 activity impairs LIN28B‐induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. These findings underscore the hub role of LIN28B in favoring pre‐metastatic processes in neuroblastoma. The intricate interplay between LIN28B, endothelial cells, and the extracellular matrix contributes to the development of the aggressive neuroblastoma phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cancer is one of the most pervasive and severe global diseases that cause millions of death annually. Numerous bacterial strains are found to play fundamental roles in tumor formation, growth, and metastasis. On the other hand, specific bacterial strains are discovered to induce beneficial changes to restrict tumoral growth and progression or alter the tumor microenvironment. Studies have also suggested bacteria are potential microorganisms that transfer synthetic genes or anti‐tumor drugs. A particularly interesting area of study is bacterial communication, known as quorum sensing (QS), in which signal peptides adjust bacterial pathogenic traits such as virulence factor, drug resistance, and biofilm after a threshold volume of signals is reached. QS signals raised a propitious future perspective against diseases and cancer. Future comprehension of the QS system can lead to novel bacterial‐based therapeutic procedures with the minimum healthy cell toxicity and higher target specificity rather than long‐established methods. This review aims to highlight significant research and advancements in the field of QS to combat cancer and find more non‐toxic and less‐invasive treatments.",

In the last decade, multiple efforts have been undertaken to mimic the heterogeneous consortium of tumors to comprehend tumor biology. Understanding the tumor‐stromal or tumor‐immune crosstalk is also crucial for screening and pre‐clinical evaluation of therapeutic candidates. The development of human‐relevant and physiologically similar models is the need of the hour to bridge the gap. Existing models relevant to tissue engineering, including porous scaffolds, hydrogel, and fibrous mats, are widely utilized to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment. In spite of their inherent limitations, they are employed to study tumor‐immune interactions in the past. In the recent decade, emerging techniques such as Microfluidics, organ on a chip, and 3D Bioprinting have been used prevalently to mimic the heterogeneous landscape of tumors. This review is intended to discuss the current developments in the field of in vitro 3D tumor models while focusing on the tumor‐immune crosstalk. Furthermore, the theoretical and practical limitations of the conventional model mimicking the tumorimmune crosstalk and the need for ‘out of the box’ ideas by converging the existing models are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Degenerative disc disease is strongly associated with low back pain, making it a leading cause of disability. With injury and age, cellular remodeling of the disc tissue leads to compositional changes, stiffening, and loss of stress relaxation, particularly in the central gelatinous nucleus pulposus (NP) region of the disc. As part of this extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, there is an increase in the deposition of fibronectin, a strongly adhesive integrin ligand that is known to regulate inflammatory signaling. However, it is unclear how these pathological changes in cellular adhesion regulate cell phenotype, and which domains of fibronectin are specifically involved. Here, a dextran vinyl sulfone (DexVS) hydrogel system is employed for presentation of specific fibronectin domains. Fibronectin peptides are found to enhance YAP signaling, inflammatory NF‐κB signaling, cellular adhesion, and cellular contractility in NP cells, which leads to a decrease in aggrecan gene expression. Covalent modification of these DexVS hydrogels with bioactive peptides allows for targeted interactions with specific integrin receptors that are involved in healthy or degenerative signaling. In doing so, the integrin binding peptides from fibronectin are identified to activate a contractile phenotype in NP cells.",

This enables the analysis of the kinetics of signal activation and propagation in a spatially and temporally resolved manner. A key strategy for such control is the light‐inducible clustering of signaling molecules, which leads to their activation and subsequent downstream signaling. In this work, an optogenetic approach is developed for inducing graded clustering of different proteins that are fused to eGFP, a widely used protein tag. To this aim, an eGFP‐specific nanobody is fused to Cryptochrome 2 variants engineered for different orders of cluster formation. This is exemplified by clustering eGFP‐IKKα and eGFP‐IKKβ, thereby achieving potent and reversible activation of NF‐κB signaling. It is demonstrated that this approach can activate downstream signaling via the endogenous NF‐κB pathway and is thereby capable of activating both an NF‐κB‐responsive reporter construct as well as endogenous NF‐κB‐responsive target genes as analyzed by RNA sequencing. The generic design of this system is likely transferable to other signaling pathways to analyze the kinetics of signal activation and propagation.",

However, formation time has become the bottleneck of applications due to the need for large-scale high-quality spheroids production. Formation time is often dominated by ECM construction and not cell aggregation. Therefore, this study focuses on the influence of ultrasound detachment replacing conventional enzyme detachment on spheroid formation processes. Thanks to cell surface protein preservation in ultrasound detachment, cell aggregation time is reduced while decreasing the formation variabilities. Moreover, it is confirmed that cells are intrinsically more capable of aggregating through enzyme-free detachment. On top of that, transplantations into rats showed equally successful engraftment properties for enzyme-free detached cells. Finally, the impact on the real co-cultured spheroid application was shown to be beneficial through more localized cell groups inside of the spheroids, possibly improving therapeutic effects and vascularization. Through this study, it is proved that ultrasound detachment can replace enzyme detachment without degrading the final spheroid properties but reducing the formation time, and variability and improving robustness and cell distribution. This opens up a new range of applications for better and faster spheroid formation in numerous bioengineering applications.",

In addition, LAs impact the tumor microenvironment by modulating inflammation, enhancing the immune response, blocking angiogenesis, and interfering with tumor innervation. The mechanisms behind these effects involve both voltage-gated sodium channel-dependent and independent pathways, such as AKT/mTOR, RAS/ERK, and SRC/STAT3, as well as regulating microRNAs, circular RNAs, and apoptosis-related proteins, among others.

In this review, the current understanding of the impact of microbiota is summarized on the tumour immune microenvironment (TIME) in ESCC, focusing on intratumoural microbes and the oral‐gut microbiota axis as potential therapeutic targets. The mechanisms are discussed by which specific bacterial species, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) , Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) , Streptococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp., influence immune responses and contribute to the progression of ESCC.

    "abstract": "Abstract Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (Stat3) acts as a central transcriptional modulator coordinating cellular proliferation, survival, apoptosis, vascularization, immune regulation, and migratory processes. Human Stat3 deficiency triggers Hyper‐IgE syndrome, associated with immune dysregulation, osseous defects, and dental malformations. This study employs genetically engineered murine models to dissect Stat3's mechanistic role within mesenchymal progenitor cells during molar root formation and periodontal tissue maturation. Conditional Stat3 knockout mice (Prx1‐Cre; Stat3 f/f ) are generated. Comparative assessments of mandibular first molar root development between Stat3 CKO and wild‐type cohorts are performed through histomorphometric evaluation, micro‐computed tomography, cellular proliferation assays (Ki67/BrdU), and transcriptome sequencing. Stat3 ablation causes marked morphological defects in first molars, featuring reduced root length and elevated crown‐root proportion. The periodontal ligament (PDL) at the distal root exhibits diminished width in mutants. Alveolar bone displays suppressed expression of osteogenic markers (Runx2, Col1a1, Ocn), accompanied by decreased Ki67 + and BrdU + cell populations in the PDL. Stat3 critically regulates mandibular first molar and alveolar bone morphogenesis. Conditional ablation of Stat3 disrupts the osteogenic capacity of Prx1 + mesenchymal progenitors, as evidenced across in vivo and in vitro models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Physiological aging is accompanied by structural and molecular changes in the brain, with varying degrees in different brain areas, and is considered one of the major risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the present study focuses on elucidating age‐related changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), a brain region particularly vulnerable in Parkinson's disease. Here, the aim is to gain a spatially resolved view of aging‐dependent alterations to conclude early processes potentially involved in neurodegeneration. Neuromelanin granules and SNpc tissue are isolated from tissue samples of young and elderly individuals via laser microdissection and measured by mass spectrometry to ascertain changes in protein expression in response to age. The findings include the identification of reduced levels of proteins involved in dopaminergic neurotransmission, either suggesting a specific loss of dopaminergic neurons or a reduction in metabolic activity. Furthermore, increased neuroinflammation is observed in elderly individuals and alterations in vesicular trafficking as well as mitochondrial proteins. Consequently, this exploratory study suggests that alterations causing known pathomechanisms of Parkinson's disease are already occurring in the physiological aging process. Since aging is still the most important risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, these findings strengthen the necessity for studying age‐related changes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is crucial for maintaining whole‐body metabolic homeostasis and combating obesity and metabolic disorders. SOX4 collaborates with EBF2 to promote the expression of thermogenic genes in BAT, but it is unclear whether there are mechanisms independent of this regulation. However, it is found that SOX4 can directly interact with the promoter regions of thermogenic genes, thereby activating their expression. Simultaneously, early B cell factor 2 (EBF2) and peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐γ (PPARγ) can independently interact with SOX4, forming two distinct complexes that promote the expression of thermogenic genes. Phenotypically, the deletion of SOX4 in BAT of mice ( Ucp1 Cre+ ‐Sox4 f/f ( Sox4‐BKO )) leads to the downregulation of thermogenic and oxidative phosphorylation genes, as well as a reduction in mitochondrial numbers. Furthermore, Sox4‐BKO mice are more susceptible to obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance when subjected to a high‐fat diet (HFD). Consistently, the loss of SOX4 results in increased cellular triglyceride content and reduced expression levels of thermogenic genes in vitro. Together, a novel mechanism by which SOX4 regulates thermogenesis in BAT is elucidated, offering a promising strategy to address obesity and metabolic disorders.",

However, information on the role of snoRNAs and associated small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snoRNPs) in prostate cancer (PCa) remains scarce. Here, the contribution of the snoRNP U3 snoRNA‐interacting protein 2 ( RRP9 ) in PCa pathogenesis is investigated. A combination of three different shRNAs is employed to knockdown RRP9 in the PCa cell lines DU‐145 and PC‐3. Cell proliferation is evaluated by seeding cells into a 96‐well plates and monitoring daily. Cell migration is evaluated by scratch and Transwell assays. FLAG‐ RRP9 pull‐down, MALDI‐TOF/TOF, and co‐immunoprecipitation assays are conducted to identify RRP9 binding partners in DU‐145 cells. In vitro cell proliferation and migration, as well as in vivo tumor growth, are suppressed following RRP9 knockdown. Pull‐down and MALDI‐TOF/TOF analyses identified five putative RRP9 binding partners, and co‐immunoprecipitation validated that RRP9 interacts with the scaffolding hub protein Sequestome‐1 (SQSTM1, p62). Interestingly, SQSTM1 overexpression rescued the anti‐growth/migration effects of RRP9 knockdown. This study unveiled a novel oncogenic role for the RRP9 ‐SQSTM1 axis in PCa cells. RRP9 is a snoRNP that binds to SQSTM1, thereby promoting PCa cell proliferation and migration. Targeting the RRP9 ‐SQSTM1 axis may be a viable therapeutic strategy for PCa.",

As our understanding of macrophage biology and their tissue‐specific behaviors grows the necessity to model macrophages within a 3D biomimetic environment becomes increasingly apparent. Numerous hydrogels are developed and explored for this purpose, extracellular matrix (ECM) mimicking hydrogels gaining special interest. In this study, the use of such a hydrogel composed of collagen and hyaluronic acid (HA), two of the major ECM components, is presented for the 3D culture of macrophages to model their role in different tissues and diseases. The ability to tailor the mechanical properties of the hydrogel through formulation modulation is demonstrated. Human macrophages retain morphology, viability, and expression of key cell surface markers when 3D cultured within the hydrogel. Interestingly, it is demonstrate in this work, that independent of mechanical properties, by adjusting the composition of the hydrogel, specifically HA molecular weight, steers macrophage polarization toward either a pro‐inflammatory or anti‐inflammatory phenotype. This HA‐dependent modulation of macrophage behavior is nullified if the HA is chemically crosslinked, shedding light on the impact of one of the most commonly used preparation methods for collagen‐HA hydrogels on macrophage behavior.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is becoming increasingly clear that mechanical stress in adhesive junctions plays a significant role in dictating the fate of cell–cell attachment under physiological conditions. Targeted disruption of cell–cell junctions leads to multiple pathological conditions, among them the life‐threatening autoimmune blistering disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV). The dissociation of cell–cell junctions by autoantibodies is the hallmark of PV, however, the detailed mechanisms that result in tissue destruction remain unclear. Thus far, research and therapy in PV have focused primarily on immune mechanisms upstream of autoantibody binding, while the biophysical aspects of the cell–cell dissociation process leading to acantholysis are less well studied. In work aimed at illuminating the cellular consequences of autoantibody attachment, it is reported that externally applied mechanical stress mitigates antibody‐induced monolayer fragmentation and inhibits p38 MAPK phosphorylation activated by anti‐Dsg3 antibody. Further, it is demonstrated that mechanical stress applied externally to cell monolayers enhances cell contractility via RhoA activation and promotes the strengthening of cortical actin, which ultimately mitigates antibody‐induced cell–cell dissociation. The study elevates understanding of the mechanism of acantholysis in PV and shifts the paradigm of PV disease development from a focus solely on immune pathways to highlight the key role of physical transformations at the target cell.",

Today, more than 160 different RNA modifications are known that decorate the RNA at the 5′‐terminus or internal RNA positions. The boost of next‐generation sequencing technologies sets the foundation to identify and study the functional role of RNA modifications. The recent advances in the field of RNA modifications reveal a novel regulatory layer between RNA modifications and proteins, which is central to developing a novel concept called “epitranscriptomics.” The majority of RNA modifications studies focus on the eukaryotic epitranscriptome. In contrast, RNA modifications in prokaryotes are poorly characterized. This review outlines the current knowledge of the prokaryotic epitranscriptome focusing on mRNA modifications. Here, it is described that several internal and 5′‐terminal RNA modifications either present or likely present in prokaryotic mRNA. Thereby, the individual techniques to identify these epitranscriptomic modifications, their writers, readers and erasers, and their proposed functions are explored. Besides that, still unanswered questions in the field of prokaryotic epitranscriptomics are pointed out, and its future perspectives in the dawn of next‐generation sequencing technologies are outlined.",

Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma samples are mixed with inhibitors for recalcification of the plasma samples to avoid activation of the coagulation‐ or complement system. Moreover, the assay is validated by spiking vascular endothelial growth factor, histamine, or tumor necrosis factor alpha to recalcified plasma and confirms their modulation of microvessel barrier function at physiologically relevant concentrations. Finally, this study shows that perfusing the microvessels with recalcified plasma samples of coronavirus disease‐2019 patients, with a confirmed proinflammatory profile, results in markedly increased leakage of the microvessels. The assay provides opportunities for diagnostic screening of inflammatory or endothelial disrupting plasma factors associated with endothelial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The interaction of two types of fragmented graphene particles (30–160 nm) with human macrophages is studied. Since macrophages have significant phagocytic activity, the incorporation of graphene particles into cells has an effect on the response to functional polarization stimuli, favoring an anti‐inflammatory profile. Incubation of macrophages with graphene foam particles, prepared by chemical vapor deposition, and commercially available graphene nanoplatelet particles does not affect cell viability when added at concentrations up to 100 µg mL −1 ; macrophages exhibit differential quantitative responses to each type of graphene particles. Although both materials elicit similar increases in the release of reactive oxygen species, the impact on the transcriptional regulation associated with the polarization profile is different; graphene nanoplatelets significantly modify this transcriptomic profile. Moreover, these graphene particles differentially affect the motility and phagocytosis of macrophages. After the incorporation of both graphene types into the macrophages, they exhibit specific responses in terms of the mitochondrial oxygen consumption and electrophysiological potassium currents at the cell plasma membrane. These data support the view that the physical structure of the graphene particles has an impact on human macrophage responses, paving the way for the development of new mechanisms to modulate the activity of the immune system.",

Bioink is optimized regarding its biophysical properties and is mixed with murine neural cells to construct a 3D model of COVID-19 infection.

    "abstract": "Abstract Blood and lymphatic vessels are regulators of physiological processes, including oxygenation and fluid transport. Both vessels are ubiquitous throughout the body and are critical for sustaining tissue homeostasis. The complexity of each vessel's processes has limited the understanding of exactly how the vessels maintain their functions. Both vessels have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer metastasis, and it is crucial to probe further specific mechanisms involved. In vitro models are developed to better understand blood and lymphatic physiological functions and their mechanisms. In this review, blood and lymphatic in vitro model systems, including 2D and 3D designs made using Transwells, microfluidic devices, organoid cultures, and various other methods, are described. Models studying endothelial cell‐extracellular matrix interactions, endothelial barrier properties, transendothelial transport and cell migration, lymph/angiogenesis, vascular inflammation, and endothelial‐cancer cell interactions are particularly focused. While the field has made significant progress in modeling and understanding lymphatic and blood vasculature, more models that include coculture of multiple cell types, complex extracellular matrix, and 3D morphologies, particularly for models mimicking disease states, will help further the understanding of the role of blood and lymphatic vasculature in health and disease.",

An increasing amount of experimental evidence across multiple tumor types strongly suggests the existence of bidirectional crosstalk between cancer cells and the neural microenvironment. However, unlike cancers affecting many solid organs, brain tumors, namely gliomas, can synaptically integrate into neural circuits and thus can exert a greater potential to induce dynamic remodeling of functional circuits resulting in long-lasting behavioral changes. The first part of the review describes dynamic changes in language, sensory, and motor networks following glioma development and presents evidence focused on how different patterns of glioma-induced cortical reorganization may predict the degree and time course of functional recovery in brain tumor patients. The second part focuses on the network and cellular-level mechanisms underlying glioma-induced cerebral reorganization. Finally, oncological and clinical factors influencing glioma-induced network remodeling in glioma patients are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is responsible for driving metastasis of multiple cancer types including lung cancer. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, a ligand-activated transcription factor, controls expression of variety of genes involved in EMT. Although several synthetic compounds act as potent full agonists for PPAR-γ, their long term application is restricted due to serious adverse effects. Therefore, partial agonists involving reduced and balanced PPAR-γ activity are more effective and valued. A previous study discerned the efficacy of quercetin and its derivatives to attain favorable stabilization with PPAR-γ. Here this work is extended by synthesizing five novel quercetin derivatives (QDs) namely thiosemicarbazone (QUETSC)) and hydrazones (quercetin isonicotinic acid hydrazone (QUEINH), quercetin nicotinic acid hydrazone (QUENH), quercetin 2-furoic hydrazone (QUE2FH), and quercetin salicyl hydrazone (QUESH)) and their effects are analyzed in modulating EMT in lung cancer cell lines via PPAR-γ partial activation. QDs-treated A549 cells diminish cell proliferation strongly at nanomolar concentration compared to NCI-H460 cells. Of the five screened derivatives, QUETSC, QUE2FH, and QUESH exhibit the property of partial activation as compared to the overexpressive level of rosiglitazone. Consistently, these QDs also suppress EMT process by markedly downregulating the levels of mesenchymal markers (Snail, Slug, and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1) and concomitant upregulation of epithelial marker (E-cadherin).",

This research aims to explore the bioactive ingredients and mechanisms of burdock leaves against AD by performing chemical profiles, network pharmacology, and molecular docking. 61 components are identified by liquid chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry. 792 targets of ingredients and 1661 AD-related genes are retrieved from public databases. Ten critical ingredients are identified from the topology analysis of the compound-target network. CytoNCA, AlzData database, and Aging Atlas database contribute to the foundation of 36 potential targets and four clinically significant targets (STAT3, RELA, MAPK8, and AR). The gene ontology (GO) analysis manifests that the included processes are close to the pathogenesis of AD. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway may be important therapeutic mechanisms. Molecular docking results imply that network pharmacology results are reliable. Furthermore, the clinical meanings of core targets are also evaluated with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.

In the past decade, FDA has approved many immunotherapy products for cancer patients who suffer from primary tumors, tumor relapse, and metastases. However, these immunotherapies still show resistance in many patients and often lead to inconsistent responses in patients due to variations in tumor genetic mutations and tumor immune microenvironment. Microfluidics‐based organ‐on‐a‐chip technologies or microphysiological systems have opened new ways that can provide relatively fast screening for personalized immunotherapy and help researchers and clinicians understand tumor‐immune interactions in a patient‐specific manner. They also have the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional drug screening and testing, given the models provide a more realistic 3D microenvironment with better controllability, reproducibility, and physiological relevance. This review focuses on the cutting‐edge microphysiological organ‐on‐a‐chip devices developed in recent years for studying cancer immunity and testing cancer immunotherapeutic agents, as well as some of the largest challenges of translating this technology to clinical applications in immunotherapy and personalized medicine.",

Plants have evolved to withstand photo‐oxidative stress, but the key regulatory mechanism underlying it remains unclear. In rice ( Oryza sativa ), DEEP GREEN PANICLE1 ( DGP1 ) is robustly up‐regulated in response to Pi deficiency. DGP1 decreases the DNA‐binding capacities of the transcriptional activators GLK1/2 on the photosynthetic genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, light harvesting, and electron transport. This Pi‐starvation‐induced mechanism dampens both electron transport rates through photosystem I and II (ETRI and ETRII) and thus mitigates the electron‐excessive stress in mesophyll cells. Meanwhile, DGP1 hijacks glycolytic enzymes GAPC1/2/3, redirecting glucose metabolism toward the pentose phosphate pathway with superfluous NADPH production. Phenotypically, light irradiation induces O 2 − production in Pi‐starved WT leaves but is observably accelerated in dgp1 mutant and impaired in GAPCs RNAi and glk1glk2 lines. Interestingly, overexpressed DGP1 in rice caused hyposensitivity to ROS‐inducers (catechin and methyl viologen), but the dgp1 mutant shows a similar inhibitory phenotype with the WT seedlings. Overall, the DGP1 gene serves as a specific antagonizer against photo‐ROS in Pi‐starved rice plants, which coordinates light‐absorbing and anti‐oxidative systems by orchestrating transcriptional and metabolic regulations, respectively.",

However, the development of colonic organoids (i.e., colonoids) is particularly challenging due to a lack of simple, cost‐effective protocols for colonoid cultivation. Here, intestinal homogenates are described as a supplement to the culture medium for maintaining and replicating colonic stem cells. Colonoids generated by this cultivation protocol demonstrate substantial proliferation and differentiation (3 months). There is a similarity between cultured colonoids and primary colon tissue regarding structure and functionality. To evaluate the functionality of colonoids, permeability testing is performed with suspensions of 4 and 40 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate‐dextran (FITC‐DEX). It is observed that neither can permeate the healthy epithelial barrier. The P‐glycoprotein receptor, a vital drug efflux pump mitigating potential drug toxicity, is functionally manipulated, as evidenced by its inhibition function by verapamil and monitoring uptake of Rhodamin 123. In addition, Forskolin treatment which affects chloride transport results in organoid swelling; this confirms the functional expression of the CFTR transporter in the colonoids. This protocol to generate colonoids is promising for high‐throughput drug screening, toxicity testing, and oral drug development.",

It is therefore crucial to optimize diagnosis and treatment to reduce this burden. Endothelial dysfunction is one of the most important prognostic factors for CVD progression, thus novel approaches to identify the early phase of endothelial dysfunction may lead to specific preventive measures to reduce the occurrence of CVD. Nowadays, multiomics approaches have provided unprecedented opportunities to stratify T2D patients into endotypes, improve therapeutic treatment and outcome and amend the survival prediction. Among omics strategies, epigenetics and metabolomics are gaining increasing interest. Recently, a dynamic correlation between metabolic pathways and gene expression through chromatin remodeling, such as DNA methylation, has emerged, indicating new perspectives on the regulatory networks impacting cellular processes. Thus, a better understanding of epigenetic‐metabolite relationships can provide insight into the physiological processes altered early in the endothelium that ultimately head to disease development. Here, recent studies on epigenetics and metabolomics related to CVD prevention potentially useful to identify disease biomarkers, as well as new therapies hopefully targeting the early phase of endothelial dysfunction are highlighted.",

Despite showing promise in numerous preclinical and clinical studies, MSC‐based therapy is not yet a reality for regenerative medicine due to its suboptimal outcome at the clinical endpoint. The mechanical environment is a critical determinant of MSC gene expression and function. This study reports that MSC population becomes phenotypically heterogenous and commits to an unwanted osteoprogenitor pathway when it experiences an abnormal mechanically stiff environment, compared to its native softer environment. A method is developed to measure the heterogeneity using nuclear shape, chromatin state, and CD73 marker. Heterogeneity is shown to be associated with a larger spread in the nuclear shape parameters and a smaller spread in the chromatin openness. Subsequently, intervention strategies are investigated to create a more homogeneous MSC population. Culturing MSCs on soft surfaces or inhibiting actomyosin on stiff surfaces can make them more homogeneous, while inhibiting YAP, Runx2, and actin polymerization helps maintain but does not fully homogenize them. This study offers insights for cell and tissue engineers, aiding in the design of optimal conditions and materials for MSC culture, ultimately enhancing their therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cellular senescence is a state of exiting the cell cycle, resisting apoptosis, and changing phenotype. Senescent cells (SCs) can be identified by large, distorted morphology and irreversible inability to replicate. In early development, senescence has beneficial roles like tissue patterning and wound healing, where SCs are cleared by the immune system. However, there is a steep rise in SC number as organisms age. The issue with SC accumulation stems from the loss of cellular function, alterations of the microenvironment, and secretions of pro‐inflammatory molecules, consisting of cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), interleukins, and extracellular matrix (ECM)‐associated molecules. This secreted cocktail is referred to as the senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a hallmark of cellular senescence. The SASP promotes inflammation and displays a bystander effect where paracrine signaling turns proliferating cells into senescent states. To alleviate age‐associated diseases, researchers have developed novel methods and techniques to selectively eliminate SCs in aged individuals. Although studies demonstrated that selectively killing SCs improves age‐related disorders, there are drawbacks to SC removal. Considering favorable aspects of senescence in the body, this paper reviews recent advancements in elimination strategies and potential rejuvenation targets of senescence to bring researchers in the field up to date.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Trehalose is synthesized in insects through the trehalose 6‐phosphate synthase and phosphatase ( TPS/TPP ) pathway. TPP dephosphorylates trehalose 6‐phosphate to release trehalose. Trehalose is involved in metamorphosis, but its relation with body weight, size, and developmental timing is unexplored. The expression and activity of TPS/TPP fluctuate depending on trehalose demand. Thus, TPS/TPP inhibition can highlight the significance of trehalose in insect physiology. TPS/TPP transcript levels are elevated in the pre‐pupal and pupal stages in Helicoverpa armigera . The inhibition of recombinantly expressed TPP by N ‐(phenylthio)phthalimide (NPP), is validated by in vitro assays. In vivo inhibition of trehalose synthesis reduces larval weight and size, hampers metamorphosis, and reduces its overall fitness. Insufficient trehalose leads to a shift in glucose flux, reduced energy, and dysregulated fatty acid oxidation. Metabolomics reaffirms the depletion of trehalose, glucose, glucose 6‐phosphate, and suppressed tricarboxylic acid cycle. Reduced trehalose hampers the energy level affecting larval vitality. Through trehalose synthesis inhibition, the importance of trehalose in insect physiology and development is investigated. Also, in two other lepidopterans, TPP inhibition impedes physiology and survival. NPP is also found to be effective as an insecticidal formulation. Overall, trehalose levels affect the larval size, weight, and metabolic homeostasis for larval‐pupal transition in lepidoptera.",

Patient samples and in vitro cell experiments showed that the expression of receptors for VIP is negatively correlated with the severity of IVDD, and the administration of exogenous VIP can ameliorate interleukin 1β‐induced nucleus pulposus (NP) cell apoptosis and inflammation. Further mRNA‐seq analysis revealed that fibroblast growth factor 18‐ (FGF18)‐mediated activation of V‐akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog signaling pathway is involved in the protective effects of VIP on inflammation‐induced NP cell degeneration. Further analysis identified VIP via its receptor vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 can directly result in decreased expression of miR‐15a‐5p, which targeted FGF18. Finally, in vivo mice lumbar IVDD model confirmed that focally exogenous administration of VIP can effectively ameliorated the progression of IVDD, as shown by the radiological and histological analysis. In conclusion, these results indicated that sympathetic neurotransmitter, VIP, delayed IVDD via FGF18/FGFR2‐mediated activation of V‐akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog signaling pathway, which will broaden the horizon concerning how the neuromodulation correlates with IVDD and shed new light on novel therapeutical alternatives to IVDD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) that is resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is one of the deadliest hematologic malignancies, and the T315I mutation in the breakpoint cluster region‐Abelson (BCR‐ABL) kinase domain is the most prominent point mutation responsible for imatinib resistance in CML. Glaucocalyxin A (GLA), a natural bioactive product derived from the Rabdosia rubescens plant, has strong anticancer activity. In this study, the effect and molecular mechanism of GLA on imatinib‐sensitive and imatinib‐resistant CML cells harboring T315I mutation via a combined deconvolution strategy of chemoproteomics and label‐free proteomics is investigated. The data demonstrated that GLA restrains proliferation and induces mitochondria‐dependent apoptosis in both imatinib‐sensitive and resistant CML cells. GLA covalently binds to the cysteine residues of mitochondrial voltage‐dependent anion channels (VDACs), resulting in mitochondrial damage and overflow of intracellular apoptotic factors, eventually leading to apoptosis. In addition, the combination of GLA with elastin, a mitochondrial channel VDAC2/3 inhibitor, enhances mitochondria‐dependent apoptosis in imatinib‐sensitive and ‐resistant CML cells, representing a promising therapeutic approach for leukemia treatment. Taken together, the results show that GLA induces mitochondria‐dependent apoptosis via covalently targeting VDACs in CML cells. GLA may thus be a candidate compound for the treatment of leukemia.",

Male Sprague Dawley rats ( n = 10) weighing 230–250 g are divided into two groups, control and HH exposure for 7 days at 25 000 ft. After the hypoxia exposure, the animals are sacrificed and hindlimb skeletal muscles are excised for further analysis. Studies found the potential role of miR‐1 (myomiR) as a biomarker under different atrophic conditions. Prolonged exposure to HH leads to enhanced expression of miR‐1 in skeletal muscle as compared to unexposed controls. The Bioinformatics approach is used to identify the validated targets and the biological processes of miR‐1. The target prediction tools identify PAX3 and HSP70 as major targets for miR‐1. Exposure to HH significantly reduces PAX3 and HSP70 expression during 7 days of HH exposure, which further enhances the activity of FOXO3, MSTN, and ATROGIN known for the progression of skeletal muscle atrophy in relation to control rats. This study indicates the increased expressions of miR‐1 and reduced expression of PAX3 and HSP70 lead to impaired myogenesis in skeletal muscle under HH. Further, enhanced expression of muscle degradation genes such as FOXO3, MSTN, and ATROGIN under HH exposure causes skeletal muscle protein loss.",

However, ROS can exhibit both tumor‐promoting and tumor‐suppressing activities in cancers, and exhibit different effects depending on its source—mtROS vs non‐mtROS. Additionally, since ROS from different sources possesses distinct functions, mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants, and non‐targeted antioxidants may have entirely different effects on cancer progression. To address this complexity, novel measurement techniques such as MitoSOX, MitoPY1, and siDMA are used to specifically assess mtROS, providing deeper insights into mitochondrial function during treatment. Therefore, distinguishing the sources of ROS and separately detecting and targeting mtROS and non‐mtROS can further clarify the anti‐tumor mechanisms of ponicidin and provide a foundation for subsequent research.",

Despite several attempts, to date, there is an extensive lack of therapeutic intervention. Hence, there is a dire need for an effective biomarker to timely diagnose TNBC. Here, utilizing super‐resolution microscopy, the remodeling structural aspects of euchromatin and heterochromatin in TNBC are studied and the results are compared with non‐cancerous and non‐TNBC cell lines. The nanoscopic visualization reveals a distinct difference in chromatin remodeling in TNBC in comparison to the other two cell lines. While the euchromatin density is found to increase, the heterochromatin is found to decrease. A complete switching of the heterochromatin‐euchromatin ratio is observed in TNBC cells thus proposing that chromatin remodeling and chromatin morphological changes can be pursued as one of the targets for diagnostic purposes. Increased expression of structure specific recognition protein‐1(SSRP‐1) protein supports the increased rate of chromatin remodeling in breast cancer cell lines. The results may lead to developing a new strategy for diagnosing TNBC patients.",

They often relate to human pathologies, primarily, to carcinogenesis, and the expression of specific RPs is considerably changed in malignant cells. On the other hand, extracellular vesicles (including exosomes), which provide intercellular communication by transporting specific molecular cargo from donor to recipient cells, often contain specific sets of RPs. Thus, one can assume that oncogenic properties of RPs can be transferred from one cell to another by exosomes. Such kind transfer has been already documented with RPS3 and gastric cancer cells. However, it remains largely unclear how widespread is the above effect and to which extent it contributes to the tumor progression and metastasis. To shed light on this issue, a comparative analysis of the sets of RPs found in exosomes and of the available data on oncogenic properties of these proteins is conducted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer and the third leading cause of cancer‐related deaths worldwide. HCC is a malignant tumor that can lead to intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastases. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM‐1) is involved in cancer metastasis. ICAM‐1 enhances cell‐cell interactions by promoting adhesion and facilitating cell movement within the extracellular matrix. Moreover, ICAM‐1 is more abundant in cancerous hepatocytes than in non‐cancerous ones. Chemokine (C‐X‐C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) is found in diverse cancers, including melanoma, breast, lung, pancreatic, colorectal, and prostate. Several studies show a correlation between CXCL1 overexpression and poor prognosis in cancer. CXCL1 has been identified as a candidate gene that could function as a clinically relevant biomarker in HCC. However, the role of CXCL1 in cancer metastasis in HCC is poorly delineated. In this study, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database analysis revealed a positive correlation between CXCL1 level and the progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. CXCL1 treatment facilitates cell movement through inducing ICAM‐1 expression. The Phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K)/Akt/Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF‐kB) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in CXCL1‐regulated ICAM‐1 production and cell motility. Thus, CXCL1 represents a promising therapeutic target for treating metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.",

These changes result in hypofunction of salivary gland which has a significant impact on the quality of life of head and neck cancer patients who treated with radiotherapy. Nevertheless, no preventive method has been found. Metformin, a diabetes drug, has recently attracted considerable attention because it can cause tissue regeneration by anti‐inflammatory action and influencing stem cells. This study examined the effects of metformin on salivary gland tissue damage caused by radiation therapy. Cultured human parotid epithelial cells are irradiated with 15 Gy of 4MV X‐rays. The analysis including DNA damage, inflammatory markers and proliferation, is conducted to confirm the effect of metformin. Similarly, an in vivo mouse model is established. Histologic and functional analyses, such as salivary flow rate and lag time, are performed. The in vitro experiment revealed irradiation increased DNA damage, NF‐кB, IL‐6, and apoptosis with reduced proliferation. The treatment with metformin decreased the radiation‐induced DNA damage and inflammation, and increased proliferation. The in vivo model also shows the same results. The group taking metformin after irradiation has preserved salivary gland parenchyma compared to irradiation only group, and the functional analysis results are comparable to the normal group. Histologic and functional analysis shows that metformin reduced radiation‐induced hypofunction of salivary gland. Hence, metformin can be used to prevent radiation‐induced salivary gland dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is an irrefutable hallmark of cellular senescence and aging. The dysfunction is marked by increased mitochondrial volume and reduced function, typified by low Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) production and higher Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation. Over the years, this dysfunction has been linked to Electron Transport Chain (ETC) malfunction and low NAD levels, augmented by poor mitophagy. However, the genetic regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction is still not clear. Here, using several senescence models, the first report on the role of the downregulation of a mitochondrial protein, Translocase of Inner Mitochondrial Membrane 50 (TIMM50), in senescence is presented. The downregulation of TIMM50 is also sufficient for triggering senescence through impaired mitochondrial function, characterized using a variety of mitochondrial function assessment assays. Reduced levels of TIMM50 initiated all the hallmarks of senescence, and overexpression significantly slowed senescence onset in response to an external trigger. The pathway analysis revealed that TIMM50 loss is mediated by the sirtuin1-dependent downregulation of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPα), a transcription activator for TIMM50 expression. To establish the translational value of the observation, screening several potential anti-aging compounds revealed TIMM50 stabilizing and senescence-delaying effects only for verapamil and mitochondrial ROS quencher, Mito (2-(2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl-4-ylamino)-2-oxoethyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride (MitoTEMPO), both known anti-aging entities. Overall, TIMM50 is identified as the key mitochondrial protein whose downregulation is a critical step in initiating cellular senescence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is characterized by altered mechanics of the valve leaflets, which disrupts blood flow through the aorta and can cause left ventricle hypotrophy. These changes in the valve tissue result in the activation of resident valvular interstitial cells (VICs) into myofibroblasts, which have increased levels of αSMA in their stress fibers. The persistence of VIC myofibroblast activation is a hallmark of AVS. In recent years, the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) has emerged as an important player in the regulation of fibrosis in various tissues (e.g., lung, skin), which motivated to investigate PTEN as a potential protective factor against matrix‐induced myofibroblast activation in VICs. In aortic valve samples from humans, high levels of PTEN are found in healthy tissue and low levels of PTEN in diseased tissue. Then, using pharmacological inducers to treat VIC cultures, it is observed that PTEN overexpression prevented stiffness‐induced myofibroblast activation, whereas genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PTEN further activated myofibroblasts. The increased nuclear PTEN localization is also observed in VICs cultured on stiff matrices, and nuclear PTEN also correlated with smaller nuclei, altered expression of histones, and a quiescent fibroblast phenotype. Together, these results suggest that PTEN not only suppresses VIC activation, but functions to promote quiescence, and can serve as a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of AVS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Renal tubular epithelial cell injury is a significant factor in the formation of kidney stones. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this injury, especially the association with autophagy‐mediated ferroptosis, remain unclear. This study first identified the upregulated ferroptosis related gene ChaC Glutathione Specific Gamma‐Glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (CHAC1) in kidney stone samples through bioinformatics analysis. Subsequently, a damage model is established by treating renal tubular epithelial cells (HK‐2) cells with calcium oxalate (CaOx) and investigated its function by downregulating CHAC1 expression through shRNA transfection. Autophagy status and oxidative stress are evaluated by detecting autophagy (LC3I, LC3II, Beclin 1) and ferroptosis (GPX4) related protein expression using GFP‐LC3 adenovirus and Western Blot. In addition, the interaction between small molecule drug Paliperidone (Pali) and CHAC1 is also investigated through molecular docking and cell thermal migration assays to explore therapeutic potential. CHAC1 is upregulated in kidney stones and associated with ferroptosis. Knockdown of CHAC1 weakened CaOx‐induced autophagy and ferroptosis. Moreover, Pali can target CHAC1 protein, reduce CHAC1 activity, and inhibit autophagy‐mediated ferroptosis during cellular injury. Pali can inhibit autophagy‐mediated ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells by targeting CHAC1, offering a new direction for the treatment of kidney stones.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterized by a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Ferroptosis, a regulated cell death, plays a significant role in inhibiting tumor progression. However, its role and regulatory mechanisms in HNSCC remain unclear. In this study, the expression of ferroptosis‐related molecules in HNSCC is analysed and NCOA4 and FTH1 are identified as prognostic markers. TU177 and TU686 cells are transfected with plasmids for the overexpression or knockdown of NCOA4 and FTH1. MTT assays demonstrated reduced cell viability following either NCOA4 overexpression or FTH1 knockdown alone. Concurrently, ferroptosis hallmarks such as iron overload and ROS overproduction are upregulated in these conditions. Conversely, NCOA4 knockdown or FTH1 overexpression has the opposite effects. Furthermore, miR‐182‐5p is found to be significantly upregulated in HNSCC tissues. Mechanistic studies revealed that miR‐182‐5p directly binding to the NCOA4 3′ UTR, leading to the downregulation of NCOA4 expression and suppression of NCOA4/FTH1‐mediated ferroptosis. In conclusion, the finding elucidate the role of miR‐182‐5p/NCOA4/FTH1 signaling axis in regulating ferroptosis in HNSCC and provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying ferroptosis in HNSCC cells.",

It modulates lipid raft-related signaling pathways and affects mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses, thereby playing an important role in atherosclerosis, neuroinflammation, and neurological disorders. The role of AIBP in cardiovascular diseases has been intensively studied. Nevertheless, recent studies have uncovered correlations between NAD(P)HX differential isomerase variants and various neurological disorders, further highlighting their substantial role in neurological diseases. This review outlines the current investigations on AIBP in neurometabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and neuropathic pain.

    "abstract": "Protoplast regeneration into plant cells and further into plants is an ongoing challenge in agricultural biotechnology. Inspired by mammalian tissue engineering, a strategic shift is proposed in plant tissue engineering to steer protoplast culture using fully synthetic materials-based culture platforms. Here a supramolecular materials method to engineer modular culture methods for protoplasts is chosen to use. Supramolecular monomers as modular building blocks allow to make various hydrogel formulations and to study different protoplast cultures; including 2D cultures on top of supramolecular hydrogels, 2.5D cultures using supramolecular fibers in solution, and 3D cultures when encapsulated in bulk hydrogels or microgels. Importantly, the need is shown for bioactive functionalization of the supramolecular hydrogels with a peptide additive in 2D protoplast cultures. After 11 days, the bioactive hydrogel induced protoplast enlargement, which is absent on pristine hydrogels. The opposite effect is present for protoplasts cultured in 3D, showing plasmolysis as a result of the bioactive additive. Interestingly, in 2.5D lower bioactive additive concentrations in supramolecular fibers stimulated protoplast enlargement, demonstrated by similar morphological changes as in 2D. Finally, protoplast encapsulation in supramolecular microgels is showcased. This work demonstrates the potential to modularly engineer various synthetic platforms to facilitate cellular agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In eukaryotic cell nuclei, chromatin exhibits a high degree of structural and functional dynamics. Recent findings suggest that chromatin has the ability to reorganize in response to changes within the cellular microenvironment. Such changes include oxidative stress found in hyperoxia. While hyperoxia is recognized for causing DNA damage and disrupting cellular functions, the effects it has on chromatin structure and the implications thereof remain poorly understood. In this work, an imaging‐based technique is developed to visualize and characterize nanoscale chromatin remodeling under hyperoxia in mesenchymal stromal cells, created via hydrogen peroxide treatment. High spatiotemporal variability of remodeling in different chromatin domains is found. Chromatin remodeling is hindered by the GSK126‐mediated inhibition of methyltransferase EZH2, which regulates the chromatin compaction. Independent assays such as ATAC seq further revealed that chromatin is compacted by hyperoxia, which is mitigated by GSK126 pretreatment. Epigenetic modifications and DNA damage under hyperoxia is investigated, which is also found to be affected by the pretreatment of GSK126. The techniques and discoveries provide mechanistic insights into chromatin remodeling, potentially paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies to combat genotoxic oxidative stress—commonly associated with degenerative diseases and aging—and to enhance cell‐based therapies in regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While aging is a natural biological process, it is associated with a greater risk for multiple diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease. Thus, it is important to study the biochemical mechanisms involved in aging to understand how to treat and prevent these health conditions. The discovery that calorie restriction (CR) promoted longevity in various organisms is a major breakthrough for aging research. Molecular studies of CR have revealed that it mediates its anti‐aging effects by activating key signaling pathways, including the AMPK pathway. This pathway is important for regulating various processes, including energy homeostasis, metabolism, and proteostasis. Despite the advantages associated with CR, this practice can have detrimental effects, including decreased liver, body, and muscle mass. Additionally, CR is difficult to track and maintain, limiting its long‐term potential. Interestingly, direct activation of the AMPK pathway offers a potential approach to increase longevity and quality of life without dietary restrictions. Remarkably, a recent discovery revealed that lithocholic acid (LCA), a metabolite from bile acid, could directly activate the AMPK pathway. Activation of the AMPK pathway by LCA leads to the beneficial effects of CR without the negative effects. These recent findings point to the possibility that supplementation of specific doses of LCA could offer a novel approach to induce anti‐aging pathways that lead to increased longevity and improved quality of life.",

Chaperone‐mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective lysosomal pathway, facilitates the degradation of proteins containing KFERQ‐like motifs via the receptor lysosome‐associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP2A). In the recent review, the pivotal role of CMA in regulating proteostasis and modulating inflammatory responses is highlighted. This commentary explores the multifaceted roles of CMA in neurodegenerative disease progression, emphasizing its involvement in age‐related decline, feedback loops between CMA dysregulation and neurodegeneration, and potential as a therapeutic target. Emerging CMA activators and the challenges of modulating CMA for clinical use are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Infections caused by Enterovirus like rhinoviruses, coxsackieviruses, and polioviruses represent a significant public health concern, for which there are no antivirals available yet. The highly conserved viral 3C protease has been the primary target for antiviral development, but competitive inhibitors targeting its active site does not meet expectations in clinical studies. Previously, an unconventional allosteric site is identified on human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14) 3C, representing novel opportunities for pan-enterovirus antivirals development. Here, in silico screening of 143,621 natural products against this allosteric site is performed and 28 candidate molecules are identified, among which dihydromyricetin (DHM) and oridonin-A1 bind to HRV14 3C and allosterically inhibit its protease activity. Moreover, DHM shows minimal cytotoxicity and potent antiviral efficacy against HRV14 infections across different cell models, with selective indexes exceeding 700. Structural analysis and mutagenesis assays further pinpoint key 3C residues essential for DHM binding. Consistent with the high conservation of these residues across Enterovirus genus, DHM broadly binds and efficiently inhibits 3C proteases from not only rhinoviruses, but also coxsackieviruses, enteroviruses and polioviruses. These findings establish DHM as a unique, broad-spectrum allosteric inhibitor of Enterovirus 3C proteases and underscore its potential as a promising candidate for the development of pan-enterovirus antivirals.",

This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic effects of solasonine in suppressing gastric cancer progression. This study explores the regulatory mechanism of solasonine in vitro cells and xenograft tumor mouse models. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) is used for DNA methylation analysis; immunohistochemical and flow cytometry are performed for MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) expression profiling. Solasonine inhibits the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells. MICA is identified as a regulatory target for solasonine in gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, DNA methylation of MICA is suppressed by solasonine. DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) family members, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, are downregulated in solasonine-treated tumor tissues. Importantly, solasonine restores the sensitivity of HGC-27 cells to natural killer (NK) cells through upregulating MICA, suggesting the potential value of solasonine as an immunotherapy drug in gastric cancer. Solasonine inhibits gastric cancer progression and restores sensitivity of gastric cancer to NK cells through inducing DNA demethylation of the MICA promoter in vitro and in vivo.

The isolated exosomes showed cup-shaped morphologyand expressed CD81, CD9, and CD63. Exosomes and ROF increased glutathione (GSH) levels while decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Further, ROF and exosomes treatment lowered the expression of the apoptotic indicators BAX, the fibrotic markers TGFβ1, Smad3, Wnt7a, and FN1, and the inflammatory marker IL6, and increased the expression of miRNA-145. Moreover, ROF and exosomes improved histological and ultrastructural examination. In conclusion, exosomes and ROF can protect against CKD by reducing apoptosis and fibrosis.",

This review focuses on models of the primary tumor environment for studying cell invasion and spread within the mammary tissue, prior to metastatic outgrowth. Using a combination of methods such as tumor spheroids, 3D printed biomaterials, and microfluidic designs, a variety of 3D in vitro modeling methods exist to recapitulate specific aspects of the tumor microenvironment and understand sources of tumor heterogeneity. An effective model can be specified for each patient, eliminating the need for human trials. Subsequently, as the mechanisms involved in breast cancer metastasis are studied utilizing more effective in vitro models, targeted therapeutics can be discovered, thus advancing clinical treatment strategies.",

It is of great significance in theory and clinic to discover new negative regulators and study their functions, but there is no effective screening system at present. Here, a screening system is established through a resistance reporter, which is designed to be expressed only in cells with interferon pathway activation. In conjunction with CRISPR knockout library, cells are screened for interferon pathway activation due to knockout of negatively regulators, which led to the identification of negatively regulator candidate genes such as PCGF3/5, UCK2, and ITPKA.

    "abstract": "Label-free optical stimulation of brain cells with infrared (IR) light provides a powerful tool for spatially targeted neuromodulation. However, lingering questions about the off-target effects of IR stimulation on non-neuronal cells remain sparsely explored. It is shown that rat astroglial cultures are independently sensitive to single pulses of infrared light, evoking calcium signaling and osmoregulatory phenomena in vitro. Recent studies highlight that astrocytes respond differently to electromagnetic and laser stimulation, recruiting different pathways. The impact of three different IR stimulation time courses on astrocyte calcium and water transport dynamics is explored with widefield fluorescence microscopy and pharmacology to fill this gap. Results show that different stimulation methods can evoke astrocyte calcium responses, resulting from distinct biomolecular signaling processes. Notably, swelling and shrinkage are also differently evoked by short-term and long-term stimulation pulses. It is shown that specific IR stimulation can drive selective water and calcium dynamics in astrocytes. The work uniquely reports label-free optical modulation techniques to drive astroglial homeostatic machinery, a crucial process in healthy brain function that lacks tools for spatially precise modulation. More broadly, the results demonstrate the need to consider off-target effects with neuromodulation strategies and how to use such effects to study brain physiology.",

As tumors are often considered to have traits of \"injured tissues,\" MSCs are recruited to tumor microenvironments where they can have pro- and antitumorigenic influences. This study assesses whether human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) of shared ancestry exhibit similar tumorigenic properties. Bone marrow-derived (hBM-MSCs) and umbilical cord-derived (hUC-MSCs) MSCs embedded in collagen are cultured in conditioned media from lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells to mimic the extracellular matrix and soluble cues of the cancer microenvironment. Cell viability, proliferation, and immunofluorescence analyses evaluate MSC behavior under these conditions. Further, A549 cells are exposed to conditioned media from cancer-stimulated MSCs to simulate indirect co-culture, and their response is assessed through viability, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analysis. Results show increased viability and proliferation of hBM-MSCs, morphological changes, and elevated alpha-smooth muscle actin expression, suggesting a transition toward cancer-associated fibroblasts. In contrast, hUC-MSCs display reduced viability and no morphological alterations. Conditioned media from cancer-exposed hUC-MSCs induce apoptosis in A549 cells, whereas hBM-MSCs support A549 growth. These findings demonstrate that, despite their common origin, hUC-MSCs and hBM-MSCs exhibit opposing responses to tumor cues and influence lung cancer cell behavior differently.",

    "abstract": "The S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1)-Cullin-F-box protein E3 ligase adaptor F-box-only protein 31 (FBXO31) regulates genomic stability and cell signaling in normal, genotoxic, and tumor cells by recognizing and ubiquitinating multiple downstream substrates. The stability and role of FBXO31 may be regulated by specific residual modification. In this study, five FBXO31 phosphorylation sites are identified in HEK293T cells using biochemical and biological techniques. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identifies phosphorylated residues, including threonine-28 and -37 and serine-33, -400, and -523. The PyMOL crystal structure reveals the location of these residues on FBXO31 and assesses whether they interact with the reported kinases. Western blotting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Thr-37 and Ser-523 contributes to FBXO31 protein stabilization, which is further confirmed by cycloheximide experiments. The regulatory roles of Thr-37 and Ser-523 in FBXO31 stability are associated with variations in phosphorylation levels and degradation pathways. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation regulates FBXO31 turnover, and phosphorylation at Thr-37 or Ser-523 may help identify upstream kinases and enhance the understanding of the physiological role of FBXO31.",

Conventional immunoassays, however, often lack specificity and require confirmatory testing with fresh human platelets. To address this limitation, we optimized our previously developed cell‐based enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for improved HIT detection under various experimental conditions. Platelet factor 4 was immobilized on breast cancer cells (MDA‐MB‐231) to capture monoclonal HIT‐like (KKO) and non‐HIT (RTO) antibodies, which served as models to evaluate assay performance under different pH levels, ionic strengths (NaCl), and fixation methods (ethanol, paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde). To identify the most suitable substrate, additional cancer cell lines (HCT‐116, MCF‐7, HepG2) were tested under live and fixed conditions, with selected conditions validated using human HIT sera. Optimal detection tested with monoclonal antibodies was achieved using 50 mM NaCl and 4% paraformaldehyde fixation. Notably, live MDA‐MB‐231 and HCT‐116 cells demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity compared to fixed cells. Furthermore, these cell lines enable the efficient detection of HIT antibodies using flow cytometry, a robust and platelet‐free diagnostic method. Our findings establish live MDA‐MB‐231 and HCT‐116 cells as highly promising platforms for clinical applications in HIT antibody detection.",

Current surveillance relies on manual mosquito traps and labor‐intensive lab tests like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which are time‐consuming and resource‐intensive. In this study, machine learning algorithms are applied to detect dengue‐infected mosquitoes based on their 3D flight patterns. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and cubic spline interpolation, mosquito flight trajectories are tracked, followed by classification with models including CNN, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multi‐Layer Perceptron (MLP), and a hybrid CNN + XGBoost model. The 5‐fold cross‐validation results showed that XGBoost achieved the highest mean accuracy (81.43%), while Random Forest has shown the best mean F1 Score (82.80%). Some validation folds demonstrated outstanding performance, with AdaBoost reaching 95.85% accuracy and Random Forest achieving 97.77% recall in Fold 1. The study also analyzed the impact of flight sequence size on models' performance, observing that longer sequences provided more accurate predictions. This approach offers a faster and more efficient method for assessing infection status, supporting real‐time vector monitoring, and improving early disease outbreak detection.",

One of the main components of aPDT is an agent known as a photosensitizer (PS). Some plants with high flavonoid content are reported as PS. In the genus Passiflora, flavonoids are predominant, but their photosensitizing activity has yet to be described. This study investigates the photosensitizing potential of extracts from Passiflora edulis, Passiflora alata, and Passiflora cincinnata. The butanolic fraction of P. cincinnata undergoes in vivo evaluation against intradermal MRSA infection in a senescent murine model (C57BL/6). In vitro assays determine the photoactivatable concentrations and their cytotoxicity. In vivo, MRSA-infected mice are divided into control, P. cincinnata-treated, and aPDT-treated groups. Subsequent assessments include cytokine levels, bacterial load, and cellular infiltrate in the ear. The P. cincinnata-treated group exhibits improved bacterial control, reduced leukocyte infiltration, and less weight loss. The aPDT group demonstrates a unique cytokine correlation profile, featuring more negative correlations among pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukin-10. P. cincinnata emerges as an effective photosensitizer for aPDT in a senescent model and highlights the potential of underexplored plant-derived photosensitizers.",

Peltate leaves, unlike typical foliage leaves, frequently emerge in a “rolled‐up” state. This study investigates mechanisms related to the unrolling process in the peltate species Syngonium podophyllum by analyzing anatomical and morphological changes and quantifying forces that arise during unrolling. Leaf unrolling in S. podophyllum appears to be primarily driven by cell expansion, particularly in the upper epidermis, with cell turgor playing an important role in leaf development and unrolling. Considering leaf properties such as cell dimensions and leaf radius of curvature, this work proposes a mathematical model to further characterize the unrolling process. The model provides satisfactory predictions of curvature variations, highlighting its potential for other plant movements involving dynamic curvature changes.",

Their activities are tightly modulated to ensure proper physiological functioning, with dysregulation often contributing to disease pathogenesis. Among these, the insulin‐like growth factor (IGF) system that encompasses IGF‐1 and IGF‐receptor binding proteins is pivotal in maintaining overall cellular health by regulating growth, repair, and metabolic regulation. Capitalizing on its pro‐mitogenic effects, translational studies have focused efforts on developing therapeutics based on IGF‐1 for age‐related muscle loss, metabolic disorders, or cardiovascular diseases. Mimetic peptide design has emerged as an innovative approach to overcoming limitations of direct IGF‐1 therapy, focusing on structural optimization to enhance bioavailability, stability, and receptor specificity. Herein, the development of IGF‐1 mimics and their potential clinical applications are reviewed. Their design and molecular properties, including structural considerations and mechanisms of action, are described. In vitro and in vivo approaches analyzed to provide insights into their pharmacokinetics, therapeutic efficacy, and safety profiles in animal models will be delved into. These preclinical studies shed light on the advantages of IGF‐1 mimics, such as bioavailability, stability, and delivery, as well as the limitations, including potential immunogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Esophageal cancer is a major disease that seriously threatens human health. Ribosomal RNA biogenesis is implicated in tumorigenesis, while the small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are responsible for post‐transcriptional modifications of ribosomal RNAs during biogenesis, which are identified as potential markers of various cancers. The clinical significance, biological behavior, and potential molecular mechanism of the nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein RRP9 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which is a major pathological type of esophageal cancer, are investigated in this study. It is found that RRP9 is abnormally highly expressed in ESCC tissues and is closely associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, it is found that RRP9 could regulate the cell cycle protein‐dependent kinase CDK1 to promote ESCC progression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, RRP9 promotes ESCC progression through enhancing the E2F1‐mediated transcriptional regulation of CDK1. Collectively, the results defined RRP9 as an important tumor driver in ESCC that acted by activating oncogenic signaling by the E2F1‐CDK1 pathway, and suggested RRP9 as a candidate therapeutic target for ESCC.",

This editorial examines the scientific value of integrating life course frameworks, minority stress models, and exposome research to understand the biological and psychosocial mechanisms underlying these disparities. The importance of investigating resilience is highlighted —both physiological and psychosocial—as a key factor in promoting healthy aging, alongside the need to study intersectionality, particularly how race, ethnicity, immigration status, and socioeconomic context interact to influence health outcomes. Additionally, research opportunities are outlined to evaluate the long‐term impact of gender‐affirming care, advocacy efforts, and macro‐level social stressors on health trajectories. It is emphasized how insights gained from transgender‐focused research can inform broader health science, including comparative investigations in other high‐stress populations, such as military veterans. Together, these lines of inquiry can advance precision health strategies, foster inclusive and person‐centered healthcare models, and ultimately improve health equity across diverse aging populations.",

This study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms of QLXZF's inhibitory effects on PCa. Tumor‐bearing mouse model and an RM‐1 tumor cell model co‐cultured with CD8T cells are treated with QLXZF. Mechanistic studies integrated in vivo imaging, IHC, WB, and genetic interventions (CHK1 overexpression). In the mouse model, QLXZF dose‐dependently suppressed tumor growth (p&lt;.01) without visceral toxicity. Immunofluorescence experiments showed QLXZF treatment has decreased the expression of CHK1, increased γH2AX foci formation. Western blot experiments confirmed an increase in pSTING/STING, pTBK1/TBK1, and pIRF3/IRF3 ratio. Additionally, the use of QLXZF increased the levels of CCL5 and CXCL10. In vitro cell experiments showed results consistent with those in the in vivo model. Further studies indicated that overexpression of CHK1 abolished the suppressive effects of QLXZF on prostate cancer cells. The study suggests that QLXZF may inhibit CHK1 expression, induce DNA image accumulation, and activate the STING/TBK1/IRF3 pathway to promote CD8 + T cell recruitment. These findings provide a new mechanistic basis for the application of QLXZF in the treatment of PCa.",

Tumors are cultivated for four days and treated with LA in absence/presence of cisplatin. Tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as expression of intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 and macrophage polarization are assessed using immunofluorescent imaging. Tumor specimens are considered to be “Responders”, when a change in proliferation and/or apoptosis by &gt;50% compared to untreated slices occurred. Five of nine samples are “Responders”, in which the LA exerted effects comparable to cisplatin. Even at clinically relevant concentrations of LA, a strong anti‐tumoral effect is observable in patient‐derived tumor slice cultures with complex structures of the tumor microenvironment highlighting the LA effect on the tumor itself and its surroundings, without any interference by other leukocytes or neuronal stimulation. The diverse reaction to LA treatment also emphasizes the importance of biomarkers to determine the tumor phenotypes, which may benefit from LA treatment.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that biodegradable polyurethane (PU) NPs exhibit immunosuppressive activity. Yet, the intracellular mechanism is not clearly understood. In this study, a uniquely designed pH nanosensor is employed for tracking the intracellular pH value of macrophages to reveal the intracellular journey of PU NPs and to clarify the intracellular pH effect on the corresponding inflammatory response. First, fluorescent mesoporous silica nanoparticles (FRMSNs) is used to detect the pH change in macrophages after endo/phagocytosis of PU NPs. Second, PU is coated on the external surface of FRMSNs to examine the intracellular trafficking process of PU in the macrophages. The results show that the majority of PU‐coated FRMSNs remain to stay at the cytosol‐early endosome/phagosome regions. The intracellular pH value and other supporting results show that the immune response of PU NPs may be correlated to their internalization journey. The retardation in the degradation process of the PU NPs may intervene with the lysosome activity and repress the immunostimulatory effect, which contributes to the low immune response of PU NPs.",

Coccoliths, the calcium carbonate scales of coccolithophores, are examples of the precise bioproduction of such complex 3D structures. However, the understanding of the cellular mechanisms that control mineral formation inside the cell, specifically the ability of these microalgae to transport high fluxes of inorganic building blocks, is still limited. Recently, using cryo‐electron and X‐ray microscopy, several intracellular compartments are shown to store high concentrations of calcium and phosphorous and are suggested to have a dominant role in the intracellular mineralization pathway. Here, live‐cell confocal microscopy and fluorescent markers are used to examine the dynamics of ion stores in coccolithophores. Using calcein and 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI) as fluorescent proxies for calcium and polyphosphates, the experiments reveal an unexpected plethora of organelles with distinct fluorescent signatures over a wide range of strains and conditions. Surprisingly, the fluorescent labeling does not show changes along the calcification process and is similar between calcifying and noncalcifying cells, suggesting that these ion pools may not be a dynamic avenue for calcium transport. In such a case, the enigma behind the ability of coccolithophores to sustain intracellular calcification still awaits comprehensive elucidation.",

Here, it is shown that AWC ON responds not only to chemicals but also to mechanical stimuli caused by fluid flow changes in a microfluidic device. The dynamics of calcium events are correlated with the stimulus amplitude. It is further shown that the mechanosensitivity of AWC ON neurons has an intrinsic nature rather than a synaptic origin, and the calcium transient response is mediated by TAX‐4 cGMP‐gated cation channel, suggesting the involvement of one or more “odorant” receptors in AWC ON mechano‐transduction. In many cases, the responses show plateau properties resembling bistable calcium dynamics where neurons can switch from one stable state to the other. To investigate the unprecedentedly observed mechanosensitivity of AWC ON neurons, a novel microfluidic device is designed to minimize the fluid shear flow in the arena hosting the nematodes. Animals in this device show reduced neuronal activation of AWC ON neurons. The results observed indicate that the tangential component of the mechanical stress is the main contributor to the mechanosensitivity of AWC ON . Furthermore, the microfluidic platform, integrating shearless perfusion and calcium imaging, provides a novel and more controlled solution for in vivo analysis both in micro‐organisms and cultured cells.",

Despite emerging evidence indicating that circRNAs are abundantly expressed in various tissues, especially in the brain and retina, the role of circRNAs in retinal function and diseases is still largely unknown. Circular Rims2 (circRims2) is highly expressed and conserved in both the human and mouse brains. However, little is known about the expression and function of circRims2 in the retina. In the current study, the high‐throughput RNA‐seq analysis reveals a high expression of circRims2 in the retina. In addition, it is found that circRims2 is mainly located in plexiform layers that contain synapses between retinal neurons. Knocking down circRims2 with short hairpin RNA through subretinal adeno‐associated viral (AAV) delivery in the mice leads to the decrease of the thickness of the outer and inner segment (OS/IS) layers and outer nuclear layer (ONL), and cessation of scotopic and photopic electroretinogram responses. Furthermore, the current study finds that circRims2 deficiency evokes retinal inflammation and activates the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway. Therefore, circRims2 may play an important role in the maintenance of retinal structure and function, and circRims2 deficiency may lead to pathogenic changes in the retina.",

These dipeptides are often considered as the genetic cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In the study, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled PR20 is used to investigate PR20‐induced cell death. The findings reveal that the cell death induced by PR20 is dependent on its nuclear distribution and can be blocked by a nuclear import inhibitor called importazole. Further investigation reveals that BRD4 inhibitors, such as JQ‐1 and I‐BET762, restrict cytoplasmic localization of PR20, thereby reducing its cytotoxic effect. Mechanistically, the inhibition of BRD4 leads to an increase in the expression of numerous histones, resulting in the accumulation of histones in the cytoplasm. These cytoplasmic histones associate with PR20 and limit its distribution within the nucleus. Notably, the ectopic expression of histones alone is enough to confer protection to cells treated with PR20. In addition, phenylephrine (PE) induces cellular hypertrophy and cytoplasmic distribution of histone, which also helps protect cells from PR20‐induced cell death. The research suggests that temporarily inducing the presence of cytoplasmic histones may alleviate the neurotoxic effects of dipeptide repeat proteins.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although cancer remains a challenging disease to treat, early detection and removal of primary tumors through surgery or chemotherapy/radiotherapy can offer hope for patients. The privilege paradigm in cancer biology suggests that cell‐autonomous mechanisms play a central role in tumorigenesis. According to this paradigm, these cellular mechanisms are the primary focus for the prevention and treatment of cancers. However, this point of view does not present a comprehensive theory for the initiation of cancer and an effective therapeutic strategy. Having an incomplete understanding of the etiology of cancer, it is essential to re‐examine previous assumptions about carcinogenesis and develop new, practical theories that can account for all available clinical and experimental evidence. This will not only help to gain a better understanding of the disease, but also offer new avenues for treatment. This review provides evidence suggesting a shift in focus from a cell‐autonomous mechanism to systemic mechanisms, particularly the immune system, that are involved in cancer formation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract N6‐methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification is involved in many aspects of gastric cancer (GC). Moreover, m6A and glycolysis‐related genes (GRGs) play important roles in immunotherapeutic and prognostic implication of GC. However, GRGs involved in m6A regulation have never been analyzed comprehensively in GC. Herein, the study aims to identify and validate a novel signature based on m6A‐related GRGs in GC patients. Therefore, a m 6 A‐related GRGs signature is established, which can predict the survival of patients with GC and remain an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analyses. Clinical significance of the model is well validated in internal cohort and independent validation cohort. In addition, the expression levels of risk model‐related GRGs in clinical samples are validated. Consistent with the database results, all model genes are up‐regulated in expression except DCN. After regrouping the patients based on this risk model, the study can effectively distinguish between them in respect to immune‐cell infiltration microenvironment and immunotherapeutic response. Additionally, candidate drugs targeting risk model‐related GRGs are confirmed. Finally, a nomogram combining risk scores and clinical parameters is created, and calibration plots show that the nomogram can accurately predict survival. This risk model can serve as a reliable assessment tool for predicting prognosis and immunotherapeutic responses in GC patients.",

However, effective drugs to manage skeletal muscle atrophy and fibrosis remain elusive. This study isolated and characterized exosomes derived from skeletal muscle satellite cells (MuSC‐Exo). The study investigated their effects on denervated skeletal muscle atrophy and fibrosis in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats via intramuscular injection. MuSC‐Exo demonstrated the potential to alleviate skeletal muscle atrophy and fibrosis. The underlying mechanism using single‐cell RNA sequencing data and functional analysis are analyzed. Mechanistic studies reveal close associations between fibroblasts and myoblasts, with the transforming growth factor β1 (TGF‐β1)‐Smad3‐Pax7 axis governing fibroblast activation in atrophic skeletal muscle. MuSC‐Exo intervention inhibited the TGF‐β1/Smad3 pathway and improved muscle atrophy and fibrosis. In conclusion, MuSC‐Exo‐based therapy may represent a novel strategy to alleviate skeletal muscle atrophy and reduce excessive fibrotic tissue by targeting Pax7 through the TGF‐β1/Smad3 pathway.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) are key mediators of inflammation in intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. TLR‐2 activation contributes to the degenerative process by increasing the expression of extracellular matrix‐degrading enzymes, pro‐inflammatory cytokines, and neurotrophins. As potent post‐transcriptional regulators, microRNAs can modulate intracellular mechanisms, and their dysregulation is known to contribute to numerous pathologies. This study aims to investigate the impact of TLR‐2 signaling on miRNA dysregulation in the context of IVD degeneration. Small‐RNA sequencing of degenerated IVD cells shows the dysregulation of ten miRNAs following TLR‐2 activation by PAM2CSK4. The miR‐155‐5p is most significantly upregulated in degenerated and non‐degenerated annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus cells. Sequence‐based target and pathway prediction shows the involvement of miR‐155‐5p in inflammation‐ and cell fate‐related pathways and TLR‐2‐induced miR‐155‐5p expression leads to the downregulation of its target c‐FOS. Furthermore, changes specific to the activation of TLR‐2 through fragmented fibronectin are seen in miR‐484 and miR‐487. Lastly, miR‐100‐3p, miR‐320b, and miR‐181a‐3p expression exhibit degeneration‐dependent changes. These results show that TLR‐2 signaling leads to the dysregulation of miRNAs in IVD cells as well as their possible downstream effects on inflammation and degeneration. The identified miRNAs provide important opportunities as potential therapeutic targets for IVD degeneration and low back pain.",

The associations of three blood plasma ceramides (C16:0, C22:0, and C24:0) with CR fitness in the population‐based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP‐START‐1; n = 1,102; mean age 50.3 years, 51.5% women) are investigated. In addition, subgroup analysis according to age (&lt;/≥54 years) and sex (female/male) is performed. Ceramides are quantified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). CR fitness is assessed by a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Sex and age independent associations are found for higher levels of C24:0 and C24:0/C16:0 ratio with higher maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 peak) kg −1 and oxygen consumption at the anaerobic threshold (VO 2 @AT 1 ) as well as for the relation of C24:0/C16:0 with maximum workload (Wattmax kg −1 ). In contrast, age/sex subgroup specific inverse associations with Wattmax kg −1 are found in women &lt;54 years for C22:0, while a positive association in men ≥54 years. Higher levels of C24:0 are associated with higher Wattmax kg −1 , except for women &lt;54 years, where no significant association can be found. The findings suggest that the use of single ceramides as cardiovascular biomarkers may be inferior, compared to ceramide ratio C24:0/C16:0. Therefore C24:0/C16:0 ratio may be a more suitable and robust cardiovascular biomarker and should be preferred over single ceramides.",

The growing interest in the prevention of skin aging and rejuvenation has sparked a surge of industrial and research studies focusing on the biological and transcriptional changes that occur during skin development and aging. In this study, the aim is to identify transcriptional differences between two main types of human skin cells: the human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and the human epidermis keratinocytes (HEKs) isolated from 30 neonatal and 30 adults (old) skin. Through differentially expressed gene (DEG) profiling using DEseq2, 604 up‐, and 769 down‐regulated genes are identified in the old group. A functional analysis using Metascape Gene Ontology and Reactome pathways revealed systematic transcriptomic shifts in key skin formation and maintenance markers, alongside a distinct difference in HOX gene families crucial for embryonic development and diverse biological processes. Among the 39 human HOX gene family, ten posterior HOX genes ( HOXA10 , 11 , 13 , HOXB13 , HOXC11 , and HOXD9 ‐ 13 ) are significantly downregulated, and anterior 25 genes ( HOXA2 ‐ 7 , HOXB1 ‐ 9 , HOXC4 ‐ 6 and 8 – 9 , and HOXD1 , 3 , 4 and 8 ) are upregulated, especially in the old HDFs. The study successfully demonstrates the correlation between HOX genes and the skin aging process, providing strong evidence that HOX genes are proposed as a new marker for skin aging assessment.",

More than 20 years have passed since molecular biological perspectives are adopted in this research field, and intracellular factors and signal pathways that control aging and lifespan have evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Furthermore, these findings have been applied to control the aging and lifespan of various model organisms by adjustment of the nutritional environment, genetic manipulation, and drug treatment using low‐molecular weight compounds. Among these, drug treatment is easier than the other methods, and research into drugs that regulate aging and lifespan is consequently expected to become more active. Chronological lifespan, a definition of yeast lifespan, refers to the survival period of a cell population under nondividing conditions. Herein, low‐molecular weight compounds are summarized that extend the chronological lifespan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe , along with their intracellular functions. The low‐molecular weight compounds are also discussed that extend the lifespan of other model organisms. Compounds that have so far only been studied in yeast may soon extend lifespan in other organisms.",

    "abstract": "In vitro studies have demonstrated that the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into cardiomyocytes requires activation of caspases through the mitochondrial pathway. These studies have relied on synthetic substrates for activity measurements, which can be misleading due to potential none-specific hydrolysis of these substrates by proteases other than caspases. Hence, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation are investigated during the differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) by directly assessing caspase-9 and -3 cleavage. Western blot reveals the presence of the cleaved caspase-9 prior to and during the differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) into cardiomyocytes at early stages, which diminishes as the differentiation progresses, without cleavage and activation of endogenous procaspase-3. Activation of exogenous procaspase-3 by endogenous caspase-9 and subsequent cleavage of chromogenic caspase-3 substrate i.e. DEVD-pNA during the course of differentiation confirmes that endogenous caspase-9 has the potency to recognize and activate procaspase-3, but for reasons that are unknown to us fails to do so. These observations suggest the existence of distinct mechanisms of caspase regulation in differentiation as compared to apoptosis. Bioinformatics analysis suggests the presence of caspase-9 regulators, which may influence proteolytic function under specific conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aging‐related bone loss is driven by various biological factors, such as imbalanced bone metabolism from decreased osteoblast and increased osteoclast activities. Various transcriptional and post‐transcriptional factors increase osteoclast activity with aging; however, studies regarding the post‐translational regulators of osteoclast activity are still limited. The ubiquitin E3 ligase Pellino‐1 is a well‐known post‐translational regulator of inflammation. However, how Pellino‐1 expression regulation affects osteoclast differentiation remains unclear. This study determined that Pellino‐1 levels are reduced in bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) from 40‐week‐old mice compared to 4‐week‐old mice. Interestingly, conditional Knockout (cKO) of Pellino‐1 in 6‐week‐old mice resulted in decreased bone mass, reduced body size, and lower weight than in Pellino‐1 floxed mice; however, these differences are not observed in 20‐week‐old mice. The increased number of tartrate‐resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)‐positive cells and serum levels of C‐terminal telopeptides of type I collagen, a marker of bone resorption, in 6‐week‐old Pellino‐1 cKO mice implied a connection between Pellino‐1 and the osteoclast population. Enhanced TRAP activity and upregulation of osteoclast genes in BMMs from the cKO mice indicate that Pellino‐1 deletion affects osteoclast differentiation, leading to decreased bone mass and heightened osteoclast activity. Thus, targeting Pellino‐1 could be a potential gene therapy for managing and preventing osteoporosis.",

Cells within a population are known to exhibit heterogeneous responses to environmental cues. These differences can lead to varied cellular states, behavior, and responses to therapeutics. Techniques are needed that are not only capable of processing and analyzing cellular populations at the single cell level, but also have the ability to isolate specific cell populations from a complex sample at high throughputs. The new CellMag‐Coalesce‐Attract‐Resegment Wash (CellMag‐CARWash) system combines positive magnetic selection with droplet microfluidic devices to isolate cells of interest from a mixture with &gt;93% purity and incorporate treatments within individual droplets to observe single cell biological responses.

    "abstract": "Abstract The design of artificial, synthetic cells is a fundamentally important and fast‐developing field of science. Of the diverse attributes of cellular life, artificial transmembrane signaling across the biomolecular barriers remains a high challenge with only a few documented successes. Herein, the study achieves signaling across lipid bilayers and connects an exofacial enzymatic receptor activation to an intracellular biochemical catalytic response using an artificial receptor. The mechanism of signal transduction for the artificial receptor relies on the triggered decomposition of a self‐immolative linker. Receptor activation ensues its head‐to‐tail decomposition and the release of a secondary messenger molecule into the internal volume of the synthetic cell. Transmembrane signaling is demonstrated in synthetic cells based on liposomes and mammalian cell‐sized giant unilamellar vesicles and illustrates receptor performance in cell mimics with a diverse size and composition of the lipid bilayer. In giant unilamellar vesicles, transmembrane signaling connects exofacial receptor activation with intracellular activation of proteolysis. Taken together, the results of this study take a step toward engineering receptor‐mediated, responsive behavior in synthetic cells.",

    "abstract": "The resolution of inflammation is not simply the end of the inflammatory response but rather a complex process that involves various cells, inflammatory factors, and specialized proresolving mediators following the occurrence of inflammation. Once inflammation cannot be cleared by the body, malignant tumors may be induced. Among them, IL-6, as an immunosuppressive factor, activates a variety of signal transduction pathways and induces tumorigenesis. Monitoring IL-6 can be used for the diagnosis, efficacy evaluation and prognosis of tumor patients. In terms of treatment, improving the efficacy of targeted and immunotherapy remains a major challenge. Blocking IL-6 and its mediated signaling pathways can regulate the tumor immune microenvironment and enhance immunotherapy responses by activating immune cells. Even transform \"cold\" tumors that are difficult to respond to immunotherapy into immunogenic \"hot\" tumors, acting as a \"heater\" for \"cold\" tumors, restarting the tumor immune cycle, and reducing immunotherapy-related toxic reactions and drug resistance. In clinical practice, the combined application of IL-6 inhibition with targeted therapy and immunotherapy may produce synergistic results. Nevertheless, additional clinical trials are imperative to further validate the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aging is associated with a decline in cardiac function. Exercise has been shown to effectively reduce the risks of cardiovascular diseases. Here whether a combination of endurance and resistance exercises can improve cardiac function in aged mice during late life is investigated. Through transcriptome analysis, several signaling pathways activated in the hearts of 22‐month‐old mice after combined exercise, including cardiac muscle contraction, mitophagy, and longevity regulation are identified. Combined exercise training mitigated age‐associated pathological cardiac hypertrophy, reduced oxidative stress, cardiac senescence, and enhanced cardiac function. Upstream stimulatory factor 2 (Usf2) is upregulated in the aged mouse hearts with combined exercise compared to sedentary mice. In the human cardiomyocytes senescent model, overexpression of Usf2 led to anti‐senescence effects, while knockdown of Usf2 exacerbated cellular senescence. The results suggest that a combination of endurance and resistance exercises, such as swimming and resistance running, can mitigate age‐related pathological cardiac remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in late life. These cardioprotective effects are likely due to the activation of Usf2 and its anti‐senescence effect. Therefore, Usf2 can potentially be a novel therapeutic target for mitigating age‐related cardiac dysfunction.",

To address the urgent need for alternative and more sustainable control strategies, the sterile insect technique (SIT) is improved, which involves the release of sterilized male insects to mate with fertile conspecifics, thereby reducing the size of the pest population in the subsequent generation. The three critical aspects that influence the success of SIT programs in D. suzukii are addressed. First, an accurate and nondestructive method is established to determine the sex of individual insects based on the differential weight of male and female pupae. Second, conditions for X‐ray sterilization are systematically tested and an optimal dose (90 kV/40 Gy) is identified that ensures the efficient production of sterile D. suzukii for release. Finally, the inherent thermosensitivity of D. suzukii males is exploited to develop a temperature‐based sterilization technique, offering an alternative or additional SIT method for this pest. These advances will contribute to the development of a comprehensive and effective strategy for the management of D. suzukii populations, reducing their impact on agriculture and helping to safeguard crop yields.",

In this study, skeletal muscle specific hnRNPU knock out mice is utilized and evaluated skeletal muscle mass and immune cell infiltration through development. By 4 weeks, muscle-specific hnRNPU knockout mice revealed Ly6C+ monocyte infiltration into skeletal muscle, which preceded muscle atrophy. Canonical NF-kB signaling is activated in a myofiber-autonomous manner with hnRNPU repression. Inducible hnRNPU skeletal muscle knockout mice further demonstrated that deletion of hnRNPU in adulthood is sufficient to cause muscle atrophy, suggesting that hnRNPU's role in muscle maintenance is not during development alone. Treatment with salirasib, to inhibit proliferation of immune cells, prevents muscle atrophy in muscle-specific hnRNPU knock out mice, indicating that immune cell infiltration plays causal role in muscle atrophy of hnRNPU knock out mice.

A novel pipeline is proposed, dubbed Transcriptome Analysis of Host‐Microbiome Crosstalk (TAHMC), designed to concurrently restore both host gene expression and microbial quantification from bulk RNA‐seq data. Employing this approach, it discerned associations between the tissue microbiome and host immunity in the context of Crohn's disease (CD). Further, machine learning is utilized to separately construct networks of associations among host mRNA, long non‐coding RNA, and tissue microbes. Unique host genes and tissue microbes are extracted from these networks for potential utility in CD diagnosis. Experimental validation of the predicted host gene regulation by microbes from the association network is achieved through the co‐culturing of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii with Caco‐2 cells. Collectively, the TAHMC pipeline accurately recovers both host gene expression and microbial quantification from CD RNA‐seq data, thereby illuminating potential causal links between shifts in microbial composition as well as diversity within CD mucosal tissues and aberrant host gene expression.",

Then, RNA‐seq and bioinformatic analyses identified some angiogenesis relevant genes and pathways in STL‐depleted DPSCs. And STL enhanced expression of mRNA‐ring finger protein 217 (RNF217), which inhibited the tubule formation and mitochondrial respiration of DPSCs.

As recently as 2002 programmed aging is thought to be theoretically impossible. However, genetics discoveries, results of selective breeding, and other direct evidence strongly support the idea that aging creates an evolutionary advantage and that therefore complex biological mechanisms evolved that control aging in mammals and other multiparous organisms. Like life‐cycle programs that control reproduction, growth, and menopause the aging program can adjust the aging trait during an individual's life to compensate for temporary or local changes in external conditions that alter the optimum lifespan for a particular species population. Genetics discoveries also strongly support the evolvability concept to the effect that sexually reproducing species can evolve design features that increase their ability to evolve, and that aging is one such feature. Genetics discoveries also prove that biological inheritance involves transmission of organism design information in digital form between parent and descendant of any organism. This has major implications for the evolution process.",

The mechanisms of QGY and N‐QGY in the treatment of OP are probed from the perspective of osteoclast‐osteoblast balance. Thirty Sprague‐Dawley rats are randomly divided into N‐QGY group, QGY group, and Control group. Beyond control rats that orally took normal saline, other rats are orally administered with isometric N‐QGY or QGY twice every day for 3 days. The drug‐containing serum and control serum are prepared and their effects on osteoclast‐derived exosome secretion are determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA), nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western blot. GW4869 and Interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β) are adopted as the exosome inhibitor and inducer, respectively. Exosome uptake, cell counting kit‐8, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, alizarin red staining, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot are performed to examine the effects of altered osteoclast exosome content on osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). N‐QGY, QGY, and GW4869 inhibit osteoclast‐derived exosome secretion and exosome uptake by MSCs, whereas IL‐1β exerted the opposite effects ( p &lt; 0.05).

And the effect of N‐QGY is more conspicuous than that of QGY ( P &lt;0.05).

The methodology utilizes Five Cross-Common Spatial Patterns (FCCSP) to develop a motor movement/imagery systemization model that extracts multi-domain characteristics with excellent performance. The goal is to eliminate the impact caused by EEG's nonstationarity. The article highlights the findings of a real-time technique that is incorporated into a comprehensive prediction system, and it offers an innovative method to boost accuracy in real-time Sensory-Motor cortex Rhythms (SMR). The accuracy increased from 57.14% using raw EEG to 85.71% after preprocessing, and from 58.08% to 97.94% in public domain SMR. The proposed Butterworth bandpass filter is optimized using the FCCSP to determine the ideal bandwidth that incorporates the whole EEG features in beta waves. The Hybrid Systemization of the Correlated Feature Removal classifier is then integrated with the FCCSP method to create improved predictive models. As a consequence, while applied to real-time and PhysioNet datasets, the outcome system achieved outstanding accuracy values of 85.71% and 97.94%, respectively. This demonstrates the robustness of the strategy to increase SMR prediction efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tb ) is a significant intracellular pathogen responsible for numerous infectious disease‐related deaths worldwide. It uses ESX‐1 T7SS to damage phagosomes and to enter the cytosol of host cells after phagocytosis. During infection, M. tb and host mitochondria release dsDNA, which activates the CGAS‐STING1 pathway. This pathway leads to the production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines and activates autophagy, which targets and degrades bacteria within autophagosomes. However, the role of type I IFNs in immunity against M. tb is controversial. While previous research has suggested a protective role, recent findings from cgas‐sting1 knockout mouse studies have contradicted this. Additionally, a study using knockout mice and non‐human primate models uncovered a new mechanism by which neutrophils recruited to lung infections form neutrophil extracellular traps. Activating plasmacytoid dendritic cells causes them to produce type I IFNs, which interfere with the function of interstitial macrophages and increase the likelihood of tuberculosis. Notably, M. tb uses its virulence proteins to disrupt the CGAS‐STING1 signaling pathway leading to enhanced pathogenesis. Investigating the CGAS‐STING1 pathway can help develop new ways to fight tuberculosis.",

There is growing evidence that exercise is a powerful physiological intervention that can obviously enhance cell rejuvenate capacity, but its molecular mechanisms that mediate the axonal regenerative benefits remain largely unclear. Using the eye as the CNS model, here it is first indicated that placing mice in an exercise stimulation environment induced DNA methylation patterns and transcriptomes of retinal ganglion cell, promoted axon regeneration after injury, and reversed vision loss in aged mice. These beneficial effects are dependent on the DNA demethylases TET3‐mediated epigenetic effects, which increased the expression of genes associated with the regenerative growth programs, such as STAT3, Wnt5a, Klf6. Exercise training also shows with the improved mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction in retinas and optic nerves via TET3. Collectively, these results suggested that the increased regenerative capacity induced by enhancing physical activity is mediated through epigenetic reprogramming in mouse model of optic nerve injury and in aged mouse. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying exercise‐dependent neuronal plasticity led to the identification of novel targets for ameliorating pathologies associated with etiologically diverse diseases.",

Femoral bones are evaluated histologically 24 h and 3 weeks post‐trauma, while RANKL/OPG and β‐CTx are measured systemically via ELISA after 3 weeks. Aging results in less mineralized bone and fewer osteoclasts within the fracture of aged mice in contrast to young groups after three weeks.

    "abstract": "Abstract FAM136A promotes the progression and metastasis of various tumors. However, there are few studies on the role of FAM136A in esophageal cancer (ESCA). The TCGA, GTEx, and GEO databases are employed to analyze the expression of FAM136A in ESCA, and qPCR and TMA experiments are performed for validation. Enrichment analyzes are performed to investigate the association of FAM136A expression with immune features, m6A modification, alternative splicing, cuproptosis, and the ceRNA network via bioinformatics analysis. FAM136A is highly expressed in ESCA and correlated with lymph node metastasis and overall survival (OS). Bioinformatics analysis suggested that FAM136A may participate in the following processes to promote ESCA development and progression: 1) Promotion of mast cells infiltration to influence the ESCA immune microenvironment, 2) HNRNPC upregulation to regulate m6A modification, 3) ALYREF upregulation to increase the occurrence of retained intron (RI) events, 4) CDK5RAP1 upregulation to achieve inhibition of tumor cell apoptosis, and 5) promotion of ESCA progression through the lncRNA SNHG15/hsa‐miR‐29c‐3p/FAM136A ceRNA network. FAM136A is a potential biomarker for ESCA diagnosis and treatment response evaluation, and the underlying mechanisms may be associated with immune infiltration, m6A modification, alternative splicing, cuproptosis, and the ceRNA regulatory network.",

Isotelekin in in vitro studies, inhibited the production of Th‐1 cytokines Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), Tumour necrosis factor (TNF‐α), and Interferon‐gamma (INF‐γ), and increased Th‐2 cytokines Interleukin‐10 (IL‐10). Whereas it inhibited the nitrites and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by mitigating the effect of LPS significantly. In vivo immunomodulatory activity in Delayed‐type hypersensitivity (DTH) and Hemagglutinating antibody (HA), Isotelekin suppressed the cellular as well as humoral immunity in immune‐affected and SRBC‐sensitized mice. Isotelekin decreased the phagocytic responses against carbon particles and plaque‐forming mainly IgG (Immunoglobulin G) production. Additionally, Isotelekin showed immunosuppressive potential through the evaluation of splenocytes, allograft acceptance, and haematological parameters. Molecular studies, including western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry, revealed that Isotelekin reduced the expression of iNOS (Inducible nitric oxide synthase), COX‐2 (Cyclo‐Oxygenase 2), and p‐IkBα (Phospho I‐kappa‐B‐alpha), and significantly inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF‐κB/p65. Based on these results, Isotelekin at 10 µ m in in vitro and at 30 mg kg −1 in in vivo demonstrated strong anti‐inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapeutic potential.",

Identifying signaling pathways involved in pancreatic β‐cell failure and identity loss can give insight into novel potential treatment strategies to prevent the loss of functional β‐cell mass in diabetes. It is reported earlier that the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus has a detrimental effect on human β‐cell identity and function by activating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Here it is hypothesized that enhanced BMP signaling plays a role in inflammation‐induced β‐cell failure. Single‐cell transcriptomics analyses of primary human islets reveal that IL‐1β+IFNγ and IFNα treatment activated BMP signaling in β‐cells. These findings are validated by qPCR. Furthermore, enhanced BMP signaling with recombinant BMP2 or 4 triggers a reduced expression of key β‐cell maturity genes, associated with increased ER stress, and impaired β‐cell function. Altogether, these results indicate that inflammation‐activated BMP signaling is detrimental to pancreatic β‐cells and that BMP‐signaling can be a target to preserve β‐cell identity and function in a pro‐inflammatory environment.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage underlies the progression of asthma toward a severe, steroid hyporesponsive phenotype. The accumulation of double-stranded DNA within the cytosol triggers the activation of cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways, notably the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway. However, the precise role of STING in driving steroid hyporesponsiveness remains elusive and warrants further investigation. This study evaluates STING levels in human bronchial fibroblasts from severe asthmatic patients and in lung homogenates from a steroid hyporesponsive lung inflammation mouse model. STING level is assessed at baseline, post house dust mites (HDM) stimulation, and following treatment with dexamethasone and STING inhibitor. The effect of STING inhibitors on regulating steroid hyporesponsiveness particularly glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-α/GR-β ratio is also examined. Severe asthmatic fibroblasts exhibit elevated STING/IFN-I pathway activation, further heightened by HDM and a similar pattern is seen in lung homogenates from steroid hyporesponsive mice. Dexamethasone combined with an STING inhibitor reduces STING activity, while dexamethasone alone is ineffective. Interestingly, the STING inhibitor restores steroid sensitivity by increasing the GRα/GRβ ratio. Furthermore, nanoparticle-encapsulated STING inhibitor more effectively reduces airway hyperresponsiveness and restores steroid sensitivity than the free inhibitor. These findings emphasize STING's role in severe asthma pathogenesis, proposing nanoparticle delivery of STING inhibitors as a promising therapeutic strategy.",

To achieve this, heterogeneous populations of cells are levitated and confined in a microcapillary channel.

In addition, the sorting of fragile rare dead cell populations is monitored in real‐time. This technique provides a broadly applicable label‐free tool for high resolution, real‐time research, as well as forensic evidence processing of rape kits. This method is validated with forensic mock samples dating back to 2003, isolating sperm from epithelial cells (E. cells) with &gt;90% efficiency and &gt;97% purity. Overall, this method reduces the processing time by over 20‐fold down to 20 min, eliminating centrifugation and labels, and providing an inexpensive and high‐yield alternative to the current centrifuge‐based differential extraction techniques. It can potentially facilitate the forensic downstream genomic analyses, accelerating the identification of suspects, and advancing public safety.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cell fragments devoid of the nucleus play an essential role in intercellular communication. Mostly studied on flat 2D substrates, their origins and behavior in native fibrous environments remain unknown. Here, cytoplasmic fragments’ spontaneous formation and behavior in suspended extracellular matrices mimicking fiber architectures (parallel, crosshatch, and hexagonal) are described. After cleaving from the parent cell body, the fragments of diverse shapes on fibers migrate faster compared to 2D. Furthermore, while fragments in 2D are mostly circular, a higher number of rectangular and blob‐like shapes are formed on fibers, and, interestingly, each shape is capable of forming protrusive structures. Absent in 2D, fibers’ fragments display oscillatory migratory behavior with dramatic shape changes, sometimes remarkably sustained over long durations (&gt;20 h). Immunostaining reveals paxillin distribution along fragment body‐fiber length, while Forster Resonance Energy Transfer imaging of vinculin reveals mechanical loading of fragment adhesions comparable to whole cell adhesions. Using nanonet force microscopy, the forces exerted by fragments are estimated, and peculiarly small area fragments can exert forces similar to larger fragments in a Rho‐associated kinase dependent manner. Overall, fragment dynamics on 2D substrates are insufficient to describe the mechanosensitivity of fragments to fibers, and the architecture of fiber networks can generate entirely new behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The ability to control biological systems via light as the external stimulus is revolutionizing fundamental and applied life sciences. Light represents the ideal trigger to steer biological processes with unmatched spatial and temporal precision in a dose-dependent manner, offering the possibility of multiplexing by using light of different wavelengths. The development and use of genetically encoded, light-responsive switches define the rapidly growing field of optogenetics. First optogenetic approaches were pioneered by the Quail group using the Arabidopsis phytochrome system to control gene expression in yeast. Nonetheless, the field of optogenetics truly took off with the discovery that light-sensitive ion channels could be used to trigger action potentials in neuronal and muscle cells. For about a decade, indeed, optogenetics was deeply intertwined and immediately associated with neurobiology. Such optogenetic technologies allow dissecting and understanding the function of neuronal networks but also controlling neuronal processes in optically triggered brain-machine interfaces. After this initial phase in which it was mostly applied in neurobiology, optogenetics became widespread among cell biologists to control intracellular processes. Nowadays, we see interesting applications spanning many different cell types and even organisms; for instance, muscle cells have been engineered for light-inducible contraction and used as optically stimulated actuators in soft robotics. The second wave of innovation in optogenetics, capitalizing on the initial phytochrome-based optogenetic work, focuses on photoreceptors that translate light stimuli into a molecular output. We call it, therefore, molecular optogenetics. The output can be a change in the interaction state between two biomolecules, an altered enzyme activity, or the regulated availability of a protein motif or peptide. Molecular optogenetics is exponentially growing with an annual publication rate that doubles every 2 years (Figure 1). This growth in publications reflects the exponentially growing community of scientists harnessing and advancing the intriguing opportunities of molecular optogenetics. Innovations in this field have yielded technologies allowing controlling every step of the cellular signaling cascade. This molecular optogenetic toolbox includes light-responsive membrane-bound receptors, intracellular kinase cascades, second messenger-producing enzymes, light-inducible transcriptional regulators, or tools to steer the translocation of proteins between different compartments as well as their degradation, just to name the most predominant ones. More recently, tools from molecular optogenetics have been applied in the extracellular space for the development of light-responsive synthetic extracellular matrices or nanobodies/monobodies with an optically tunable affinity for their antigens. In order to keep track of the vertiginous selection of molecular optogenetic tools, the publicly available database www.optobase.org was established. In this issue dedicated to molecular optogenetics, the contributions of experts in the field in the form of reviews of the latest advances or original research are collected with the aim to help interested readers enter the exciting world of light-triggered biological devices learning how to apply them for their own purposes. One of the most often targeted cellular processes for light control since the early days of optogenetics is gene expression. By now, we have a multitude of tools for use in different organisms, ranging from bacteria to living mice. Baumschlager and Khammash discuss in article 2000256 past and recently developed strategies to control gene expression in bacteria, which will help readers find their way in the intricate jungle of possibilities to choose from. In article 2000234, Tucker and Pearce review recent approaches in endowing light-regulated dimerization systems with a second control layer. These approaches are used to decrease background leakiness and increase the dynamic range of naturally occurring photoreceptors for advanced optogenetic applications. One way to control protein activity with light is by allosteric coupling of the protein of interest to a photosensor. The successful engineering of fusions whereby the light-triggered conformational change of the photoreceptor propagates down to the protein of interest is not straightforward and often requires trial and error. In article 2000181, Mathony and Niopek give an exciting guided tour of the most recent advances in methodologies that support the design of optogenetic allosteric switches. Among the discussed strategies, the one based on the insertion of LOV domains into surface-exposed loops is particularly promising, as demonstrated by its successful application to the light-mediated control of kinases, Cas9, and nanobodies. In article 2000180, Zhang and colleagues comprehensively review recent new optogenetic switches as well as improved, engineered variants of previous switches. They further compile experimental conditions, biophysical properties and application fields of different switches, representing a highly valuable resource when planning future optogenetic experiments. In addition to these reviews, this special issue features new optogenetic technologies applied at different levels of intracellular signal processing but also in the extracellular space to control the assembly of nanomaterials. In article 2000307, the Zurbriggen group describes a blue light-responsive system for mRNA knockdown. The system is based on the blue light-inducible expression of an engineered Cas13b to degrade target mRNAs specifically. By combining three blue light-inducible switches for mRNA degradation, suppressing transcription, and target protein destabilization, the protein levels can rapidly be reduced by >99%. In article 2000147, Zhou and colleagues bring us into the world of the innate immune system. They adapt two previously established optogenetic tools, namely CRY2-mediated protein oligomerization and LOVTRAP-mediated protein heterodimerization, to control with blue light the assembly of MyDDsomes and MAVsomes, two types of supramolecular organizing centers (SMOC). Consequently, the authors can trigger the activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-κB) and type-I interferons (IFNs) with blue light, opening up new avenues to study the innate immune system and potentially counteract immune diseases and cancer. In article 2000196, Radziwill and colleagues develop and characterize a multichromatic optogenetic system, where blue, red, and far-red light is used to activate either RAF/ERK or AKT signaling orthogonally. This system is useful in dissecting and steering the fine-grained and intricate processes involved in cell fate decisions. In article 2000134, Yi, Zhang and colleagues apply optogenetics in hair-follicle-derived stem cells (HSCs) to study how activation of the tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) receptor impacts several processes such as migration and differentiation. Making use of the blue light-inducible TrkA (OptoTrkA) previously engineered by the Zhang group, they show that HSCs with OptoTrkA activity proliferate and migrate more, as well as differentiate more quickly into neuronal and glial cells. The Grosse group was the first to engineer optogenetic control of the endogenous formin mDia2 back in 2013 to show the involvement of this formin in the formation of dynamic actin filaments in the nucleus. Continuing with their tradition to develop optogenetic molecular tools to study the actin cytoskeleton and related cellular processes, Zhao and Grosse present in article 2000208 a novel light-controllable MRTFA, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. By fusing the blue light-inducible nuclear export signal LEXY to MRTFA, they are able to steer with blue light the ability of different mammalian cells to invade and bleb. In article 2000541, the Zhou group develops so-called sunbodies consisting of nanobodies with engineered blue light-responsive light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domains. They show that the affinity of sunbodies towards intracellular antigens can be switched by blue light, which they use for light-inducible targeting of intracellular proteins. The Wegner group moves optogenetics out of the cell in article 2000199. They target the green light photoreceptor CarH to the surface of breast cancer cell lines, which induces cell-cell interactions in the dark. By the subsequent illumination of the sample with green light, CarH tetramers dissociate leading to the dissolution of the cell aggregates. Similarly, in article 2000179, the Möglich group harvests the ability of some LOV photoreceptors to homodimerize with blue light to control the aggregation state of gold nanoparticles. They conjugate two well-characterized LOV domains – Phaeodactylum tricornutum aureochrome 1a (Ptaur) and Neurospora crassa Vivid (NcVVD) – to the surface of the gold nanoparticles. By shining blue light, they trigger the assembly of large aggregates, which are instead monodispersed in darkness. This article nicely contributes to the growing field of optogenetics for material science. We hope the readers will be as fascinated as we are by this excellent collection and eagerly await the next developments in the field of molecular optogenetics the tools described here will surely spark.

    "abstract": "Abstract Demineralized bone matrix (DBM), a potential alternative to autologous bone grafts, has been increasingly used for clinical bone repair; however, its application in larger defects has not been successful partly due to the rapid dispersion of DBM particles and relatively lower osteoinductivity. Here, a novel strategy is created to complement the osteoinductivity of DBM by incorporating DBM in a biopolymer hydrogel combined with the abrogation of BMP antagonism. Combined treatment of DBM+noggin‐suppression displays increased osteogenic potency of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) in vitro. An injectable chitosan (MeGC)‐based hydrogel with heparinization (Hep‐MeGC) is further developed to localize and stabilize DBM. Noggin‐suppression reveals a significant increase in osteogenesis of hBMSCs in the photopolymerizable Hep‐MeGC hydrogels with the encapsulation of DBM. Moreover, the combination of DBM+noggin‐suppression in the injectable Hep‐MeGC hydrogel displays robust bone healing in mouse critical‐sized calvarial defects in vivo. The mechanistic analysis demonstrates that noggin‐suppression increases DBM osteoinductivity by stimulating endogenous BMP/Smad signals. These results have shown promise in DBM's ability as a prominent bone grafting material while being coupled with gene editing mechanism and a localizing 3D scaffold. Together, this approach poses a significant increase in the efficiency of DBM‐mediated craniofacial bone repair and dental osteointegration.",

    "abstract": "Genetically encoded reporters have greatly increased our understanding of biology. While fluorescent reporters have been widely used, photostability and phototoxicity have hindered their use in long-term experiments. Bioluminescence overcomes some of these challenges but requires the addition of an exogenous luciferin limiting its use. Using a modular approach, Autonomous Molecular BioluminEscent Reporter (AMBER), an indicator of membrane potential is engineered. Unlike other bioluminescent systems, AMBER is a voltage-gated luciferase coupling the functionalities of the Ciona voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and bacterial luciferase, luxAB. When co-expressed with the luciferin-producing genes, AMBER reversibly switches the bioluminescent intensity as a function of membrane potential. Using biophysical and biochemical methods, it is shown that AMBER switches its enzymatic activity from an OFF to an ON state as a function of the membrane potential. Upon depolarization, AMBER switches from a low to a high enzymatic activity state, showing a several-fold increase in the bioluminescence output (ΔL/L). AMBER in the pharyngeal muscles and mechanosensory touch neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans is expressed. Using the compressed sensing approach, the electropharingeogram of the C. elegans pharynx is reconstructed, validating the sensor in vivo. Thus, AMBER represents the first fully genetically encoded bioluminescent reporter without requiring exogenous luciferin addition.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is rapidly becoming a frontline cancer therapy. However, the manufacturing process is time-, labor- and cost-intensive, and it suffers from significant bottlenecks. Many CAR-T products fail to reach the viability release criteria set by regulators for commercial cell therapy products. This results in non-recoupable costs for the manufacturer and is detrimental to patients who may not receive their scheduled treatment or receive out-of-specification suboptimal formulation. It is demonstrated here that inertial microfluidics can, within minutes, efficiently deplete nonviable cells from low-viability CAR-T cell products. The percentage of viable cells increases from 40% (SD ± 0.12) to 71% (SD ± 0.09) for untransduced T cells and from 51% (SD ± 0.12) to 71% (SD ± 0.09) for CAR-T cells, which meets the clinical trials' release parameters. In addition, the processing of CAR-T cells formulated in CryStor yields a 91% reduction in the amount of the cryoprotectant dimethyl sulfoxide. Inertial microfluidic processing has no detrimental effects on the proliferation and cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells.

The use of ADCs is effective for the treatment of different diseases, including cancers, and is gaining widespread attention. To date, 12 ADCs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating cancer and improving the quality of life of patients. To expand the application of ADCs and improve their treatment efficiency, various formats have recently been manufactured, including pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonist‐based ADCs. The antibody has a unique structure that enables the specific delivery of PRR agonists to the tumor area, and this improves the therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity. This review briefly discusses the current landscape and future perspectives of antibody–PRR agonist conjugates for cancer therapy.",

The properties of the premetastatic niche can influence the DTC phenotype. To better understand how matrix properties of premetastatic niches influence DTC behavior, three hydrogel formulations are implemented to model a permissive niche and two nonpermissive niches. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogels with varying adhesivity ([RGDS]) and degradability ([N-vinyl pyrrolidinone]) are implemented to mimic a permissive niche with high adhesivity and degradability and two nonpermissive niches, one with moderate adhesivity and degradability and one with no adhesivity and high degradability. The influence of matrix properties on estrogen receptor positive (ER+ ) breast cancer cells (MCF7s) is determined via a multimetric analysis. MCF7s cultured in the permissive niche adopted a growth state, while those in the nonpermissive niche with reduced adhesivity and degradability underwent tumor mass dormancy. Complete removal of adhesivity while maintaining high degradability induced single cell dormancy. The ability to mimic reactivation of dormant cells through a dynamic increase in [RGDS] is also demonstrated. This platform provides the capability of inducing growth, dormancy, and reactivation of ER+ breast cancer and can be useful in understanding how premetastatic niche properties influence cancer cell fate.",

CAR‐T therapy has achieved successful clinical outcomes, and it has been transformed into commercially available products to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B cell lymphoma. These breakthroughs have motivated hundreds of CAR‐T clinical trials initiated each year, with ≈900 cases registered on the ClinicalTrials website till 2021. Accumulating clinical experiences have highlighted some limitations of this strategy, e.g., relapse after complete response, poor efficacy in solid tumors, on‐target off‐tumor toxicities, lack of persistence, and tumor resistance. These challenges limit the therapeutic application of CAR‐T cells. Multidisciplinary approaches are actively investigated to address these issues. In this review, the antigens, CAR designs, and cell sources are summarized in clinical trials from 2020 to 2021. The innovative modular and programmable designs in CAR‐T cells, including advances in signaling domains, antigen‐recognition domains, T cell engineering, and cell resources, are further discussed. Integrative genetic and chemical engineering strategies are promising to improve the versatility, antitumor efficacy, persistence, and safety of CAR‐T cells. In the future, the next generation of CAR‐T cell therapies will offer more options for patients who are refractory to standard tumor therapies.",

Despite advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment, the survival rate of patients with HNC remains stagnant. The cancer‐nerve interaction has been recognized as an important driver of cancer progression. Schwann cells, a type of peripheral glia, have been implicated in promoting cancer cell growth, migration, dispersion, and invasion into the nerve in many cancers. Here, it is demonstrated that the presence of Schwann cells makes oral cancer cells more aggressive by promoting their proliferation, extracellular matrix breakdown, and altering cell metabolism. Furthermore, oral cancer cells became larger, more circular, with more projections and nuclei following co‐culturing with Schwann cells. RNA‐sequencing analysis in oral cancer cells following exposure to Schwann cells shows corresponding changes in genes involved in the hallmarks of cancer and cell metabolism; the enriched KEGG pathways are spliceosome, RNA transport, cell cycle, axon guidance, signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, cAMP signaling, WNT signaling, proteoglycans in cancer and PI3K‐Akt signaling. Taken together, these results suggest a significant role for Schwann cells in facilitating oral cancer progression, highlighting their potential as a target to treat oral cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In humans with type 2 diabetes, at least 70% of patients exhibit islet amyloid plaques formed by misfolding islet amyloid polypeptides (IAPP). The oligomeric conformation and accumulation of the IAPP plaques lead to a panoply of cytotoxic effects on the islet β‐cells. Currently, no marketed therapies for the prevention or elimination of these amyloid deposits exist, and therefore significant efforts are required to address this gap. To date, most of the experimental treatments are limited to only in vitro stages of testing. In general, the proposed therapeutics use various targeting strategies, such as binding to the N‐terminal region of islet amyloid polypeptide on residues 1–19 or the hydrophobic region of IAPP. Other strategies include targeting the peptide self‐assembly through π‐stacking. These methods are realized by using several different families of compounds, four of which are highlighted in this review: naturally occurring products, small molecules, organometallic compounds, and nanoparticles. Each of these categories holds immense potential to optimize and develop inhibitor(s) of pancreatic amyloidosis in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian carcinoma (OC) forms outgrowths that extend from the outer surface of an afflicted organ into the peritoneum. OC outgrowth formation is poorly understood due to the limited availability of cell culture models examining the behavior of cells that form outgrowths. Prompted by immunochemical evaluation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in human tissues, laminin and collagen-rich ECM-reconstituted cell culture models amenable to studies of cell clusters that can form outgrowths are developed. It is demonstrated that ECM promotes outgrowth formation in fallopian tube non-ciliated epithelial cells (FNE) expressing mutant p53 and various OC cell lines. Outgrowths are initiated by cells that underwent outward translocation and retained the ability to intercalate into mesothelial cell monolayers. Electron microscopy, optical coherence tomography, and small amplitude oscillatory shear experiments reveal that increased ECM levels led to increased fibrous network thickness and high shear elasticity of the microenvironment. These physical characteristics are associated with outgrowth suppression. The low ECM microenvironment mimicks the viscoelasticity of malignant peritoneal fluid (ascites) and supports cell proliferation, cell translocation, and outgrowth formation. These results highlight the importance of the ECM microenvironment in modulating OC growth and can provide additional insights into the mode of dissemination of primary and recurrent ovarian tumors.",

Herein, gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)–poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) based 3D hydrogel microspheroids are constructed with non‐immunogenicity and controllable macroporous structure to establish a tumor‐immune cell coculture (3D‐HyGTIC) system. In 3D‐HyGTIC system, when immune cells embarked, stepwise up‐regulation of main immune checkpoints (ICs) molecules is observed with compromised cytokine production in CD8 + T cells, the trajectory of which is in lineage correlation with in vivo grafted tumors. Reinvigoration of CD8 + T cells is more obvious with the addition of an anti‐PD‐1 regimen at the early time point, which is recapitulated during the coculture of patient‐derived tumor fragments (PDTF) and autologous T cells. Moreover, the upregulation of LAG‐3 on CD8 + T cells after anti‐PD‐1 treatment is uncovered. Sequential addition of anti‐LAG‐3 successfully rescues the otherwise failed reactivation of CD8 + T cells. Therefore, the 3D‐HyGTIC system is not only inclined to mimic the early differentiation trajectories of tumor‐infiltrating CD8 + T cells but also may facilitate an evaluation of the efficacy of IC blockades and guide the designing of combination immunotherapy.",

Here targeted plasma metabolomic is performed, and the metabolite profiles among healthy controls, and asymptomatic, moderate, and severe COVID‐19 patients are compared. Among the altered metabolites, arachidonic acid and linolenic acid pathway metabolites are profoundly up‐regulated in COVID‐19 patients. Arginine biosynthesis, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathways are significantly disturbed in asymptomatic patients. In the comparison of metabolite variances among the groups, higher levels of l ‐citrulline and l ‐glutamine are found in asymptomatic carriers and moderate or severe patients at the remission stage. Furthermore, l ‐citrulline and l ‐glutamine combination therapy is demonstrated to effectively protect mice from coronavirus infection and endotoxin‐induced sepsis, and is observed to efficiently prevent the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis and central nervous system damage. Collectively, the data reveal the metabolite profile of asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients and propose a potential strategy for COVID‐19 treatment.",

An improved understanding of the cell‐type‐specific dysfunction contributing to male infertility is needed to improve available therapies; however, human testicular tissues are difficult to obtain for research purposes. To overcome this, researchers have begun to use human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to generate various testis‐specific cell types in vitro. Peritubular myoid cells (PTMs) are one such testicular cell type that serves a critical role in the human testis niche but, to date, have not been derived from hiPSCs. This study set forth to generate a molecular‐based differentiation method for deriving PTMs from hiPSCs, mirroring in vivo patterning factors. Whole transcriptome profiling and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) show that this differentiation method is sufficient to derive cells with PTM‐like transcriptomes, including upregulation of hallmark PTM functional genes, secreted growth and matrix factors, smooth muscle, integrins, receptors, and antioxidants. Hierarchical clustering shows that they acquire transcriptomes similar to primary isolated PTMs, and immunostaining shows the acquisition of a smooth muscle phenotype. Overall, these hiPSC‐PTMs will allow in vitro study of patient‐specific PTM development and function in spermatogenesis and infertility.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a very low survival rate due to poor response to chemotherapy and late detection. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is regarded as a major contributor to drive metastasis during NSCLC progression. Towards this, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) is the key driver that endows cancer cells with increased aggressiveness. Recently, this group synthesized a series of Schiff base quercetin derivatives (QDs) and ascertained their effectiveness on EMT markers of A549 cell line. This study evidenced that the EMT process is counteracted via the partial activation of a nuclear hormone receptor, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ through QDs. Here, that work is extended to investigate the interplay between PPAR-γ partial activation and TGF-β1-induced EMT in human lung cancer A549 cells. The results reveal that TGF-β1 plays a critical role in suppressing PPAR-γ, which is markedly reversed and increased by partial agonists: QUE2FH and QUESH at both protein and transcriptional levels. The partial agonists not only stimulate PPAR-γ in a balanced manner but also prevent the loss of E-cadherin and acquisition of TGF-β1-induced mesenchymal markers (Snail, Slug, Vimentin, and Zeb-1). Subsequently, the effects are accompanied by attenuation of TGF-β1-induced migratory ability of A549 cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neurodegenerative diseases and cancers are considered to be two families of diseases caused by completely opposite cell‐death mechanisms: the former caused by premature cell death, with the latter due to the increased resistance to cell death. Growing epidemiologic evidence appear to suggest an inverse correlation between neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. However, pathological links, particularly from a protein‐cell interaction perspective, between these two families of diseases remains to be proven. Here, a fundamental study investigates the effects of three amyloid proteins of Aβ (associated with AD), hIAPP (associated with T2D), and hCT (associated with MTC) on pancreatic cancer (PANC‐1) cells. Collective results demonstrate a general inhibitory activity of all of three amyloid proteins on cancer cell proliferation, but inhibition efficiencies are strongly dependent on amyloid sequence (Aβ, hIAPP, hCT), concentration (IC25, IC50, IC75), and aggregation states (monomers, oligomers). Amyloid proteins exhibit two pathways against cancer cells: amyloid monomer‐induced ROS production to inhibit cell growth and amyloid oligomer‐induced membrane disruption to kill cells. Collectively, the results demonstrate a general inhibition function of amyloid proteins to induce cancer cell death by preventing cell proliferation, suppressing cell migration, promoting reactive oxygen species production, and disrupting cell membranes.",

However, an increased capsule thickness and inflammatory response are observed in the groups with surface topographies, The addition of an endplate results in prolonged bleb survival, demonstrating that engineering of the shape of glaucoma implants could prolong bleb functionality.

Herein a GOx-based glucose-responsive delivery system is designed based on fibrin-coated polymeric microcapsules (FCPMC) using the layer-by-layer (LbL) approach that simultaneously delivers two nucleic acids in diabetic wounds. The designed FCPMC displays an ability to effectively load many nucleic acids in polyplexes and release it over a prolonged period with no cytotoxic effects seen in in vitro studies. Furthermore, the developed system does not show any undesired effects in vivo. When applied to wounds in genetically diabetic db/db mice, the fabricated system on its own improves reepithelialization and angiogenesis while decreasing inflammation. Also, key proteins involved in the wound healing process, i.e., Actn2, MYBPC1, and desmin, are upregulated in the glucose-responsive fibrin hydrogel (GRFHG) treated group of animals. In conclusion, the fabricated hydrogel promotes wound healing. Furthermore, the system may be encapsulated with various therapeutic nucleic acids that aid wound healing.",

Cell-free CM is collected and the anti-inflammatory capacity of PDLSC CM and PDLSC-SPION CM is assessed by treatment of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages and IL-17-stimulated human gingival fibroblasts. Both CMs inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in cells, and the therapeutic effect is more distinct for PDLSC-SPION CM than PDLSC CM, which may be due to their different proteomic compositions. Therefore, modification of PDLSCs with ferumoxytol enhances the anti-inflammatory capacity of its CM, making it more potentially useful for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis.",

Manual counting and quantification of these cells are prone to time-consuming processes, human error, and inter-observer variability, particularly challenging when heterogeneous cell types in 3D clusters are present. To overcome these challenges, we developed \"Fastcount,\" an in-house MATLAB-based algorithm for precise, automated quantification and phenotypic characterization of CTCs and CTCCs, in both 2D and 3D. Fastcount is 120 times faster than manual counting and produces reliable results with a ±7.3% deviation compared to a trained laboratory technician. By analyzing 400 GB of fluorescence imaging data, we showed that Fastcount outperforms manual counting and commercial software when cells are aggregated in 3D or staining artifacts are present, delivering more accurate results. We further employed Fastcount for automated analysis of 3D image stacks obtained from CTCCs isolated from colorectal adenocarcinoma and renal cell carcinoma blood samples. Interestingly, we observed a highly heterogeneous spatial cellular composition within CTCCs, even among clusters from the same patient. Overall, Fastcount can be employed for various applications with lab-chip devices, such as CTC detection, CTCC analysis in 3D and cell detection in biosensors.",

The expression of TIGIT and PD‐1 in RCC and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and the correlation between TIGIT and PD‐1 are evaluated. The expression of TIGIT and PD‐1 is inhibited, and then the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration are assessed. TIGIT expression is positively related to the expression of PDCD1, BTLA, ICOS, and FOXP3 ( p &lt; 0.05). TIGIT expression in the PBMC, TIL, RCC, and adjacent normal tissues is higher than PD‐1 expression. Blocking the TIGIT and PD‐1 signaling pathways significantly inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of RCC cells and promotes their apoptosis. These effects are more evident in TIGIT inhibitors than in PD‐1 inhibitors. TIGIT inhibitor mainly regulates the expression of differential genes to achieve the reconstruction of immune killing and restore the killing effect on the RCC, and its mechanism by which TIGIT functions overlap that of PD‐1 inhibitor. TIGIT may become a target for the immunotherapy of RCC, and there is a theoretical basis for the combination of TIGIT inhibitors and PD‐1 inhibitors for the treatment of RCC.",

Environmental hypoxia and tissue hypoxia in muscles cue for their appropriate physiological response and adaptation, and cause an array of cellular and metabolic changes.

The mechanisms of hypoxia‐mediated regulation of satellite cells and myogenesis are yet to be characterized, and their seemingly contradicting effects reported leave their exact roles somewhat perplexing. This review summarizes the recent findings on the effect of hypoxia and hypoxia signaling on the key aspects of muscle physiology, namely, stem cell maintenance and myogenesis with a particular attention given to distinguish the intrinsic versus local hypoxia in an attempt to better understand their respective regulatory roles and how their relationship affects the overall response.

Despite MLC1 being established as a key mediator in tumor progression, its role in PC remains unexplored. This study aims to validate MLC1's anti‐tumor effects and uncover potential mechanisms. MLC1's clinical significance is assessed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype‐Tissue Expression databases. MLC1 expression is significantly reduced in PC samples compared with the adjacent normal tissues. MLC1 expression correlates negatively with tumor metastasis and positively with the survival of patients with PC. In vitro, up‐regulating MLC1 effectively inhibits tumor progression by curtailing proliferation, infestation, and migration through the deactivation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Conversely, down‐regulating MLC1 promotes PC progression, a phenomenon alleviated by the PI3K/AKT inhibitor, Gefitinib. Furthermore, the anti‐tumor function of MLC1 is corroborated by a reduction in tumor volume compared with the negative control in vivo. This study confirms the anti‐tumor effects of MLC1 via in vitro and in vivo experiments, demonstrating its potential mechanism of inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",

Herein, immunostimulatory effects of IFNγ cytokine and a CD40 ligand (CD40L) costimulatory molecule are evaluated as combined with an antigen, and also linked to an antigen in mice. For this purpose, after preparation of the HIV‐1 Nef, IFNγ, and CD40L DNA constructs, and also their recombinant protein in an Escherichia coli expression system, nine groups of female BALB/c mice are immunized with different regimens of DNA constructs. About 3 weeks and also 3 months after the last injection, humoral and cellular immune responses are assessed in mice sera and splenocytes. Additionally, mice splenocytes are exposed to single‐cycle replicable (SCR) HIV‐1 virions for evaluating their potency in the secretion of cytokines in vitro. The data indicate that the linkage of IFNγ and CD40L to Nef antigen can significantly induce the Th‐1 pathway and activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes compared to other regimens. Moreover, groups receiving the IFNγ‐Nef and CD40L‐Nef fusion DNA constructs show higher secretion of IFNγ and TNF‐α from virion‐infected lymphocytes than other groups. Therefore, the IFNγ‐Nef and CD40L‐Nef fusion DNA constructs are suggested to be a potential option for development of an efficient HIV‐1 vaccine.",

In vitro assays show that sEV_UC, despite an equal particle count, induces more robust ERK phosphorylation, cytoprotection, and proliferation in iPS‐derived cardiomyocytes (iPS‐CMs) compared to sEV_SEC. sEV_UC also contains elevated periostin (POSTN) protein levels, resulting in enhanced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation in iPS‐CMs. Importantly, this effect persists with treatment with soluble free‐sEV protein fraction from SEC (Prote_SEC), indicating that free proteins like POSTN in sEV_UC enhance FAK phosphorylation. In vivo, sEV contamination with soluble proteins doesn't affect cardiac targeting or FAK phosphorylation, underscoring the intrinsic tissue targeting properties of sEV. These findings emphasize the need for standardized sEV isolation methods, as the choice of method can impact experimental outcomes, particularly in vitro.",

This study aims to elucidate whether ketone bodies generated from the liver play a critical role in bridging the liver and spinal cord. Mice model with a contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) surgery is established, and SCI induces significant histological changes in mice liver. mRNA‐seq of liver tissue shows the temporal changes of ketone bodies‐related genes, β‐hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1) and solute carrier family 16 (monocarboxylic acid transporters), member 6 (SLC16A6). Then, an activated ketogenesis model is created with adult C57BL/6 mice receiving the tail intravenous injection of GPAAV8‐TBG‐Mouse‐Hmgcs2‐CMV‐ mCherry ‐WPRE (HMGCS2 liver ) and mice receiving equal AAV8‐Null being the control group (Vector liver ). Then, the mice undergo either a contusive SCI or sham surgery. The results show that overexpression of HMG‐CoA synthase (Hmgcs2) in mice liver dramatically alleviates SCI‐mediated pathological changes and promotes ketogenesis in the liver. Amazingly, liver‐derived ketogenesis evidently alleviates neuron apoptosis and inflammatory microglia activation and improves the recovery of motor function of SCI mice. In conclusion, a liver‐spinal cord axis can be bridged via ketone bodies, and enhancing the production of the ketone body within the liver has neuroprotective effects on traumatic SCI.",

Chemotherapy has recently been recognized as one of such reasons. However, in‐depth studies of chemotherapy‐induced dormancy are lacking due to the absence of an in vitro human‐relevant model tailor‐made for such a scenario. This report utilized multicellular breast cancer spheroid to create a primary platform for establishing a chemotherapy‐induced dormancy model. It is observed that extreme chemotherapeutic stress affects invasive and non‐invasive spheroids differently. Non‐invasive spheroids exhibit more resilience and maintain viability and migrational ability, while invasive spheroids display heightened susceptibility and improved tumorigenic capacity. Heterogenous spheroids exhibit increased tumorigenic capacity while show minimal survival ability. Further probing of chemotherapeutically dormant spheroids is needed to understand the molecular mechanism and identify dormancy‐related markers to achieve therapeutic success in the future.",

In this study, a drastic deviation from this tendency is proposed and developed a new type of hydrogel scaffold in which cells are covalently connected to 3D hydrogel networks via bioorthogonal click cross‐linking reactions of azide‐modified cells with alkyne‐modified polymers. The purpose of this study is to directly compare the utility of the covalent cell‐loading approach and the conventional physical cell‐loading approach as hydrogel scaffolds for in vivo tissue engineering. It is found that the proposed covalent cell‐loading approach significantly promotes tissue regeneration and functional recovery in vivo in comparison with the conventional physical cell‐loading approach. This is the first report demonstrating the importance of the covalent cell‐loading approach in tissue engineering. This covalent cell‐loading approach is applicable to a broad spectrum of mammalian cells, including stem cells. The present findings provide a promising new route to generate innovative hydrogel scaffolds for in vivo tissue engineering.",

Pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells are seeded into nonwoven microfibrous viscose‐rayon scaffolds functionalized with poly‐ l ‐lysine and laminin. Compared with the results from static control cultures with and without electrical stimulation and bioreactor cultures with the fluid flow without electrical stimulation, expression levels of the differentiation markers β3‐tubulin, shootin1, and ephrin type‐A receptor 2 are greatest when cells are cultured in bioreactors with fluid flow combined with in‐situ electrical stimulus. Immunocytochemical assessment of neurite development and morphology within the scaffolds confirm the beneficial effects of exposing the cells to concurrent hydrodynamic and electrical treatments. Under the conditions tested, electrical stimulation by itself produces more pronounced levels of cell differentiation than fluid flow alone; however, significant additional improvements in differentiation are achieved by combining these treatments. Fluid flow and electrical stimuli exert independent and noninteractive effects on cellular differentiation, suggesting that interference between the mechanisms of differentiation enhancement by these two treatments is minimal during their simultaneous application. This work demonstrates the beneficial effects of combining several different potent physical environmental stimuli in cell culture systems to promote neurogenesis.",

Here, a molecular cocktail is identified comprising of pan‐BET family inhibitor (I‐BET151), retinoic acid, and riluzole that enables the efficient conversion of fibroblasts into functional Sertoli‐like cells (CiSCs). The gene expression profiles of CiSCs resemble those of mature SCs and exhibit functional properties such as the formation of testicular seminiferous tubules, engulfment of apoptotic sperms, supporting the survival of germ cells, and suppressing proliferation of primary lymphocytes in vitro. Moreover, CiSCs are sensitive to toxic substances, making them an alternative model to study the deleterious effects of toxicants on SCs.

    "abstract": "Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), as a novel class of anticancer therapy, can be more efficacious and less toxic than chemotherapy, but their clinical success is confined to certain tumor types. Elucidating their targets, mechanisms and scope of action, and potential synergism with chemotherapy and/or targeted therapies are critical to widen their clinical indications. Treatment response to an ICI targeting programmed death‐1 (anti‐PD‐1) is sought to be understood here by conducting a preplanned correlative analysis of a phase II clinical trial in patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA). The cytolytic capacity of circulating immune cells in cancer patients using a novel ex vivo cytotoxicity assay is evaluated, and the utility of circulating biomarkers is investigated to predict and monitor the treatment effect of anti‐PD‐1. Baseline expression of Bim and NKG7 and upregulation of CX3CR1 in circulating T cells are associated with the clinical benefit of anti‐PD‐1 in patients with SBA. Overall, these findings suggest that the frequency and cytolytic capacity of circulating, effector immune cells may differentiate clinical response to ICIs, providing a strong rationale to support immune monitoring using patient peripheral blood.",

Moreover, a total of 153 engineered tRNAs are screened for efficient all stop‐codons decoding to construct a codon‐dependent termination defect in vitro protein synthesis with all 64 sense‐codons, iPSSC.

    "abstract": "Abstract Dysfunction of glucokinase (GCK) caused by mutations in the GCK gene is the main cause of maturity‐onset diabetes of the young type‐2 (MODY2, also known as GCK‐MODY), which is usually present in adolescence or young adulthood. MODY2 is characterized by mild, stable fasting hyperglycemia that presents at birth, usually 5.4–8.3 mmol L −1 , and rarely develops complications from diabetes. The treatment of MODY2 prefers a manageable diet rather than the use of insulin. Previous studies have identified GCK mutations only by online software prediction or enzyme kinetic analysis and thermolability assays which are complicated to be conducted. In this study, six mutations in the GCK gene, including four novel mutations and two mutations that are previously reported, are identified. All the six locations are highly conserved according to the sequencing alignment. Moreover, missense mutations are strongly predicted to be pathogenic using online programs. Functional studies show that mutations in GCK mutation do not affect insulin secretion but affect glycogen synthesis. These findings demonstrate that GCK mutations decrease glycogen synthesis, which leads to hyperglycemia in MODY2. Meanwhile, this study provides a new perspective and methods for identifying pathogenic mutations in GCK.",

There is a widespread need for in vitro models of human colon physiology with its innate immune system. A method is described to produce a cassette with a network of struts supporting a suspended, non‐chemically cross‐linked collagen hydrogel scaffold compatible with the co‐culture of primary gastrointestinal epithelium and migratory inflammatory cells. The epithelial monolayer cultured on the suspended collagen possesses a population of polarized and differentiated cells similar to that present in vivo. This epithelial layer displays proper barrier function with a transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) ≥ 1,500 Ω cm 2 and an apparent permeability ≤10 −5 cm 2 s −1 . Immune cells plated on the basal face of the scaffold transmigrated over a period of 24 h to the epithelial layer in response to epithelial production of IL‐8 induced by luminal stimulation of Clostridium difficile Toxin A. These studies demonstrate that this in vitro platform possesses a functional primary colonic epithelial layer with an immune cell compartment capable of recruitment in response to pro‐inflammatory cues coming from the epithelium.",

A framework is introduced here in which activity‐dependent transcriptional programs, induced by these environmental stimuli, move somatic cells such as neurons and muscle cells toward a state that resembles younger cells to allow remodeling and adaptation of the organism. This cellular adaptation program targets several process classes that are heavily implicated in aging, such as mitochondrial metabolism, cell–cell communication, and epigenetic information processing, and leads to functional improvements in these areas. The activity‐dependent gene program (ADGP) can be seen as a natural, endogenous cellular reprogramming mechanism that provides deep insight into the principles of inducible improvements in cell and organism function and can guide the development of therapeutic approaches for longevity. Here, these ADGPs are analyzed, exemplary critical molecular nexus points such as cAMP response element‐binding protein, myocyte enhancer factor 2, serum response factor, and c‐Fos are identified, and it is explored how one may leverage them to prevent, attenuate, and reverse human aging‐related decline of body function.",

Among these, advances in high‐throughput drug screening approaches have permitted the rapid identification of potential therapeutic agents from drug libraries that contain thousands or millions of molecules. Moreover, high‐throughput‐based therapeutic target discovery strategies can comprehensively interrogate relationships between biomolecules (e.g., gene, RNA, and protein) and diseases and significantly increase the authors’ knowledge of disease mechanisms. Diabetes is a chronic disease primarily characterized by the incapacity of the body to maintain normoglycemia. The prevalence of diabetes in modern society has become a severe public health issue that threatens the well‐being of millions of patients. Although a number of pharmacological treatments are available, there is no permanent cure for diabetes, and discovering novel therapeutic targets and agents continues to be an urgent need. The present review discusses the technical details of high‐throughput screening approaches in drug discovery, followed by introducing the applications of such approaches to diabetes research. This review aims to provide an example of the applicability of high‐throughput technologies in facilitating different aspects of disease research.",

A functional NK cell repertoire is generated through cellular education, resulting in a heterogeneous NK cell population with distinct capabilities responding to different stimuli. The application of a high-throughput droplet-based microfluidic platform allows monitoring of NK cell-target cell interactions at the single-cell level and in real-time. A variable response of single NK cells toward different target cells is observed, and a distinct population of NK cells (serial killers) capable of inducing multiple target lysis is identified. By assessing the cytotoxic dynamics, it is shown that single umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor (HPC)-NK cells display superior antitumor cytotoxicity. With an integrated analysis of cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion, it is shown that target cell interactions augment cytotoxic as well as secretory behavior of NK cells. By providing an integrated assessment of NK cell functions by microfluidics, this study paves the way to further functionally characterize NK cells ultimately aimed to improve cancer immunotherapy.",

However, evaporation is a critical problem in such platforms, hindering their wide‐range applications in various fields. This study aims to develop a functional sessile LM system for long‐term 3D cell culture. Previously, this study group and others demonstrated that floating LM‐based bioreactors could reduce the evaporation rate, and were thus suitable for growing multicellular spheroids. However, floating LMs are not robust and easily collapse. Herein, an evaporation‐reducing sessile LM by embedding LM with agarose gel is proposed. Through a series of comprehensive mathematical modeling, numerical simulations, and experimental investigations (both with and without biological cells), it is shown that such a platform acts as a moisture absorption system to control the evaporation and thus extends the life span of LMs. It is also found that unlike pure LMs, the LMs filled with agarose maintain their spherical shapes within 72 h inside a humidified incubator. Moreover, the presence of agarose significantly contributes to minimizing evaporation and improves the viability of the harvested multicellular spheroids. These results can open up a new avenue in using LMs in life sciences and chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Cytotoxicity assessment has great importance in both research and pharmaceutical development. The mainstream in vitro cytotoxicity assays are mostly biochemical assays that evaluate a specific cellular activity such as proliferation and apoptosis. Few assays assess toxicity by characterizing overall functional outcomes in cellular physiology such as multicellular morphogenesis. The intrinsic cellular chiral bias (also known as cell chirality, left-right asymmetry, or handedness), which determines cellular polarization along the left-right axis, is demonstrated to play important roles in development and disease. This chiral property of cells gives insights not only into functions of individual cells, such as motility and polarity but also into emerging behaviors of cell clusters, such as collective cell migration. Therefore, cell chirality characterization can be potentially used as a biomarker for assessing the overall effects of pharmaceutical drugs and environmental factors on the health of the cell. In this review article, the current in vitro techniques for cell chirality characterization and their applications are discussed and the advantages and limitations of these cell chirality assays as potential tools for detecting cytotoxicity are discussed.",

The topographical anisotropy and mechanical stiffness of the substrates are the main physical cues that affect leukocytes’ shape generation and migratory responses. However, their combined effects on the cell morphology and motility have been poorly understood, particularly for neutrophils, which are the fastest reacting leukocytes against infections and wounds. Here, spatiotemporally correlated physical parameters are shown, which determine the neutrophil shape change during migratory processes, in response to surface topography and elasticity. Guided crawling and shape generation of individual neutrophils, activated by a uniform concentration of a chemoattractant, are analyzed by adopting elasticity‐tunable micropatterning and live cell imaging techniques. Whole cell‐level image analysis is performed based on a planar geometric quantification of cell shape and motility. The findings show that the pattern anisotropy and elastic modulus of the substrate induce synergic effects on the shape anisotropy, deformability, and polarization/alignment of crawling neutrophils. How the morphology–motility relationship is affected by different surface microstructures and stiffness is demonstrated. These results imply that the neutrophil shape‐motility correlations can be utilized for controlling the immune cell functions with predefined physical microenvironments.",

Clues of the exact sequence of events are beginning to emerge. Recent metagenomics analyses has uncovered the Asgard super‐phylum as the closest yet known archaea host of eukaryotes. Some of these have been tested and confirmed experimentally. However, the bulk of eukaryotic signature proteins predicted to be encoded by the Asgard super‐phylum have not been studied, and their true functions, at least in the context of a eukaryotic cell, are still elusive. For example, there are several different variants of the profilin within each Asgardian Achaea, and there are some conflicting results of their actual roles. Here, the 3D structure of profilin from Thorarchaeota is determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and shows that this profilin has a eukaryotic‐like profilin with a rigid core and an extended N‐terminus previously implicated in polyproline binding. In addition, it is also shown that Thorarchaeota Profilin co‐localizes with eukaryotic actin in cultured HeLa cells. This finding reaffirms the notion that Asgardian encoded proteins possess eukaryotic‐like characteristics and strengthen the likely existence of a complex cytoskeleton already in a last eukaryotic common ancestor.",

Preterm infants face unique environmental impacts on their newly acquired microbiomes, including increased incidence of cesarean section delivery and exposure to antibiotics as well as delayed enteral feeding and reduced human interaction during their intensive care unit stay. Using contextualized paired metabolomics and 16S sequencing data, the development of the gut, skin, and oral microbiomes of infants is profiled daily for the first week after birth, and it is found that the skin microbiome appears robust to early life perturbation, while direct exposure of infants to antibiotics, rather than presumed maternal transmission, delays microbiome development and prevents the early differentiation based on body site regardless of delivery mode. Metabolomic analyses identify the development of all gut metabolomes of preterm infants toward full‐term infant profiles, but a significant increase of primary bile acid metabolism only in the non‐antibiotic treated vaginally birthed late preterm infants. This study provides a framework for future multi‐omic, multibody site analyses on these high‐risk preterm infant populations and suggests opportunities for monitoring and intervention, with infant antibiotic exposure as the primary driver of delays in microbiome development.",

Hence, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data are analyzed to gain detailed insights. Initially, two ceRNA networks with 19 and 3 differentially expressed (DE) hub lncRNAs are reconstructed in SARS-CoV-2 infected Frontal Cortex (FC) and Choroid Plexus (CP), respectively. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses of downstream mRNAs of deregulated ceRNA axes demonstrate impairment of neurological processes. Mapping of hub lncRNA-mRNA pairs from bulk RNA-seq with snRNA-seq data has indicated that NORAD, NEAT1, and STXBP5-AS1 are downregulated across 4, 4, and 2 FC cell types, respectively. At the same time, MIRLET7BHG and MALAT1 are upregulated in excitatory neurons of FC and neurons of CP, respectively. Here, it is hypothesized that downregulation of NORAD, NEAT1, and STXBP5-AS1, and upregulation of MIRLET7BHG and MALAT1 might deregulate respectively 51, 6, and 37, and 31 and 19 mRNAs in cell types of FC and CP. Afterward, 13 therapeutic miRNAs are traced that might safeguard against deregulated lncRNA-mRNA pairs of NORAD, NEAT1, and MIRLET7BHG in FC.

This study compares the structural and compositional differences between bone apatite clusters formed in intramembranous (IO) and endochondral ossification (EO). Calvaria (IO) and femurs (EO) are isolated from mice at embryonic days (E) 14.5 to 15.5 and post‐natal days (P) 6 to 7, respectively. Results show that the initially formed bone apatite clusters in EO (≅1.2 µm 2 ) are &gt;10 times larger than those in IO (≅0.1 µm 2 ), without significant changes in ion composition. In IO (E14.5 calvarium), early minerals are formed inside matrix vesicles (MVs). In contrast, in EO (P6 femur epiphysis), no MVs are observed, and chondrocyte‐derived plasma membrane nanofragments (PMNFs) are the nucleation site for mineralization. Apatite cluster size difference is linked with the different nucleation sites. Moreover, an alkaline pH and slow P supply into a Ca‐rich microenvironment are suggested to facilitate apatite cluster growth, as demonstrated in a biomimetic mineralization system. Together, the results reveal for the first time the distinct and exquisite microstructures of bone apatite clusters in IO and EO, and provide insightful inspirations for the design of more efficient materials for bone tissue engineering and repair.",

The interaction with the oviductal epithelium, as a site of sperm storage, is one type of cell‐to‐cell interaction that serves as a selection mechanism. Abnormal sperm cells with poor swimming performance, the major cause of male infertility, are filtered out by this selection mechanism. In this study, collinear bundles, consisting of two sperm cells, generate propulsive thrusts along opposite directions and allow to observe the influence of cell‐to‐cell interaction on flagellar wave‐patterns. The developed elasto‐hydrodynamic model demonstrates that steric and adhesive forces lead to highly symmetrical wave‐pattern and reduce the bending amplitude of the propagating wave. It is measured that the free cells exhibit a mean flagellar curvature of 6.4 ± 3.5 rad mm ‐1 and a bending amplitude of 13.8 ± 2.8 rad mm ‐1 . After forming the collinear bundle, the mean flagellar curvature and bending amplitude are decreased to 1.8 ± 1.1 and 9.6 ± 1.4 rad mm ‐1 , respectively. This study presents consistent theoretical and experimental results important for understanding the adaptive behavior of sperm cells to the external time‐periodic force encountered during sperm–egg interaction.",

The superior properties of ORs have led to the development of OR‐based biosensors that have shown promising potential in many applications over the past two decades. In particular, newly designed technologies in gene synthesis, protein expression, solubilization, purification, and membrane mimetics for membrane proteins have greatly opened up the previously inaccessible industrial potential of ORs. In this review, gene design, expression and solubilization strategies, and purification and reconstitution methods available for modern industrial applications are examined, with a focus on ORs. The limitations of current OR production technology are also estimated, and future directions for further progress are suggested.",

The IBD-mouse model is established by replacing normal water intake with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) aqueous solution, and 50 mg kg-1 of AKBA treatment is administered. The experimental mice are randomly divided into four groups, including control, AKBA , DSS, and DSS + AKBA groups. AKBA therapy conspicuously ameliorates the adverse symptoms caused by DSS in mice and inhibits the reduction of colon length and the rise of disease activity index score. Hematoxylin-eosin staining results suggest that AKBA strikingly improves the pathological conditions of the colon and small intestine tissues in IBD mice. AKBA prominently inhibits the DSS-induced increase of proinflammatory factor contents and the upregulation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways' protein levels in the colon tissues of IBD mice. AKBA alleviates DSS-induced colonic inflammatory injury in IBD mice by repressing the activation of the JNK-p38/MAPK and NF-κB pathways.",

Here is explored the paradigm shift of creating a rapid and purification‐free assay in picoliter drops where the antibody is expressed from coding DNA and its binding to antigens concomitantly characterized in situ. Efficient synthesis in bulk of various functional variable domains of heavy‐chain only antibodies (VHH) using reconstituted cell‐free expression media, including an anti‐green fluorescent protein VHH, is shown first. A microfluidic device is then used to generate monodisperse drops (30 pL) containing all the assay components, including a capture scaffold, onto which the accumulation of VHH:antigen produces a specific fluorescent signal. This allows to assess, in parallel or sequentially at high throughput (500 Hz), the VHH‐antigen binding and its specificity in less than 3 h, directly from a VHH‐coding DNA, for multiple VHH sequences, various antigens and down to DNA concentrations as low as 12 plasmids per drop. It is anticipated that the ultraminiaturized format, robustness, and programmability of this novel cell‐free immunoassay concept will constitute valuable assets in fields as diverse as antibody discovery, point‐of‐care diagnostics, synthetic biology, and/or bioanalytical assays.",

However, it remains unclear how anisotropic topography promotes the transition of collective to disseminated cell migration. This study applies a collective cell migration model with and without 800 nm wide aligned nanogrooves parallel, perpendicular, or diagonal to the cell migration direction. After 120 hour migration, MCF7‐GFP‐H2B‐mCherry breast cancer cells display more disseminated cells at the migration front on parallel topography than on other topographies. Notably, a fluid‐like collective motion with high vorticity is enhanced at the migration front on parallel topography. Furthermore, high vorticity but not velocity is correlated with disseminated cell numbers on parallel topography. Enhanced collective vortex motion colocalizes with cell monolayer defects where cells extend protrusions into the free space, suggesting that topography‐driven cell crawling for defect closure promotes the collective vortex motion. In addition, elongated cell morphology and frequent protrusions induced by topography may further contribute to the collective vortex motion. Overall, a high‐vorticity collective motion at the migration front promoted by parallel topography suggests a cause of the transition of collective to disseminated cell migration.",

Whether inhibition of mitochondrial fission benefits from the early treatment of hemorrhagic shock under a hot environment is unclear. An uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock model in rats is used, and the effects of mitochondrial fission inhibitor mdivi‐1 on mitochondrial function, organ function, and survival rate of rats are measured. The results show that 0.1–3 mg/kg mdivi‐1 antagonizes hemorrhagic shock‐induced mitochondrial fragment. In addition, mdivi‐1 improves mitochondrial function, and alleviates hemorrhagic shock‐induced oxidative stress and inflammation under a hot environment. Further studies show that 0.1–3 mg/kg Mdivi‐1 reduces blood loss, and maintains a mean artery pressure (MAP) of 50–60 mmHg before bleeding‐stops after hemorrhagic shock, compared with single Lactate Ringer's (LR) resuscitation. Notably, 1 mg/kg of Mdivi‐1 extends the time of hypotensive resuscitation to 2–3 h. During 1 or 2 h of ligation, Mdivi‐1 prolongs survival time and protects vital organ function by rescuing mitochondrial morphology and improving mitochondrial function. These results suggest Mdivi‐1 is suitable for the early treatment of hemorrhagic shock under a hot environment and can extend the golden treatment time to 2–3 hour for hemorrhagic shock under a hot environment.",

To accelerate candidate material selection and overcome the disconnect between conventional 2D cell culture and in vivo findings, screening platforms unifying high‐throughput with physiologically relevant endpoint analysis based on 3D in vitro models are promising. Here, a 3D tumor spheroid co‐culture model based on cancerous and healthy human cells is presented for the concurrent assessment of radio‐enhancement efficacy, toxicity, and intratissural biodistribution with full ultrastructural context of radioenhancer candidate materials. Its potential for rapid candidate materials screening is showcased based on the example of nano‐sized metal–organic frameworks (nMOFs) and direct benchmarking against gold nanoparticles (the current “gold standard”). Dose enhancement factors (DEFs) ranging between 1.4 and 1.8 are measured for Hf‐, Ti‐, TiZr‐, and Au‐based materials in 3D tissues and are overall lower than in 2D cell cultures, where DEF values exceeding 2 are found. In summary, the presented co‐cultured tumor spheroid—healthy fibroblast model with tissue‐like characteristics may serve as high‐throughput platform enabling rapid, cell line‐specific endpoint analysis for therapeutic efficacy and toxicity assessment, as well as accelerated radio‐enhancer candidate screening.",

However, commonly used patterning methods have difficulties in generating antibody arrays with both high resolution and multiplexity, limiting their applications. Here, a convenient and versatile technique for the patterning of multiple antibodies with resolution down to 20 µm is reported using micropillar‐focused droplet printing and microcontact printing. Droplets of antibody solutions are first printed and stably confined on the micropillars of a stamp, and then the antibodies absorbed on the micropillars are contact‐printed to the target substrate, generating antibody patterns faithfully replicating the micropillar array. The effect of different parameters on the patterning results is investigated, including hydrophobicity of the stamps, override time of the droplet printing, incubation time, and the diameters of the capillary tips and micropillars. To demonstrate the utility of the method, multiplex arrays of anti‐EpCAM and anti‐CD68 antibodies is generated to capture breast cancer cells and macrophages, respectively, on the same substrate, and successful capturing of individual cell types and enrichment among the cells are achieved. It is envision that this method would serve as a versatile and useful protein patterning tool for biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is still controversy about whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) vaccination at different times of day will induce a stronger immune response. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial (ChiCTR2100045109) is conducted to investigate the impact of vaccination time on the antibody response to the inactivated vaccine against SARS‐CoV‐2 from April 15 to 28, 2021. Participants are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive inactivated SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine in the morning or afternoon. The primary endpoint is the change of neutralizing antibody between baseline and 28 days after the second dose. In total, 503 participants are randomized, and 469 participants (238 in the morning group and 231 in the afternoon group) complete the follow‐up. There is no significant difference in the change of neutralizing antibody between baseline and 28 days after the second dose between the morning and afternoon groups (22.2 [13.2, 45.0] AU mL −1 vs 22.0 [14.4, 40.7] AU mL −1 , P = 0.873). In prespecified age and sex subgroup analyses, there is also no significant difference in the morning and afternoon group (all P &gt; 0.05). This study demonstrates that the vaccination time does not affect the antibody response of two doses of inactivated SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine.",

Combination therapy has proven to be a promising strategy for enhancing TNBC treatment efficacy. Toosendanin (TSN), a plant-derived triterpenoid, has shown pleiotropic effects against a variety of tumors. Herein, it is evaluated whether TSN can enhance the efficacy of paclitaxel (PTX), a common chemotherapeutic agent, against TNBC. It is found that TSN and PTX synergistically suppress the proliferation of TNBC cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 and BT-549, and the combined treatment also inhibits the colony formation and induces cell apoptosis. Furthermore, this combination shows more marked migratory inhibition when compared to PTX alone. Mechanistic study shows that the ADORA2A pathway in TNBC is down-regulated by the combination treatment via mediating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In addition, the combined treatment of TSN and PTX significantly attenuates the tumor growth when compared to PTX monotherapy in a mouse model bearing 4T1 tumor. The results suggest that combination of TSN and PTX is superior to PTX alone, suggesting that it may be a promising alternative adjuvant chemotherapy strategy for patients with TNBC, especially those with metastatic TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This work hypothesizes that some genes undergo radically changed transcription regulations (TRs) in breast cancer (BC), but don't show differential expressions for unknown reasons. The TR of a gene is quantitatively formulated by a regression model between the expression of this gene and multiple transcription factors (TFs). The difference between the predicted and real expression levels of a gene in a query sample is defined as the mqTrans value of this gene, which quantitatively reflects its regulatory changes. This work systematically screens the undifferentially expressed genes with differentially expressed mqTrans values in 1036 samples across five datasets and three ethnic groups. This study calls the 25 genes satisfying the above hypothesis in at least four datasets as dark biomarkers, and the strong dark biomarker gene CXXC5 (CXXC Finger Protein 5) is even supported by all the five independent BC datasets. Although CXXC5 does not show differential expressions in BC, its transcription regulations show quantitative associations with BCs in diversified cohorts. The overlapping long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may have contributed their transcripts to the expression miscalculations of dark biomarkers. The mqTrans analysis serves as a complementary view of the transcriptome‐based detections of biomarkers that are ignored by many existing studies.",

The renal anti-senescence effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and metformin have been proven in diabetic settings, but the roles of each one and combination of two drugs in natural kidney aging process remain undefined and deserve further research. Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) were orally administered dapagliflozin, metformin, and a combination of them for 16 weeks. Dapagliflozin exhibits better effects than metformin in lowering senescence related markers, and the combination therapy shows the best results. In vitro experiments demonstrate the same results that the combination of dapagliflozin and metformin can exert a better anti-senescence effect. Blood metabolites detection in vivo shows dapagliflozin mainly leads to the change of blood metabolites enriched in choline metabolism, and metformin tends to induce change of blood metabolites enriched in purine metabolism. In conclusion, the results suggest dapagliflozin may have a better renal anti-senescence effect than metformin in non-diabetes environment, and the combination of the two drugs can strengthen the effect.

However, the primary site of disease origin and initial mechanisms involved in the development of allergic airway inflammation (AAI) is not yet understood. Therefore, the initial contributing organs and mechanisms involved in the development of AAI are investigated using a mouse model of asthma. This study, without a local allergen challenge into the lungs, demonstrates a significant increase in intestinal inflammation with signature type-2 mediators including IL-4, IL-13, STAT6, eosinophils, and Th2 cells. In addition, gut leakage and mRNA expressions of gut leakage markers significantly increase in the intestine. Moreover, reduced mRNA expressions of tight junction proteins are observed in gut and interestingly, in lung tissues. Furthermore, in lung tissues, an increased pulmonary barrier permeability and IL-4 and IL-13 levels associated with significant increase of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP-gut leakage marker) and eosinophils are observed. However, with local allergen challenges into the lungs, these mechanisms are further enhanced in both gut and lungs. In conclusion, the primary gut originated inflammatory responses translocates into the lungs to orchestrate AAI in a mouse model of asthma.",

Dangui Huoxue Preparation (DHP) is a clinically effective traditional Chinese herbal formula for the treatment of SSc in the hospital. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of DHP in the treatment of SSc. SSc mice models are induced by bleomycin (BLM). Tissues of DHP group, normal control group, and positive control drug Sanqi Tongshu Capsule (STC) group are collected for inflammation, fibrosis, and vasculopathy. Also, the human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) stimulated with TGF‐β1 are analyzed for in vitro study. The expression levels of MCP‐1, IFN‐γ, IL‐1β, IL‐10, Fizz1, iNOS, and IL12p40, and the mRNA levels of Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, and Col5a1 are significantly decreased in all DHP groups and STC group compare with those in the BLM group. The main drug of DHP inhibits the proliferation and migration of HDF, reduces Ctgf, Itgb3, Itgb5 expression, and also inhibits the Smad3 pathway. In conclusion, DHP can ameliorate SSc skin inflammation, fibrosis, and vasculopathy, possibly suppressing the TGF‐β1/Smad3 signaling pathway through extracellular and intracellular mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, there has been growing concern over the rising incidence of liver diseases, with increasing exposure to environmental toxins as a significant contributing factor. However, the mechanisms of liver injury induced by environmental pollutants are largely unclear. Here, using tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), a widely used brominated flame retardant, as an example, environmental toxin‐induced liver toxicity in mice is characterized via single‐cell sequencing technology. Heterogeneous gene expression profiles after exposure to TBBPA in major cell types of the liver are demonstrated. In hepatocytes, pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes reveals the enhanced interferon response and diminished metabolic processes. The disrupted endothelial functions in TBBPA‐treated cells are then shown. Moreover, the activation of M2‐polarization in Kupffer cells, as well as activated effector T and B cells are unveiled in TBBPA‐treated cells. Finally, ligand‐receptor pair analysis shows that TBBPA disrupts cell‐cell communication and induces an inflammatory microenvironment. Overall, the results reveal that TBBPA‐induced dysfunction of hepatocytes and endothelial cells may then activate and recruit other immune cells such as Kuffer cells, and T/NK cells into the liver, further increasing inflammatory response and liver injury. Thus, the results provide novel insight into undesiring environmental pollutant‐induced liver injury.",

A total of 502 HIV/AIDS patients are randomized to the training cohort and evaluation cohort. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis are performed to identify the indicators and establish the nomogram for predicting the immune reconstitution. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve (CIC) are used to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the nomogram. Predictive factors included white blood cells (WBC), baseline CD4 + T‐cell counts (baseline CD4), ratio of effector regulatory T cells to resting regulatory T cells (eTreg/rTreg) and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and are incorporated into the nomogram. The area under the curve (AUC) is 0.812 (95% CI, 0.767∼0.851) and 0.794 (95%CI, 0.719∼0.857) in the training cohort and evaluation cohort, respectively. The calibration curve shows a high consistency between the predicted and actual observations. Moreover, DCA and CIC indicate that the nomogram has a superior net benefit in predicting poor immune reconstitution. A simple‐to‐use nomogram containing four routinely collected variables is developed and internally evaluated and can be used to predict the poor immune reconstitution in HIV/AIDS patients after ART.",

These techniques enhance the stability, biological activity, target‐binding capacity, and controlled release of EVs at specific cells and tissues. The diverse origins of cardioprotective EVs are covered, and the applications of cardiac‐targeting EV delivery systems in protecting against cardiovascular diseases are discussed.

The effect of EMS on the dynamics of the aneuploid genome, increased cellular instability, and carcinogenicity in relation to benign and malignant tumors are reported, but the molecular level understanding of morphological changes of higher‐order chromatin structure has poorly been understood. This is due to a lack of sufficient resolution in conventional microscopic techniques to see small structures below the diffraction limit. Here, using super‐resolution radial fluctuation, a largely fragmented, decompaction, and less dense heterochromatin structure upon EMS treatment to HEK 293A cells without any change in nuclear DNA domains is observed. This result suggests an early stage of carcinogenicity happened due to the point mutation. In addition, the distinct structural changes with an elongated morphology of lysosomes are also observed.

The tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) receptor that is expressed on these cells plays key roles in mediating the survival and differentiation of neural progenitors as well as in the regulation of the growth and regeneration of different neural systems. In this study, the OptoTrkA system is introduced, which is able to stimulate TrkA activity via blue‐light illumination in HSCs. This allows to determine whether TrkA signaling is capable of influencing the proliferation, migration, and neural differentiation of these somatic stem cells. It is found that OptoTrkA is able to activate downstream molecules such as ERK and AKT with blue‐light illumination, and subsequently able to terminate this kinase activity in the dark. HSCs with OptoTrkA activity show an increased ability for proliferation and migration and also exhibited accelerated neuronal and glial cell differentiation. These findings suggest that the precise control of TrkA activity using optogenetic tools is a viable strategy for the regeneration of neurons from HSCs, and also provides a novel insight into the clinical application of optogenetic tools in cell‐transplantation therapy.",

In the current perspective a historical context for the discovery of the extracellular cAMP is provided. The story of extracellular cAMP through investigations addressing the molecule's role in the adenosine pathway is followed, which is widespread in mammalian physiology. The adenosine pathway mediates normal physiological conditions such as renin release, phosphate transport, etc., and participates in pathological conditions such as bronchoconstriction of the airways. Furthermore, adenosine mediated biological pathways are regulated via the receptor mediated intracellular cAMP pathway in mammalian cells. It then speculates on the question of whether cAMP enriched EVs could bypass typical receptor mediated cell signaling and directly activate cAMP signaling cascade in target cells. Preliminary studies to suggest cAMP enriched EVs are provided, added to naïve endothelial cells, results in an increase in intracellular cAMP. An alternate mechanism is proposed, apart from the traditional adenosine pathway, that extracellular cAMP may exert its effects and put into perspective how it might consider circulating cAMP moving forward.",

Rapid advances in the technology of single‐cell sequencing offer a perfectly useful tool to fulfill this purpose. Despite its great promise, single‐cell sequencing is highly interdisciplinary, and successful applications in specific biological contexts require a general understanding of its diversity as well as the advantage versus limitations for each of its variants. Here, the technological principles of single‐cell sequencing are consolidated and its applications in the study of embryonic development are summarized. First, the technology basics are presented and the available tools for each step including cell isolation, library construction, sequencing, and data analysis are discussed. Then, the works that employed single‐cell sequencing are reviewed to investigate the specific processes of embryonic development, including preimplantation, peri‐implantation, gastrulation, and organogenesis.

Although HRD possibly triggers the production of numerous tumor neoantigens that sufficiently stimulate and activate various tumor‐immune responses, a comprehensive understanding of the HRD‐associated tumor microenvironment is elusive. To investigate the effect of HRD on the selective enrichment of transcriptomic signatures, 294 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas‐Ovarian Cancer project with both RNA‐sequencing and SNP array data are analyzed. Differentially expressed gene analysis and network analysis are performed to identify HRD‐specific signatures. Gene‐sets associated with mitochondrial activation, including enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), are significantly enriched in the HRD‐high group. Furthermore, a wide range of immune cell activation signatures is enriched in HRD‐high cases of high‐grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). On further cell‐type‐specific analysis, M1‐like macrophage genes are significantly enriched in HRD‐high HGSOC cases, whereas M2‐macrophage‐related genes are not. The immune‐response‐associated genomic features, including tumor mutation rate, neoantigens, and tumor mutation burdens, correlated with HRD scores. In conclusion, the results of this study highlight the biological properties of HRD, including enhanced energy metabolism, increased tumor neoantigens and tumor mutation burdens, and consequent exacerbation of immune responses, particularly the enrichment of M1‐like macrophages in HGSOC cases.",

In the past decades, various stomatal models with different functions have been established to investigate and predict stomatal behavior and its association with plants' responses to the changing climate, but with limited biological information provided. On the other hand, many stomatal models at the molecular level focus on simulating and predicting molecular practices and ignore the dynamic quantitative information. As a result, stomatal models are often divided between the microscopic and macroscopic scales. Quantitative systems analysis offers an effective in silico approach to explore the link between microscopic gene function and macroscopic physiological traits. As a first step, a systems model, OnGuard, is developed for the investigation of guard cell ion homeostasis and its relevance to the dynamic stomatal movements. The system model has already yielded a series of important predictions to guide molecular physiological studies in stomata. It also exhibits great potential in breeding practice, which represents a key step toward \"Breeding by design\" of improving plant carbon-water use efficiency.

    "abstract": "The incidence of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and HCC-related deaths have remarkably increased over the recent decades. It has been reported that β-catenin activation can be frequently observed in HCC cases. This study identified the integrin-linked kinase-associated phosphatase (ILKAP) as a novel β-catenin-interacting protein. ILKAP is localized both in the nucleus and cytoplasm and regulates the WNT pathway in different ways. First, it is demonstrated that ILKAP activates the WNT pathway in HCC cells by increasing the protein level of β-catenin and other proteins associated with the WNT signaling, such as c-Myc and CyclinD1. Next, it is shown that ILKAP promotes the metastasis of HCC both in vitro and in vivo in a zebrafish xenograft model. It is also found that ILKAP dephosphorylates the GSK3β and CK1, contributing to the reduced ubiquitination of β-catenin. Furthermore, it is identified that ILKAP functions by mediating binding between TCF4 and β-catenin to enhance expression of WNT target genes. Taken together, the study demonstrates a critical function of ILKAP in metastasis of HCC, since ILKAP is crucial for the activation of the WNT pathway via stabilization of β-catenin and increased binding between TCF4 and β-catenin.",

    "abstract": "Antibacterial properties are desirable in wound dressings. Silks, among many material formats, have been investigated for use in wound care. However, the antibacterial properties of liquid silk are poorly understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the inherent antibacterial properties of a Bombyx mori silk fibroin solution. Silk fibroin solutions containing ≥ 4% w/v silk fibroin do not support the growth of two common wound pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When liquid silk is added to a wound pad and placed on inoculated culture plates mimicking wound fluid, silk is bacteriostatic. Viability tests of the bacterial cells in the presence of liquid silk show that cells remain intact within the silk but could not be cultured. Liquid silk appears to provide a hostile environment for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa and inhibits growth without disrupting the cell membrane. This effect can be beneficial for wound healing and supports future healthcare applications for silk. This observation also indicates that liquid silk stored prior to processing is unlikely to experience microbial spoilage.",

However, effective therapeutics are lacking. Therefore, the study examines the effect of doxazosin on liver fibrosis. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) is injected into mice to establish a liver fibrosis model. Doxazosin (5 and 10 mg/kg) is administered daily by gavage. HE staining, Masson staining, Sirius Red staining, scanning electron microscopy, western blotting, real‐time PCR, and immunofluorescence analysis are performed to estimate liver fibrosis and sinusoidal capillarization in mice. Cell Counting Kit‐8 assays, western blotting, immunofluorescence analysis, tube formation, and transwell migration assays are performed on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HHSECs) to elucidate the potential mechanism of doxazosin. Doxazosin alleviates liver fibrosis and sinusoidal capillarization in CCl 4 ‐induced mice. Angiogenesis is attenuated by doxazosin in HUVECs and HHSECs. This study demonstrates that doxazosin attenuated liver fibrosis by alleviating sinusoidal capillarization and liver angiogenesis.",

The underlying rationale is based on a neural coupling mechanism that governs the coordinated movements of the arms and legs during walking, and that the excitability of these neural pathways can be exploited by actively engaging the arms during locomotor training. Self-assistive treadmill walking rehabilitation devices are envisioned as an approach that would allow an individual to actively use their arms to help the legs during walking.

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the intricate processes of neuronal growth, degeneration, and neurotoxicity is paramount for unraveling nervous system function and holds significant promise in improving patient outcomes, especially in the context of chemotherapy‐induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). These processes are influenced by a broad range of entwined events facilitated by chemical, electrical, and mechanical signals. The progress of each process is inherently linked to phenotypic changes in cells. Currently, the primary means of demonstrating morphological changes rely on measurements of neurite outgrowth and axon length. However, conventional techniques for monitoring these processes often require extensive preparation to enable manual or semi‐automated measurements. Here, a label‐free and non‐invasive approach is employed for monitoring neuronal differentiation and degeneration using quantitative phase imaging (QPI). Operating on unlabeled specimens and offering little to no phototoxicity and photobleaching, QPI delivers quantitative maps of optical path length delays that provide an objective measure of cellular morphology and dynamics. This approach enables the visualization and quantification of axon length and other physical properties of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal cells, allowing greater understanding of neuronal responses to stimuli simulating CIPN conditions. This research paves new avenues for the development of more effective strategies in the clinical management of neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Various cancer models have been developed to aid the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of tumor development and evaluate the effectiveness of various anticancer drugs in preclinical studies. These models accurately reproduce the critical stages of tumor initiation and development to mimic the tumor microenvironment better. Using these models for target validation, tumor response evaluation, resistance modeling, and toxicity comprehension can significantly enhance the drug development process. Herein, various in vivo or animal models are presented, typically consisting of several mice and in vitro models ranging in complexity from transwell models to spheroids and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies. While in vitro models have been used for decades and dominate the early stages of drug development, they are still limited primary to simplistic tests based on testing on a single cell type cultivated in Petri dishes. Recent advancements in developing new cancer therapies necessitate the generation of complicated animal models that accurately mimic the tumor's complexity and microenvironment. Mice make effective tumor models as they are affordable, have a short reproductive cycle, exhibit rapid tumor growth, and are simple to manipulate genetically. Human cancer mouse models are crucial to understanding the neoplastic process and basic and clinical research improvements. The following review summarizes different in vitro and in vivo metastasis models, their advantages and disadvantages, and their ability to serve as a model for cancer research.",

Herein, biomaterial‐based systems and metabolic labeling are utilized to evaluate how skeletal muscle stem cells deposit extracellular matrix. Muscle stem cells and committed myoblasts are observed to generate less nascent matrix than muscle resident fibro‐adipogenic progenitors. When cultured on substrates that matched the stiffness of physiological uninjured and injured muscles, muscle stem cells increased nascent matrix deposition with activation kinetics. Reducing the ability to deposit nascent matrix by an inhibitor of vesicle trafficking (Exo‐1) attenuated muscle stem cell function and mimicked impairments observed from muscle stem cells isolated from old muscles. Old muscle stem cells are observed to deposit less nascent matrix than young muscle stem cells, which is rescued with therapeutic supplementation of insulin‐like growth factors. These results highlight the role of nascent matrix production with muscle stem cell activation.",

While many methods to detect this loss have been developed, enhancing the field, these existing methods often suffer from being labor‐intensive, expensive, and not sufficiently sensitive. To bridge this gap, a novel and more efficient technique is developed, named the SinChro assay. This method employs multiplexed single‐cell droplet PCR, designed to detect cells with sex chromosome loss at single‐cell resolution. Through the SinChro assay, the age‐dependent increase in Y chromosome loss in male blood is successfully mapped. The age‐dependent loss of the X chromosome in female blood is also identified, a finding that has been challenging with existing methods. The advent of the SinChro assay marks a significant breakthrough in the study of age‐related sex mosaicism. Its utility extends beyond blood analysis, applicable to a variety of tissues, and it holds the potential to deepen the understanding of biological aging and related diseases.",

Tissue Resident Macrophages in lung constitutes the important defense against external pathogens. Macrophages connects the innate and adaptive immune system, and also plays important roles in carcinogenesis and cancer immunotherapy. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer‐related death worldwide, with an overall five‐year survival rate of only 21%. Macrophages that infiltrate or aggregate in lung tumor microenvironment are defined as tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs are the main components of immune cells in the lung tumor microenvironment. The differentiation and maturation process of TAMs can be roughly divided into two different types: classical activation pathway produces M1 tumor‐associated macrophages, and bypass activation pathway produces M2 tumor‐associated macrophages. Studies have found that TAMs are related to tumor invasion, metastasis, and treatment resistance, and show potential as a new target for tumor immunotherapy. Therefore, the biological function of macrophages in lung and the role of TAMs in the occurrence, development, and treatment of lung cancer are discussed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Triptolide (TP), an active component isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TWHF), shows great promise for treating inflammation-related diseases. However, its potential nephrotoxic effects remain concerning. The mechanism underlying TP-induced nephrotoxicity is inadequately elucidated, particularly at single-cell resolution. Hence, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of kidney tissues from control and TP-treated mice is performed to generate a thorough description of the renal cell atlas upon TP treatment. Heterogeneous responses of nephron epithelial cells are observed after TP exposure, attributing differential susceptibility of cell subtypes to excessive reactive oxygen species and increased inflammatory responses. Moreover, TP disrupts vascular function by activating endothelial cell immunity and damaging fibroblasts. Severe immune cell damage and the activation of pro-inflammatory Macro_C1 cells are also observed with TP treatment. Additionally, ligand-receptor crosstalk analysis reveals that the SPP1 (osteopontin) signaling pathway targeting Macro_C1 cells is triggered by TP treatment, which may promote the infiltration of Macro_C1 cells to exacerbate renal toxicity. Overall, this study provides comprehensive information on the transcriptomic profiles and cellular composition of TP-associated nephrotoxicity at single-cell resolution, which can strengthen the understanding of the pathogenesis of TP-induced nephrotoxicity and provide valuable clues for the discovery of new therapeutic targets to ameliorate TP-associated nephrotoxicity.",

Astrocytes, the main glia in the spinal cord, become reactive following SCI and contribute to adverse outcomes. The anti‐inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFβ3) has been shown to mitigate astrocyte reactivity; however, the effects of prolonged TGFβ3 exposure on reactive astrocyte phenotype have not yet been explored. This study investigates whether magnetic core‐shell electrospun fibers can be used to alter the release rate of TGFβ3 using externally applied magnetic fields, with the eventual application of tailored drug delivery based on SCI severity. Magnetic core‐shell fibers are fabricated by incorporating superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) into the shell and TGFβ3 into the core solution for coaxial electrospinning. Magnetic field stimulation increased the release rate of TGFβ3 from the fibers by 25% over 7 days and released TGFβ3 reduced gene expression of key astrocyte reactivity markers by at least twofold. This is the first study to magnetically deliver bioactive proteins from magnetic fibers and to assess the effect of sustained release of TGFβ3 on reactive astrocyte phenotype.",

Its main biological functions include promoting endothelial generation and migration through the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway and inhibiting the adhesion of inflammatory cells to ECs. In addition, it induces angiogenesis and promotes bone formation. Due to the excellent functions of Endomucin in the above aspects, it provides a new research target for the treatment of vascular inflammatory‐related diseases and bone diseases. Based on the current understanding of its function, the research of Endomucin mainly focuses on the above two diseases. As it is known, the progression of cancer is closely related to angiogenesis. Endomucin recently is found to be differentially expressed in a variety of tumors and correlated with survival rate. The biological role of Endomucin in cancer is opaque.

Diagnosis of ACS is complex and controversial due to the lack of standardized objective methods, which results in high rates of misdiagnosis/late diagnosis, leading to permanent neuro‐muscular damage. ACS pathophysiology is poorly understood at a cellular level due to the lack of physiologically relevant models. In this context, microfluidics organ‐on‐chip systems (OOCs) provide an exciting opportunity to investigate the cellular mechanisms of microvascular dysfunction that leads to ACS. In this article, the state‐of‐the‐art OOCs designs and strategies used to investigate microvasculature dysfunction mechanisms is reviewed. The differential effects of hemodynamic shear stress on endothelial cell characteristics such as morphology, permeability, and inflammation, all of which are altered during microvascular dysfunction is highlighted. The article then critically reviews the importance of microfluidics to investigate closely related microvascular pathologies that cause ACS. The article concludes by discussing potential biomarkers of ACS with a special emphasis on glycocalyx and providing a future perspective.",

Acute bouts of aerobic exercise are shown to improve PFC function, however, the acute effects of exercise on PFC oxygenation have not yet been examined in MCR. This study aims to characterize the PFC oxygenation responses during acute exercise in older adults with MCR. Nineteen older adults with MCR performed a submaximal cycling exercise protocol. Functional near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is used to measure concentrations of oxygenated (OxyHb) and deoxygenated (DeoxyHb) hemoglobin from the PFC. There is a trend for increased OxyHb concentrations and decreased DeooxyHb concentrations during exercise. Exercise also induced significant increases in ratings of perceived exertion (RPEs) and heart rate. A significant, positive correlation between PFC OxyHb and RPEs during the cycling exercise are also observed. The findings reveal that PFC oxygenation increases during exercise in an intensity‐dependent manner and the subjective perception of exertion is associated with the magnitude of PFC oxygenation. These results suggest that moderate‐intensity cycling exercise may have beneficial effects on increasing cerebral blood flow in the PFC of older adults with MCR.",

In this study, IRF4 is upregulated in periodontitis periodontal ligament tissues, as compared to healthy periodontal ligament tissues. IRF4 knockdown increases cell proliferation, decreases levels of tumor necrosis factor‐alpha, interleukin‐6, and interleukin‐8, enhances osteogenic activity, and increases the expression of RUNX family transcription factor 2, Collagen I, and Osteocalcin in PDLSCs. The opposite results are observed in IRF4 overexpressed PDLSCs. Additionally, GSEA shows that IRF4 activates the interleukin‐18 (IL‐18) signaling pathway. The expressions of IL‐18, B‐cell translocation gene 2, interleukin‐1beta, and caspase‐3 are decreased by IRF4 knockdown, while increased by IRF4 overexpression. IL‐18 overexpression eliminates the promoting effect of IRF4 knockdown on osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. In conclusion, IRF4 suppresses osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs by activating the IL‐18 signaling pathway.",

Despite significant efforts for early diagnosis of EAD, there is no existing approach that can predict EAD on the first post‐operative day. The aim is to define a metabolite‐based biomarker on the first day after LT complicated with EAD. Ten patients diagnosed with EAD and 26 non‐EAD are recruited for the study. A HPLC‐MS/MS is used to determine 14 amino acids and 15 bile acids serum concentration. Comparative analyses are conducted between EAD and non‐EAD groups. Arginine is identified as the most significant metabolite distinguishing the EAD and non‐EAD groups, and therefore, is identified as a potential biomarker of EAD. The optimal cut‐off value for arginine is 52.09 µmol L −1 , with an AUROC of 0.804 (95% confidence interval: 0.638–0.917, p &lt; 0.001), yielding a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 53.8%, and Youden index of 0.54, NPVof 100%, and PPV of 45.45%. In summary, the study indicated that targeted metabolomics analysis would be a promising strategy for discovering novel biomarkers to predict EAD. The identified arginine may be helpful in developing an objective diagnostic method for EAD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Longevity, the length of an organism's lifespan, is impacted by environmental factors, metabolic processes, and genetic determinants. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity by repairing oxidatively modified base lesions. Nei‐like DNA Glycosylase 1 (NEIL1), part of the BER pathway, is vital in repairing oxidative bases in G‐rich DNA regions, such as telomeres and promoters. Hence, in this comprehensive review, it have undertaken a meticulous investigation of the intricate association between NEIL1 and longevity. The analysis delves into the multifaceted aspects of the NEIL1 gene, its various RNA transcripts, and the diverse protein isoforms. In addition, a combination of bioinformatic analysis is conducted to identify NEIL1 mutations, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifications, as well as its lncRNA/pseudogene/circRNA‐miRNA‐mRNA regulatory network. The findings suggest that the normal function of NEIL1 is a significant factor in human health and longevity, with defects in NEIL1 potentially leading to various cancers and related syndromes, Alzheimer's disease, obesity, and diabetes.",

In this study, human myogenic progenitors (hMPs) cultured on electrospun fibrin microfiber bundles and evaluated the therapeutic potential of engineered hMP TEMGs in the treatment of murine tibialis anterior (TA) VML injuries is employed. In vitro, the hMP TEMGs express mature muscle markers by 21 days. Upon implantation into VML injuries, the hMP TEMGs enable remarkable regeneration. To further promote wound healing and myogenesis, human adipose‐derived stem/stromal cells (hASCs) as fibroadipogenic progenitor (FAP)‐like cells with the potential to secrete pro‐regenerative cytokines are incorporated. The impact of dose and timing of seeding the hASCs on in vitro myogenesis and VML recovery using hMP‐hASC TEMGs are investigated. The hASCs increase myogenesis of hMPs when co‐cultured at 5% hASCs: 95% hMPs and with delayed seeding. Upon implantation into immunocompromised mice, hMP‐hASC TEMGs increase cell survival, collagen IV deposition, and pro‐regenerative macrophage recruitment, but result in excessive adipose tissue growth after 28 days. These data demonstrate the interactions of hASCs and hMPs enhance myogenesis in vitro but there remains a need to optimize treatments to minimize adipogenesis and promote full therapeutic recovery following VML treatment.",

Mimicking protein‐mediated communication in artificial cells holds great promise to elucidate the underlying working principles, but remains challenging without the stimulus‐responsive regulatory machinery of living cells. Therefore, systems to precisely control when and where protein release occurs should be incorporated in artificial cells. Here, a light‐activatable TEV protease (LaTEV) is presented that enables spatiotemporal control over protein release from a coacervate‐based artificial cell platform. Due to the presence of Ni 2+ ‐nitrilotriacetic acid moieties within the coacervates, His‐tagged proteins are effectively sequestered into the coacervates. LaTEV is first photocaged, effectively blocking its activity. Upon activation by irradiation with 365 nm light, LaTEV cleaves the His‐tags from sequestered cargo proteins, resulting in their release. The successful blocking and activation of LaTEV provides control over protein release rate and triggerable protein release from specific coacervates via selective irradiation. Furthermore, light‐activated directional transfer of proteins between two artificial cell populations is demonstrated. Overall, this system opens up avenues to engineer light‐responsive protein‐mediated communication in artificial cell context, which can advance the probing of intercellular signaling and the development of protein delivery platforms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ferroptosis is a new type of cell death characterized by iron dependence and the excessive accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS) that has gradually become better characterized. There is sufficient evidence indicating that ferroptosis is associated with a variety of human life activities and diseases, such as tumor suppression, ischemic organ injury, and degenerative disorders. Notably, ferroptosis is also involved in the initiation and development of fibrosis in various organs, including liver fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, renal fibrosis, and cardiac fibrosis, which is usually irreversible and refractory. Although a large number of patients with fibrosis urgently need to be treated, the current treatment options are still limited and unsatisfactory. Organ fibrosis involves a series of complex and orderly processes, such as parenchymal cell damage, recruitment of inflammatory cells and activation of fibroblasts, which ultimately leads to the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and the formation of fibrosis. An increasing number of studies have confirmed the close association between these pathological processes and ferroptosis. This review summarizes the role and function of ferroptosis in fibrosis and proposes several potential therapeutic strategies and pathways based on ferroptosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Developing bioinspired materials to convert sunlight into electricity efficiently is paramount for sustainable energy production. Fluorescent proteins are promising candidates as photoactive materials due to their high fluorescence quantum yield and absorption extinction coefficients in aqueous media. However, developing artificial bioinspired photosynthetic systems requires a detailed understanding of molecular interactions and energy transfer mechanisms in the required operating conditions. Here, the supramolecular self‐assembly and photophysical properties of fluorescent proteins complexed with organic dyes are investigated in aqueous media. Supercharged mGreenLantern protein, mutated to have a charge of +22, is complexed together with anionic zinc phthalocyanines having 4 or 16 carboxylate groups. The structural characterization reveals a strong electrostatic interaction between the moieties, accompanied by partial conformational distortion of the protein structure, yet without compromising the mGreenLantern chromophore integrity as suggested by the lack of emission features related to the neutral form of the chromophore. The self‐assembled biohybrid shows a total quenching of protein fluorescence, in favor of an energy transfer process from the protein to the phthalocyanine, as demonstrated by fluorescence lifetime and ultrafast transient absorption measurements. These results provide insight into the rich photophysics of fluorescent protein–dye complexes, anticipating their applicability as water‐based photoactive materials.",

Here the role and the underlying mechanism of p21 activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in mouse oocyte meiosis is evaluated.

PAK4 has direct physical interaction with both mitogen‐activated protein kinases 1/2 (MEK1/2) and Paxillin, they are colocalized on the spindle structure during metaphases I and II. Phospho‐PAK4 is distributed beneath the cytoplasmic membrane and on the chromosomes, and colocalized with the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) proteins, Pericentrin and γ‐tubulin, as well as phosphor‐MEK1/2 and phosphor‐Paxillin on spindle poles.

Xiao‐Ban‐Xia decoction (XBXD), a classical anti‐emetic traditional Chinese medicine formula, is frequently used for the clinical treatment of CINV. This study used a cisplatin‐induced rat pica model to explore whether the anti‐emetic mechanism of XBXD in treating CINV is related to ferroptosis. The inflammatory damage of the gastrointestinal tract is evaluated by HE staining and ELISA. The degree of ferroptosis are validated by the iron deposition, the levels of ROS, MDA, and GSH, and the ultrastructure of mitochondria in the gastric antrum and ileum. The potential ferroptosis‐related targets of XBXD against CINV are screened by network pharmacology and further assessed by Western blot. XBXD significantly decreased the kaolin consumption in rats, and improved the inflammatory pathological damage, with decreased levels of HMGB1, IL‐1β, and TNF‐α. Furthermore, XBXD significantly suppressed ferroptosis, as indicated by the improvement of iron deposition, mitochondrial abnormalities, and oxidative stress. The network pharmacology and Western blot results indicated that XBXD activated the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling pathway. This study proved that XBXD activates the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis, which represents a critical anti‐emetic mechanism of XBXD in combatting CINV.",

The introduction of UBM as top surface layers significantly promotes cell adhesion, facilitating rapid formation of isolated regeneration zone.

Furthermore, a two-year repair trial is conducted on a full-thickness abdominal wall muscle defect in canine model and confirmed that the UBM/SIS scaffold exhibits reduced seroma occurrences and enhanced tissue repair performances.

Therefore, the evaluation of such therapies should be conducted in pre‐clinical models able to recapitulate the complex cellular and molecular crosstalk of the TME. To build‐in critical hallmarks of the TME, a breast cancer heterotypic 3D cell model (3D‐3) is devised using a microencapsulation strategy with an inert biomaterial (alginate) and agitation‐based cultures. Both stromal and immune components are added to multicellular tumor spheroids, therefore fostering cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) immunomodulatory interactions. The potential of the methodology to assess Ab‐based therapies is then addressed by employing a series of anti‐HER2‐based ADCs. ADCs induced tumor‐cell specific cytotoxicity toward HER2+ breast cancer spheroids while sparing HER2‐negative CAFs. In addition, an immunomodulatory blocking Ab against colony‐stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) decreases the expression of immunosuppressive and anti‐inflammatory markers in TAMs, like what is previously observed upon in vivo α‐CSF1R administration. Collectively, the human TME‐based 3D‐3 cell model is a suitable tool to evaluate the anti‐tumor and immunomodulatory potential of novel antibody‐based therapies directed against TME targets, such as cancer cells and macrophages.",

Nevertheless, its active ingredients and potential pharmacological mechanisms are not yet clearly elucidated. This study will identify the active ingredients of TJM using serum pharmacochemistry and to elucidate the mechanism on RE through network pharmacology. The blood‐borne ingredients of TJM are identified by the Ultra‐performance liquid chromatography‐quadrupole‐time of flight‐mass spectrometer. Subsequently, a “compound‐target‐disease” network is established and obtained core targets associated with TJM and RE. Then, the potential signaling pathways are forecasted through the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. Finally, the rat model of RE is established to verify the results predicted by network pharmacology through animal experiments. Fifteen blood‐borne ingredients of TJM are identified, with eight active ingredients‐namely Tangeretin, Tricin, Palmati, Berberine, Limonin, Evodiamine, Tetrahydropalmatine and Rutecarpine – making significant contributions to its efficacy. Moreover, TJM is predicted to act on 193 targets related to RE, involving AKT1, HSP90AA1, PIK3CA, and other targets, which enriches mainly in PI3K/AKT /NF‐κB signaling. Additionally, TJM can alleviate inflammation of the esophageal mucosa, reduce pathological damage, and increase gastric pH. It can downregulate PI3K, AKT, and NF‐κB mRNA transcription levels and reduce the protein expression of PI3K, AKT, and NF‐κB. Furthermore, it can inhibit the overproduction of IL‐6, TNF‐α and IL‐17. TJM can alleviate immune‐inflammatory responses and ameliorate RE by restraining the PI3K/AKT pathway and its downstream NF‐κB.",

    "abstract": "Intrauterine adhesion (IUA) can negatively impact on pregnancy outcomes, leading to reduced pregnancy rates, secondary infertility, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Studies have shown that the application of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in IUA patients is effective. However, the clinical readhesive rate of IUA after treatment is still high, especially in severe cases. Platelet-rich plasma double-network hydrogel (DN gel) is an engineered PRP double network hydrogel, which is a sodium alginate (SA) based PRP hydrogel with egg carton ion cross-linking and fibrin double network. The results of this study show that intrauterine injection of DN gel has a better effect on promoting endometrial regeneration and enhancing endometrial receptivity than PRP gel. The mechanism is analyzed through single-cell sequencing, which may be achieved by increasing the expression of neutrophils (Neut), natural killer cells (NK), and type I classical dendritic cells (cDC1) in the endometrium and inhibiting the infiltration of M2 macrophages. Overall, based on the good healing efficiency and good biocompatibility of DN gel, it is expected to become a method of treating IUA with better efficacy and faster clinical translation.",

Both mechanical and sucrose stimulation of co-cultures increased the percentage of neurons undergoing a calcium flux, indicating an action potential. Neuronal activation is blocked with either a piezo or insulin receptor blocker. At baseline, a flow only stimulus elicited 51.9% of neurons to activate in co-culture, which is decreased to 15.1% with a piezo blocker. Piezo blocked and sucrose stimulated EECs increased neuronal activation to 43.9%, and an insulin blocker reduced response to 12.4%. Since a cell line is used to model the EEC in the previous experiments, primary rat duodenal epithelium enriched for EECs are also stimulated and found to produced measurable insulin. This work shows the ability of EECs to produce insulin and for ENs to sense insulin. These results inspire further work on how insulin production outside the pancreas effects diabetes, insulin as a neurotransmitter, and exploration of additional nutritional and microbiotic stimuli on enteroendocrine-to-neuronal signaling.",

Various toxicological studies are carried out to investigate the toxicity and underlying mechanism of MO NPs. A series of physicochemical properties of MO NPs, such as primary size, charge, solubility, crystal structure, crystalline phase, etc., are correlated with their induced toxicity. Recently, electronic properties of MO NPs have exhibited intense correlation with the oxidative injury in cells and mice. The overlap between the conduction band energy ( E c ) of MO NPs and the biological redox potential range (−4.12 to −4.84 eV) of biological systems shows increasing evidence in causing the oxidative injury. Charge carrier types (hole or electron) of MO NPs are further found to potentiate or alleviate these injuries. Based on this knowledge, safer MO NPs can be prepared through regulation of energy edges of MO NPs. Herein, the relationship between the electronic properties of MO NPs and their induced oxidative injury is summarized, and the new safe‐by‐design approach for preparing safer MO NPs is introduced.",

One powerful approach for switchable control is the use of inducible dimerization systems, which can be configured to control activity of a target protein upon induced dimerization triggered by chemicals or light. Individually, many inducible dimerization systems suffer from pre‐defined dynamic ranges and overwhelming sensitivity to expression level and cellular context. Such systems often require extensive engineering efforts to overcome issues of background leakiness and restricted dynamic range. To address these limitations, recent tool development efforts have explored overlaying dimerizer systems with a second layer of regulation. Albeit more complex, the resulting layered systems have enhanced functionality, such as tighter control that can improve portability of these tools across platforms.",

Here, the key concepts of cardiac development that are successfully applied in a bioinspired approach to growing engineered cardiac tissues, are reviewed. The native cardiac milieu is studied extensively from embryonic to adult phenotypes, as it provides a resource of factors, mechanisms, and protocols to consider when working toward establishing living tissues in vitro. It begins with the various cell types that constitute the cardiac tissue. It is discussed how myocytes interact with other cell types and their microenvironment and how they change over time from the embryonic to the adult states, with a view on how such changes affect the tissue function and may be used in engineered tissue models. Key embryonic signaling pathways that have been leveraged in the design of culture media and differentiation protocols are presented. The cellular microenvironment, from extracellular matrix chemical and physical properties, to the dynamic mechanical and electrical forces that are exerted on tissues is explored. It is shown that how such microenvironmental factors can inform the design of biomaterials, scaffolds, stimulation bioreactors, and maturation readouts, and suggest considerations for ongoing biomimetic advancement of engineered cardiac tissues and regeneration strategies for the future.",

Each array consists of 1.6 × 10 5 microwells measuring 8 µm in diameter and 5 µm height, with a platinum nanoring electrode for in situ electrochemistry, all integrated on a transparent thin wafer for further high‐resolution live‐cell imaging. After optimizing the filling rate, 32% of cells are effectively trapped within microwells. This allows to analyse S. cerevisiae metabolism associated with basal respiration while simultaneously measuring optically other cellular parameters. In this study, the impact of glucose concentration on respiration and intracellular rheology is focused. It is found that while the oxygen uptake rate decreases with increasing glucose concentration, diffusion of tracer nanoparticles increases. The OptoElecWell‐based respiration methodology provides similar results compared to the commercial gold‐standard Seahorse XF analyzer, while using 20 times fewer biological samples, paving the way to achieve single cell metabolomics. In addition, it facilitates an optical route to monitor the contents within single cells. The proposed device, in combination with the dual detection analysis, opens up new avenues for measuring cellular metabolism, and relating it to cellular physiological indicators at single cell level.",

Since chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T immunotherapy achieves unprecedented success in curing hematological malignancies, the possibility of it revolutionizing the paradigm of solid tumors has aroused increasing attention. However, the restricted accessibility to tumor parenchyma, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and antigen heterogeneity of solid tumors make it difficult to replicate its success. Therefore, dynamic evaluation of CAR T cells’ tumor accessibility, intratumoral viability, and anti‐tumor cytotoxicity is necessary to facilitate its translation to solid tumors. Besides, real‐timely imaging above events in vivo can help evaluate therapeutic responses and optimize CAR T immunotherapy for solid tumors. Nuclear imaging, including positron emission tomography (PET) and single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, is frequently applied for evaluating adoptive cell therapies owing to its excellent sensitivity, high tissue penetration, and great translation potential. In addition, quantitative analysis can be performed in dynamic and noninvasive patterns. This review focuses on recent advances in PET/SPECT technologies and imaging probes in monitoring CAR T cells’ migration, viability, and cytotoxicity to solid tumors post‐administration. Prospects of what should be done in the next stage to promote CAR T therapy's application in solid tumors are also discussed.",

These findings, coupled with studies of the therapeutic potential of mitochondrial transplantation, provide a strong impetus to better understand how mitochondria can influence cell function or fate. Here an inducible mitochondrial depletion modelis used to study how cells lacking endogenous mitochondria respond, on a global protein expression level, to transplantation with lineage-mismatched (LM) mitochondria. It is shown that LM mitochondrial transplantation does not alter the proteomic profile in nonmitochondria-depleted recipient cells; however, enforced depletion of endogenous mitochondria results in dramatic changes in the proteomic landscape, which returns to the predepletion state following internalization of LM mitochondria. These data, derived from a cell system that can be rendered free of influence by endogenous mitochondria, indicate that transplantation of mitochondria-even from a source that differs significantly from the recipient cell population, effectively restores a normal proteomic landscape to cells lacking their own mitochondria.",

Cell chirality can be regulated by actin‐binding proteins such as α‐actinin‐1 and can also be mediated by certain signaling pathways, such as protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. Fascin, an actin crosslinker known to mediate parallel bundling of actin filaments, appears as a prominent candidate in cell chirality regulation, given its role in facilitating cell migration as an important PKC substrate. Here, it is shown that the chirality of NIH/3T3 cells can be altered by PKC activation and fascin manipulation. With either small‐molecule drug inhibition or genetic knockdown of fascin, the chirality of 3T3 cells is reversed from a clockwise (CW) bias to a counterclockwise (CCW) bias on ring‐shaped micropatterns, accompanied by the reversal in cell directional migration. The Ser‐39 fascin‐actin binding sites are further explored in cell chirality regulation. The findings of this study reveal the critical role of fascin as an important intermediator in cell chirality, shedding novel insights into the mechanisms of L‐R asymmetric cell migration and multicellular morphogenesis.",

Due to the limited demographic impacted by this ailment, an in‐depth investigation of the GWI has yielded little regarding the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Here, the hypothesis that exposure to pyridostigmine bromide (PB) results in severe enteric neuro‐inflammation, that cascades to disruptions in colonic motility, is tested. The analyses are performed on male C57BL/6 mice that are treated with physiologically similar doses of PB given to GW veterans. When colonic motility is assessed, GWI colons have significantly reduced forces in response to acetylcholine or electrical field stimulation. GWI is also accompanied by high levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, associated with increased numbers of CD40 + pro‐inflammatory macrophages within the myenteric plexus. Enteric neurons responsible for mediating colonic motility reside within the myenteric plexus, and PB exposure reduced their numbers. Significant smooth muscle hypertrophy is also observed due to increased inflammation. Together, the results show that PB exposure caused functional and anatomical dysfunction, promoting impaired motility within the colon. Achieving a greater understanding of the mechanisms of GWI will allow more refinement in therapeutic options that improve veterans’ quality of life.",

    "abstract": "From chiseled silica-crafting diatoms to migrating blue wildebeests, living matter manifests itself in an exceptional diversity of morphologies and functions. Perhaps even more amazing is that this astonishing diversity is encoded in the same and highly conserved molecule, DNA, the molecular code of life. Structurally, DNA can be primarily described as a double helix held by hydrogen bonds through specific base pairing. Functionally, naturally occurring DNA is essentially the support of the genetic code that is translated into proteins. In the course of evolution, living systems have thus reached a high degree of complexity and versatile functionality while having encoded them in a rather simple and robust molecular entity. On a separate path and through years of scientific exploration and industrial development, human-made synthetic materials have steadily improved to achieve broader, more sustainable, and/or higher-performance functionality. Based on a vast repertoire of known chemical reactions and processes, synthetic materials are typically designed, fabricated and shaped by judiciously combining building blocks from a rich alphabet of atoms, molecules, or supramolecular entities, through synthesis, assembly and/or formulation. Unlike their living counterparts, synthetic materials have a perfectly well-defined composition and known mechanisms of operation, but they are rarely able to achieve some of the properties characteristic of living systems such as communication, adaptation, reproduction and evolution. Interestingly, in recent years we have a witnessed a technological twist, since now virtually any synthetic DNA of any desired sequence or length can not only be synthesized in a rapid, user-defined manner, but can also be purchased at very low cost. Exploiting synthetic DNA as a molecular program to build and design synthetic systems thus appears to be a particularly timely and relevant strategy: i) to generate a variety of user-defined structures and functions in a generic and highly programmable manner; ii) to build well-defined systems in which all components are perfectly known and assembled; iii) to interrogate living systems in a rational manner; iv) to realize synthetic systems with life-like properties such as communication, adaptation, reproduction or evolution. It is precisely this rich territory that this special issue aims to explore. It presents a selection of research articles pushing the boundaries of current knowledge, as well as reviews providing original perspectives on the field, all reports having in common the construction, exploitation, study or analysis of synthetic systems encoded by DNA. Several scientific fields are more particularly involved. This is the case for structural DNA nanotechnology, which exploits specific base pairing to build sophisticated synthetic DNA-based nanostructures with programmable morphologies and site-specific functionalities. In this special issue, structural DNA nanotechnology is expanded by examining its advantageous coupling with additive manufacturing (article adbi.202200195). It is also revisited by considering programmable liquid-state structures (article adbi.202200180) and finds new applications for fundamental research, especially in mechanobiology sensing (article adbi.202200224). In addition, the emergence of synthetic biology has prompted researchers to convert synthetic genes into functions through cell-free protein synthesis, leading to the emergence of new synthetic systems capable of biological functions. These systems not only provide insight into the functioning of living matter, but also create new biocompatible tools for diagnostics and biomedical applications. In this issue, cell-free expression is better controlled, understood and predicted through original experiments (article adbi.202200164) and simulation tools (article adbi.202200177). The novel reconstitution of important proteins in minimal systems allows a better understanding of the spatio-temporal organization of cellular components involved in cell division (article adbi.202200172) as well as the development of animal-free and ultraminiaturized immunoassays (article adbi.202200266). In addition to encoding structures and functions, DNA has also been recognized as an active code capable of performing logic operations, leading to the development of DNA-based molecular computing. In this issue, this approach explores promising prospects for sample classification and pattern recognition that can be applied to diagnosis (article adbi.202200203). All of these different articles not only share a common interest in exploiting synthetic DNA as a molecular program in their own specific research areas. They also have cross-cutting goals, including understanding information-based assembly (adbi.202200180, adbi.202200195, adbi.202200203), studying spatio-temporal organization at the molecular (adbi.202200177, adbi.202200164) and cellular (adbi.202200172, adbi.202200224) levels, the rational construction of functional architectures (adbi.202200266, adbi.202200172, adbi.202200195, adbi.202200224), as well as the development of original tools for biotechnological and biomedical applications (adbi.202200266, adbi.202200203). In article adbi.202200195, Simmel and colleagues expose an original overview for improving the structural resolution of additive manufacturing by combining it with bottom-up DNA self-assembly. They demonstrate that implementing DNA programmability constitutes a great perspective for the future of bioprinting to achieve hierarchical assembly of synthetic biomaterials with molecular resolution up to supra-cellular levels. In article adbi.202200180, Takinoue and colleagues present what is probably one the first reviews specifically dedicated to DNA droplets. They showcase in particular the emerging interface between DNA nanotechnology and dynamic soft matter systems. They also highlight the unique properties of this new state of programmable matter made of liquids with sequence-specific recognition and programmable mechanical properties. In article adbi.202200224, Bellot and colleagues analyze the current state-of-the-art of constructing sophisticated force-sensitive DNA nanodevices and their exploitation for mechanobiological investigations. They discuss the challenges and opportunities raised by this new class of man-made and finely engineered nanomachines interacting with biological systems. In article adbi.202200164, Yoshikawa and colleagues report an original and systematic study on the role of monovalent cations in regulating cell-free expression in the TX-TL system. They unveil in particular a marked promoting role of Rb+. In article adbi.202200177, Shimizu and colleagues describe the development of a protein synthesis simulator. Their tool allows for large-scale model construction based on cell-free protein synthesis, with user-specified conditions (nucleic acid sequence, component concentrations, decoding rules), and can advantageously simulate the cell-free synthesis of full-length proteins. In article adbi.202200172, Danelon and colleagues use cell-free expression to produce the basal division membrane-binding protein FtsA from its coding DNA inside synthetic cells. In the presence of the purified FtsZ protein partner, FtsA-FtsZ cytoskeletal structures that constrict the cell membrane are formed without inducing its division. In article adbi.202200266, our group describes a novel fully synthetic bio-assay where functional single-domain antibodies (VHH) are cell-free expressed from their coding DNA with concomitant antigen binding assessment inside picoliter drops. This new purification-, animal- and culture-free format produces a fast and ultraminiaturized immunoassay with improved ethical acceptability and high-degree of programmability. In article adbi.202200203, Rondelez, Gines and colleagues survey the recent advances in DNA-based molecular programming for sample classification and disease pattern recognition, a particularly promising approach for one-pot and low-cost smart diagnostics. They focus in particular in recent experimental implementations of molecular circuits using Boolean operations or neural networks. In summary, because of its simple and robust base-pairing principle, its capacity for gene coding and molecular programming, its stability, and its ease of being synthesized at virtually any length and sequence, synthetic DNA is emerging as a highly versatile and convenient molecular code that can rationalize and expand the repertoire of synthetic systems in terms of design, properties and applications (Figure 1). Nadrian Seeman (1945–2021), the inspirational founder of DNA nanotechnology, regularly gave a lecture entitled “DNA: Not Merely the Secret of Life”. This issue demonstrates once again how true and promising this statement is. The authors declare no conflict of interest. Damien Baigl is exceptional class professor of chemistry at Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS-PSL) in Paris, France and senior member of the Institut Universitaire de France (IUF). Curiosity-driven, he is exploring original and interdisciplinary ways to observe, manipulate, control, or build a variety of soft matter systems. His current research interests include dynamic DNA nanotechnology, reconfigurable self-assembly, soft synthetic biology, coffee-ring effect for patterning and diagnostics, colloidal organization at fluid interfaces, synthetic cells, and genetic encoding of soft matter properties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One possible pathological mechanism underlying hypertension and its related health consequences is dysfunction of the circadian system—a network of coupled circadian clocks that generates and orchestrates rhythms of ≈24 h in behavior and physiology. To better understand the role of circadian function during the development of hypertension, circadian regulation of motor activity is investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) before the onset of hypertension and in their age‐matched controls—Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs). Two complementary properties in locomotor activity fluctuations are examined to assessthe multiscale regulatory function of the circadian control network: 1) rhythmicity at ≈24 h and 2) fractal patterns—similar temporal correlation at different time scales (≈0.5–8 h). Compared to WKYs, SHRs have more stable and less fragmented circadian activity rhythms but the changes in the rhythms (e.g., period and amplitude) from constant dark to light conditions are reduced or opposite. SHRs also have altered fractal activity patterns, displaying activity fluctuations with excessive regularity at small timescales that are linked to rigid physiological states. These different rhythmicity/fractal patterns and their different responses to light in SHRs indicate that an altered circadian function may be involved in the development of hypertension.",

However, the safety issue of CBD in the nervous system has not been settled fully, while CBD has been reported to have mild side effects including dizziness and somnolence. In this work, a platform of neuron‐astrocyte sandwich coculture to investigate the neurotoxicity of CBD, as well as the neuronal responses to CBD, in a more in vivo relevant mode is constructed. CBD (15 and 30 µ m ) causes the viability decrease, along with morphological damage, in the neuron‐alone culture, whereas its neurotoxic effects are significantly attenuated by the supports of astrocytes in the neuron‐astrocyte coculture. In addition, it is found that CBD‐induced increase of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, via activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, are noticeably ameliorated by coculturing neurons with astrocytes. This work provides crucial information in the development of CBD as therapeutics for neurological disorders, as well as in a fundamental understanding of how CBD works in the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Though the occurrence of neuroinflammation after spinal cord injury (SCI) is essential for antigen clearance and tissue repair, excessive inflammation results in cell death and axon dieback. The effect of anti-inflammatory medicine used in clinical treatment remains debatable owing to the inappropriate therapeutic schedule that does not align with the biological process of immune reaction. A better understanding of the immunity process is critical to promote effective anti-inflammatory therapeutics. However, cellular heterogeneity, which results in complex cellular functions, is a major challenge. This study performs single-cell RNA sequencing by profiling the tissue proximity to the injury site at different time points after SCI. Depending on the analysis of single-cell data and histochemistry observation, an appropriate time window for anti-inflammatory medicine treatment is proposed. This work also verifies the mechanism of typical anti-inflammatory medicine methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS), which is found attributable to the activation inhibition of cells with pro-inflammatory phenotype through the downregulation of pathways such as TNF, IL2, and MIF. These pathways can also be provided as targets for anti-inflammatory treatment. Collectively, this work provides a therapeutic schedule of 1-3 dpi (days post injury) to argue against classical early pulse therapy and provides some pathways for target therapy in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an intestinal malignant tumor with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Inoperability or resistanance to radiation and chemotherapy occur in the conventional treatments against CRC. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are one kind of virus that selectively infects and lyses cancer cells, which is considered to be a new anticancer therapy with biological and immune‐based approaches. Enterovirus 71 (EV71), belonging to the enterovirus genus in the family Picornaviridae, is a single positive‐stranded RNA virus. EV71 is transmitted in a fetal‐oral route and infects gastrointestinal tract in infants. Here, EV71 is exploited to be a novel oncolytic virus in colorectal cancer. It is revealed that EV71 infection can selectively cause colorectal cancer cells cytotoxicity but not primary intestinal epithelial cells. Consistently, EV71 injection significantly inhibits tumor growth in nude mice xenografted colorectal cancer cells. In detail, EV71 infects colorectal cancer cells to repress the expression of Ki67 and B‐cell leukemia 2 (Bcl‐2) leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation, while activating the cleavage of poly‐adenosine diphosphatase‐ribose polymerase and Caspase‐3 protein resulting in the promotion of cell apoptosis. The findings demonstrate the oncolytic feature of EV71 in CRC treatment and may provide a potential clue for clinical anticancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mutations in MC4R are the most common genetic cause of obesity. In the reported Chinese morbid obesity cohort, 10 out of 59 harbor six MC4R variants, including Y35C, T53I, V103I, R165W, G233S, and C277X, among which V103I has a relatively high frequency, while other five variants are rare in the population. The prevalence of MC4R carriers in Chinese morbid obese patients (body mass index ≥ 45 kg m −2 ) is detected as 16.9% in this study. R165W and C277X are loss‐of‐function variants. The patient with R165W achieves excess weight loss (%EWL) as high as 20.6% and 50.3% at 1 and 8 months after surgery, respectively. G233S is reported for the first time in Asia obese population. The patient harboring G233S has a %EWL as 23.3% one month postsurgery. It is concluded that morbid obese patients with rare MC4R variants can benefit from metabolic surgery. More importantly, the choice of surgery procedure and MC4R variant should be taken into consideration for personalized treatment. In the future, a larger size cohort, accompanied with regular and longer follow‐up, would be helpful.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD). This study investigates the role of Parkin, a protein involved in mitochondrial quality control, and strongly linked to PD, in the context of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. Mitochondrial mutator mice (Polg D257A/D257A ) (Polg) are used and bred with Parkin knockout (PKO) mice or mice with disinhibited Parkin (W402A). In the brain, mtDNA mutations are analyzed in synaptosomes, presynaptic neuronal terminals, which are far from neuronal soma, which likely renders mitochondria there more vulnerable compared with brain homogenate. Surprisingly, PKO results in reduced mtDNA mutations in the brain but increased control region multimer (CRM) in synaptosomes. In the heart, both PKO and W402A lead to increased mutations, with W402A showing more mutations in the heart than PKO. Computational analysis reveals many of these mutations are deleterious. These findings suggest that Parkin plays a tissue‐dependent role in regulating mtDNA damage response, with differential effects in the brain and heart. Understanding the specific role of Parkin in different tissues may provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of PD and potential therapeutic strategies. Further investigation into these pathways can enhance the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.",

Short‐chain fatty acids and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + (NAD + ) production by the gut microbiome are highlighted as key mechanisms with profound rhythmic behavior, and it is suggested to boost them as prophylactic/therapeutic approaches. Integrating aging, its associated comorbidities, and circadian regulation of physiological processes into stroke research may increase the translational value of pre‐clinical studies and help to schedule the optimal time window for existing practices to improve stroke outcome and recovery.",

Various classification models are developed within each T-category and evaluated using the Harrel-concordance index (C-index), Akaike-information criterion (AIC), and visual inspection. Stratification into distinct prognostic categories, with internal validation, is performed using bootstrapping analysis (SPSS and R-software). Through multivariate analysis, PNI is significantly associated with disease-specific survival (p < 0.001). PNI integration into the staging system results in a significantly improved model compared with the current T category alone (lower AIC, p < 0.001). The PNI-integrated model is superior in predicting differential outcomes between T3 and T4 patients. A new model for T-classification of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma is proposed, which is based on incorporating PNI into the staging system. These data can be used for future evaluations of the TNM staging system.",

Several strategies to solve this issue are proposed but none has decisively tackled the problem. This is in part due to an excessive focus on microvascularization that ignores the need of having macrovessels capable of being surgically connected to the patient's circulation upon implantation. Indeed, a strategy for macrovessel engineering must co‐exist with a strategy for microvessels. And if this is true, all the intermediate scales have to be addressed as well. Therefore, multiscale vascular networks must be the focus of tissue engineering vascularization efforts.

And three types of EEG features, namely time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear dynamics, are screened for optimal feature subset in mTBI detection. First, EEG signals of animals are recorded before and after establishing the animal model of mTBI. Second, signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature preprocessing are performed to obtain the full‐feature dataset, and 1442 feature subsets are obtained by 15 feature reduction algorithms extracted from combinations of 47 features. Ultimately, the support vector machines and K‐nearest neighbor algorithms are trained and tested respectively, and their performance is comprehensively compared to determine the optimal feature subset for mTBI detection. In the EEG dataset collected in this study, a total of eight feature subsets extracted from combinations of original 47 features and classification models with 100% accuracy are obtained.

The key brain region for inspiratory rhythm regulation and opioid‐induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) and current knowledge has mainly been obtained from animal systems. This study aims to establish a protocol to generate human preBötC neurons from induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) and develop an opioid overdose and recovery model utilizing these iPSC‐preBötC neurons. A de novo protocol to differentiate preBötC‐like neurons from human iPSCs is established. These neurons express essential preBötC markers analyzed by immunocytochemistry and demonstrate expected electrophysiological responses to preBötC modulators analyzed by patch clamp electrophysiology. The correlation of the specific biomarkers and function analysis strongly suggests a preBötC‐like phenotype. Moreover, the dose‐dependent inhibition of these neurons’ activity is demonstrated for four different opioids with identified IC50's comparable to the literature. Inhibition is rescued by naloxone in a concentration‐dependent manner. This iPSC‐preBötC mimic is crucial for investigating OIRD and combating the overdose crisis and a first step for the integration of a functional overdose model into microphysiological systems.",

Here, individual primary human chondrocytes (PHC) are encapsulated and cultured in 50 µm diameter alginate microgels using drop‐based microfluidics. This unique culturing method enables PCM formation and manipulation of individual cells. Over ten days, matrix formation is observed using autofluorescence imaging, and the elastic moduli of isolated cells are measured using AFM. Matrix production and elastic modulus increase are observed for the chondrons cultured in microgels. Furthermore, the elastic modulus of cells grown in microgels increases ≈ten‐fold over ten days, nearly reaching the elastic modulus of in vivo PCM. The AFM data is further analyzed using a Gaussian mixture model and shows that the population of PHCs grown in microgels exhibit two distinct populations with elastic moduli averaging 9.0 and 38.0 kPa. Overall, this work shows that microgels provide an excellent culture platform for the growth and isolation of PHCs, enabling PCM formation that is mechanically similar to native PCM. The microgel culture platform presented here has the potential to revolutionize cartilage regeneration procedures through the inclusion of in vitro developed PCM.",

    "abstract": "When tumor cells are released from a primary tumor into the bloodstream or lymphatic circulation system, they are exposed to a continuous shear flow environment. This environment exerts physical stresses on the tumor cells, which can activate apoptotic pathways. However, certain tumor cells have the ability to adapt to these mechanical stresses, enhancing their likelihood of survival and promoting metastasis. In this study, these tumor cells survived from shear flow environment are examined and revealed to closely link to stem cell-like characteristics. Higher gene expression levels of self-renewal and differentiation markers and enhanced abilities of migration, spheroid formation, and colony formation are shown. Moreover, the interaction between immune cells and the surviving cells is investigated. The results show that the surviving cells possess immune escape capabilities, implying their ability to evade immune surveillance. Additionally, these surviving cells display characteristics reminiscent of stem cells. This study holds great importance in advancing the understanding of tumor biology. By comprehending the behavior and properties of these surviving cells, new therapeutic strategies can be developed to specifically target circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and enhance cancer treatment outcomes.",

Studies have shown that TPL is involved in multiple cellular processes and signal pathways; however, its pharmaceutical activity in human colorectal cancer (CRC) as well as the underlying molecular mechanism remain elusive. In this study, the effects of TPL on HCT116 human colon cancer cells and CCD841 human colon epithelial cells are first evaluated. Next, the protein targets of TPL in HCT116 cells are identified through an activity‐based protein profiling approach. With subsequent in vitro experiments, the mode of action of TPL in HCT116 cells is elucidated. As a result, TPL is found to selectively inhibit HCT116 cell viability and migration. A total of 54 proteins are identified as the targets of TPL in HCT116 cells, among which, Annexin A1 (ANXA1) and Peroxiredoxin I/II (Prdx I/II) are picked out for further investigation due to their important role in CRC. The interaction between TPL and ANXA1 or Prdx I is confirmed, and it is discovered that TPL exerts inhibitory effect against HCT116 cells through binding to ANXA1 and Prdx I. The study reinforces the potential of TPL in the CRC therapy, and provides novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of CRC.",

Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with ROS scavenging activity are potential candidates for inflammatory bone loss. In this regard, the biosynthetic Ag NPs with low toxicity and high stability by using Flos Sophorae Immaturus extract as the reducing and capping agents are reported. The inflammatory bone loss model is established by injecting LPS. Quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction and Western Blot are utilized to determine the expression level of target biomarkers related to osteoclast formation. Ag NPs can significantly reduce the number of TRAP‐positive (TRAP + ) cells. In addition, Ag NPs down‐regulate the expression of biomarkers relevant to osteoclast formation. Interestingly, Ag NPs can effectively suppress osteoclast formation via down‐regulating ROS‐mediated phosphorylation of NF‐κB pathways. The in vivo study shows that Ag NPs can ameliorate bone density and decrease osteoclast number. Due to these benefits, the constructed Ag NPs can delay the progression of inflammatory bone loss. These findings suggest that Ag NPs are a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of inflammatory bone loss.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have potent immunomodulatory properties to regulate ovarian function, while thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) improves the abnormal formation of ovarian vessels. The present study investigated the efficacy of the combined use of adipose‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) and TSP1 in PCOS mice. The PCOS model is established using dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by subcutaneous injection. Ovarian apoptosis is assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labeling (TUNEL). Real‐time quantitative PCR (RT‐PCR) and western blotting are used to detect the expression of inflammatory factors and the levels of angiogenesis‐related factors in ovarian tissues. Inflammatory cells count and ovarian angiogenesis are evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. This research shows that TSP1 and ADSCs treatment can significantly reduce the inflammatory state of PCOS mice, relieve the degree of ovarian cell apoptosis, optimize the ovarian histological manifestations, and restore the levels of related hormones. The proportion of CD31‐positive cells in PCOS mice returned to near‐normal levels. The synergistic use of ADSCs and TSP1 therapy can exert a more impressive effect by inhibiting the ovarian inflammatory response and regulating the balance of angiogenesis than the single application in PCOS mice.",

Olfactory discrimination (OD) rule learning occludes slow calcium‐dependent potassium current (sI AHP ) in piriform cortex (PC) pyramidal neurons, which increases their intrinsic neuronal excitability. Similar learning‐induced sI AHP changes are demonstrated in hippocampal CA1. The shutdown of sI AHP is mediated by the metabotropic activation of the kainate subtype glutamatergic receptor, GluK2. Here, the duration of training required for OD rule learning increased significantly as the mice matured and aged is first shown, which appears earlier in 5xFAD mice. At the cellular biophysical level, aging is accompanied by reduction in the post‐burst AHP in these neurons, while neuronal excitability remains stable. This is in contrast to aging CA1 neurons that exhibit enhanced post‐burst AHPs in previous reports. Kainate reduces post‐burst AHP in adults, but not in aged PC neurons, whereas it reduces post‐burst AHPs in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of both young and aged mice. Overexpression of GluK2 in CA1 neurons restores OD learning capabilities in aged wild‐type and 5xFAD mice, to a level comparable to young adults. Activation of GluK2 receptors in selectively vulnerable neurons can prevent aging‐related cognitive decline is suggested.",

Here, temperature‐dependent MSNP uptake and recovery processes in hairy roots are examined as a function of surface chemistry. MSNP uptake into hairy roots and time‐dependent expulsion are quantified using Ti content (present for biomolecule binding) and fluorescence spectroscopy of fluorescently tagged MSNPs, respectively. The results suggest that functionalization and surface charge (regulated by amine group attachment) play the biggest role in the effectiveness of uptake and recovery. Comparison of MSNP interactions with hairy roots at 4 and 23 °C shows that weakly charged MSNPs functionalized only with Ti are taken up and expelled by thermally activated mechanisms, while amine‐modified positively charged particles are taken up and expelled mainly by direct penetration of cell walls. Amine‐functionalized MSNPs move spontaneously in and out of plant cells by dynamic exchange with a residence time of 20 ± 5 min, suggesting promise as a biomolecule nanoharvesting platform for plant organ cultures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), a G‐protein‐coupled receptor (GPCR), plays critical roles in neural functions and represents the target for a wide variety of drugs used to treat neurological diseases. However, its fundamental physicochemical properties, such as dimerization and affinity to different lipid environments, remain unknown. Here, reconstitution and characterization of D2R in a supported model membrane in nanometric confinement are reported. D2R is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and transferred into the supported model membrane as cell membrane blebs. D2R molecules are reconstituted with an elevated density in the cleft between the substrate and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomer. Reconstituted D2R retains the physiological functions, as evaluated from its binding to an antagonist and dimerization lifetime. The transient dimer formation of D2R, similar to the live cell, suggests that it is an innate property that does not depend on the cellular structures such as actin filaments. Although the mechanism of this unique reconstitution process is currently not fully understood, the finding points to a new possibility of using a nanometric space (&lt;100 nm thick) as a platform for reconstituting and studying membrane proteins under the quasi‐physiological conditions, which are difficult to be created by other methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many helminth life cycles, including hookworm, involve a mandatory lung phase, where myeloid and granulocyte subsets interact with the helminth and respond to infection‐induced lung injury. To evaluate these innate subsets in Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection, reporter mice for myeloid cells (CX3CR1 GFP ) and granulocytes (PGRP dsRED ) are employed. Nippostrongylus infection induces lung infiltration of reporter cells, including CX3CR1 + myeloid cells and PGRP + eosinophils. Strikingly, CX3CR1 GFP/GFP mice, which are deficient in CX3CR1, are protected from Nippostrongylus infection with reduced weight loss, lung leukocyte infiltration, and worm burden compared to CX3CR1 +/+ mice. This protective effect is specific for CX3CR1 as CCR2‐deficient mice do not exhibit reduced worm burdens. Nippostrongylus co‐culture with lung Ly6C + monocytes or CD11c + cells demonstrates that CX3CR1 GFP/GFP monocytes secrete more pro‐inflammatory cytokines and actively bind the parasites causing reduced motility. RNA sequencing of Ly6C + or CD11c + cells shows Nippostrongylus ‐induced gene expression changes, particularly in monocytes, associated with inflammation, chemotaxis, and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways. Analysis reveals cytotoxic and adhesion molecules as potential effectors against the parasite, such as Gzma and Gzmb , which are elevated in CX3CR1 GFP/GFP monocytes. These studies validate a dual innate cell reporter for lung helminth infection and demonstrate that CX3CR1 impairs monocyte–helminth interaction.",

However, its use is limited as it is hydrolyzed by trehalase, a widely expressed enzyme in multiple organisms. Several trehalose analogs are prepared, including a microbial metabolite 4‐trehalosamine, and their high biological stability is confirmed. For further analysis, 4‐trehalosamine is selected as it shows high producibility. Compared with trehalose, 4‐trehalosamine exhibits better or comparable protective activities and a high buffer capacity around the neutral pH. Another advantage of 4‐trehalosamine is its chemical modifiability: simple reactions produce its various derivatives. Labeled probes and detergents are synthesized in one‐pot reactions to exemplify the feasibility of their production, and their utility is confirmed for their respective applications. The labeled probes are used for mycobacterial staining. Although the derivative detergents can be effectively used in membrane protein research, long‐chain detergents show 1000–3000‐fold stronger autophagy‐inducing activity in cultured cells than trehalose and are expected to become a drug lead and research reagent. These results indicate that 4‐trehalosamine is a useful trehalose substitute for various purposes and a material to produce new useful derivative substances.",

    "abstract": "Eating during the rest phase is associated with metabolic syndrome, proposed to result from a conflict between food consumption and the energy-saving state imposed by the circadian system. However, in nocturnal rodents, eating during the rest phase (day-feeding, DF) also implies food intake during light exposure. To investigate whether light exposure contributes to DF-induced metabolic impairments, animals receive food during the subjective day without light. A skeleton photoperiod (SP) is used to entrain rats to a 12:12 cycle with two short light pulses framing the subjective day. DF-induced adiposity is prevented by SP, suggesting that the conflict between light and feeding stimulates fat accumulation. However, all animals under SP conditions develop glucose intolerance regardless of their feeding schedule. Moreover, animals under SP with ad libitum or night-feeding have increased adiposity. SP animals show a delayed onset of the daily rise in body temperature and energy expenditure and shorter duration of nighttime activity, which may contribute to the metabolic disturbances. These data emphasize that metabolic homeostasis can only be achieved when all daily cycling variables are synchronized. Even small shifts in the alignment of different metabolic rhythms, such as those induced by SP, may predispose individuals to metabolic disease.",

Icariin is a phytomolecule from herbal Epimedium , a traditional Chinese medicine widely used to treat musculoskeletal disorders for thousands of years. Here the effects of icariin against sarcopenia are investigated and the underlying mechanism is elucidated. A classic rat model of bilaterally orchiectomized (ORX) is used to induce sarcopenia. After administration for 8 weeks, compared to the control group, the forelimb grip strength, the specific tetanic forces of the soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) are higher, and the fiber cross‐sectional areas (CSAs) of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscle are larger in the icariin group. In addition, icariin promotes mRNA and protein expressions of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) both in SOL and EDL. Mechanistically, icariin significantly suppresses the mRNA and protein expressions of FOXO3a, atrogin‐1, and MuRF‐1, which are related to the degradation of myosin heavy chain. Collectively, icariin protects from sarcopenia in ORX rats characterized by enhancing grip strength and skeletal muscle contraction, as well as increasing skeletal muscle CSA by inhibiting the ubiquitination degradation of the MyHC in skeletal muscle fibers.",

Efforts are needed to better understand and combat this problem. This study hypothesized that dead cell debris post‐radiation therapy creates an advantageous microenvironment rich in metabolic materials promoting the growth of remaining live cancer cells. In this study, live cancer cells are co‐cultured with dead cancer cells eradicated by UV radiation to mimic a post‐therapy environment. Isotopic labeling metabolomics is used to investigate the metabolic behavior of cancer cells grown in a post‐radiation‐therapy environment. It is found that post‐UV‐eradicated dead cancer cells serve as nutritional sources of “off‐the‐shelf” and precursor metabolites for surviving cancer cells. The surviving cancer cells then take up these metabolites, integrate and upregulate multiple vital metabolic processes, thereby significantly increasing growth in vitro and probably in vivo beyond their intrinsic fast‐growing characteristics. Importantly, this active metabolite uptake behavior is only observed in oncogenic but not in non‐oncogenic cells, presenting opportunities for therapeutic approaches to interrupt the active uptake process of oncogenic cells without affecting normal cells. The process by which living cancer cells re‐use vital metabolites released by dead cancer cells post‐therapy is coined in this study as “metabolic recycling” of oncogenic cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neural precursor cells (NPC) are primary cells intensively used in the context of research on adult neurogenesis and modeling of neuronal development in health and diseased states. Substrates that can facilitate NPC adhesion will be very useful for culturing these cells. Due to the presence of laminin in basal lamina as well as their involvement in differentiation, migration, and adhesion of many types of cells, surfaces modified with laminin‐derived peptides are focused upon and compared with the widely used fibronectin‐derived Arg‐Gly‐Asp (RGD) peptides. An array of 46 peptides is synthesized on cellulose paper (SPOT) to identify laminin‐derived peptides that promote short‐term adhesion of murine NPC and human primary endothelial cells. Various previously reported peptide sequences are re‐evaluated in this work. Initial adhesion experiments show NPC preferred several laminin‐derived peptides by up to 5‐time higher cell numbers, compared to the well‐known promiscuous integrin binding RGD peptide. Importantly, screening of cell adhesion has revealed a synergetic effect of filamentous matrix, peptide sequence, surface property, ligand density, and the dynamic process of NPC adhesion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The myocardin‐related transcription factor A (MRTF‐A) controls the transcriptional activity of the serum response factor (SRF) in a tightly controlled actin‐dependent manner. In turn, MRTF‐A is crucial for many actin‐dependent processes including adhesion, migration, and contractility and has emerged as a novel target for anti‐tumor strategies. MRTF‐A rapidly shuttles between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartment via dynamic actin interactions within its N‐terminal RPEL domain. Here, optogenetics is used to spatiotemporally control MRTF‐A nuclear localization by blue light using the light‐oxygen‐voltage‐sensing domain 2‐domain based system LEXY (light‐inducible nuclear export system). It is found that light‐regulated nuclear export of MRTF‐A occurs within 10–20 min. Importantly, MRTF‐A‐LEXY shuttling is independent of perturbations of actin dynamics. Furthermore, light‐regulation of MRTF‐A‐LEXY is reversible and repeatable for several cycles of illumination and its subcellular localization correlates with SRF transcriptional activity. As a consequence, optogenetic control of MRTF‐A subcellular localization determines subsequent cytoskeletal dynamics such as non‐apoptotic plasma membrane blebbing as well as invasive tumor‐cell migration through 3D collagen matrix. This data demonstrates robust optogenetic regulation of MRTF as a powerful tool to control SRF‐dependent transcription as well as cell motile behavior.",

Biomaterials or surface patterns that boost specific cell functions can enable innovative new products in cell culture and diagnostics. This study investigates the influence of the intrinsically nano-patterned surface of nanoporous glass membranes on the behavior of mammalian cells. Three different cell lines and primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) proliferate readily on nanoporous glass membranes with mean pore sizes between 10 and 124 nm. In both proliferation and mRNA expression experiments, L929 fibroblasts show a distinct trend toward mean pore sizes >80 nm. For primary hMSCs, excellent proliferation is observed on all nanoporous surfaces. hMSCs on samples with 17 nm pore size display increased expression of COL10, COL2A1, and SOX9, especially during the first two weeks of culture. In the upside down culture, SK-MEL-28 cells on nanoporous glass resist the gravitational force and proliferate well in contrast to cells on flat references. The effect of paclitaxel treatment of MDA-MB-321 breast cancer cells is already visible after 48 h on nanoporous membranes and strongly pronounced in comparison to reference samples, underlining the material's potential for functional drug screening.",

In this system, near-infrared light irradiation triggers H2 S release in coacervate model protocells, leading to modulation of the behavior of living cells. The functional coacervate model protocells are prepared by loading metal-alloyed plasmonic nanoparticles and an H2 S donor into the liquid coacervate microdroplets. Upon light irradiation, the H2 S signal messenger is released through the photothermal effect of plasmonic nanoparticles and photothermal mediated pyrolysis of the H2 S donor. The H2 S signal is delivered to the mammalian cell community to trigger depletion of reactive oxygen species, reduce the activity of lactate dehydrogenase and improve cell viability. This study provides a new approach to the implementation of chemical signaling in artificial cell colonies and protocell/living cell consortia. The photothermal protocell system offers a powerful platform for light modulation of the behavior of mammalian cells and shows great promise for biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dynamic extracellular environments profoundly affect the behavior and function of cells both biochemically and mechanically. Neurite initiation is the first step for neurons to establish intricate neuronal networks. How such a process is modulated by mechanical factors is not fully understood. Particularly, it is unknown whether the molecular clutch model, which has been used to explain cell responses to matrix rigidity, also holds for neurite initiation. To study how mechanical properties modulate neurite initiation, substrates with various well‐defined surface viscosities using supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) are synthesized. The results show that ligands with intermediate viscosity greatly maximize neurite initiation in primary neurons, while neurite initiation is drastically limited on substrates with higher or lower viscosity. Importantly, biochemical characterizations reveal altered focal adhesion and calpain activity are associated with distinct neurite initiation patterns. Collectively, these results indicate that neurite initiation is surface viscosity‐dependent; there is an optimal range of surface viscosities to drive neurite initiation. Upon binding to ligands of varying viscosities, calpain activity is differentially triggered and leads to distinct levels of neurite outgrowth. These findings not only enhance the understanding of how extracellular environments regulate neurons, but also demonstrate the potential utility of SLBs for neural tissue engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Antibiotic resistance is the greatest challenge for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) infection under the global antibiotic resistance crisis. With the bottleneck period of the development of new antibiotics, novel alternative agents are urgently in need. In this study, the small molecule amentoflavone is identified as a dual‐action inhibitor of Hla, a pore‐forming virulence determinant particularly important for S. aureus pathogenicity and Toll‐like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling, which triggers inflammation response upon recognizing pathogen‐associated molecular patterns. Amentoflavone treatment conferred effective protection against S. aureus pneumonia through this dual‐action mechanism. Mechanically, amentoflavone effectively inhibited Hla pore formation, thereby reducing Hla‐mediated cytotoxicity and tissue damage; at the same time, amentoflavone suppressed TLR2‐mediated inflammatory response by blocking the interaction between TLR2 and its adapter myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88). Surprisingly, TLR2 signaling induced by synthetic bacterial TLR2 agonists and other heat‐killed gram‐positive bacteria is also blocked by amentoflavone. In summary, these results presented amentoflavone as a potential antibiotic alternative that curbed S. aureus infection by simultaneously suppressing host‐damaging virulence determinants derived from bacteria and the detrimental effect of excessive inflammation derived from the host rather than bacteria viability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a multifactorial disease defined by chronic intestinal inflammation with idiopathic origins. It has a predilection to affect the mucosal lining of the large intestines and rectum. Management of UC depends upon numerous factors that include disease pathogenesis and severity that are maintained via medical or surgical means. Chronic inflammation that is left untreated or managed poorly from a clinical stance can result in intestinal ulceration accompanied by resulting physiological dysfunction. End‐stage UC is mediated by surgical intervention with the resection of diseased tissue. This can lead to numerous health‐related quality of life issues but is considered a curative approach. Regimens to treat UC are ever evolving and find their basis within various platforms to evaluate and treat UC. Numerous modeling systems have been examined to delineate potential mechanisms of action. However, UC is a heterogenous disease spanning unknown genetic origins coupled with environmental factors that can influence disease outcomes and related treatment procedures. Unfortunately, there is no one‐size‐fits‐all model to fully assess all facets of UC. Within the context of this review article, the utility of various approaches that have been employed to gain insight into different aspects of UC will be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Excitation-coupling (ECC) is paramount for coordinated contraction to maintain sufficient cardiac output. The study of ECC regulation has primarily been limited to cardiomyocytes (CMs), which conduct voltage waves via calcium fluxes from one cell to another, eliciting contraction of the atria followed by the ventricles. CMs rapidly transmit ionic flux via gap junction proteins, predominantly connexin 43. While the expression of connexin isoforms has been identified in each of the individual cell populations comprising the heart, the formation of gap junctions with nonmuscle cells (i.e., macrophages and Schwann cells) has gained new attention. Evaluating nonmuscle contributions to ECC in vivo or in situ remains difficult and necessitates the development of simple, yet biomimetic in vitro models to better understand and prevent physiological dysfunction. Standard 2D cell culture often consists of homogenous cell populations and lacks the dynamic mechanical environment of native tissue, confounding the phenotypic and proteomic makeup of these highly mechanosensitive cell populations in prolonged culture conditions. This review will highlight the recent developments and the importance of new microphysiological systems to better understand the complex regulation of ECC in cardiac tissue.",

Cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate are used as single agents and in triple combination. The highest level of resistance to cisplatin is observed in MG‐63/CISR8, doxorubicin in HOS‐143B/DOXR8, and methotrexate in HOS‐143B/MTXR8. The MG‐63/TRIR8 and HOS‐143B/TRIR8 triple‐resistance models show lower levels of resistance to combination treatment and are not resistant to the drugs individually. Apoptosis assays suggest that the resistance in MG‐63/TRIR8 isfrom cisplatin and methotrexate and not doxorubicin. In contrast, the resistance in HOS‐143B/TRIR8 is from doxorubicin and methotrexate instead of cisplatin. Upregulation of P‐glycoprotein is seen in all resistant models except those developed with single‐agent methotrexate. However, P‐glycoprotein is not causing resistance in all cell lines as the inhibitor elacridar only reverses the resistance of doxorubicin on MG‐63/DOXR8 and HOS‐143B/TRIR8. The migration of the MG‐63 resistant models is significantly increased, their invasion rate tends to increase, and RT‐PCR shows a switch from epithelial to mesenchymal gene signaling. In contrast, a significant decrease in migration is seen in HOS‐143B resistant models with their invasion rate tending to decrease and a switch from mesenchymal to epithelial gene signaling.",

Although studies have provided substantial evidence that geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NAFLD corresponding drug screening is rare. A GGPPS‐targeted inhibitor is identified using a structure‐based virtual small molecule screening method. The interaction of 4‐AZ and GGPPS is detected by microscale thermophoresis. 4‐AZ degradation of GGPPS by the ubiquitin‐proteasome pathway is detected by western blotting. The anti‐steatotic effect of 4‐AZ in vivo is detected by CT. Lipid‐related gene detection is detected by real‐time PCR both in primary hepatocytes and mice. The compound inhibits the accumulation of lipids in primary hepatocytes and decreases lipogenic gene expression through GGPPS. Pharmacological studies show that 4‐AZ can attenuate hepatic steatosis and improve liver injury in high‐fat diet‐induced mice. This data provides a novel application of 4‐AZ NAFLD therapy, proving that the inhibition of GGPPS is a novel strategy for the treatment of NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Several studies have shown that downregulation of GALNT2 (Polypeptide N‐Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2), encoding polypeptide N ‐acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2, decreases high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) and increases triglycerides levels by glycosylating key enzymes of lipid metabolism, such as angiopoietin like 3, apolipoprotein C‐III, and phospholipid transfer protein. GALNT2 is also a positive modulator of insulin signaling and action, associated with in vivo insulin sensitivity and during adipogenesis strongly upregulates adiponectin. Thus, the hypothesis that GALNT2 affects HDL‐C and triglycerides levels also through insulin sensitivity and/or circulating adiponectin, is tested. In 881 normoglycemic individuals the G allele of rs4846914 SNP at the GALNT2 locus, known to associate with GALNT2 downregulation, is associated with low HDL‐C and high values of triglycerides, triglycerides/HDL‐C ratio, and theHomeostatic Model Assessment of insulin resistance HOMA IR ( p ‐values = 0.01, 0.027, 0.002, and 0.016, respectively). Conversely, no association is observed with serum adiponectin levels ( p = 0.091). Importantly, HOMA IR significantly mediates a proportion of the genetic association with HDL‐C (21%, 95% CI: 7–35%, p = 0.004) and triglyceride levels (32%, 95% CI: 4–59%, p = 0.023).

Heat stress (HS) has become a major environmental factor threatening food security worldwide. Understanding how plants sense and respond to HS is of clear interest to plant scientists and crop breeders. However, it is not trivial to elucidate the underlying signaling cascade, as specific cellular responses (ranging from detrimental to systemic effects) must be disentangled. Plants respond and adapt to high temperatures in many ways. In this review, recent progress in understanding heat signal transduction and the role of histone modifications in regulating the expression of genes involved in HS responses are discussed. The outstanding issues that are crucial for understanding the interactions between plants and HS are also discussed. The study of heat signal transduction mechanisms in plants is essential to facilitate the cultivation of heat‐resistant crop varieties.",

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer‐related deaths worldwide, and there are currently no effective therapies for advanced HCC. This study explores the comprehensive effects and possible mechanisms of CACF on HCC. The results show that CACF reduces the viability of hepatoma cells in vitro, while benefiting normal hepatocytes. In addition, CACF inhibits hepatoma cell growth in a zebrafish xenotransplantation model and decreases lipid accumulation, represses inflammation and cell proliferation markers in fatty acid translocase ( CD36 ) transgenic zebrafish, and inhibits the expression of cell proliferation and β‐catenin downstream targets in telomerase ( tert ) transgenic zebrafish models. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis reveals that CACF exerts multiple functions, including reduction of inflammation and inhibition of lipid transporter and PPAR signaling pathway. Surprisingly, CACF also regulates the expression of genes and reduces coronavirus infection and pathogenesis in a zebrafish model. CACF treatment is validated to regulate the expression of genes for anti‐coronavirus activity. Mechanistically, CACF stabilizes G‐quadruplex and reduces cell senescence associated β‐galactosidase activity. In summary, CACF may be a promising therapeutic agent with multiple functions including anticancer, anti‐inflammation, and anti‐microorganisms in a zebrafish model.",

    "abstract": "The regenerative capacity of corneal endothelial cells (CECs) differs between species; in bigger mammals, CECs are arrested in a non-proliferative state. Damage to these cells can compromise their function causing corneal opacity. Corneal transplantation is the current treatment for the recovery of clear eyesight, but the donor tissue demand is higher than the availability and there is a need to develop novel treatments. Interestingly, rabbit CECs retain a high proliferative profile and can repopulate the endothelium. There is a lack of fundamental knowledge to explain these differences. Gaining information on their transcriptomic variances could allow the identification of CEC proliferation drivers. In this study, human, sheep, and rabbit CECs are analyzed at the transcriptomic level. To understand the differences across each species, a pipeline for the analysis of pathways with different activities is generated. The results reveal that 52 pathways have different activity when comparing species with non-proliferative CECs (human and sheep) to species with proliferative CECs (rabbit). The results show that Notch and TGF-β pathways have increased activity in species with non-proliferative CECs, which might be associated with their low proliferation. Overall, this study illustrates transcriptomic pathway-level differences that can provide leads to develop novel therapies to regenerate the corneal endothelium.",

It is mostly caused by mutations in LEP, LEPR, PCSK1 , as well as some rare mutations in UCP3, NR0B2 , and PPARG . Among 30 obesity patients, five patients are identified with positive gene detection. For the first time, the c.624C&gt;T mutation associated with PCSK1 , and the c.50G&gt;A and c.293_301delinsAC mutations associated with NR0B2 , as well as the obesity phenotype mutation (c.284A&gt;G) associated with PPARG is confirmed. Following this, the genotype‐clinical phenotype, mutation hotspots, and mutation distributions of each gene are summarized, and the genetic characteristics of NSMO are analyzed. The locations of mutation c.50G&gt;A, and c.284A&gt;G are highly conserved according to the sequencing alignment. According to the findings, the c.624C&gt;T mutation in PCSK1 is a newly discovered synonymous mutation, but it can result in significant early‐onset obesity. Additionally, the mutation of c.284A&gt;G( PPARG ) can lead to a variety of clinical phenotypes and the mutation of UCP3 and NR0B2 may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study enriches the human NSMO gene mutation database and provides a scientific basis for clinically accurate diagnosis and treatment.",

In this study, bioinformatics methods/tools are applied to quantitatively analyze molecular characteristics evolution of GC progression, and a prognosis model is constructed. This study finds that some dysregulated differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) in the LGIN stage may continue to promote the occurrence and development of EGC. Among the LGIN, HGIN, and EGC stages, there are differences and relevance in the transcription expression patterns of DEmRNAs, and the activation related to immune cells is very different. The biological functions continuously changed during the progression from LGIN to HGIN to EGC. The COX model constructed based on the three EGC‐related DEmRNAs has GC prognostic risk prediction ability. The evolution of biological characteristics during the development of EGC mined by the authors provides new insight into understanding the molecular mechanism of EGC occurrence and development. The three‐gene prognostic risk model provides a new method for assisting GC clinical treatment decisions.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women and the most lethal gynecologic cancer. It is curable when discovered at an early stage, but usually remains asymptomatic until advanced stages. It is crucial to diagnose the disease before it metastasizes to distant organs for optimal patient management. Conventional transvaginal ultrasound imaging offers limited sensitivity and specificity in the ovarian cancer detection. With molecularly targeted ligands addressing targets, such as kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), attached to contrast microbubbles, ultrasound molecular imaging (USMI) can be used to detect, characterize and monitor ovarian cancer at a molecular level. In this article, the authors propose a standardized protocol is proposed for the accurate correlation between in- vivo transvaginal KDR-targeted USMI and ex vivo histology and immunohistochemistry in clinical translational studies. The detailed procedures of in vivo USMI and ex vivo immunohistochemistry are described for four molecular markers, CD31 and KDR with a focus on how to enable the accurate correlation between in vivo imaging findings and ex vivo expression of the molecular markers, even if not the entire tumor could can be imaged by USMI, which is not an uncommon scenario in clinical translational studies. This work aims to enhance the workflow and the accuracy of characterization of ovarian masses on transvaginal USMI using histology and immunohistochemistry as reference standards, which involves sonographers, radiologists, surgeons, and pathologists in a highly collaborative research effort of USMI in cancer.",

Forty RCTs are included, with 4405 participants. The effectiveness of six acupuncture techniques, three types of prophylactic drugs, and psychotherapy are compared and ranked. Acupuncture outperformed prophylactic drugs in terms of diminishing visual analog scale (VAS) score, migraine attack frequency, and days during the treatment and at the 12-week follow-up. At the 12-week follow-up, the effectiveness of various interventions is ranked as follows: manual acupuncture (MA) > electroacupuncture (EA) > calcium antagonists (CA) in reducing VAS score; MA > EA > CA in reducing migraine attack frequency; MA > EA > β-receptor blocker and CA in reducing headache attack days. Acupuncture is a promising treatment for migraine prevention. The best option of acupuncture for improving various migraine outcomes has changed over time.

The lincRNA TMPOP2 is highly expressed in gynecological cancers and may exhibit tumor‐promoting functions. However, the function of TMPOP2 in pancreatic cancer is limited. TMPOP2 expression in pancreatic cancer and adjacent tissues is analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GTEx database. It shows the high expression of TMPOP2 in pancreatic cancer tissues. Similar results are observed in resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors and adjacent tissues from 20 patients and the relative cell lines. When the pancreatic cell lines are transfected with si‐TMPOP2, it shows that TMPOP2 downregulation inhibits the cells migration and EMT. Furthermore, the potential mechanism is explored by detecting the expression of c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylated JNK, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and phosphorylated STAT3. It suggests that TMPOP2 knockdown inactivates JNK and STAT3 phosphorylation. When a JNK activator (anisomycin) is added to the cells with si‐NC or si‐TMPOP2, it can partially reverse the migration and EMT inhibition of the cells with inhibited TMPOP2. TMPOP2 inhibition suppresses the migration and EMT of pancreatic cancer by repressing the JNK/STAT3 pathway. Thus, this may be a novel target for pancreatic cancer therapy.",

Interventions to maintain muscle strength may mitigate the age‐related loss of physical function, thus maximizing health span. The work on environmental enrichment (EE), an experimental paradigm recapitulating aspects of an active lifestyle, has revealed EE‐induced metabolic benefits mediated by a brain‐fat axis across the lifespan of mice. EE initiated at 18‐month of age shows a trend toward an increased mean lifespan. While previous work described EE's influences on the aging dynamics of several central‐peripheral processes, its influence on muscle remained understudied. Here, the impact of EE is investigated on motor function, neuromuscular physiology, and the skeletal muscle transcriptome. EE is initiated in 20‐month‐old mice for a five‐month period. EE mice exhibit greater relative lean mass that is associated with improved mobility and hindlimb grip strength. Transcriptomic profiling of muscle tissue reveals an EE‐associated enrichment of gene expression within several metabolic pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle. Many mitochondrial‐related genes—several of which participate in the electron transport chain—are upregulated. Stress‐responsive signaling pathways are downregulated because of EE. The results suggest that EE improves motor function—possibly through preservation of mitochondrial function—even late in life.",

This study aims to elucidate the role of VD in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and its impact on AAPs‐induced metabolic adverse effects. Female C57BL/6 mice receive either calcitriol or vehicle one week prior to co‐treatment with olanzapine (OLZ) for an additional four weeks. Metabolic parameters, hepatic ER homeostasis, and the SREBPs pathway are assessed through biochemical assays and protein expression profiling. HepG2 cells are transfected with vitamin D receptor (VDR) siRNA for VDR knockdown. OLZ‐treated HepG2 cells are exposed to calcitriol to examine its effects on SREBPs and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. VDR activation by calcitriol reduces OLZ‐induced hepatic ER stress, leading to decreased SREBPs activity and lipid accumulation. Conversely, the knockdown of VDR in HepG2 cells diminishes the protective effects of calcitriol against OLZ‐induced ER stress and SREBPs activation. This resulted in sustained UPR activation, elevated cleaved SREBPs levels, and increased lipid accumulation. These findings highlight an essential role of VDR signaling in the beneficial effects of VD on OLZ‐induced metabolic side effects. Targeting VDR to resolve ER stress is likely an applicable therapeutic strategy for AAPs‐induced metabolic disturbances.",

Recent reports have made it clear that the balance of HA synthesis and degradation is critical for tumor progression. HA is synthesized on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane by hyaluronan synthases (HAS) and extruded into the extracellular space. Excessive HA production in cancer is associated with enhanced HA degradation in the tumor microenvironment, leading to the accumulation of HA fragments with small molecular weight. These perturbations in both HA synthesis and degradation may play important roles in tumor progression. Recently, it has become increasingly clear that small HA fragments can induce a variety of biological events, such as angiogenesis, cancer‐promoting inflammation, and tumor‐associated immune suppression. Progression of urologic malignancies, particularly of prostate and bladder cancers, as well as of certain types of kidney cancer show markedly perturbed metabolism of tumor‐associated HA. This review highlights the recent research findings regarding HA metabolism in tumor microenvironments with a special focus on urologic cancers. It also will discuss the potential implications of these findings for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for the treatment of prostate, bladder, and kidney cancers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are highly sought after as a source of biomarkers for disease detection and monitoring. Tumor EV isolation, processing, and evaluation from biofluids is convoluted by EV heterogeneity and biological contaminants and is limited by technical processing efficacy. This study rigorously compares common bulk EV isolation workflows (size exclusion chromatography, SEC; membrane affinity, MA) alongside downstream RNA extraction protocols to investigate molecular analyte recovery. EV integrity and recovery is evaluated using a variety of technologies to quantify total intact EVs, total and surface proteins, and RNA purity and recovery. A comprehensive evaluation of each analyte is performed, with a specific emphasis on maintaining user ( n = 2), biological ( n = 3), and technical replicates ( n ≥3) under in vitro conditions. Subsequent study of tumor EV spike‐in into healthy donor plasma samples is performed to further validate biofluid‐derived EV purity and isolation for clinical application. Results show that EV surface integrity is considerably preserved in eluates from SEC‐derived EVs, but RNA recovery and purity, as well as bulk protein isolation, is significantly improved in MA‐isolated EVs. This study concludes that EV isolation and RNA extraction pipelines govern recovered analyte integrity, necessitating careful selection of processing modality to enhance recovery of the analyte of interest.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells are invaluable resources for personalized medicine. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have received great attention as therapeutic tools due to being a safe, ethical, and accessible option with immunomodulatory and controlled differentiation properties. Apelin receptor (Aplnr) signaling is reported to be involved in biological events, including gastrulation, mesoderm migration, proliferation of MSCs. However, the knowledge about the exact role and mechanism of Aplnr signaling during mesoderm and MSCs differentiation is still primitive. The current study aims to unveil the role of Aplnr signaling during mesoderm and MSC differentiation from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) through peptide/small molecule activation, overexpression, knock down or CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knock out of the pathway components. Morphological changes, gene and protein expression analysis, including antibody array, LC/MS, mRNA/miRNA sequencing, reveal that Aplnr signaling promotes mesoderm commitment possibly via EGFR and TGF-beta signaling pathways and enhances migration of cells during mesoderm differentiation. Moreover, Aplnr signaling positively regulates MSCs differentiation from hPSCs and increases MSC characteristics and differentiation capacity by regulating pathways, such as EGFR, TGFβ, Wnt, PDGF, and FGF. Osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic differentiations are significantly enhanced with Aplnr signaling activity. This study generates an important foundation to generate high potential MSCs from PSCs to be used in personalized cell therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Liver tissue engineering has undergone remarkable developments since the late 20th century, transitioning from simple two‐dimensional cultures to sophisticated three‐dimensional organoid models for drug toxicity assessments. Stem cell innovations have enabled the creation of liver organoids for disease modelling and tissue engineering. However, a key limitation is the absence of functional bile ducts in these organoids, crucial for replicating bile‐duct related diseases. Bile, synthesized by hepatocytes, plays a vital role in digesting fats and expelling lipid‐soluble wastes, including drug byproducts. Diseases impeding bile flow are responsible for many liver transplants and can cause severe conditions such as liver cirrhosis, causing over 50,000 annual deaths in the US. Current liver organoids, while bile‐producing, are devoid of bile ducts, limiting their efficacy in mimicking diseases related to bile flow. This article underscores the pressing need to incorporate bile ducts in engineered liver tissues, delves into the challenges faced in this effort, and highlights potential solutions through biomaterial and bioengineering techniques. Such advancements will offer researchers enhanced insights into bile duct disorders and pave the way for exploring innovative therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The manufacturing of 3D cell scaffoldings provides advantages for modeling diseases and injuries as it enables the creation of physiologically relevant platforms. A triple‐flow microfluidic device is developed to rapidly fabricate alginate/graphene hollow microfibers based on the gelation of alginate induced with CaCl 2 . This five‐channel microdevice actualizes continuous mild fabrication of hollow fibers under an optimized flow rate ratio of 300:200:100 µL min −1 . The polymer solution is 2.5% alginate in 0.1% graphene and a 30% polyethylene glycol solution is used as the sheath and core solutions. The biocompatibility of these conductive microfibers by encapsulating mouse astrocyte cells (C8D1A) within the scaffolds is investigated. The cells can successfully survive both the manufacturing process and prolonged encapsulation for up to 8 days, where there is between 18–53% of live cells on both the alginate microfibers and alginate/graphene microfibers. These unique 3D hollow scaffolds can significantly enhance the available surface area for nutrient transport to the cells. In addition, these conductive hollow scaffolds illustrate unique advantages such as 0.728 cm 3 gr −1 porosity and two times more electrical conductivity in comparison to alginate scaffolds. The results confirm the potential of these scaffolds as a microenvironment that supports cell growth.",

    "abstract": "As an evolutionary adaptation to the light-dark cycles across solar days, circadian rhythms are present in almost all biological and physiological processes, and observed at multiple scales from gene expression to system-level behaviors such as sleep and physical activity.[1] Circadian rhythms are regulated and orchestrated by a network of internal biological clocks with a central pacemaker located in the hypothalamus—the suprachiasmatic nucleus.[2, 3] Intact circadian regulation is key for optimal body functions, and perturbed circadian regulation has been prospectively linked to various diseased conditions such as mood, cardiometabolic, and neurocognitive disorders.[4, 5] In this issue, four review articles and seven original research articles summarize and/or provide the evidence for changes in circadian rhythms with aging and the relevance of circadian disturbances to the risk for age-related diseases and disease progression. Impacts of aging and potential pathways Aging broadly affects all aspects of biological processes on the cellular and molecular levels, leading to physiological dysfunctions on the system level. In this special issue, Xu and Li reviewed studies on the impact of aging on the circadian regulatory system in mammals. These studies highlighted that the age-related degradations of circadian rhythms at the system level should be attributed not only to changes of the circadian molecular machinery within the circadian clocks but also to the downstream pathways through which the clocks regulate biological processes (article number 2200219). The review also pointed out the potential role of increased inflammatory responses in circadian degradations with aging. Relatedly, Joshi and Sundar reviewed evidence and possible pathways for the impact of circadian clock disruption on lung inflammation, a pathological mechanism underlying the association between night shift work and pulmonary disease (article number 2200292). They also discussed the potential application of chronotherapy in the treatment of chronic lung diseases. Supporting this association, Sundar et al. also presented their new data from a mice model, showing that ozone exposure impacted clock gene expression and inflammation in the lung (article number 2300045). Circadian disturbances and other diseases Circadian disturbances are linked to the development and outcomes of many different diseases. Recent studies have also provided strong evidence that circadian disturbances are linked to neurodegenerative diseases.[4] In this special issue, Keihani et al. focused their review (article number 2200237) on the differences in the circadian regulation between healthy adults and people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Their main conclusion indicated that altered circadian rhythms in people with MCI are more pronounced, and some aterations are consistently reported in the studies of daily rest-activity rhythms. There is certain evidence for changes in daily/circadian rhythms of core body temperature, melatonin, and cortisol rhythms in people with MCI, but more studies are required to validate these results. This review article also highlighted preliminary evidence for the possibility to prevent or halt the progress of neurodegeneration by targeting circadian intactness. Kara et al. reviewed findings related to the influences of circadian rhythms on stroke susceptibility and pathogenesis (article number 2300048). The authors also discussed the potential relevance of circadian regulated gut-microbiome, inflammation, and immune response to stroke outcome. The reviewed evidence, despite being preliminary, suggests new directions for the design of novel stroke therapies by integrating circadian rhythms and aging in clinical stroke research. Yilmaz et al. investigated the circadian regulation and its response to different light condition in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) — a commonly used animal model for hypertension (article number 2200324). Using both traditional circadian rhythmicity and nonlinear measures of the circadian motor activity regulation, the study showed that SHRs had altered circadian regulation even before the onset of hypertension, displaying more excessive rigidity and less response to light as compared to age-matched control rats. These original data strongly support the role of altered circadian regulation in the development of hypertension. Chronotype, timing of daily behaviors, and relevance to disease prevention/treatment The intrinsic properties of the circadian clocks such as the cycle length and the entrainment of circadian rhythms may vary among individuals, which can manifest as different chronotypes or preferences in sleep and wake schedules. By investigating temporal stride-to-stride fluctuations of walking at different times of the day, Vaz et al. showed that the daily variation of gait dynamics in healthy young adults is also affected by chronotype (article number 2200235). This finding supports the relevance of the circadian regulation to motor activity regulation and balance control. Antonsdottir et al. reported original results showing the associations of daily motor activity patterns with depressive symptoms and cognitive performance in individuals with memory impairment (article number 2300138).They found that “greater depressive symptomatology is associated with greater activity in midafternoon, evening, and overnight into midday, whereas better delayed recall is associated with greater late evening activity and higher global cognitive performance is associated with greater activity in the morning and afternoon.” Their findings suggest the possibility to improve mental health in patients with memory impairment though this hypothesis should be further tested in future studies. Cumulating evidence suggests that feeding during the rest phase (instead of the active phase) disturbs metabolism, which may contribute to the development of metabolic disease. Méndez-Hernández et al. used a rat model and a unique light protocol that maintained complete darkness except for two 30-min light pulses identifying the beginning and end of the subjective day. Results indicated that small shifts in the circadian rhythms of body temperature and energy expenditure and shortened active period are linked to impacts glucose intolerance and increased adiposity, even when feeding is scheduled during the active phase or not controlled (article number 2200116). These findings suggest that an “optimal” synchronization among circadian rhythms of different physiological processes is required for metabolic homeostasis, highlighting a potential circadian therapy to prevent or treat metabolic disorders by manipulating feeding time. In addition to the inter-individual differences in intrinsic circadian regulation, the manifested daily rhythms in behavioral and physiological processes (the entrainment to the daily light-dark cycle) may also be affected by many external factors. Lai et al. presented data from a randomized controlled trial but found no significant effect of vaccination time on antibody response to an inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (article number 2300028). They pointed out in their article that reliable assessment of the time-of-day effects require consideration of accurately phenotyping the chronotypes of participants, data on sleep-wake and work schedules, and enough sample data points across a circadian cycle. Findings in these research/review articles represent certain recent advances in the emerging field of circadian medicine, which has opened a promising, new avenue for healthcare.[6, 7] We would like to thank the editor-in-chief, Monty A. Montano, for his help throughout the conception and preparation of this special issue and to acknowledge all the authors and reviewers for their vision and contributions to this special issue of circadian medicine.

    "abstract": "Abstract The nuanced heterogeneity and specialized functions of translation machinery are increasingly recognized as crucial for precise translational regulation. Here, high‐throughput ribosomal profiling (ribo‐seq) is used to analyze the specialized roles of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) in the budding yeast. By examining changes in ribosomal distribution across the genome resulting from knockouts of eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4G1, CAF20, or EAP1, or knockdowns of eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4E, or PAB1, two distinct initiation‐factor groups, the “looping” and “scanning” groups are discerned, based on similarities in the ribosomal landscapes their perturbation induced. The study delves into the cis‐regulatory sequence features of genes influenced predominantly by each group, revealing that genes more dependent on the looping‐group factors generally have shorter transcripts and poly(A) tails. In contrast, genes more dependent on the scanning‐group factors often possess upstream open reading frames and exhibit a higher GC content in their 5′ untranslated regions. From the ribosomal RNA fragments identified in the ribo‐seq data, ribosomal heterogeneity associated with perturbation of specific initiation factors is further identified, suggesting their potential roles in regulating ribosomal components. Collectively, the study illuminates the complexity of translational regulation driven by heterogeneity and specialized functions of translation machinery, presenting potential approaches for targeted gene translation manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Optogenetics is a powerful approach in neuroscience research. However, other tissues of the body may benefit from controlled ion currents and neuroscience may benefit from more precise optogenetic expression. The present work constructs three subcellularly‐targeted optogenetic actuators based on the channelrhodopsin ChR2‐XXL, utilizing 5, 10, or 15 tandem repeats (TR) from mucin as N‐terminal targeting motifs and evaluates expression in several polarized and non‐polarized cell types. The modified channelrhodopsin maintains its electrophysiological properties, which can be used to produce continuous membrane depolarization, despite the expected size of the repeats. This work then shows that these actuators are subcellularly localized in polarized cells. In polarized epithelial cells, all three actuators localize to just the lateral membrane. The TR‐tagged constructs also express subcellularly in cortical neurons, where TR5‐ChR2XXL and TR10‐ChR2XXL mainly target the somatodendrites. Moreover, the transfection efficiencies are shown to be dependent on cell type and tandem repeat length. Overall, this work verifies that the targeting motifs from epithelial cells can be used to localize optogenetic actuators in both epithelia and neurons, opening epithelia processes to optogenetic manipulation and providing new possibilities to target optogenetic tools.",

Herein, it is shown that the expression of Trim21 mRNA level of interscapular brown adipose tissue elevates after birth, and peaks at P14 (postnatal day 14). Trim21 depletion severely impairs the maturation of interscapular brown adipose tissue, decreases the expression of a series of thermogenic genes, and reduces energy expenditure. Consistently, the loss of Trim21 also leads to a suppression of white adipose tissue “browning”, in response to cold exposure and a β‐adrenergic agonist, CL316,243. In addition, Trim21 −/− mice are more prone to high‐fat diet‐induced obesity compared with the control littermates. Taken together, the study for the first time reveals a critical role of Trim21 in regulating iBAT postnatal development and thermogenesis.",

The profiling results show that newly established common minke‐whale‐derived immortaliozed cells have completely different profiles from SV40 cells. This result indicates that the expression of mutant CDK4, cyclin D1, and TERT enables to establish immortalized cell lines with different biological nature from SV40 expressing cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Liver fibrosis is the integral process of chronic liver diseases caused by multiple etiologies and characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). During liver fibrosis, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) transform into a highly proliferative, activated state, producing various cytokines, chemokines, and ECM. However, the precise mechanisms that license HSCs into the highly proliferative state remain unclear. Cyclin‐dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is a requisite event for the transition of the G1/S and G2/M phases in eukaryotic cells. In this study, it is demonstrated that CDK1 and its activating partners, Cyclin A2 and Cyclin B1, are upregulated in both liver fibrosis/cirrhosis patient specimens and the murine hepatic fibrosis models, especially in activated HSCs. In vitro, CDK1 is upregulated in spontaneously activated HSCs, and inhibiting CDK1 with specific small‐molecule inhibitors (CGP74514A, RO‐3306, or Purvalanol A) orshort hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) resulted in HSC apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by regulating Survivin expression. Above all, it is illustrated that increased CDK1 expression licenses the HSCs into a highly proliferative state and can serve as a potential therapeutic target in liver fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As regulatory bodies encourage alternatives to animal testing, there is renewed interest in engineering disease models, particularly for cardiac tissues. The aligned organization of cells in the mammalian heart controls the electrical and ionic currents and its ability to efficiently circulate blood to the body. Although the development of engineered cardiac systems is rising, insights into the topographical aspects, in particular, the necessity to design in vitro cardiac models incorporating cues for unidirectional cell growth, is lacking. This review first summarizes the widely used methods to organize cardiomyocytes (CMs) unidirectionally and the ways to quantify the resulting cellular alignment. The behavior of CMs in response to alignment is described, with emphasis on their functions and underlying mechanisms. Lastly, the limitations of state‐of‐the‐art techniques to modulate CM alignment in vitro and opportunities for further development in the future to improve the cardiac tissue models that more faithfully mimic the pathophysiological hallmarks are outlined. This review serves as a call to action for bioengineers to delve deeper into the in vivo role of cellular organization in cardiac muscle tissue and draw inspiration to effectively mimic in vitro for engineering reliable disease models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Seaweeds are a treasure trove of natural secondary metabolites. Terpenoids extracted from seaweeds are shown to possess a variety of antitumor cellular activities. However, due to the complex and diverse structures of terpenoids, their therapeutic targets and complex mechanisms of action have not been clarified. The present study summarises the research on terpenoids from seaweeds in oncological diseases over the last 20 years. Terpenoids show different degrees of inhibitory effects on different types of tumor cells, suggesting that terpenoids in seaweeds may have potential antitumor disease potential. Terpenoids with potential antitumor activity and their mechanism of action are investigated using network pharmacology. A total of 125 terpenoids and 286 targets are obtained. Proto‐oncogene tyrosine‐protein kinase Src(SRC), Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), Mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK3, MAPK1), Heat shock protein HSP 90‐alpha (HSP90AA1), Phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate 3‐kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), and RAC‐alpha serine/threonine‐protein kinase (AKT1) are defined as core targets. According to GO function and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes(KEGG) enrichment analysis, terpenoids may affect the Phoshatidylinositol 3'‐kinase (PI3K)‐Akt signaling pathway, Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, Prostate cancer, MAPK signaling pathway, and Proteoglycans in cancer. In addition, the molecular docking results show that the selected terpenoids are all able to bind strongly to the active protein. Terpenoids may slow down the progression of cancer by controlling apoptosis, proliferation, and protein and enzyme binding.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tumor invasion and metastasis are complex interfacial mechanical processes between the tumor and its surrounding tissue, with the interfacial curvature of tumor playing an important role in cancer progression. In this study, the potential role of interfacial curvature in the prognosis of patients with colon adenocarcinoma is investigated. The front edge interfacial curvature of adenocarcinoma from biopsies of patients in different tumor, lymph node, and metastasis (TNM) stages are calculated and compared, and prognosis assessment is conducted using Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Results reveal that patients with larger interfacial curvature of adenocarcinoma are more likely to belong to higher TNM stages. Concomitantly, in the same TNM stage, patients with increased adenocarcinoma interfacial curvature show worse prognosis with higher recurrence and lower survival rates. Besides, interfacial curvature is an independent prognostic factor for cause‐specific survival and relapse‐free survival among all selected patients. Mechanical models of colon adenocarcinoma invasion and metastasis are established to better understand the close association between interfacial curvature and tumor progression. The results together with hematoxylin and eosin staining indicate that metastasis in stages T3N0M0 and T3N1M0 may be linked to large interfacial curvatures. Therefore, interfacial curvature may serve as a potential index for predicting prognosis in patients with colon adenocarcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In tissue engineering, biomaterials have been used to steer the host response. This determines the outcome of tissue regeneration, which is modulated by multiple growth factors (GFs). Hence, a sustainable delivery system for GFs is necessary to control tissue regeneration actively. A delivery technique of single and multiple GF combinations, using a layer‐by‐layer (LBL) procedure to improve tissue remodeling, is developed. TGF‐β1, PDGF‐ ββ , and IGF‐1 are incorporated on tailor‐made polymeric rods, which could be used as a tool for potential tissue engineering applications, such as templates to induce the formation of in situ tissue engineered blood vessels (TEBVs). Cell response is analyzed in vitro using rat and human dermal fibroblasts for cellular proliferation, fibroblast differentiation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein synthesis. Results revealed a higher loading efficiency and control release of GFs incorporated on chloroform and oxygen plasma‐activated (COX) rods. Single PDGF‐ ββ and IGF‐1 release, and dual release with TGF‐β1 from COX rods, showed higher cell proliferation when compared to COX rods alone. A substantial increase in α‐smooth muscle actin (α‐SMA) is also observed in GF releasing COX rods, with TGF‐β1 COX rods providing the most pronounced differentiation. A significant increase in collagen and elastin synthesis is observed on all GF releasing COX rods compared to control, with COX rods releasing TGF‐β1 and IGF‐1 providing the highest secretion. TGF‐β1 and IGF‐1 releasing COX rods induced higher Glycosaminoglycan (GAG)/DNA amounts than the other GF releasing COX rods. As PDGF‐ ββ and TGF‐β1/PDGF‐ ββ COX rods displayed the highest fibroblast attachment, these rods provided the highest total collagen and elastin production. The attractive results from efficiently incorporating single and multiple GFs on COX rods and their sustainable release to steer cellular behavior suggest a promising route to enrich the formation of in situ engineered tissues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Accurate segregation of chromosomes during anaphase relies on the central spindle and its regulators. A newly raised concept of the central spindle, the bridging fiber, shows that sliding of antiparallel microtubules (MTs) within the bridging fiber promotes chromosome segregation. However, the regulators of the bridging fiber and its regulatory mechanism on MTs sliding remain largely unknown. In this study, the non‐motor microtubule‐associated protein, hyaluronan‐mediated motility receptor (HMMR), is identified as a novel regulator of the bridging fiber. It then identifies that HMMR regulates MTs sliding within the bridging fiber by cooperating with its binding partner HSET. By utilizing a laser‐based cell ablation system and photoactivation approach, the study's results reveal that depletion of HMMR causes an inhibitory effect on MTs sliding within the bridging fiber and disrupts the forced uniformity on the kinetochore‐attached microtubules‐formed fibers (k‐fibers). These are created by suppressing the dynamics of HSET, which functions in transiting the force from sliding of bridging MTs to the k‐fiber. This study sheds new light on the novel regulatory mechanism of MTs sliding within the bridging fiber by HMMR and HSET and uncovers the role of HMMR in chromosome segregation during anaphase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) derive from specialized regions of the endothelium known as the hemogenic endothelium (HE) during embryonic developmental processes. This knowledge opens up new possibilities for designing new strategies to obtain HSCs in vitro from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Previous advances in this field show that the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway plays a crucial role in PSC‐derived HSC formation. In this work, lithium, a GSK3 inhibitor, is identified as an element capable of stabilizing β‐catenin and inducing embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiation in hemangioblast‐like cells, highly consistent with the role of Wnt agonists on ESC differentiation. ESCs treated with 10 m m lithium express CD31+, SCA‐1+, Nkx2‐5+, CD34+, and FLK1+ cells characteristic of the hemangioblast cells that precede HE development. However, 10 m m Li treated cells remain arrested in a hemangioblast‐like phase, which switched into the expression of HE markers after stimulation with maturation medium. The ability of lithium‐treated ESCs to further derive into HE is confirmed after defined maturation, resulting in a rapid increase in cells positive for the HE markers RUNX1 and SOX17. The results represent a novel strategy for generating HSC precursors in vitro as a multipotent source of stem cells for blood disease therapies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biomedical devices such as islet‐encapsulating systems are used for treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Despite recent strides in preventing biomaterial fibrosis, challenges remain for biomaterial scaffolds due to limitations on cells contained within. The study demonstrates that proliferation and function of insulinoma (INS‐1) cells as well as pancreatic rat islets may be improved in alginate hydrogels with optimized gel%, crosslinking, and stiffness. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)‐based graft phenotyping of encapsulated INS‐1 cells and pancreatic islets identified a hydrogel stiffness range between 600 and 1000 Pa that improved insulin Ins and Pdx1 gene expression as well as glucose‐sensitive insulin‐secretion. Barium chloride (BaCl 2 ) crosslinking time is also optimized due to toxicity of extended exposure. Despite possible benefits to cell viability, calcium chloride (CaCl 2 )‐crosslinked hydrogels exhibited a sharp storage modulus loss in vitro. Despite improved stability, BaCl 2 ‐crosslinked hydrogels also exhibited stiffness losses over the same timeframe. It is believed that this is due to ion exchange with other species in culture media, as hydrogels incubated in dIH 2 O exhibited significantly improved stability. To maintain cell viability and function while increasing 3D matrix stability, a range of useful media:dIH 2 O dilution ratios for use are identified. Such findings have importance to carry out characterization and optimization of cell microphysiological systems with high fidelity in vitro.",

New advances in this area have provided with a means to record electrical activity from cells, examining neural firing or epithelial barrier integrity, and stimulate cells through applied electrical fields. Many of these applications utilize invasive implantation systems to perform this interaction in close proximity to the cells in question. Traditionally, the body's immune system fights back against these systems through the foreign body response, limiting the efficacy of long‐term interactions. New technologies in tissue engineering, biomaterials science, and bioelectronics offer the potential to circumvent the foreign body response and create stable long‐term biological interfaces. Looking ahead, the next advancements in the biomedical sciences can truly integrate, interface, and interact with the human body.",

It is critical to identify the keys that regulate the differentiation fate of senescent pre‐osteoblasts. LINC01013 has an essential role in cell stemness, differentiation, and senescence regulation. This study aims to examine the role and mechanism of LINC01013 in regulating osteogenic differentiation in senescent human embryonic osteoblast cell line (hFOB1.19) cells induced by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). The results show that LINC01013 decreased alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization of hFOB1.19 cells in vitro, and the expression of collagen II, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein. LINC01013 knockdown enhances the osteogenesis of hFOB1.19 cells and rescues osteogenic differentiation impaired by H 2 O 2 . METTL3 negatively regulates LINC01013 expression, enhancing hFOB1.19 cells' osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo. METTL3 overexpression can enhance hFOB1.19 cells' osteogenic differentiation impaired by H 2 O 2 . YTHDF2 promotes LINC01013 decay, facilitating osteogenic differentiation. YTHDF2 overexpression rescues hFOB1.19 cells osteogenic differentiation impaired by H 2 O 2 . Taken together, METTL3 upregulates osteogenic differentiation by inhibiting LINC01013, and YTHDF2 accelerates LINC01013 degradation, reducing its inhibitory effect. This study highlights LINC01013 as a key regulator in the fate switching process of senescent hFOB1.19 cells, impacting osteogenic differentiation.",

In the present study, the aim is to develop next‐generation therapeutics against S. aureus by harnessing the drug delivery potential of milk nanovesicles called milk exosomes (mENs). In the present work, a drug system is developed by encapsulating aminobenzylpenicillin (AMP) in mENs (mENs‐AMP). Electron microscopy and zeta‐sizer results indicate that the size of mENs‐AMP ranged from 55.79 ± 2.8 to 85.53 ± 7.4 nm. The AMP loading efficiency in mENs is 88.61% with its sustained release. Fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that mENs are biocompatible with mammary epithelial cells. In vitro studies show that the antibacterial activity and the minimum inhibitory concentrations of mENs‐AMP are eleven times greater and four times lower than that of unencapsulated AMP, respectively. The mENs‐AMP exhibit significantly higher therapeutic efficacy than AMP at the same dosage and treatment frequency. Validation of this approach is demonstrated in mastitis‐affected animals through an observation in the reduction of somatic cell counts and bacterial loads in the milk of treated animals.",

Caloric restriction (CR) plays a pivotal role in modulating the expression of genes associated with key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the glyoxylate cycle. In this study, the chronological lifespan (CLS) of 35 viable single-gene deletion mutants under both non-restricted and CR conditions, focusing on genes related to these metabolic pathways is evaluated. CR is found to increase CLS predominantly in mutants associated with the glycolysis and TCA cycle. However, this beneficial effect of CR is not observed in mutants of the glyoxylate cycle, particularly those lacking genes for critical enzymes like isocitrate lyase 1 (icl1Δ) and malate synthase 1 (mls1Δ). This analysis revealed an increase in isocitrate lyase activity, a key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle, under CR, unlike the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase, which remains unchanged and is specific to the TCA cycle. Interestingly, rapamycin, a compound known for extending lifespan, does not increase the activity of the glyoxylate cycle enzyme. This suggests that CR affects lifespan through a distinct metabolic mechanism.",

Cutting‐edge genomic tools such as Oncomine, gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA), and cBio Cancer Genomics Portal (cBioPortal) are utilized to explore the TOP gene family (TOP1/1MT/2A/2B/3A/3B) in soft‐tissue sarcomas (STSs). This in‐depth analysis reveals a notable upregulation of TOP mRNA in STS patients arcoss various SARC subtypes, French Federation Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer classification (FNCLCC) grades, and specific molecular profiles correlating with poorer clinical outcomes. Furthermore, this investigation identifies distinct patterns of immune cell infiltration, genetic mutations, and somatic copy number variations linked to TOP genes that inversely affect patient survival rates. These findings underscore the diagnostic and therapeutic relevance of the TOP gene suite in STSs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ovarian endometrioma (OE) is a common gynecological condition characterized by the formation of “chocolate cysts”. Recent research indicates that the cyst fluid acts as a “toxic environment” for the ovary and plays a significant role in the development of OE, with macrophages being pivotal. However, the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms of it are not fully understood. In this study, clinical samples are integrated, single‐cell sequencing, in vivo and in vitro experimental models to comprehensively investigate the effects of OE fluid on ovarian function and the mechanisms of it. Combined with bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation, the findings demonstrate that OE fluid can cause ovarian function decline, which associated with inflammatory response, and mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence, while activating the cGAS/STING signaling pathway. As a STING inhibitor, H‐151 effectively alleviates ovarian dysfunction, inflammatory state and cell apoptosis induced by OE fluid. Furthermore, it is also discovered that H‐151 can inhibit OE fluid‐induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence. These findings provide important theoretical and experimental foundations for further research and development of STING inhibitors as potential drugs for treating ovarian dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Premature Aging (PA) diseases are rare genetic disorders that mimic some aspects of physiological aging at an early age. Various causative genes of PA diseases have been identified in recent years, providing insights into some dysfunctional cellular processes. However, the identification of PA genes also revealed significant genetic heterogeneity and highlighted the gaps in this understanding of PA‐associated molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, many patients remain undiagnosed. Overall, the current lack of knowledge about PA diseases hinders the development of effective diagnosis and therapies and poses significant challenges to improving patient care. Here, a network‐based approach to systematically unravel the cellular functions disrupted in PA diseases is presented. Leveraging a network community identification algorithm, it is delved into a vast multilayer network of biological interactions to extract the communities of 67 PA diseases from their 132 associated genes. It is found that these communities can be grouped into six distinct clusters, each reflecting specific cellular functions: DNA repair, cell cycle, transcription regulation, inflammation, cell communication, and vesicle‐mediated transport. That these clusters collectively represent the landscape of the molecular mechanisms that are perturbed in PA diseases, providing a framework for better understanding their pathogenesis is proposed. Intriguingly, most clusters also exhibited a significant enrichment in genes associated with physiological aging, suggesting a potential overlap between the molecular underpinnings of PA diseases and natural aging.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although various strategies have been used to prevent and treat SARS‐CoV‐2, the spread and evolution of SARS‐CoV‐2 is still progressing rapidly. The emerging variants Omicron and its sublineage have a greater ability to spread and escape nearly all current monoclonal antibodies treatments, highlighting an urgent need to develop therapeutics targeting current and emerging Omicron variants or recombinants with breadth and potency. Here, some small molecule drugs are rapidly identified that could covalently binding to receptor binding domain (RBD) protein of Omicron through the combined application of artificial intelligence (AI) and activity‐based protein profiling (ABPP) technology. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and pseudo‐virus neutralization experiments further reveal that an FDA‐approved drug gallic acid has robust neutralization potency against Omicron pseudo‐virus with the IC 50 values of 23.56 × 10 −6 m . Taken together, a platform combining AI intelligence, biochemical, SPR, molecular docking, and pseudo‐virus‐based screening for rapid identification and evaluation of potential anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 small molecule drugs is established and the effectiveness of the platform is validated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Viruses are biological entities embodied in protein‐based nanoparticles devoid of metabolic activity. Hence, the colloidal, interfacial, and chemical reactivity of virus particles (VPs) profoundly affects the fate of natural and artificial viruses in biotic or abiotic aqueous systems. These rely on the physical chemistry at the outer surface of VPs. In other words, whether wild or synthetic VPs and regardless of the scientific fields involved, taming viruses implies thus managing the physical chemistry at the VP external surface. The surface hydrophobicity (SH) of VPs is a critical feature that must be looked at. Still, the literature dealing with nanoscale hydrophobic domains at the proteinaceous surface of VPs underlying their global SH is like a fragmented puzzle. This article provides an overview of the topic from the perspective of modern protein biophysics for updating the classic physicochemical picture of outer VP/water interfaces hitherto accepted. Patterns of non‐polar and “false‐polar” patches, expressing variable hydrophobic degrees according to neighboring polar patches, are now drawn. The extensive discussion of reviewed data generates such fresh ideas to explore in the coming years for better modeling the SH of wild virions or engineered virus‐based nanoparticles, paving the way for new directions in fundamental virology and virus‐based chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), a postsurgical decline in cognitive function, primarily affects older adults and worsens their prognosis. Although elevated interleukin‐12p70 (IL‐12p70) is closely correlated with slower cognitive decline in older adults, its role in POCD remains unclear. Here, IL‐12p70 is identified as a significant mediator of therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on POCD. EA at acupoints ST36, GV20, and GV24 significantly enhanced cognitive behaviors of POCD mice. IL‐12p70, downregulated in POCD mice but rescued by EA treatment, is the cytokine closely associated with EA's therapeutic effect. Clinically, IL‐12p70 is downregulated in older adults’ serum post‐surgery. Furthermore, IL‐12p70 exerts a potent neuroprotective effect in both neuronal cell lines and primary hippocampal neurons. The PI3K‐AKT‐BCL2 axis enriched by in silico analysis is validated as the signaling mechanism underlying IL‐12p70‐induced neuroprotection. In vivo, beneficial effects of EA treatment on the activation of PI3K‐AKT‐BCL2 axis and POCD are reproduced by IL‐12p70 administration but attenuated by IL‐12p70 knockdown. The findings reveal a novel mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of EA on POCD, demonstrating that IL‐12p70 exerts a neuroprotective effect by activating PI3K‐AKT‐BCL2 axis in hippocampal neurons. The newly‐discovered function and mechanism of IL‐12p70 highlight its potential in treating cognitive disorders.",

    "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive cancer with poor response to chemotherapy or radiation, necessitating novel therapeutic approaches. Epigenetic regulation, which is reversible, plays a significant role in cancer progression. CBX3 (HP1γ), a key heterochromatin protein, regulates gene expression by interacting with histone H3 lysine 9 trimethyl (H3K9me3) markers. While CBX3 is linked to tumor progression in various cancers, its role in CCA remains unclear. This study reveals that CBX3 and H3K9me3 enrich the HLTF promoter, a gene involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. HLTF is often inactivated by hypermethylation in other cancers, suggesting tumor-suppressive properties. Depleting CBX3 in CCA cells elevates HLTF expression, reducing proliferation, while HLTF silencing reverses this effect. Furthermore, HLTF overexpression inhibits PI3K-AKT signaling activated by CBX3. These findings suggest CBX3 promotes CCA progression by suppressing HLTF expression.",

Thus, this work aims to evaluate the effect of a 7‐day cold‐water acclimation on the cytoprotective mechanism of autophagy in young males. Further, this work assesses changes in cellular cold tolerance by employing hypothermic ex vivo (whole blood) cooling prior to and following acclimation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are isolated before and after cold exposures on days 1, 4, and 7 of acclimation and following ex vivo cooling. Proteins associated with autophagy, apoptosis, the heat shock response, and inflammation are analyzed via Western blotting. Indicators of autophagic dysfunction paired with increased apoptotic signaling are prevalent at the beginning of acclimation. At the end of acclimation, autophagic activity increased while apoptotic and inflammatory signaling decreased. Although an elevated heat shock response is observed following cold exposure, this does not change throughout the acclimation. Further, improvements of autophagic activity are observed during ex vivo cooling along with a reduction of apoptotic signaling, albeit still elevated compared to basal levels. This work shows that 7‐day cold acclimation elicits improvements in cellular cold tolerance in young males through enhanced autophagic responses concomitant with reductions in apoptotic signaling.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, the effectiveness of combining short‐term starvation (STS or fasting) is investigated with blue light illumination therapy in delaying the progression of various types of cancer, including osteosarcoma, cervical, breast, liver carcinoma, and melanoma cancer in animal models. Moreover, the comparative analysis between cancerous (including HeLa, 143B, MDA‐MB‐231, and HepG2) and normal cell lines (including NCM460, HEKa, and L‐O2), highlights the selectivity of the treatment's cytotoxic effects, favoring cancer cells while largely sparing normal cells. In HeLa cancer cells, treatment with the STS and blue light illumination combination resulted in increased phosphorylation of JNK and p38, which led to the activation of downstream signalling substrates, such as p53 and H2AX. This activation induced mitochondrial and nuclear damage, ultimately leading to tumor cell death. The combination treatment also caused metabolic disorders in tumor cells, which interfered with biomolecule availability and selectively induced lethal effects in tumor cells. Therefore, the combination treatment can be an effective strategy for eliminating cancer.",

    "abstract": "Malaria kills millions of people annually, and it is one of the major causes of preventable mortality in the world. Of the different plasmodium species that induce malaria, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax account for the most severe form of malarial disease in humans. This review focuses on understanding preventive measures, mutation-based disease evolution, malaria-related biomarkers, and potential plant bioactive components for the treatment and management of malaria. The burden of malaria drug resistance has made it necessary for scientists to focus on alternative therapeutics, with particular interests in those involving plant-based bioactive components that could mediate biochemical pathways, consisting of metabolic interactions essential for parasitic inhibition. To avoid artefacts or false positives, these bioactive components from plant sources are further filtered using the \"pan-assay-interfering compounds\" (PAINS) tool. This review discussed the history of malaria treatment, current treatment options, malaria preventive measures, and challenges associated with current treatment strategies. Additionally, this work discusses the barriers while developing drugs from phytochemicals and the steps needed to accelerate the development of new antimalarial from the lead compounds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Meckel's cartilage, a cartilage rod present in the mandible during developmental stages, shows a unique developmental fate: while the anterior and posterior portions undergo ossification, the middle part degenerates. Previously, it was shown that a stiff environment promoted cartilage degeneration in the middle region, while a soft environment enhanced the mineralization in the anterior region of Meckel's cartilage. This study aims to elucidate the spatio‐temporal changes in the mechanosensing properties of Meckel's cartilage during its early developmental stages and clarify the mechanotransduction‐related mechanisms involved in its degeneration. The results show that the expression of Hippo pathway effector yes‐associated protein (YAP) is only detectable in the Meckel's cartilage onward embryonic day (E)14.5, indicating that mechanosensing is dependent on the tissue developmental stage. Consistently, microenvironmental stiffness‐induced cartilage degeneration can only be induced in cartilages onward E14.5, but not in those at earlier developmental stages. Expressions of integrin‐β1 and cartilage matrix‐degrading enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP‐1) and MMP‐13, are significantly enhanced in the degeneration area. Moreover, verteporfin (YAP inhibitor) and integrin‐β1 antibody block the substrate stiffness‐induced degeneration by suppressing the expressions of MMP‐1 and MMP‐13. These data provide new insights into the interplay between biochemical and mechanical cues determining the fate of Meckel's cartilage.",

Therefore, it is hypothesized that the process by which epidural fat MPCs maintain the dura mater can be accelerated in p21 −/− mice. Using a Prx1 lineage tracing mouse model, the epidural fat MPCs are found to increase in the dura mater over time in both C57BL/6 ( p21 +/+ ) and p21 −/− mice; however, by 3 weeks post‐tamoxifen induction, few MPCs are observed in p21 −/− mice. These endogenous MPCs also localize to dural injuries in both mouse strains, with MPCs in p21 −/− mice demonstrating increased proliferation. When epidural fat MPCs derived from p21 −/− mice are transplanted into dural injuries in C57BL/6 mice, these MPCs are found in the injury site. It is demonstrated that epidural fat MPCs play a role in dural tissue maintenance and are able to directly contribute to dural injury repair. This suggests that these MPCs have the potential to treat injuries and/or pathologies in tissues surrounding the spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) can improve cardiac function and cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic cardiomyopathy; however, the beneficial effect of GLP‐1 on human diabetic cardiomyocytes (DCMs) and its mechanism have not been fully elucidated. Here, the DCMs model by human‐induced pluripotent stem cells‐derived cardiomyocytes is developed. Two subtypes of GLP‐1, GLP‐1 7–36 and GLP‐1 9‐36 , are evaluated for their efficacy on the DCMs model. Diabetogenic condition is sufficient to induce most characteristics of diabetic cardiomyopathy in vitro, such as cardiac hypertrophy, lipid accumulation, impaired calcium transients, and abnormal electrophysiological properties. GLP‐1 7−36 and GLP‐1 9–36 can restore cardiomyocyte hypertrophic phenotype, impaired calcium transient frequency, abnormal action potential amplitude, depolarization, and repolarization velocity. Interestingly, RNA‐seq reveals different pathways altered by GLP‐1 7–36 and GLP‐1 9–36 , respectively. Differentially expressed gene analysis reveals that possible targets of GLP‐1 7–36 involve the regulation of mitotic nuclear division and extracellular matrix–receptor interaction, while possible targets of GLP‐1 9–36 involve kinetochore assembly, and the complement and coagulation cascades. This study demonstrates the therapeutic effects of GLP‐1 on human DCMs and provides a novel platform to unveil the cellular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy, shedding light on discovering better targets for novel therapeutic interventions.",

NG,NG-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAHs) are enzymes involved in the nitric oxide-protein kinase G signaling axis which increases thermogenic gene expression. However, the role of DDAHs in thermogenic adipocytes has not been elucidated. The adipocyte-specific Ddah1 knockout mice are generated by crossing Ddah1fl/fl mice with adiponectin Cre recombinase mice. Adipocyte-specific DDAH1 overexpressing mice are generated using adeno-associated virus-double-floxed inverse open reading frame (AAV-DIO) system. These mice are analyzed under basal, cold exposure, or high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. Primary inguinal white adipose tissue cells from adipocyte-specific Ddah1 knockout mice expressed comparable amounts of Ucp1 mRNA. Adipocyte-specific DDAH1 overexpressing mice do not exhibit enhanced activation of thermogenic adipocytes. In addition, when these mice are exposed to cold environment or fed an HFD, their body temperature/weight and thermogenesis-related gene and protein expressions are unchanged. These findings indicate that DDAH1 does not play a role in either cold- or diet-induced thermogenesis. Therefore, adipocyte targeting DDAH1 gene therapy for the treatment of obesity is unlikely to be effective.",

Attempts to shorten the doubling time of cultured cells have never ceased. In plants, auxin is applied to promote plant growth, the synthetic derivative 1‐Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) is a good example. Despite the auxin's naturally occurring receptors are not present in mammalian cells, studies suggested they may affect cell culturing. Yet the effects and mechanisms are still unclear. Here, an up to 2‐fold increase in the yield of in vitro cultured human cells is observed. Different types of human cell lines and primary cells are tested and found that NAA is effective in all the cells tested. The PI staining followed by FACS suggested that NAA do not affect the cell cycling. Apoptosis‐specific dye staining analysis implicated that NAA rescued cell death. Further bulk RNA sequencing is done and it is identified that the lipid metabolism‐engaging and anti‐apoptosis gene, ANGPTL4, is enhanced in expression upon NAA treatment. Studies on ANGPTL4 knockout cells indicated that ANGPTL4 is required for NAA‐mediated response. Thus, the data identified a beneficial role of NAA in human cell culturing and highlighted its potency in in vitro cell culturing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oxidative stress (OXS) is closely related to tumor prognosis and immune response, while TP53 integrated with NRF2 is closely associated with the regulation of cancer‐related OXS. Hence, constructing a TP53‐NRF2 integrated OXS signature of pan‐cancer is essential in predicting survival prognosis and facilitating cancer drug treatment. The pan‐cancer analysis acquired the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) transcriptome sequencing data from UCSC Xena, which consisted of 33 cancer types ( n = 10 440). The Random Forest, Lasso regression, and Cox regression analyses are used to construct an OXS score based on 25 OXS genes. Following this, based on the OXS signature, patients are categorized into low‐ and high‐risk groups. The disparities between the two cohorts regarding survival prognosis, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity are delved deeply. The expression level of genes is confirmed using immunohistochemistry. The prognosis of pan‐cancer patients is adequately predicted by the OXS signature with the assistance of the machine‐learning algorithm. A highly accurate nomogram is developed by combining the OXS signature and clinical features. The presence of immune cells indicated that the OXS signature can be associated with the critical pathways of immunotherapy for all types of cancer, and BCL2 showed promising results. Distinct inter‐group differences are observed in the OXS signature for frequently utilized antineoplastic medications in clinical settings, including first‐line drugs suggested in the guidelines. In summary, by conducting a thorough analysis of OXS genes, a new model based on OXSscore is successfully developed. This model can predict the clinical prognosis and drug sensitivity of pan‐cancer with high accuracy. Potential stars in the field of cancer‐related anti‐OXS may include drugs that target BCL2.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The progression of primary tumors to metastases remains a significant roadblock to the treatment of most cancers. Emerging evidence has identified genes that specifically affect metastasis and are potential therapeutic targets for managing tumor progression. However, these genes can have dual tumor promoter and suppressor functions that are contextual in manifestation, and that complicate their development as targeted therapies. CD44 and RHAMM/HMMR are examples of multifunctional proteins that can either promote or suppress metastases, as demonstrated in experimental models. These two proteins can be viewed as microenvironmental sensors and this minireview addresses the known mechanistic underpinnings that may determine their metastasis suppressor versus promoter functions. Leveraging this mechanistic knowledge for CD44, RHAMM, and other multifunctional proteins is predicted to improve the precision of therapeutic targeting to achieve more effective management of metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that glia maturation factor β (GMFβ) is important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hpertension (PAH), but the underlying mechanism is unknown. To clarify whether GMFβ can be involved in pulmonary vascular remodeling and to explore the role of the IL-6-STAT3 pathway in this process, the expression of GMFβ in PAH rats is examined and the expression of downstream molecules including periostin (POSTN) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) is measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. The location and expression of POSTN is also tested in PAH rats using immunofluorescence. It is proved that GMFβ is upregulated in the lungs of PAH rats. Knockout GMFβ alleviated the MCT-PAH by reducing right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Moreover, the inflammation of the pulmonary vasculature is ameliorated in PAH rats with GMFβ absent. In addition, the IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway is activated in PAH; knockout GMFβ reduced POSTN and IL-6 production by inhibiting the IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that knockout GMFβ ameliorates PAH in rats by inhibiting the IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Obesity is a significant global health concern linked to excessive dietary energy intake. This research focuses on the mammalian hairless protein (HR), known for its role in skin and hair function, and its impact on metabolism. Examining male wild‐type ( Hr +/+ ) and Hr null ( Hr −/− ) mice over a 14‐week normal chow diet (NCD) or high‐fat diet (HFD) intervention. This study reveals that HR deficiency exhibited a protective effect against HFD‐induced obesity and insulin resistance. This protective effect is attributed to increased energy expenditure in Hr −/− mice. Moreover, the brown adipose tissue (BAT) of Hr −/− mice displays elevated levels of the thermogenic protein, uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), and its key transcriptional regulators (PPARγ and PGC1α), compared to Hr +/+ mice. In summary, the findings underscore the protective role of HR deficiency in countering HFD‐induced adiposity by enhancing insulin sensitivity, raising energy expenditure, and augmenting thermogenic factors in BAT. Further exploration of HR metabolic regulation holds promise for potential therapeutic targets in addressing obesity‐related metabolic disorders.",

It is often a benign disease but can have significant morbidity and mortality when the heart is involved (often presenting with clinical manifestations such as conduction irregularities and heart failure). This study addresses a critical gap in cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) research by developing a robust animal model. The absence of a reliable animal model for cardiac sarcoidosis is a significant obstacle in advancing understanding and treatment of this condition. The proposed model utilizes carbon nanotube injection and transverse aortic constriction as stressors. Intramyocardial injection of carbon nanotubes induces histiocytes typical of sarcoid granulomas in the heart but shows limited effects on fibrosis or cardiac function. Priming the immune system with transverse aortic constriction prior to intramyocardial injection of carbon nanotubes enhances cardiac fibrosis, diminishes cardiac function, and impairs cardiac conduction. This novel, easily executable model may serve as a valuable tool for disease profiling, biomarker identification, and therapeutic exploration.",

Here, the alternative end-joining mechanism is reported rather than PCR artifacts accounts largely for that VNTRs formation and expansion. During generating a point mutation on GPLD1 gene, an unexpected formation of VNTRs employing the 31 bp mutagenesis primers is observed as the repeat unit in the pcDNA3.1-GPLD1 plasmid. The 31 bp VNTRs are formed in 24.75% of the resulting clones with copy number varied from 2 to 13. All repeat units are aligned with the same orientation as GPLD1 gene. 43.54% of the repeat junctions harbor nucleotide mutations while the rest don't. Their demonstrated short primers spanning the 3' part of the mutagenesis primers are essential for initial creation of the 2-copy tandem repeats (TRs) in circular plasmids. The dimerization of mutagenesis primers by the alternative end-joining in a correct orientation is required for further expansion of the 2-copy TRs. Lastly, a half-double priming strategy is established, verified the findings and offered a simple method for VNTRs creation on coding genes in circular plasmids without junction mutations.",

It is a result of both genetic and non‐genetic factors. Although much research has been conducted on the genetic contributors to other forms of cognitive impairment (e.g. Alzheimer's disease), knowledge is lacking on the genetic factors associated with VCI. A better understanding of the genetics of VCI will be critical for prevention and treatment. To begin to fill this gap, the genetic contributors are reviewed with VCI from the literature. Phenome‐wide scans of the identified genes are conducted and genetic variants identified in the review in large‐scale resources displaying genetic variant‐trait association information. Gene set are also carried out enrichment analysis using the genes identified from the review. Thirty one articles are identified meeting the search criteria and filters, from which 107 unique protein‐coding genes are noted related to VCI. The phenome‐wide scans and gene set enrichment analysis identify pathways associated with a diverse set of biological systems. This results indicate that genes with evidence of involvement in VCI are involved in a diverse set of biological functions. This information can facilitate downstream research to better dissect possible shared biological mechanisms for future therapies.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance and expansion of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in 3D tissue scaffolds is a promising strategy in producing cost-effective hNSCs with quality and quantity applicable for clinical applications. A few biopolymers have been extensively used to fabricate 3D scaffolds, including hyaluronic acid, collagen, alginate, and chitosan, due to their bioactive nature and availability. However, these polymers are usually applied in combination with other biomolecules, leading to their responses difficult to ascribe to. Here, scaffolds made of chitosan, alginate, hyaluronic acid, or collagen, are explored for hNSC expansion under xeno-free and chemically defined conditions and compared for hNSC multipotency maintenance. This study shows that the scaffolds made of pure chitosan support the highest adhesion and growth of hNSCs, yielding the most viable cells with NSC marker protein expression. In contrast, the presence of alginate, hyaluronic acid, or collagen induces differentiation toward immature neurons and astrocytes even in the maintenance medium and absence of differentiation factors. The cells in pure chitosan scaffolds preserve the level of transmembrane protein profile similar to that of standard culture. These findings point to the potential of using pure chitosan scaffolds as a base scaffolding material for hNSC expansion in 3D.",

However, not all somatic mutations result in immunogenicity, hence, efficient tools to predict the immunogenicity of neoepitopes are needed. A pipeline is presented that provides a comprehensive solution for the identification of neoepitopes based on genomic sequencing data. The pipeline consists of a data pre‐processing step and three machine learning predictive steps. The pre‐processing step analyzes genomic data for different types of alterations, produces a list of all possible antigens, and determines the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type and T‐cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. The first predictive step performs a classification into antigens and neoantigens, selecting neoantigens for further consideration. The next step predicts the strength of binding between neoantigens and available major histocompatibility complexes of class I (MHC‐I). The third step is engaged to predict the likelihood of inducing an immune response. Neoepitopes satisfying all three predictive stages are assumed to be potent candidates to ensure immunogenicity. The predictive pipeline is used in two regimes: selecting neoantigens from patients' sequencing data and generating novel neoantigen candidates. Two different techniques — Monte Carlo and Reinforcement Learning – are implemented to facilitate the generative regime.",

Recent studies show that the addition of PEG 300 to culture medium affects cell growth and differentiation; however, its effect on the embryoid body is unclear. This study aims to understand the role of PEG 300 in the process of EB formation and germ layer differentiation. EBs formed more efficiently and differentiated toward the mesoderm when cultured in a medium supplemented with appropriate concentrations of PEG 300. The expression of T/Bry, a marker of mesodermal differentiation, increases in EBs in the PEG group, and the expression of TUBB3 generally decreases, showing a quantitative relationship with PEG. Furthermore, further differentiation of PEG‐pretreated EB into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) by directional induction shows that PEG 300‐pretreated induced VSMCs have higher expression of phenotypic markers and greater secretory and contractile functions. This study highlights the role of PEG 300 in the culture medium during EB differentiation, which can significantly enhance mesodermal gene expression and the efficiency of subsequent differentiation into smooth muscle cells and other target cells.",

This joint special issue aims to curate a wide-ranging collection of works including tissue engineering, biomaterials, biofabrication, and the implementation of these advances into complex models of human pathophysiology. The issue, guest edited by Martin Trapecar, Ramana Sidhaye, and Deok-Ho Kim (founding members of the new Center for Microphysiological Systems at Johns Hopkins University), is being jointly published in Advanced Biology and Advanced Healthcare Materials. You find all articles in a virtual collection. Part I: Advanced Biology Manuscripts The studies and reviews in Advanced Biology highlight significant advancements in bioengineering, specifically in the development and application of microphysiological systems (MPS), hydrogel optimization, and stem cell-derived models for biomedical research. Collectively, these efforts underscore the potential of these technologies to transform various fields, including angiogenesis, cancer immunotherapy, diabetes treatment, drug development, respiratory health, and neurological research. Lam et al. (article 202300094) developed and validated a high-throughput bioassay to assess the angiogenic bioactivity of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). They identified hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene expression as a potential biomarker for MSC angiogenic activity. The novelty here lies in the C-Curio MPS as a tool for evaluating MSC potency and the identification of HGF as a surrogate marker. Peng and Lee (article 202300077) then review the use of MPS (e.g., organs-on-a-chip) in cancer immunotherapy research, emphasizing their advantages over traditional methods. The article highlights the application of MPS in analyzing immune cell interactions and the tumor microenvironment, with potential use in personalized medicine and immunotherapy. Quiroz et al. (article 202300502) focused on optimizing alginate hydrogels for cell encapsulation to improve viability and function for type 1 diabetes models and found conditions that enhance the function of encapsulated cells. This advance will improve cell graft viability and function in vitro. Tomlinson et al. (article 202300131) discuss the use of MPS in drug development, emphasizing the need for standardization and regulatory acceptance. They highlight the importance of defining the context of use, characterizing materials, and developing reference test items. Guo et al. (article 202300276) describe a protocol to differentiate neurons from human iPSCs and created an opioid overdose model to study respiratory inhibition by opioids. The neurons expressed the mu-opioid receptor and responded to opioids, with naloxone reversing the effects. The novelty here is in developing a cellular model for studying opioid-induced respiratory depression, offering a platform for drug screening and mechanistic investigation. Lagowala et al. (article 202300165) utilized three microphysiological models to study the pulmonary system and interactions between epithelial and immune cells in COPD and cigarette smoke injury. The models showed that co-culture with epithelial cells is necessary for macrophage polarization and altering epithelial actin dynamics. The strength of this system is the opportunity to mimic complex lung interactions, providing a more physiologically relevant platform for studying lung diseases. Morales Pantoja et al. (article 202300198) presented a method to increase the population of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in brain microphysiological systems (bMPS) using a chemically defined glial-enriched medium (GEM). They demonstrated that GEM enhances glial cell populations, neurite outgrowth, and cell migration without compromising neuronal differentiation. The novelty is in developing a culture medium that promotes glial cell enrichment in brain organoids, improving the functionality of bMPS for neurological disease research and drug discovery. The collective findings from these studies in Advanced Biology underscore the transformative potential of advanced bioengineering techniques in biomedical research. Each study contributes novel insights and methodologies, paving the way for more realistic and effective models in various fields, with the goal of ultimately improving health outcomes and advancing translational medicine.

Urciolo et al. (article 202400357) explored the challenges in replicating functional barrier organs' microenvironments, emphasizing the dynamic role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the need for MPS that faithfully reproduce native cell-ECM interactions. Shoji et al. (article 202301067) conducted a literature analysis of organoid and organ-on-a-chip research, revealing significant growth in gastrointestinal and neural organoid studies and the increasing use of human cells. This work underscores the need for more detailed disease-specific models and the potential for multiorgan systems.

Also, the uniqueness and existence of solutions are calculated based on the fixed point hypothesis. For the fractional order co‐infection model, its positivity and boundedness are demonstrated. Furthermore, different types of Ulam‐Hyres stability are also discussed. The numerical solution of the model are obtained by using the operational matrix of the Hermite wavelet approach. This scheme is used to solve the system of nonlinear equations that are very fruitful and easy to implement. Additionally, the stability analysis of the numerical scheme is explained. The mathematical model taken in this work incorporates the biological characteristics of both HIV‐1 and HTLV‐I. After that all the equilibrium points of the fractional order co‐infection model are found and their existence conditions are explored with the help of the Caputo derivative. The global stability of all equilibrium points of this model are determined with the help of Lyapunov functions and the LaSalle invariance principle. Convergence analysis is also discussed. Hermite wavelet operational matrix methods are more accurate and convergent than other numerical methods. Lastly, variations in model dynamics are found when examining different fractional order values. These findings will be valuable to biologists in the treatment of HIV‐1/HTLV‐I.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The management of extensive tracheal resection followed by circumferential replacement remains a surgical challenge. Numerous techniques are proposed with mixed results. Partial decellularization of the trachea with the removal of the mucosal and submucosal cells is a promising method, reducing immunogenicity while preserving the biomechanical properties of the final matrix. Despite many research protocols and proofs of concept, no standardized clinical grade protocol is described. Furthermore, local and systemic biointegration mechanisms of decellularized trachea are not well known. Therefore, in a translational research perspective, this work set up a partial tracheal decellularization protocol in line with Cell and Tissue Products regulations . Extensive characterization of the final product is performed in vitro and in vivo. The results show that the Partially Decellularized Trachea (PDT) is cell‐free in the mucosa and submucosa, while the cartilage structure is preserved, maintaining the biomechanical properties of the trachea. When implanted in the muscle in vivo for 28 days, no systemic inflammation is observed, and locally, the PDT shows an excellent biointegration and vascularization. No signs of graft rejection are observed. These encouraging results confirmed the efficacy of the clinical grade PDT production protocol, which is an important step for future clinical applications.",

Therefore, understanding the potential molecular mechanisms that facilitate the regeneration of damaged nerves is crucial. Evidence indicates that Schwann cells (SCs) play a pivotal role in repairing peripheral nerve injuries. Previous studies have shown that RNA, particularly non‐coding RNA (ncRNA), plays a crucial role in nerve regeneration, including the proliferation and dedifferentiation of SCs. In this review, the individual roles of ncRNA in SCs and PNI are analyzed. This review not only enhances the understanding of ncRNA's role in nerve injury repair but also provides a significant theoretical foundation and inspiration for the development of new therapeutic strategies.",

In this study, the potential involvement of salt inducible kinase SIK2) in this cascade within retinal Müller glia is explored. It is found that SIK2 phosphorylation status and activity are modulated in an FGF2-dependent manner, possibly via ERK1/2. With SIK2 downregulation, enhanced ERK1/2 activation with delayed attenuation and increased cell proliferation is observed, while SIK2 overexpression hampers FGF2-dependent ERK1/2 activation. In vitro kinase and site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that SIK2 targets the pathway element GRB2-associated-binding protein 1 (Gab1) on Ser266. This phosphorylation event weakens Gab1 interactions with its partners growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and Src homology region 2 domain containing phosphatase 2 (Shp2). Collectively, these results suggest that during FGF2-dependent proliferation process ERK1/2-mediated activation of SIK2 targets Gab1, resulting in downregulation of the Ras/ERK1/2 cascade in a feedback loop.",

    "abstract": "Abstract People all over the world, independent of their culture or background, touch their faces up to 800 times per day. No other part of the body is touched as often as the face. Forehead, nose, and chin—the so‐called T‐zone of the face—are touched particularly frequently during spontaneous facial self‐touches (sFST). It is hypothesized that there is a relationship between the density of mechanoreceptors (inferred from facial hair distribution) and the frequency of spontaneous self‐touching. In order to indirectly measure the density of mechanoreceptors (cutaneous end organ complexes), the number of vellus and terminal hairs at 40 different measuring points on the face of 30 (15f/15m) healthy volunteers in study A is determined. In study B, the frequency of sFST at the same 40 measuring points in 66 (32f/34m) healthy persons is determined. Study A reveals that the number of facial hairs—in both sexes—is higher in the T‐zone than in other areas of the face. Study B reveals that the T‐zone is touched more frequently than other areas of the face. Skin areas of the face with a higher number of vellus hairs (and presumably higher innervation density) are touched particularly frequently during sFST.",

It is confirmed that three different fluorescent proteins, encoded by genes integrated at different loci, can be coexpressed at high levels. Further, a stable cell line is generated, producing antigens from different human coronaviruses: MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43.

The FPFC performs a cascade of cell processing steps on a microfluidic platform: introduces biological cells one at a time into a solution of a biological reagent that acts as a stimulus, incubates the cells with the stimulus solution in a flow, and sorts the cells into subpopulations according to their phenotypic responses to the provided stimulus. The presented implementation of the FPFC uses intracellular fluorescence as a readout, incubates cells for 75 s, and operates at a throughput of up to 4 cells min −1 —resulting in the profiling and sorting of hundreds of cells within a few hours. The design and operation of the FPFC are validated by sorting cells from the human Burkitt's lymphoma cancerous cell line Ramos on the basis of their response to activation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) by a targeted monoclonal antibody.",

Accumulating evidence suggests that internalized receptors play critical roles in triggering cellular signaling, including transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling. Despite intensive studies on the TGFβ pathway over the last decades, the necessity of TGFβ receptor endocytosis for downstream TGFβ signaling responses is a subject of debate. In this study, mathematical modeling and synthetic biology approaches are combined to re‐evaluate whether TGFβ receptor internalization is indispensable for inducing Smad signaling. It is found that optogenetic systems with plasma membrane‐tethered TGFβ receptors can induce fast and sustained Smad2 activation upon light stimulations. Modeling analysis suggests that endocytosis is precluded for the membrane‐anchored optogenetic TGFβ receptors. Therefore, this study provides new evidence to support that TGFβ receptor internalization is not required for Smad2 activation.",

    "abstract": "Healthy Aging As part of our series on emerging life sciences, the editor speaks with Drs Vince C. Marconi MD and Kris Ann Oursler MD, principal investigators at Emory University and Virginia Tech, respectively, about their research pathway into healthy aging and their passion for advancing whole-body health. Drs Marconi and Oursler reflect on personal and professional experiences motivating their research and the road ahead as we begin 2023. 1. Can you share a life event or activity that informs your view on healthy aging? VCM: After returning from overseas military deployment to Iraq and relocating to a new job in Atlanta, I struggled with both physical and psychosocial challenges. The usual, siloed strategies to address these challenges fell short. After discovering a body of literature demonstrating the biological impact of the experience of stress on the immune system through neuroendocrine pathways,[1-7] I shifted my approach to incorporate an integrative strategy in my personal and professional life. Of particular interest, the interplay, history and mechanistic details of immune response to viral infections (HIV, SARS-CoV-2), psychological trauma, and long-term comorbid burden have broad implications for healthy aging. Following these collective insights, we began an exploration of whether stress and trauma experienced by patients with HIV in our clinic might be mitigated by a special kind of meditation and mindfulness practice known as Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT®), developed by a team working with the Dalai Lama and Emory University investigators. In the initial randomized, active attention-control trial, we found increasing CBCT practice time reduced objective levels of circulating inflammatory factors and subjective psychological stress.[8] Demonstrating a mechanistic link between psychological experience and biological markers for patients from an inner city HIV clinic and the benefits of using a non-pharmacologic intervention. These data were convincing enough for me to continue pursuing this general approach in my health sciences research. KAO: My career path has also been informed by my research on patients with HIV. Effective antiretroviral therapy was just becoming feasible when I joined the faculty in the Department of Medicine at the University of Maryland. I observed firsthand as middle-aged veterans with HIV would succumb to cancer and myocardial infarction after successfully controlling viral burden, a task that frequently required first overcoming drug addiction and home insecurity. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to explore the phenotype of biological aging in people with HIV (PWH) in the Veterans Cohort Study (VACS) under the mentorship of Amy Justice. Trained as an Infectious Diseases physician, the complexity of aging as a process was new to me. This quickly changed when the late Andrew Goldberg invited me to join the Division of Geriatrics and Gerontology, which championed physical activity and exercise training modalities as a strategy for healthy aging. A pivotal life event for me was when a veteran named Mr. K. who had HIV, diabetes and peripheral vascular disease volunteered for an exercise trial we were conducting. The trial's screening treadmill test showed previously undiagnosed ischemic heart disease which led to open heart surgery, and, because of the early diagnosis, Mr. K. had a remarkable recovery. Mr. K. returned to complete the exercise trial, resulting in complete resolution of his arterial claudication and improved diabetes. Multiple benchmarks of healthy aging are improved with exercise – from sarcopenia to polypharmacy. I was also struck by the positive impact that exercise had on Mr. K, not just his comorbidity and quality of life, but also his resilience. 2. What scientific insights have informed your view that life in the modern era is often characterized by chronic un-wellness? VCM: Most low and middle-income countries have a greater proportion of deaths due to infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies.[9] As these countries increase their economic well-being, chronic non-communicable diseases (NCD) and mental health conditions emerge as an important cause of death. A debate persists as to whether this reflects a survivor bias whereby individuals avoiding infectious disease deaths then live long enough to develop age-related comorbidities or if technological advancements have resulted in more sedentary lives, increased psychological stress, more processed foods, and disintegrated social networks increasing the prevalence of NCDs and mental health disorders. Since the late 1930's, the U.S. has climbed to the top globally in gross domestic product per capita without relinquishing this spot in nearly 100 years. Despite this standing, NCD's and mental health conditions continue to increase, in contrast with our success in treating malaria, smallpox, yellow fever, tuberculosis, and diarrheal diseases. Notably, deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD), influenza, and pneumonia have substantially decreased since 1950 while cancer deaths remained stable. However, dementia, suicide, drug, and alcohol related deaths have substantially increased over the past 20 years. Along with these changes, the U.S. (the only high-income country to do so) has experienced a decline in life expectancy since 2008, well before COVID-19 had an appreciable impact. 3. Can you elaborate on healthy aging as a holistic outcome? KAO: Viewpoints on holistic outcomes are as diverse as the definitions of the word holistic. One I favor is by Patrick Pietroni who defined the patient as “a multidimensional being, possessing body, mind and spirit, all inextricably connected, each part affecting the and whole and the whole being greater than the sum of the parts”.[10] Older clinicians will recall the “biopsychosocial model”.[11] Younger clinicians more often spend questionable time looking at the computer screen rather than their patient's face or life history. For me, healthy aging is more than the absence of disease. It requires more than multidimensional integrated treatment. Relating back to my first lesson in gerontology, healthy aging in an individual requires consideration of “quality” in the biology of aging in concert with social determinants of health and, of course, prevention of disease and disability. VCM: Because neurohormonal pathways that connect psychosocial experience with the immunologic milieu determine disease emergence, progression, and response, I think that approaches that address the synergistic relationships between mind (cognitive/behavioral), body (motor/sensory/autonomic/cellular/molecular), and spirit (affective) domains will be most successful at optimizing quality of life and healthy aging. In this synergy model, alterations in one domain invariably create a disruption in the other. Therefore, any intervention affecting one of these areas could be potentially offset or be augmented through compensatory changes in other domains. 4. Where do you see progress in mechanistic pathways that underlay healthy aging? VCM: Substantial progress has been made in translational geroscience over the past decade due in part to advances in systems biology and multi-omics technology. Over the next decade, we anticipate the discovery of composite markers that capture both global senescence and organ-specific aging phenotypes. These composite markers should incorporate functional assessments, multi-morbidity, and biological profiles with special attention to bioenergetic, immunologic, neurologic, and hormonal mechanistic pathways. Concurrent with these efforts, proof-of-concept trials of interventions targeting these pathways (hypothalamic-pituitary-axis, mTOR, Jak-STAT, NF-kB, etc.) will provide invaluable insight into the strategic design of therapeutics with the express purpose of mitigating adverse aging outcomes. 5. As guest editors of the upcoming special issue, “Healthy aging: linking causal mechanisms with holistic outcomes”, how do you measure success? KAO: Aging transcends all clinical disciplines and is driven by mechanisms from basic science to behavioral health. Therefore, my first goal of the issue is to encourage collaboration across not just across disciplines but also research approaches. Funding, and thus research opportunity, tends to be placed in a single area of one of these domains and needs updating to accommodate the growth in interdisciplinary research in aging. This objective would be realized by more announcements akin to the Paul B. Beeson Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging. A second goal relates to my research focus, and personal interest, in exercise. I would like to see translational research in diverse areas coalesce into major advances that prioritize healthspan over lifespan. Another personal measure of success would be for me to continue to ride my bike over mountains for the next 2 decades. VCM: A key challenge for researchers pursuing holistic approaches to scientific inquiry is the need to connect seemingly disparate disciplines and concepts, which requires innovative paradigms and novel perspectives. Since each discipline possesses a unique culture and intellectual foundation, bridging these divides is compulsory for cross-cutting investigation to thrive. It is conceivable that this thematic issue could serve as an incubator for investigators to explore and cultivate these collaborations. Measures of success would include (1) funded grants and calls for proposals employing these strategies, (2) publications which arise beyond this thematic issue, and (3) conferences or meetings which include a focus on holistic science and that embrace complexity. A podcast based on this interview and a special collection of papers related to healthy aging will be published in our partner journal Aging Cell in mid-2023.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Esophageal pathologies such as atresia and benign strictures often require surgical reconstruction with autologous tissues to restore organ continuity. Complications such as donor site morbidity and limited tissue availability have spurred the development of acellular grafts for esophageal tissue replacement. Acellular biomaterials for esophageal repair rely on the activation of intrinsic regenerative mechanisms to mediate de novo tissue formation at implantation sites. Previous research has identified signaling cascades involved in neoepithelial formation in a rat model of onlay esophagoplasty with acellular silk fibroin grafts, including phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling. However, it is currently unknown how these mechanisms are governed by DNA methylation (DNAme) during esophageal wound healing processes. Reduced‐representation bisulfite sequencing is performed to characterize temporal DNAme dynamics in host and regenerated tissues up to 1 week postimplantation. Overall, global hypermethylation is observed at postreconstruction timepoints and an inverse correlation between promoter DNAme and the expression levels of differentially expressed proteins during regeneration. Site‐specific hypomethylation targets genes associated with immune activation, while hypermethylation occurs within gene bodies encoding PI3K‐Akt signaling components during the tissue remodeling period. The data provide insight into the epigenetic mechanisms during esophageal regeneration following surgical repair with acellular grafts.",

    "abstract": "While there are multiple metrics for assigning impact and value of authors and published work, there remain substantial limitations. This editorial will briefly introduce current popular metrics and proposes a need for improved methodology in identifying value in the research publishing industry. Using this calculation, the JIF doesn't account for the volume of papers published, nor the months in press prior to the JIF calculation. Perhaps more importantly, this metric does not attribute value to the type of research, the researcher, and the journals where the research is published. In effect, this approach does not adequately incorporate value intrinsic to the authors nor productive research in their respective fields of study. Another important metric in mainstream publishing that, while useful, nevertheless limits ascertainment of value is the h-index.[2] The h-index is a measure of the impact of a researcher based on how often their publications have been cited. For example, if an author in 2022 has an h-index of 15, that means that they have published 15 papers up to 2022 and that each of those papers have received at least 15 citations. On the surface, this seems reasonable. However, there are concerns. First, in the above example, the h-index would only credit the author for 225 career citations (i.e., 15 papers x 15 citations per paper = 225). But what if that same author had 1,500 career citations? This would mean that the h-index credits the author for only 15% (225/1500) of their published work. Secondly, the h-index dimensionally reduces the author value to one number and often used by research publishing professionals in their commissioning strategy. We assert that author value is multidimensional. Because the h-index is a unidimensional metric, its limitations need to be fully recognized. Beyond the h-index, there are other popular but limited approaches that assign value to papers and authors. They include bias based on total number of publications, based on the assumption that publishing volume equates to value, i.e., more volume = more value. Indeed, publishers and their journals tend to bias their content acquisition strategies towards this value archetype, placing less value on early-stage investigators doing phenomenal research, often in nascent fields that are likely to become highly relevant, and possibly disruptive. This trend in disincentivizing disruptive value has large scale effects on research.[3] With the current model, publishers are inclined to go after higher profile authors, with high citations and publications. By recognizing the limitations of popular metrics, research publishing has an opportunity to change its collective thinking and traditional methodologies, and in doing so, open the door to recognizing broader value in authors and papers. These are just some of the questions that the publishing industry and readership should be asking when assessing the true value of authors, papers and research. How then to move forward in aligning value with impact and are there a existing methods for doing so? Part of the solution might benefit from creating an index that measures performance. And more specifically, an index that is a weighted, as a multi-variable algorithm designed to assess an author's output, in the context of citations and percentage of over (or under) performance, over (for example) in an appropriate timeframe. Such an index would add value beyond existing popular methods because it would not penalize early-stage investigators and by contrast might capture early indicators of positive inflection, i.e., disruptive value. Perhaps the time has come to recognize that the biggest, most-established authors may at times but not always reflect disruptive value in relation to the next generation of research questions. A new method might identify new sub-areas of research, and the authors that drive that research, beyond what current methods achieve. For now, at the very least, the development of methods for evaluating research publishing would benefit from including the past, present, and future author and paper performance into new disciplines. Current methods for evaluating ‘impact’ and ‘value’ of authors and research, as stated above, are by design limited. New methods are sorely needed that account for the performance of authors in a myriad of contexts and that include relevant quantitative variables that capture ‘value’ and ‘impact’ to optimize effective communication of progress in scientific research.",

Real‐time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to further explore the relationship of HC with the JAK signaling pathway and autophagy. Double immunofluorescence staining is used to detect the fluorescence localization of LC3 and STAT3 after HC treatment. With increasing HC concentrations, A431 cell viability decreases in a dose‐dependent manner, and the apoptosis rate increases significantly. Laser confocal colocalization reveals that the fluorescence of labeled LC3 protein is significantly increased, and the fluorescence of labeled STAT3 is significantly reduced in this study. HC may induce autophagy in A431 cells and affect cell proliferation by downregulating the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.",

While tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have widely diverse phenotypes, tumors coevolve with the ones that can promote tumorigenesis. Functionally, TAMs/myeloid cells constitute the largest negative influence on the tumor microenvironment and need to be reprogrammed in order to enable successful anti-tumor response in most tumors. It is predicted that successful TAM repolarization has the potential to become a staple of immuno-oncology across most indications.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence and severity of high-altitude sickness increases with increasing altitude. Prevention of hypoxia caused by high-altitude sickness is an urgent problem. As a novel oxygen-carrying fluid, modified hemoglobin can carry oxygen in a full oxygen partial pressure environment and release oxygen in a low oxygen partial pressure environment. It is unclear whether modified hemoglobin can improve hypoxic injury on a plateau. Using hypobaric chamber rabbit (5000 m) and plateau goat (3600 m) models, general behavioral scores and vital signs, hemodynamic, vital organ functions, and blood gas are measured. The results show that the general behavioral scores and vital signs decrease significantly in the hypobaric chamber or plateau, and the modified hemoglobin can effectively improve the general behavioral scores and vital signs in rabbits and goats, and reduce the degree of damage to vital organs. Further studies reveal that arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 ) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) on the plateau decrease rapidly, and the modified hemoglobin could increase PaO2 and SaO2 ; thus, increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity. Moreover, modified hemoglobin has few side effects on hemodynamics and kidney injury. These results indicate that modified hemoglobin has a protective effect against high-altitude sickness.",

This study investigates the expression and localization of CPNE1 in tooth germ development and the role of CPNE1 in odontoblastic differentiation. In rat tooth germs, CPNE1 is expressed in the odontoblasts and ameloblasts since the late bell stage. The depletion of CPNE1 in the stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs) clearly inhibits the expression of odontoblastic-related genes and the formation of mineralized nodules during differentiation, while CPNE1 overexpression promotes this process. In addition, CPNE1 overexpression increases AKT phosphorylation during the odontoblastic differentiation of SCAPs. Furthermore, treatment with AKT inhibitor (MK2206) reduces the expression of odontoblastic-related genes in CPNE1 over-expressed SCAPs, and Alizarin Red staining shows reduced mineralization. These results suggest that CPNE1 plays a role in the tooth germ development as well as the odontblastic differentiation of SCAPs in vitro that is related to the AKT signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "The framework of “centering the margins”, developed by thought leader Bell Hooks(1), states that any group has center and a margin, and the center has more power than does the margin. To produce the most innovative, impactful, equitable, and inclusive work, the key is for those who are at the center to move to, and partner with those at, the margins. The margins must be brought to the center. We note that in biology and evolution, Nature has already shown us the importance of discourse between margins and center across scales: In cells, calcium at cardiomyocyte margins induces calcium release inside the cell. In tissues, the pathobiology of tumor margins can predict recurrence. In organisms, marginal growth factors and metabolites partially drive developmental assembly. In populations, or societies, trees at the forest margin affect health and resilience of the entire population. In this issue, we broadly apply this framework to regenerative tissue and organ engineering, from both societal and scientific standpoints. We bring the margins to the center. To do this, we asked “who and what lies at the margins of our field?” For the “who”: we believe it is those individuals who bring new and unique voices, such as those who have lived experiences or identities that are systematically marginalized by our profession. It is the bold and creative leaders who are unafraid to disrupt. The “what” are scientific ideas that look at old problems through a new lens or from a new angle. It is the scientific concept, idea, or approach that has been overlooked or marginalized. Thus, in this issue, we recruited papers from emerging faculty who bring powerful new voices, experiences, and scientific ideas to our field. Each of the faculty featured in this issue have unique lenses through which they look at our profession and society. All have taken leading roles in building a stronger, better, and more just profession. All forge new, creative areas of science. The innovation and fearlessness of these emerging faculty leaders is demonstrated by the cutting edge ideas and work they share in this issue. The first paper in this issue tackles one of greatest remaining challenges in engineering complex tissues – that of building vasculature (article number 2200050). Here, Dr. Quinton Smith and colleagues provide unique developmental and cell sourcing lenses through which to look at this challenge. While the vascular engineering field has historically focused on engineering arterial and venous networks, Drs. Catherine Whittington and Katharina Maisel and colleagues urge us to also consider the critical importance of lymphatic networks. In a pair of beautifully complementary papers, both groups call for increased attention to modeling lymphatic networks, which play crucial roles in chronic disease, inflammation and immunity, and fibrosis (article numbers 2200158 and 2200041). The heart is particularly sensitive to alterations in blood flow, as vascular occlusion causes loss of cardiomyocytes, morbidity, and mortality. Dr. Darryl Dickenson shows how hydrogel composites are a creative approach that push this field towards achieving the elusive goal of replicating several of the structural features and cardiomyocyte organization, within this organ (article number 2200067). Drs. Abigail N. Koppes, Ryan A. Koppes and colleagues move our view of heart tissue engineering past cardiomyocytes and vascular networks alone, to review how cardiomyocytes can also form gap junctions with nonmuscle cells such as fibroblasts and macrophages, a phenomenon that still needs to be better understood in the context of human heart health and disease. These are cell types that were once considered “at the margin” but we now realize their central role in heart function (article number 2200117). In addition to the heart, another highly metabolically active organ that requires robust vascular support is the liver. Dr. Kelly Stevens and colleagues work to solve the challenge of vascularizing liver grafts by stimulating “seeds” of engineered liver tissues to coordinately expand with vasculature in vivo (article number 2200208). Drs. Timothy Downing, Joshua Mauney, and Shreya Raghavan and colleagues provide two works that fill out our dive into the gastroinestnal system, by further examining the esophagus and colon. Drs. Timothy Downing, Joshua Mauney and colleagues take a new angle by which to examine esophageal regenerative mechanisms, by characterizing epigenenic DNA methylation in this process (article number 2200160). Shreya Raghavan and colleagues examine gastrointestinal disease by probing an important health equity question facing veterans, by shedding light on the mechanisms leading to gastrointestinal immobility that results from chemical exposure during the Gulf War (article number 2200254). Thus, from lymphatics, to immunoengineering, to epigenetics, to health equity - this issue of Advanced Biology is ripe with emerging topics that are at the margins – but we believe should be highlighted, and moved to the center – of our field. Join us in celebrating these individuals and this work. They are the future. We hope you will enjoy this issue as much as we do. The authors would like to acknowledge the ideas and work of Dr. Brendan Harley, who has also pushed forward the framework of “centering the margins” in the scientific profession previously.",

    "abstract": "Abstract COVID‐19 disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), has led to enormous morbidity and mortality worldwide. After gaining entry into the human host, the virus initially infects the upper and lower respiratory tract, subsequently invading multiple organs, including the pancreas. While on one hand, diabetes mellitus (DM) is a significant risk factor for severe COVID‐19 infection and associated death, recent reports have shown the onset of DM in COVID‐19‐recovered patients. SARS‐CoV‐2 infiltrates the pancreatic islets and activates stress response and inflammatory signaling pathways, impairs glucose metabolism, and consequently leads to their death. Indeed, the pancreatic autopsy samples of COVID‐19 patients reveal the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 particles in β ‐cells. The current review describes how the virus enters the host cells and activates an immunological response. Further, it takes a closer look into the interrelationship between COVID‐19 and DM with the aim to provide mechanistic insights into the process by which SARS‐CoV‐2 infects the pancreas and mediates dysfunction and death of endocrine islets. The effects of known anti‐diabetic interventions for COVID‐19 management are also discussed. The application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a future therapy for pancreatic β ‐cells damage to reverse COVID‐19‐induced DM is also emphasized.",

    "abstract": "The collective adhesive behavior of epithelial cell layers mediated by complex macromolecular fluid environments plays a vital role in many biological processes. Mucins, a family of highly glycosylated proteins, are known to lubricate cell-on-cell contacts in the shear direction. However, the role of mucins mediating axial epithelial adhesion in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the cell sheet has received less attention. This article subjects cell-on-cell layers of live ocular epithelia that express mucins on their apical surfaces to compression/decompression cycles and tensile loading using a customized instrument. In addition to providing compressive moduli of native cell-on-cell layers, it is found that the mucin layer between the epithelia acts as a soft cushion between the epithelial cell layers. Decompression experiments reveal mucin layers act as soft, nonlinear springs in the axial direction. The cell-on-cell layers withstand decompression before fracturing by a cohesive failure within the mucin layer. When mucin deficiency is induced via a protease treatment, it is found that the axial adhesion between the cell layers is increased. The findings which correlate changes in biological factors with changes in mechanical properties might be of interest to challenges in ophthalmology, vision care, and mucus research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Osteocytes have recently been identified as a new regulator of bone remodeling, but the detailed mechanism of their differentiation from osteoblasts remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to identify cell cycle regulators involved in the differentiation of osteoblasts into osteocytes and determine their physiological significance. The study uses IDG‐SW3 cells as a model for the differentiation from osteoblasts to osteocytes. Among the major cyclin‐dependent kinases ( Cdks ), Cdk1 is most abundantly expressed in IDG‐SW3 cells, and its expression is down‐regulated during differentiation into osteocytes. Inhibition of CDK1 activity reduces IDG‐SW3 cell proliferation and differentiation into osteocytes. Osteocyte and Osteoblast‐specific Cdk1 knockout in mice ( Dmp1‐Cdk1 KO ) results in trabecular bone loss. Pthlh expression increases during differentiation, but inhibiting CDK1 activity reduces Pthlh expression. Parathyroid hormone‐related protein concentration is reduced in the bone marrow of Dmp1‐Cdk1 KO mice. Four weeks of Parathyroid hormone administration partially recovers the trabecular bone loss in Dmp1‐Cdk1 KO mice. These results demonstrate that Cdk1 plays an essential role in the differentiation from osteoblast to osteocyte and the acquisition and maintenance of bone mass. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of bone mass regulation and can help develop efficient therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis treatment.",

Tetraspanin CD82 is a useful cell surface marker for prospective isolation of human myogenic progenitors and its expression is decreased in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cell lines. The function of CD82 in skeletal muscle remains elusive, partly because the binding partners of this tetraspanin in muscle cells have not been identified. CD82‐associated proteins are sought to be identified in human myotubes via mass spectrometry proteomics, which identifies dysferlin and myoferlin as CD82‐binding partners. In human dysferlinopathy (Limb girdle muscular dystrophy R2, LGMDR2) myogenic cell lines, expression of CD82 protein is near absent in two of four patient samples. In the cell lines where CD82 protein levels are unaffected, increased expression of the ≈72 kDa mini‐dysferlin product is identified using an antibody recognizing the dysferlin C‐terminus. These data demonstrate that CD82 binds dysferlin/myoferlin in differentiating muscle cells and its expression can be affected by loss of dysferlin in human myogenic cells.",

    "abstract": "As part of our series on emerging life sciences, the editor speaks with Drs Mario Luca Morieri MD and Hongwen Zhou MD, principal investigators at University of Padova and Nanjing Medical University, respectively, about their research pathway into genetics and metabolic disease and their passion for advancing research in this area. Drs Morieri (MLM) and Zhou (HZ) reflect on personal and professional experiences motivating their research and the road ahead. 1. Can you share a life event or experience that led you to research the interplay of genetics and environmental factors driving metabolic disease? MLM: As a young physician and scientist I was interested in a holistic approach to patient care and chose to specialize in internal medicine. When treating patients with diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia, I realized these conditions had multi-organ influences that differed from patient to patient. As an example, a young patient with a good life-style style developed diabetes or cardiovascular disease (CVD) in their 40s, while an older patient with longer exposure to multiple cardiometabolic risk factors did not develop CVD or diabetes. While on average there is no doubt that the overall accumulation of these and other cardio-metabolic risk factors (e.g., sedentary lifestyle, smoking, unhealthy diet, hypertension) are directly correlated with risk of cardiometabolic disease, there is clearly heterogeneity in outcomes. Those were the years of the first -omics studies (genome-wide studies, microbiomes studies) and renewed enthusiasm for precision medicine approaches. Driven by my interest in this topic, I pursued a fellowship at the Joslin Diabetes Center (Boston, USA) to study the interplay between genetics and environmental factors driving metabolic disease. HZ: Among my patients with obesity there was one case I would like to share: I diagnosed and treated a 35-year-old female patient who complained of hyperphagia, early-onset progressive and refractory obesity with normal birth weight. Her BMI was 57.8 kg/m2, with fat accumulation throughout the body and distributed in a pantaloon way. Lifestyle modification, medication, and surgical intervention, such as gastric bypass surgery, were all unhelpful. With further investigation, family history revealed a consanguineous marriage between her parents (first-degree cousins) with normal weight and blood glucose level. Whole Genome Sequencing indicated the presence of a loss of function mutation in the gene of the leptin receptor, leading to the symptoms the patient was experiencing. This case and others led me to think about the interplay of genetics and environmental factors driving metabolic disease. 2. What scientific insights have informed your view that obesity and diabetes are products of genetics and environment? MLM: In our studies, evaluating the interplay between genetics and environment we were able to demonstrate that genetic background can be successfully used (and nowadays at relatively low cost) to distinguish patients with type 2 diabetes that have very similar general characteristics, but differ in cardiovascular risk.[1] Similarly, we found that some genetic variants might help distinguish subjects with different cardiovascular response to preventative treatment.[2-4] Several other groups are working in this emerging field of cardiometabolic disease with promising results.[5, 6] I expect that these approaches will be implemented in clinical practice over the next ten years. HZ: In 1994, Professor Jeffery Friedman at Rockefeller University cloned the mouse and human obese (ob) gene which produces leptin, a master adipokine that regulates appetite and body weight. Patients with mutations in the leptin gene are often extremely obese. We now know that not only the leptin and its receptor, but also genes in the melanocortin signaling pathway are essential players in modulating food-seeking behavior, appetite regulation, and systemic energy metabolism. Genetic studies have advanced our understanding of the nature of obesity to include monogenic obesity and polygenic obesity. Similarly to diabetes, genetic factors contribute to these diseases. For example, mutations in the insulin coding gene (ins) are one type of neonatal diabetes mellitus. To date, approximately twenty genes have been associated with monogenic diabetes. Genetic variation in metabolic genes influences both obesity and diabetes, however, the dramatic increase in prevalence of obesity and diabetes in recent decades cannot be fully explained by genetic variation. The term an “obesogenic environment”[7] was proposed in 1999, which describes the interaction between environmental and innate biological factors and reveals the nature of many metabolic disorders. These scientific insights informed my view that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to obesity and diabetes. 3. Where do you see future progress in understanding pathophysiology in complex metabolic diseases? LM: Thanks to the growing availability of large biobank databases leveraging “real-world”, routinely collected data combined with genome-wide or whole genome sequencing, I think that we will continue to see progress in this field. Increasing the sample size of these databases will allow us to evaluate “gene by gene” and “gene by gene by environment” interactions that will help us move toward the development of personalized algorithms. HZ: Metabolic syndromes, including diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia, and their associated comorbidities, are global health epidemics that require multimodal approaches. Translational genomic approaches will likely be critical tools going forward. Professor Peng Li and colleagues have suggested that given the complexity of metabolism and metabolic diseases, it would be beneficial to focus on multi-center efforts for further collaboration locally and globally, including scientific clinical research and animal centers that can generate genetically modified animal models to better mimic metabolic health and disease in humans. These centers are also expected to perform standardized characterization of metabolic phenotypes and generate databases accessible to the wider scientific community.[8] 4. Where do you see advances in risk prediction, given the different global geographic distribution of metabolic disease and likely different demographic exposures? MLM: The consideration of populations with different genetic backgrounds is essential for target discovery.[9, 10] It will be crucial to develop population-specific screening programs since the prevalence of diabetes is expected to rise in regions outside of Europe and North America where most of the studies are currently being conducted.[11] I also believe that we will need to have, and will gain from, deeper and more detailed assessments of the environment, including socio-economic factors. This will help to better define “gene by environment” interactions that ultimately influence health outcomes. HZ: With the aging of the global human population, the rate of developing metabolic diseases and associated comorbidities is increasing, potentially leading to a substantial clinical burden and a public health concern.[11] There is an urgent need to implement effective risk prediction of metabolic diseases for early detection and intervention, such as the development of analytical tools for high-throughput sequencing techniques and metabolomics (e.g., UK Biobank[12]). Another example, findings from the China 4C study revealed that systematic amino acids and microbiota-related metabolites play a potential role in prediction of T2DM.[13] Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) coupled with artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) offer a promise of polygenic risk score development in early identification of risk for metabolic diseases. Moving forward, more effort should be placed in developing predictive tools for screening metabolic disease risk. 5. As guest editors, what are your goals for the upcoming thematic issue, “Genetics and Metabolism”, and how will you measure success? MLM: The goal of the issue is to increase awareness of the interplay of genetics and environment in the context of different countries and continents. Success will be if Advanced Biology will increase the number of high-quality studies being published on genetic, epigenetic and other -omic approaches in the field of cardiometabolic risk and precision medicine. HZ: It has been my honor to serve as a guest editor for this thematic issue, “Genetics and Metabolism”. The first goal for me is to make the readership Advanced Biology more familiar with the field of genetics and metabolism, and my second goal is to promote discussions and collaborations across different academic fields and build international support of investigations into genetic and metabolic disease research. Hopefully this will bring improvements in treatments and public awareness in this field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Kidney ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) poses a major global healthcare burden, but effective treatments remain elusive. IRI involves a complex interplay of tissue‐level structural and functional changes caused by interruptions in blood and filtrate flow and reduced oxygenation. Existing in vitro models poorly replicate the in vivo injury environment and lack means of monitoring tissue function during the injury process. Here, a high‐throughput human primary kidney proximal tubule (PT)‐microvascular model is described, which facilitates in‐depth structural and rapid functional characterization of IRI‐induced changes in the tissue barrier. The PREDICT96 (P96) microfluidic platform's user‐controlled fluid flow can mimic the conditions of IR to induce pronounced changes in cell structure that resemble clinical and in vivo phenotypes. High‐throughput trans‐epi/endo‐thelial electrical resistance (TEER) sensing is applied to non‐invasively track functional changes in the PT‐microvascular barrier during the two‐stage injury process and over repeated episodes of injury. Notably, ischemia causes an initial increase in tissue TEER followed by a sudden increase in permeability upon reperfusion, and this biphasic response occurs only with the loss of both fluid flow and oxygenation. This study demonstrates the potential of the P96 kidney IRI model to enhance understanding of IRI and fuel therapeutic development.",

Treatment with EA significantly reduces body weight, fat deposition, and lipid accumulation in HFD‐fed mice. Additionally, EA effectively ameliorates metabolic imbalances, reducing blood glucose levels and plasma markers of liver function. At the molecular level, EA enhances the expression of thermogenesis‐associated genes in brown adipose tissue and decreases p53 expression, suggesting a decrease in apoptosis. Autophagy in white adipose tissue is inhibited by EA, as demonstrated by the suppression of key autophagy‐related proteins. Further experiments highlight the critical role of Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) in EA's anti‐obesity effects. Sirt3 supplementation combined with EA results in reduced body weight, fat deposition, and lipid accumulation, along with modulations in key metabolic indicators. Moreover, EA's modulatory effect on uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), Peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (Pgc‐1α), and p53 is found to be Sirt3 dependent. In conclusion, EA exerts beneficial effects against obesity through Sirt3‐dependent modulation of autophagy and energy metabolism, indicating a potential therapeutic approach for obesity and related metabolic disorders.",

The objective of this study is to investigate hepatotoxicity by replicating critical features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This includes replicating 3D structures, metabolic activities, and tumor‐specific markers. The internal environment of spheroids comprised of cancerous human patient‐derived hepatocytes using microparticles is modulated to enhance the oxygenation state and recreate cell‐extracellular matrix interactions. Furthermore, the role of hepatic stellate cells in maintaining hepatocyte survival and function is explored and hepatocytes from two cellular sources (immortalized and patient‐derived) to create four formulations with and without microparticles are utilized. To investigate drug‐induced changes in metabolism and apoptosis in liver cells, coculture spheroids with and without microparticles are exposed to three hepatotoxic drugs. The use of microparticles increases levels of apoptotic markers in both liver models under drug treatments. This coincides with reduced levels of anti‐apoptotic proteins and increased levels of pro‐apoptotic proteins. Moreover, cells from different origins undergo apoptosis through distinct apoptotic pathways in response to identical drugs. This 3D microphysiological system offers a viable tool for liver cancer research to investigate mechanisms of apoptosis under different microenvironmental conditions.",

To test this hypothesis, human protein sequences are extracted from the UniProt database and the relative frequency of every amino acid residue in aging‐related proteins and the remaining proteins is calculated. The main observation is that the mean relative frequency of aspartic acid (D) is consistently higher, while the mean relative frequencies of tryptophan (W) and leucine (L) are consistently lower in aging‐related proteins compared to the non‐aging‐related proteins for the human and four examined model organisms. It is also observed that the mean relative frequency of aspartic acid is higher, while the mean relative frequency of tryptophan is lower in pro‐longevity proteins compared to anti‐longevity proteins in model organisms. Finally, it is found that aging‐related proteins tend to be longer than non‐aging‐related proteins.

    "abstract": "Abstract Myeloid‐derived suppressor cell (MDSC)‐like adherent cells (MLACs) are a recently identified CD11b + F4/80 − myeloid cell subset that can infiltrate tumors early in development and promote their growth. Because of these functions, MLACs play an important role in establishing an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the lack of MLAC‐specific markers has hampered further characterization of this cell type. This study identifies the gene signature of MLACs by analyzing RNA‐sequencing (RNA‐seq) and public single‐cell RNA‐seq data, revealing that MLACs are an independent cell population that are distinct from other intratumoral myeloid cells. After combining proteome analysis of membrane proteins with RNA‐seq data, H2‐Ab1 and CD11c are indicated as marker proteins that can support the isolation of MLAC subsets from CD11b + F4/80 − myeloid cells by fluorescence‐activated cell sorting. The CD11b + F4/80 − H2‐Ab1 + and CD11b + F4/80 − CD11c + MLAC subsets represent approximately half of the MLAC population that is isolated based on their adhesion properties and possess gene signatures and functional properties similar to those of the MLAC population. Additionally, membrane proteome analysis suggests that MLACs express highly heterogeneous surface proteins. This study facilitates an integrated understanding of heterogeneous intratumoral myeloid cells, as well as the molecular and cellular details of the development of an immunosuppressive TME.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Animal studies on vascular aging pose a few limitations. One of the most important reasons for this is the absence of a fast and efficient model of vascular tissue aging. In this study, ex vivo aortic culture and Matrigel subcutaneous implantation are combined to develop a new model for studying vascular cellular senescence. Eight‐week‐old C57BL/6J mice are used to obtain aortas. Bleomycin is used to induce aortas senescence in vitro. Then, aortas are transplanted to the acceptor mice with Matrigel. Senescence is evaluated using western blotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and senescence‐associated beta‐galactosidase activity. Inflammatory cytokines are detected using Luminex Liquid Suspension Chip. RNA levels are analyzed by transcriptome sequencing. The results revealed that vessels in the bleomycin group exhibited significant senescence than those in the control group that can be enhanced by stripping vessel adventitia. The levels of cytokines such as interleukin (IL‐2, IL‐1β, and IL‐6 increased significantly in the ex vivo model. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing revealed 56 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ex vivo model vessels compared with those in naturally aging aortas. In conclusion, this study introduces a cost‐effective and time‐saving vessel senescence model for vascular cellular senescence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR‐associated (Cas) systems are widely distributed adaptive immune systems found in prokaryotes. The process involves three main stages: adaptation, expression, and interference. While the adaptation stage has been extensively studied, there is still an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying the capture, trimming, and integration of exogenous DNA. For instance, Cas4, a CRISPR‐Cas protein with endonuclease activity, is responsible for selecting and processing protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences. However, some CRISPR isoforms lack Cas4 activity, relying on other enzymes for adaptive immunity. Recently, Wang et al. presented a novel model of exogenous DNA processing in a type I‐E CRISPR system lacking Cas4 in a Nature article. This model integrates protospacer processing into CRISPR arrays through fine‐tuned synthases formed by DnaQ‐like exonuclease (DEDDh) and Cas1‐Cas2 complexes. Their study introduces a novel model, shedding new light on the evolution of CRISPR adaptive immunity. This perspective comprehensively examines the fundamental process of CRISPR adaptive immunity, detailing both the classical pathway mediated by Cas4 and the alternative pathway mediated by DEDDh. Furthermore, a thorough evaluation of Wang et al.’s work is conducted, highlighting its strengths, weaknesses, and existing research challenges.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and diabetes are common and complex metabolic diseases, with an increasing prevalence worldwide that results from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Recent advances in “-omic” technologies have enabled the discovery of an increasing number of genetic, epigenetic and metabolite markers associated with these conditions. These findings have revealed the complex pathophysiology of these conditions. The challenge now is for researchers and physicians to translate this growing knowledge into action and new clinical approaches. The motivation for this special issue was to provide perspectives and tools to improve risk prediction, prevention, and treatment of metabolic diseases, to better care for patients. In this special issue of Advanced Biology, “Genetics and Metabolic Diseases”, we highlight articles with a translational approach, moving from laboratory discoveries to clinical translation, with an emphasis on metabolic diseases resulting from genetic mutations, such as monogenic obesity and lipodystrophy. Other studies dissect the interrelationship between obesity, diabetes, and lipid metabolism to improve prediction and managed care of complications arising from treatment. In the study by Di Paola et al. (adbi.202200319), the authors address the strict relationship between obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, focusing on the evaluation of how polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (coded by GALNT2) influence HDL-c and triglycerides levels. While GALNT2 can influence lipid metabolism (e.g., angiopoietin like 3 , apolipoprotein C-IIII and phospolipid transfer protein ) it also affects insulin sensitivity and adipokines. The authors use genetic variants to evaluate the hypothesis that GALNT2 effects on circulating lipoprotein levels go beyond the sole regulation of key lipid metabolism enzyme and also includes effects on insulin sensitivity. In the review by Wang and colleagues (adbi.202300035), a detailed overview is given of the central and peripheral roles of melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in energy metabolism and endocrine hormone homeostasis. Evidence supports the diversity of phenotypes and biased downstream signaling caused by distinct MC4R mutations. This review also includes recent advances in drug development targeting MC4R. MC4R was also evaluated by Zhou et al. (adbi.202300007), reporting six MC4R variants (Y35C, T53I, V103I, R165W, G233S, and C277X) in morbidly obese persons in China. In this morbidly obese cohort, patients with rare MC4R variants seems to benefit the most from metabolic surgery. With the global epidemic of obesity, there is a growing number of patients who need to undergo bariatric/metabolic surgery. In this context, the study by Centeno et al. (adbi.202300001) evaluated the epigenetic changes following bariatric surgery. Specifically, the authors evaluated the DNA methylation remodeling in adipose tissue and identified changes in more than one thousand CpG sites. The GNAS complex locus which is associated with BMI, lipid obesity, and glucose metabolism, harbored the sites with the greatest changes. Remarkably, several of the other sites identified in the study are in genes/loci previously not known to be related to metabolic disorders, stimulating future studies. This study also underscores the role that epigenetic regulation might play in modulating adipose tissue function in obese patients and how these altered functions may potentially be reversed. Excessive fat accumulation also affects the liver and Xue and colleagues (adbi.202200150) described their results inhibiting geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) as a novel strategy for treating metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Using a structure-based virtual small molecule screening method, 4-AZ is detected as a GGPPS targeted inhibitor. Further investigation showed that 4-AZ promotes the degradation of GGPPS via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and inhibits the accumulation of lipids in primary hepatocytes and decreased lipogenic gene expression through GGPPS. Yu and colleagues (adbi.202200301) identify four unique lamin A/C (LMNA) mutations from six lipodystrophy patients and show how these LMNA variations are characterized by decreased Lamin A/C stability and degradation primarily through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Ma and colleagues (adbi.202200234) provide a narrative review of the key redox factors, endogenous mechanisms for redox homeostasis, and advanced techniques for dynamic monitoring of redox states. Liu and colleagues (adbi.202300100) discuss the role of diet and gut microbiota interactions on metabolic homeostasis. In addition, they review the alterations of gut microbiota in relation to diet. They emphasize the potential for diet-microbiota crosstalk to influence metabolic homeostasis. One important aspect in the care of patients with metabolic disease is the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular complications. Liu and colleagues (adbi.202200130) demonstrate the therapeutic effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on human diabetic cardiomyocytes (DCMs) and establish a novel DCM model for mechanistic based studies. Based on human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes, they highlight that both GLP-1 7–36 and GLP-1 9–36 restore cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and abnormal calcium transient frequency. Specifically, that possible targets of GLP-1 7–36 are involved in the regulation of mitotic nuclear division and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, while targets of GLP-1 9–36 influence kinetochore assembly, complement, and coagulation cascades. Pipino et al. (adbi.202300172) review prediction of cardiovascular disease – a major complication of metabolic disease, – with a focus on how epigenetic and metabolomic markers may predict endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. Excitingly, the manuscript describes the epigenetic-metabolite relationship and how these can provide novel insights into the physio-pathological processes in early stages of endothelium function. Understanding these processes will enable identification of disease biomarkers and therapies to reduce the cardiovascular burden in metabolic disease. In the review by Geiger et al. (adbi.202300211), details are provided on various epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNA, and how they affect immuno-metabolic disease conditions. The authors also describe several environmental factors that influence the epigenetic signature and how these can be transmitted trans-generationally, i.e., influencing the disease traits of the patients and their offspring. The review discusses metabolic traits, such as insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, macrophage polarization, endothelial dysfunction, metabolic cardiomyopathy, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In addition, the review describes currently used drugs (e.g., statins and metformin) as “epigenetic” drugs, suggesting their mechanism of action may be mediated by epigenetic changes. In summary, this special issue includes several studies that aim to advance knowledge and reduce the global burden of metabolic disease. The populations described in these manuscripts are diverse and derived from different countries with different ancestries. Such diversity will further enhance discovery and underscores the value in diverse and equitable approaches in future studies. The care of all patients, recognizing genetic and environmental differences, needs to be considered if we are to be successful in mitigating metabolic diseases worldwide.

    "abstract": "Abstract The small compound Pitstop‐2 is a recent potent inhibitor of clathrin‐mediated endocytosis (CME), widely used in biomedical research areas. In recent years, however, it is observed that it exhibits CME‐independent inhibitory effects on nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), the nucleocytoplasmic gatekeepers. NPCs are elaborate proteinaceous transport nano‐machineries of crucial physiological importance rendering them novel targets for various medical applications. They mediate all nucleocytoplasmic transport forming a physiologically essential selective nucleocytoplasmic barrier. The direct Pitstop‐2 disruptive effects on NPCs manifested themselves at both the structural and functional integrity levels. Moreover, they are massive, acute, and detectable at concentrations equal to CME‐inhibitory concentrations. Pitstop‐2 inhibits CME by binding to the terminal β‐propeller domain of the heavy chain of clathrin. Several NPC scaffold proteins, critical for the structural and functional integrity of the NPC, possess β‐propeller folds. Herein, utilizing computational docking analysis, it is demonstrated that Pitstop‐2 exhibits particularly high binding affinities to β‐propeller folds of NPC scaffold proteins, similar to its binding affinity to the terminal β‐propeller domain of clathrin. The authors, therefore, conclude that Pitstop‐2 is a potent disruptor of NPCs, an activity which, separately or in synergy with CME inhibition, may be exploited for a myriad of pharmacological applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cell therapies involving c‐kit+ progenitor cells (CPCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been actively studied for cardiac repair. The benefits of such therapies have more recently been attributed to the release of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from the parent cells. These sEVs are 30−180 nm vesicles containing protein/nucleic acid cargo encapsulated within an amphiphilic bilayer membrane. Despite their pro‐reparative effects, sEV composition and cargo loading is highly variable, making it challenging to develop robust therapies with sEVs. Synthetic alternatives have been developed to allow cargo modulation, including prior work from the laboratory, to design sEV‐like vehicles (ELVs). ELVs are synthesized from the sEV membrane but allow controlled cargo loading. It is previously shown that loading pro‐angiogenic miR‐126 into CPC‐derived ELVs significantly increases endothelial cell angiogenesis compared to CPC‐sEVs alone. Here, they expand on this work to design MSC‐derived ELVs and study the role of the parent cell type on ELV composition and function. It is found that ELV origin does affect the ELV potency and that ELV membrane composition can affect outcomes. This study showcases the versatility of ELVs to be synthesized from different parent cells and highlights the importance of selecting ELV source cells based on the desired functional outcomes.",

The biomaterial is fabricated specialized for obese conditions to initiate simultaneous lipolysis and angiogenesis locally in the hypoxic subcutaneous fat in wound margins of obese subjects. Caffeine‐reinforced collagen biomatrix shows better structural integrity, thermal stability, bio‐compatibility, and lesser proteolytic susceptibility. Caffeine‐collagen biomaterial promote angiogenesis, fibroblast migration, and localized browning of white adipocytes to activate thermogenesis in the subcutaneous fat layer at the wound site. Full‐thickness excision wound healing studies performed in obese C57BL6 mice shows faster wound closure within day 9 when compare to control mice. The Caffeine‐reinforced collagen biomaterial remodeled the wound site locally by activating fibroblast to secrete collagen, activate endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis, and induce browning in white adipocytes in subcutaneous fat.

    "abstract": "With the beginning of each new year, we tend to ask ourselves, what has changed and where do we fit within a renewing landscape of possibility? In the life sciences, there have been profound changes, not only in the pace of discovery, but also in the culture of how we innovate. Scientific advances are outpacing traditionally defined research disciplines, and while we are achieving a deeper understanding within disciplines, there is a growing appreciation for cross-disciplinary insights that dissolve boundaries, creating fertile ground for emerging fields. The culture of how we innovate has also shifted towards collaborative teams, and increasingly with industry and international partnerships, collectively engaged in integrative, multi-modal approaches to meeting the next generation of challenges in the life sciences. I have the privilege of starting 2022 as the new Editor-in-Chief of Advanced Biology during a pivotal period of change, both in the approach and in the culture of scientific discovery. My hope is that Advanced Biology will sit at the intersection of this change, giving voice to emerging fields and providing a forum for the highest quality research in emerging life sciences. Advanced Biology is primed with a new expanded scope to meet the challenge of reporting cutting-edge research within and across life science disciplines. The journal provides the readership with a wide array of high-quality studies designed to provoke insight by juxtaposing multiple disciplines curated through rigorous peer-review. Evidence of the journal's upward trajectory is the newly assigned 2021 impact factor (4+), indicating a continuously increasing impact in life sciences publications. The continuing success of the journal would not have been possible without the talented and professional efforts by the previous editors, operating within the historic context of Wiley's Advanced series of integrated journals. With the help of deputy editors, our editorial board, and staff expertise accessible within the matrix of Advanced journals, our goal is to develop a publishing niche that builds connectivity across disciplines, between and within academia and industry, nationally and internationally, to catalyze discussion, innovation, and knowledge growth in the basic and applied biosciences. Advanced Biology will facilitate connectivity through soliciting and publishing interdisciplinary reviews, thematic series, and commentary on emerging trends by key thought leaders across the life sciences. The journal will, in turn, adapt content to provide timely publications with thematic issues and calls-for-papers, based on data-driven analysis of trends in research at the crossroads of existing and emerging life sciences. To demonstrate our commitment to cutting-edge research, from multiple perspectives, geographies, and life sciences backgrounds, we plan to invite early-stage investigators worldwide to consider joining our editorial board. Among the key deliverable goals for Advanced Biology will be to publish the best science within disciplines, and at the intersection of the life sciences (e.g., geriatrics and infectious diseases, immunology and the biology of aging), to provide peer-reviewed, holistic perspectives, from molecular to population-based studies (see our expanded Scope section here). Advanced Biology also plans to develop a suite of timely reviews and thematic issues reflecting cutting-edge life science research both in academia and industry and will feature conversations with key opinion leaders as horizon view assessments of how research is evolving. We have restructured the journal to meet these goals and in so doing, we hope to enable author cross-over exposure into emerging life sciences research, to overcome “silo” effects that often limit specialty journals, and to create a forum for innovation in cross-disciplinary research. On behalf of our talented team at Advanced Biology, I look forward to working with all stakeholders in the life sciences community, in a culture of collaboration and interdisciplinary and international perspectives, to meet the challenges of advancing scientific knowledge across the life sciences.",

    "abstract": "Tell us about your earlier research experiences. What drew you to the intersection of cancer and neuroscience research? After my first year of clinical residency in otolaryngology, I joined the lab of Dr. Ziv Gil. His lab was studying pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest cancers. Interestingly, the lab was focused on the intersection between immune cells, nerves, and cancer cells. Pancreatic cancer, like other exocrine gland tumors (for example, prostate and salivary gland tumors), is highly innervated and has a unique feature: the ability to invade and disseminate along nerves. This feature, called perineural invasion, is an ominous sign and is actually the fourth route of metastasis, along with local invasion, lymphatic spread, and hematogenous spread. In perineural invasion, tumor cells use the nerves in the vicinity of the tumor as “highways” for distant spread. In patients, perineural invasion can cause pain and paralysis. Unfortunately, these “highways” often lead to critical structures such as the spine and brain, which limits our ability as surgeons to completely remove the tumors. Can you tell us about some key scientific developments that led to your current thinking about the tumor microenvironment, immune response and health outcomes? Throughout my training and as a junior faculty member, I was always amazed by the minimal (if any) role attributed to the nervous system in cancer. As a clinician, we consider nerves mainly in the context of pain, or we think about how invading tumors or cancer treatments damage nerves. However, considering that the nervous system controls every aspect of our life, in health and disease, it was peculiar that the role of nerves in regulating cancer growth, progression, and response to therapy was neglected for many years. The article that marked the change in the field, published by Claire Magnon et al. in Science in 2013,[1] showed for the first time that there is an orchestrated interaction between the autonomous nervous system and cancer development. This article left a strong impression on my mission as a scientist and led me to think about a fundamental question: how do nerves get to the tumor microenvironment? I realized that the process may be similar to angiogenesis in that a cascade of signals coming from cancer cells and maybe other cells in the tumor microenvironment might be involved. This led me to study paracrine signaling, but this time I was looking in the opposite direction from my view as a clinician—that is, at how cancer cells and nerves interact. During my Ph.D. studies, I obtained experience in dissecting paracrine signals, including vesicle-mediated signaling, that led to our findings about the ability of cancer to “hack” the nervous system. In your view, what are the pressing and longer-term questions at the interface of cancer and neuroscience and how should they be prioritized? What do you see as the major challenges in cancer neuroscience research, and future directions to overcome barriers? The major challenge is the overcoming of disciplinary barriers to conversations and collaboration between scientists in each field. There are many technical obstacles (for instance, cancer biologists usually do not understand neuron culture, andmany neuroscientists are not familiar with cancer models), but these challenges can be easily sorted out through discussions and data sharing. I had dual training, but it is not a necessity if you have good collaborators. How is cancer neuroscience a great example of opportunities for early-stage investigators to engage in interdisciplinary research? Engaging in interdisciplinary research is the essence of advancing the field of cancer neuroscience. Getting trained in both fields and becoming an expert in both is nearly impossible. I was fortunate to have great mentors who became my collaborators after my transition to independence. My mentors have expertise in fields that would have taken me a lifetime to acquire, including Dr. Jeffrey Myers in cancer modeling and P53 biology; Dr. George Calin in RNA biology; and Dr. Patrick Dougherty in neurobiology. Each of these mentors has dedicated his life to a specific topic, and taking advantage of what each one brings to the table has made it possible for all of us to make new discoveries. As the guest editor, what are your goals for the upcoming thematic issue on neuron-tumor interactions and how will you measure success? My goals are threefold: one, to introduce the field of cancer neuroscience to the readership of Advanced Biology and to expose neuroscientists, cancer biologists, and clinicians to the field; two, to foster discussion and collaboration between the disciplines; and three, to drive policymakers and key stakeholders, such as the National Institutes of Health, to invest in cancer neuroscience research since this is an unexplored territory that holds a lot of therapeutic potential for cancer patients and their caregivers. The most important and personally exciting deliverable for me would be to see more clinical trials looking at neuromodulation as cancer therapy. I think that until the first neuromodulatory approach or therapy targeting the nervous system is Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency-approved for cancer, we will not be satisfied. But we are becoming more optimistic by the day. Moran Amit, MD PhD mamit@mdanderson.org Photo Credit: Photograph courtesy of Dr. Moran Amit.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The regulatory solute carrier protein, family 1, member 1 (RS1) modulates via its N‐terminal domain RS1‐reg the activity of Na + – d ‐glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) and thereby the glucose uptake in the small intestine by blocking the release of SGLT1‐containing vesicles at the trans ‐Golgi network (TGN). The antidiabetic activity of RS1 is mediated by ornithindecarboxylase 1 (ODC1), catalyzing the conversion of ornithine to putrescine. Putrescine can bind to a buddying protein complex for SGLT1‐containing vesicles at the membrane of the TGN, triggering vesicle release. In this report, a first in‐depth analysis of the important binding process between ODC1 and RS1‐reg for regulating glucose uptake in the human organism is described by comparing results from the surface‐based methods, “surface plasmon resonance” (SPR) and “surface acoustic wave” (SAW) with findings by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In cases of SAW and SPR, three different assay surface setups are compared, resulting in small but significant differences in K D values for different surfaces. Noteworthy, an affinity increase by the factor of about 100 for the interaction is detected and herewith described for the first time in the presence of biological membranes that may be relevant in vivo for the biological function of RS1 and future bespoken antidiabetic drug development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a major role in tumorigenesis and metastasis, the role of genetic alterations in invasiveness of CSCs is still unclear. Tumor microenvironment signals, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, significantly influence cell behaviors. Unfortunately, these signals are often lost in in vitro cell culture. This study determines putative CSC populations, examines genetic changes during tumorigenesis of human breast epithelial stem cells, and investigates single‐cell migration properties on ECM‐mimetic platforms. Whole exome sequencing data indicate that tumorigenic cells have a higher somatic mutation burden than non‐tumorigenic cells, and that mutations exclusive to tumorigenic cells exhibit higher predictive deleterious scores. Tumorigenic cells exhibit distinct somatic copy number variations (CNVs) including gain of duplications in chromosomes 5 and 8. ECM‐mimetic topography selectively enhances migration speed of tumorigenic cells, but not of non‐tumorigenic cells, and results in a wide distribution of tumorigenic single‐cell migration speeds, suggesting heterogeneity in cellular sensing of contact guidance cues. This study identifies mutations and CNVs acquired during breast tumorigenesis, which can be associated with enhanced migration of breast tumorigenic cells, and demonstrates that a nanotopographically‐defined platform can be applied to recapitulate an ECM structure for investigating cellular migration in the simulated tumor microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Survival rates for most head and neck cancers (HNCs) have seen large statistically significant improvements. This is attributed in part to recent advances in the use of chemotherapy plus radiation and the use of hyperfractionated radiotherapy.[1] That's great news on the survival front and can be attributed to the physicians and researchers who continue to evolve HNC research and treatment. However, on this journey as a survivor, sometimes it seems that with every step forward, obstacles appear. What follows are notes divided into two parts. The first explores agency and patient-centric actions under the patient's control that may lead to better survival outcomes. The second discusses quality of life (QoL) considerations for long term HNC survivors based on my experience. Part 1. Patient agency can drive better outcomes Knowledge and outreach were enabling. While each person and their cancer is a unique medical condition, there is a growing wealth of information to help better understand your cancer. I accumulated knowledge and found key informational resources about the latest treatment approaches, medical facilities treating high numbers of specific HNCs and clinical trials. After undergoing a difficult surgery, I was diagnosed with 5 inoperable hot spots, I asked my physician what options I had. Chemo left me in bed for a year but the 5 became 1 operable cancer spot. Having learned much, I was prepared when my physician told me that the cancer will keep coming back if we don't try something out-of-the-box. My reply – what options do I have? My daughter was growing but my job as her dad was not finished. The research empowered me. My physician and I had built a trusting relationship. He listened to me and I listened to him. I became a knowledgeable advocate for myself. I became a partner in my treatment plan. My medical team found a clinical trial at another highly regarded HNC institution and modeled my treatment plan based on that trial. I was fortunate that my persistence and having a care team that listened and fought with me. My cancer never returned. I remain thankful that I continue to see my daughter grow into the amazing person she is becoming. Throughout this journey of ups and downs, I found an extended support system through social media. There I received patient-centered insights for my questions and concerns. Every question I had I took to my physician. He still listens and discusses all the options facing me. Write down your questions before your visit with the medical team. Visits can be overwhelming and by writing the questions down there is a higher likelihood they will be asked and not forgotten. Also, find the right medical team for you. For me, it was pivotal. Establishing and maintaining follow up visits. Fifty to 60% of HNC patients develop a recurrence within 2 years after initial diagnosis and treatment.[2] Establish a follow up plan and stick to it. The visits may begin quarterly and then taper off to semi-annually, and then annually. At a minimum, maintaining follow up visits, is a quality-of-life (QoL) activity, because the earlier a recurrence is detected and attended to, the better the potential outcome and quality of life for you. Maintaining oral health and nutrition. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) is common among HNC survivors and can be challenging. Work with a qualified medical Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) to determine a nutrition plan. This may necessitate a modified diet or a feeding tube. Feeding tubes have their place in the HNC survivorship population. Research indicates that bacteria in the oral cavity (i.e., microbiome) can sometimes lead to systemic infection, and other health related challenges.[3, 4] This further complicates what can and cannot be done safely in a compromised jawbone due to radiation. An ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure. Rehabilitation was essential. Speech and swallowing deficits are common HNC survivor outcomes. A qualified medical SLP will help guide you through rehabilitation. I recommend you start this process concurrent with your treatment. A common saying one will hear is, “use it or lose it”. This applies to both speech and swallowing. Finding my “new normal.” The experience of surviving HNC changes life after treatment. For example, because your voice changes, it may be more difficult for others to understand you. You may lose your ability to be spontaneous, and for me, I couldn't tell jokes as well as before. Jokes need timing to be most effective and, well, funny. With my speech difficulties, I couldn't deliver a good punch line – but I still try. I kept activities that were important to me in both phases of my life pre- and post-HNC. I traveled then for fun, now I travel to advocate for all those surviving HNCs and swallowing disorders. Because I don't have a social eating ability due to my surgery, my social activities are a bit different or at least require more thought as my diet has changed. I can't really go out to eat, in a literal sense. To be part of social dining experience, I may move the food around on the plate (like a little kid who doesn't want to eat his peas) so that the wait staff doesn't come over and ask, is everything alright with your meal? One's “new normal” may change over time. Whatever changes you face, understand there is a cost to survivorship and accept them. You are not giving up. You are continuing to fight with your dignity, awareness, knowledge and your treatment plan. Adapting to your new circumstances gives you power over what seems at times uncontrollable. Part II. Quality-of Life (QOL) as a survivor Post-traumatic stress. HNC treatment can be traumatic. I was convinced that I was suffocating when removed from the ventilator following my salvage surgery (Briefly, my salvage surgery involved removal of the primary tumor at the base of my tongue, my left lingual nerve ran right through my tumor necessitating the severing of that nerve. My left jawbone and 4 perfectly good teeth were surgically removed and replaced by my tibia bone from my right leg, a skin graft from my right upper thigh was used to repair the tissue from where my tibia was removed. A titanium plate was inserted from my earlobe to my chin to support my jaw's reconstruction. This was a 12-hour surgery). This sensation lasted on and off for 5 days. Recently, when the thought of how a COVID-19 infection could potentially affect my respiratory system, memories of suffocation came rushing back 14 years after the salvage surgery. Seek appropriate mental health support, because surviving HNC leaves a trail of tears in your mind and body, often resulting in some type of PTSD.[5] Aspiration pneumonia awareness. This is common among HNC survivors.[6] Onset can vary. Mine happened 5 years after my treatment stopped and I can pinpoint the moment it happened. Everyone aspirates, it's all a matter of degree, frequency, and your overall health. My aspiration pneumonia crept up on me to the point where I was very weak and became hospitalized. Social isolation and other changes. As mentioned earlier, speech and swallowing may become compromised. These were functions that I took for granted. Imagine not being able to eat or communicate verbally in social situations. This will change how you live your life and what you enjoy. I chose to recognize and accept with conviction this new reality, because just maybe, this bittersweet adversity might create opportunities to discover new joys. Swallowing Disorders (dysphagia). As the volunteer president of the National Foundation of Swallowing Disorders for over a decade I have a lot of contact with those experiencing dysphagia. Many are HNC survivors requiring validating diagnosis.[7] The number of times I've heard other patients say their healthcare provider says it is all in their head is disheartening. If you encounter this, and I hope you don't, challenge your medical team to recognize this is real and needs to be addressed. If not, find a new healthcare provider! Aging versus treatment effects. With aging as an HNC survivor, there may be biological changes that impact treatment outcomes and QoL.[8, 9] Unfortunately, it can be difficult to differentiate age-related effects from treatment-related effects. Consult your medical team with changes that seem unusual. This could be your primary cancer physician, the dental oncology experts, a qualified SLP, a geriatrician offering a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), and, always, seek mental health support Neurotoxic effects. This is another common symptom of HNC patients.[10] A peculiar historical irony is that much of chemotherapy was born out of observations in the World Wars I/II, with the observation of nitrogen mustard exposure exhibiting effects on certain cancers [11, 12] . It's not surprising that there are off-target effects and drawbacks to certain chemotherapeutic agents. Neuropathy (tingling and numbness often of your limbs or face) may be one of them. Another neurotoxic symptom of cancer therapy can be cognitive impairment. This brain fog may be long or short lasting. With either symptom, please seek medical help to track the severity. While treatment options are few, research in this area is a priority. Pain management. A good pain management specialist is invaluable. In some cases, opiates may be the best option. This has become more controversial with the opioid crisis. Other options to mitigate pain are an active area of research.[13, 14] In closing, while there have been advances in HNC treatment and cancer, the road ahead for survivors needs to be paved with efforts that improve QoL. The Cancer Neuroscience symposium and special issue in November 2022 that I was part of was an important step in that journey, but the road to pave still lies ahead and must be taken. I remain grateful to my integrated HNC team of dedicated medical and research professionals at the University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center. They listened to my wishes and gave me the gift of life… 18 years of watching my daughter grow up. 18 years of travels to see the world. 18 years and counting to speak for many HNC survivors.

Many researches have been made to understand the drug‐induced cholestasis using human cell based in vitro 3D model. Although noninvasive observation of 3D model will help unveil the hidden mechanism of this phenomenon, there have been few studies using the noninvasive methods. This study has attempted to evaluate the potential of noninvasive optical coherence tomography (OCT) combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy using the aggregates of a differentiated human hepatic cell line. From immunofluorescence staining images, the aggregates during drug‐induced cholestasis are divided into three groups: aggregates of mature phase (type I), immature phase (type II), and death phase (type III). OCT data reveal that different distributions of gray levels of OCT images are observed between heterogeneous (type I and II) and homogeneous cell populations (type III). A threshold based on gray levels of OCT data in each phenotype is determined, and the data can distinguish type III aggregates from the others. The results suggest that OCT data provide valuable information for noninvasively and quantitatively determining the transition of different types of cell population, i.e., from type I and II to type III, in drug‐induced intrahepatic cholestasis processes.",

Over the past years, optogenetics has become a versatile tool in life science research. This special issue will be focused on the molecular aspects of this technology from controlling protein activity and signaling pathways to immunological applications. With this we continue our tradition of publishing special issues, such as the December 2020 issue dedicated to the topic of “Extracellular Vesicles” and guest-edited by our editorial board member Ralph Weissleder. This compilation of 12 articles was focused on diagnostic aspects of extracellular vesicles analysis and has been prepared by current and past members of a large exosome consortium in Boston. Furthermore, we have recently streamlined our article types to “Research Articles” and “Reviews”, which may be of any length. However, the scientific contents should justify the length. We will continue to publish “Perspectives” as well as “Comments”. More information on the requirements for each article type can be found on our author guidelines page. The year 2021 will also bring some changes with regards to indexing. I am happy to announce that Clarivate has decided to move the journal from the Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) to the Science Citations Index Expanded (SCIE). This means that we will receive our first impact factor next year. After the inclusion of Advanced Biosystems in MEDLINE (PubMed) in 2020 this represents another milestone for the journal. Advanced Biology's dedicated team of full-time in-house editors is wholeheartedly committed to growing the journal's impact and usefulness for the scientific community with the support of our international editorial advisory board. With new topic areas to cover, we will welcome new editorial board members to help guide us into our future in these growing and productive fields. We are grateful to our authors, readers and editorial board members for their continued support of the journal as we enter our 5th year of publication. I am very excited about our plans for Advanced Biology, and I hope that you will join us on this journey. We are looking forward to receiving your manuscripts from the topic areas mentioned above and related areas and to establishing Advanced Biology as a premium journal for the life sciences.

Triangular microposts (dark triangles) separate the central microchannel containing the fibroblast spheroid from the left microchannel containing the endothelial lumen. The sprouts are observed to surround the spheroid.",
