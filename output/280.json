    "abstract": "We consider linear heat equations in a bounded domain of $\\mathbb R^{d}$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We analyze the problem of controllability when the control acts on a (small) open subset of the domain. It is by now well known that the system is approximately controllable, null-controllable and also finite-approximately controllable. This last property means that there exist controls by means of which we can simultaneously guarantee the approximate controllability and the exact controllability of a projection of the solution over a finite dimensional subspace. In this paper we obtain explicit bounds of the cost of approximate controllability, i.e., of the minimal norm of a control needed to control the system approximately. We also address the problem of simultaneous finite-approximate controllability. The methods we use combine global Carleman estimates, energy estimates for parabolic equations and the variational approach to approximate controllability. In the case of the constant coefficient heat equation, following a different approach, we are able to obtain better bounds. We also show that, in this particular case, the estimates are sharp. As a consequence of our estimates, we can determine the speed of convergence of the limiting process in which the approximate control is obtained through a sequence of penalized optimal control problems.",

Included in the study are existence results, comparisons between the Boussinesq equations and other wave models, and several numerical simulations. The existence theory is in fact a local well-posedness result that becomes global when the solution satisfies a practically reasonable constraint. The comparison result is concerned with initial velocities and wave profiles that correspond to unidirectional propagation. In this circumstance, it is shown that the solution of the Boussinesq system is very well approximated by an associated solution of the KdV or BBM equation over a long time scale of order $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the ratio of the maximum wave amplitude to the undisturbed depth of the liquid. This result confirms earlier numerical simulations and suggests further numerical experiments, some of which are reported here. Our results are related to recent results of Bona, Colin and Lannes [11] comparing Boussinesq systems of equations to the full two-dimensional Euler equations (see also the recent work of Schneider and Wayne [26] and Wright [30].",

In contrast, motivated by the recent work of Machihara, Nakanishi, and Tsugawa, [7] we first prove local existence in $L^2$ by using null coordinates, where the time of existence depends on the profile of the initial data. To extend this to a global existence result we need to rule out concentration of $L^2$ norm, or charge, at a point.

Therefore the usual solvability conditions and the conventional methods of non-linear analysis cannot be directly applied. We reduce the elliptic problem to an integro-differential system of equations and show how to apply the implicit function theorem to it. It allows us to prove existence of waves for the Lewis number different from $1$ and sufficiently close to it.

The major aim of this paper is to provide a framework ensuring the validity of the fractional Euler-Lagrange equation in the case of a Riemann-Liouville derivative of order $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. For this purpose, we consider the set of functions possessing $p$-integrable Riemann-Liouville derivatives and we introduce a class of quasi-polynomially controlled growth Lagrangian. In the first part of the paper, we prove a new fractional fundamental (du Bois-Reymond) lemma and a new fractional integration by parts formula involving boundary terms. The proof of the second result is based on an integral representation of functions possessing Riemann-Liouville derivatives. In the second part of the paper, we give not only a necessary optimality condition of Euler-Lagrange type for fractional Bolza functionals, but also necessary optimality boundary conditions. Finally, we give an additional application of our results: we prove an existence result for solutions of linear fractional boundary value problems. This last result is based on a Hilbert structure and the classical Stampacchia theorem.",

The novelty is the existence of solutions with very fast decay as $|x|\\to \\infty$. There are other ways in which this range differs from usual nonlinear diffusion.

We characterize the conditions that must satisfy the auxiliary function that leads to a global Carleman inequality for the adjoint problem and then to get a null controllability result. We give some examples of unbounded domains $(\\Omega,\\omega)$ that satisfy these sufficient conditions. Finally, when $\\Omega\\setminus \\overline \\omega$ is bounded, we prove the null controllability of the semilinear heat equation when the nonlinearity $f(y,\\nabla y)$ grows more slowly than $|y|\\log^{3/2}(1+|y|+|\\nabla y|)+ |\\nabla y|\\log^{1/2}(1+|y|+|\\nabla y|)$ at infinity (generally in this case in the absence of control, blow-up occurs).

The results have been obtained by the method of sub and supersolutions (appropriately modified) and Schauder's fixed point theorem.

For the Catteneo system without inertial term, being a coupling of a Schrödinger type equation (the elastic plate equation) with a hyperbolic system for the temperature and the heat flux, we shall show that a regularity-loss phenomenon appears in the asymptotic behavior as time tends to infinity, while this is not given in the standard model where the Cattaneo law is replaced by the standard Fourier law. This kind of effect of changing the qualitative behavior when moving from Fourier to Cattaneo reflects the effect known for bounded domains, where the system with Fourier law is exponentially stable while this property is lost when going to the Cattaneo law. In particular, we shall describe in detail the singular limit as $\\tau\\to 0$. For the system with inertial term we demonstrate that it is of standard type, not of regularity loss type. The corresponding limit of a vanishing inertial term is also described. All constants appearing in the main results are given explicitly, allowing for quantitative estimates.

For examples of these problems on ball domains it is known that there is a $\\lambda^*>0$ such that there exists a unique small nonnegative solution for $0 <\\lambda <\\lambda^*$. This is in contrast to the situation where $f$ has superlinear but subcritical growth , in which case always also a large unstable solution can be found.

We do not have to assume anything on the behavior of $f$ between zero and infinity. More generally we can assign to any domain $\\Omega$ a number $M(\\Omega)$ which in the case that $M(\\Omega) < \\frac12$ allows the same conclusion if in the above growth condition $\\frac{n-2}{2n}$ is replaced by $\\frac12-M(\\Omega)$.

We take the parameter $p>2$, so that finite propagation holds and free boundaries occur. We consider the problem posed in the whole space $R^n$ and work with nonnegative solutions. A self-similar solution is a solution $ u(x,t)$ that preserves its shape in time up to scaling. By focusing we mean that the solution vanishes for, say, $t<0$, in a ball of radius $s(t)$ centered at the origin and as $t\\to 0$ we get $s(t)\\to 0$, so that the hole disappears at $t=0$. We have $s(t)=c\\,(-t)^\\nu$ and the main point is the calculation of the anomalous exponent $\\nu=\\nu(n,p)$. The behaviour of the solution near $(0,0)$ is important in the regularity theory because when focusing occurs in dimension greater than $1$ a singularity appears. Hence, focusing solutions supply concrete bounds for the regularity of general solutions of the equation, which are presumably optimal. A characteristic of the focusing problem for the PLE is the fact that $\\nu$ is not a monotone function of $p$ so that minimal regularity at the focusing is obtained for an intermediate $p$ in the interval $(2,\\infty)$.",

We prove that the observation of the last component of the vector state allows one to recover the initial energies of all of its components in suitable functional spaces under a necessary and sufficient condition on the coupling operators for cascade bidiagonal systems. The approach is based on a multi-level energy method which involves $n$-levels of weakened energies. We establish this result for the case of bounded as well as unbounded dual-control operators and under the hypotheses of partial coercivity of the $n-1$ coupling operators on the sub-diagonal of the system. We further extend our observability result to mixed bidiagonal and non-bidiagonal $n+p$-coupled cascade systems by $p+1$ observations. Applying the HUM method, we derive the corresponding exact controllability results for $n$-coupled bidiagonal cascade and $n+p$-coupled mixed cascade systems. Using the transmutation method for the wave operator, we prove that the corresponding heat (respectively Schr\\odinger) multi-dimensional cascade systems are null-controllable for control regions and coupling regions which are disjoint from each other and for any positive time for $n \\le 5$ for dimensions larger than $2$, and for any $n \\ge 2$ in the one-dimensional case. The controls can be localized on a subdomain or on the boundary, and in the one-dimensional case the coupling coefficients can be supported in any non-empty subset of the domain.",

The quantum correction can be interpreted as a dispersive regularization of the classical hydrodynamic equations. Physically motivated Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions for the electron density are prescribed. The existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for sufficiently small current densities are proven. Furthermore, the classical limit (vanishing scaled Planck constant) and the zero-space-charge limit (vanishing scaled Debye length) are performed. The proofs are based on a transformation of variable for the electron density, yielding a fourth-order, elliptic equation for the new variable. As a by-product of the classical limit, the existence of subsonic solutions to the hydrodynamic system is obtained. Finally, numerical examples are presented showing that for ``large'' current densities, fast oscillations in the particle density occur as the scaled Planck constant tends to zero.",

The large time behavior of the solutions is usually embodied by the attractor and the inertial manifolds which have been the object of many studies. In the present article, explicit expressions which can be completely evaluated are obtained for the dimension of an inertial manifold for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. This involves reworking the analysis in [1] to estimate the radius of the absorbing ball. From there, the choice of phase space, spectral gap condition, and preparation of the equation outside the absorbing ball are varied and the results compared over a moderate domain length. A new preparation of the equation is introduced which leads to the smallest dimension of those compared. The dimension is also obtained for the equation prepared using radii smaller than that of the known absorbing ball, down to the radius of the global attractor suggested by computations.",

Also, as consequences of (2), we derive a parabolic Liouville theorem for (1), and for some equations of the form $u_t=\\Delta u+f(u,\\nabla u)$, we obtain results on blow-up rates and a priori estimates of global solutions.

    "abstract": "This work is concerned with the exact controllability/obser-vability of abstract cascade hyperbolic systems by a reduced number of controls/observations. We prove that the observation of the last component of the vector state allows one to recover the initial energies of all of its components in suitable functional spaces under a necessary and sufficient condition on the coupling operators for cascade bidiagonal systems. The approach is based on a multi-level energy method which involves $n$-levels of weakened energies. We establish this result for the case of bounded as well as unbounded dual-control operators and under the hypotheses of partial coercivity of the $n-1$ coupling operators on the sub-diagonal of the system. We further extend our observability result to mixed bidiagonal and non-bidiagonal $n+p$-coupled cascade systems by $p+1$ observations. Applying the HUM method, we derive the corresponding exact controllability results for $n$-coupled bidiagonal cascade and $n+p$-coupled mixed cascade systems. Using the transmutation method for the wave operator, we prove that the corresponding heat (respectively Schr\\\"odinger) multi-dimensional cascade systems are null-controllable for control regions and coupling regions which are disjoint from each other and for any positive time for $n \\le 5$ for dimensions larger than $2$, and for any $n \\ge 2$ in the one-dimensional case. The controls can be localized on a subdomain or on the boundary, and in the one-dimensional case the coupling coefficients can be supported in any non-empty subset of the domain.",

Our first result concerns weak solutions in the two-dimensional case, for initial data close to the stationary state. Our method is based on general arguments for stabilization of nonlinear parabolic systems combined with a change of variables to handle the fact that the fluid domain of the stationary state and of the stabilized solution are different. This additional difficulty leads to the assumption that the initial position of the rigid body is the position associated to the stationary state. Without this hypothesis, we work with strong solutions, and to deal with compatibility conditions at the initial time, we use finite dimensional dynamical controls. We again prove that for initial data close to the stationary state, we can stabilize the position and the velocity of the rigid body and the velocity of the fluid. In the three dimensional case, we also obtain the local stabilization of strong solutions with finite dimensional dynamical controls.",

Equations of type (0.1) are often well posed in a scale $X_s$, say, of Banach spaces, at least for $s$ large enough. Here, increasing values of $s$ correspond to more regularity; thus $X_r\\subset X_s $ if $r>s$. For smaller values of $s$, some equations of the form in (0.1) are well-posed in a conditional sense that the uniqueness aspect depends upon the imposition of auxiliary conditions. In the latter context, it is natural to inquire whether or not the auxiliary conditions are essential to securing uniqueness. It is shown here that for a conditionally well-posed Cauchy problem (0.1), the auxiliary specification is removable if a certain persistence of regularity holds. As a consequence, it will transpire that a conditionally well-posed problem (0.1) is (unconditionally) well-posed if the aforementioned persistence property holds. These results are applied to study several recent conditional well-posedness results for the KdV equation, nonlinear Schrödinger equations, and nonlinear wave equations. It is demonstrated that the auxiliary conditions used to secure the uniqueness are all removable and the corresponding Cauchy problems are, in fact, unconditionally well-posed as long as their classical solutions exist globally. In addition, the well-posedness for an initial-boundary-value problem for the KdV equation posed in a quarter plane is also considered. An affirmative answer is provided for a uniqueness question left open in a recent paper of Colliander and Kenig [14].",

Our results extend previous work on perturbations in the scale of fractional domain spaces associated with $A$ and allow for a greater flexibility in choosing intermediate spaces for the action of perturbation operators.

In the last thirty years these PDE ideas of Sturm found new applications, generalizations and extensions in various areas of general parabolic theory, stability and orbital connection problems, unique continuation and Poincaré--Bendixson theorems, mean curvature and curve shortening flows, symplectic geometry, etc. Using such a local classification of multiple zeros, we establish a unique continuation theorem for higher-order parabolic PDEs and inequalities, and estimate the Hausdorff dimension of nodal sets of solutions. It turns out that some common features of multiple zeros formation can be observed for solutions of other PDEs including linear dispersion and wave equations, $$ u_t=u_{xxx} \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad u_{tt}=u_{xx}, $$ and we present a discussion on this issue.",

The motion of the fluid is described by the compressible Navier-Stokes equations whereas the motion of the structure is given by the nonlinear Saint-Venant Kirchhoff model. For this model, we prove the existence and uniqueness of regular solutions defined locally in time. To do so, we first rewrite the nonlinearity in the elasticity equation in an adequate way. Then, we introduce a linearized problem and prove that this problem admits a unique regular solution. To obtain time regularity on the solution, we use energy estimates on the unknowns and their successive derivatives in time and to obtain spatial regularity, we use elliptic estimates. At last, to come back to the nonlinear problem, we use a fixed point theorem.",

For this purpose, the method of asymptotic integration is developed for such equations and representation formulae for solutions are obtained. These formulae are analysed further to obtain time decay of $L^p$--$L^q$ norms of propagators for the corresponding Cauchy problems. It turns out that the decay rates can be expressed in terms of certain geometric indices of the limiting equation and we carry out a thorough analysis of this relation. This provides a comprehensive view of asymptotic properties of solutions to time-perturbations of hyperbolic equations with constant coefficients. Moreover, we also obtain the time decay rate of the $L^p$--$L^q$ estimates for equations of these kinds, so that the time well posedness of the corresponding nonlinear equations with additional semilinearity can be treated by standard Strichartz estimates.",

The problem involves a weighted $p$-Laplacian operator and subcritical nonlinearities, and even in the case $p=2$ the main existence results are new.

In detail, we apply the mountain-pass theorem of Ambrosetti and Rabinowitzif $\\lambda <\\lambda_1$, while we use mini-max methods and linking structures over cones, as in Degiovanni [10]and in Degiovanni and Lancelotti [11], if $\\lambda\\ge \\lambda_1$. In the latter part of the paper we do not require any longer the Ambrosetti--Rabinowitz condition at $\\infty$, but the so-called Szulkin--Weth conditions, and we obtain the same result for all $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb R$. More precisely, using the Nehari-manifold method for $C^1$ functionals developed by Szulkin and Weth in [38], we prove existence of ground states, multiple solutions, and least-energy sign-changing solutions, whenever $\\lambda <\\lambda_1$.

For example, the Dirichlet problem of the heat equation can be solved in terms of the transform pair associated with the Fourier sine series. Such transform pairs can be constructed via the spectral analysis of the associated spatial operator. For more complicated IBVPs, which will be referred to as problems of type~II, there does not exist a classical transform pair and the solution cannot be expressed in terms of an infinite series. Here we pose and answer two related questions: first, does there exist a (non-classical) transform pair capable of solving a type~II problem, and second, can this transform pair be constructed via spectral analysis? The answer to both of these questions is positive and this motivates the introduction of a novel class of spectral entities. We call these spectral entities augmented eigenfunctions, to distinguish them from the generalized eigenfunctions described in the sixties by Gel'fand and his co-authors.",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the stability of a parallel flow of the compressible Navier-Stokes equation in a cylindrical domain. The spectrum of the linearized operator is analyzed for the purpose of the study of the nonlinear stability. It is shown that, if the Reynolds and Mach numbers are sufficiently small, then the linearized semigroup is decomposed into two parts; one behaves like a solution of a one dimensional heat equation as time goes to infinity and the other one decays exponentially. Some estimates related to the spectral projections are established, which will also be useful for the study of the nonlinear problem.",

This corresponds to an anisotropic mean curvature flow where the anisotropy has a nonconvex Frank diagram. The geometric evolution law is therefore forward-backward parabolic in character, hence ill-posed in general. We study a particular regularization of this geometric evolution, obtained with a nonlinear version of the so-called bidomain model. This is described by a degenerate system of two uniformly parabolic equations of reaction-diffusion type, scaled with a positive parameter $\\epsilon$. We analyze some properties of the formal limit of solutions of this system as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, and show its connection with nonconvex mean curvature flow. Several numerical experiments substantiating the formal asymptotic analysis are presented.",

As a consequence of the above uniform stabilization result, we obtain---via a result of [15]---a corresponding exact controllability result by explicit boundary controls, which improves upon the recent result of [4, 5].

This equation relates the pressure distribution over a typical section of a long slender wing in subsonic compressible air flow to the normal velocity of the points of a wing (down-wash). In spite of the importance of the Possio equation, the question of the existence of its solution has not yet been settled. In this paper, we provide a rigorous study of the reduced version of the Possio equation and prove its solvability. The reduced Possio equation is important in its own right for two reasons: (a) it can be used as an approximate equation for the numerical analysis of the coupled system describing a vibrating wing in a surrounding air flow; (b) its analysis is essential for identifying analytical difficulties associated with the general Possio equation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we establish and analyze a mosquito population suppression model with seasonal switching. Under the assumption that the ratio of sexually active Wolbachia-infected males and wild mosquitoes is kept at a constant level during the favorable seasons, we give a rather complete description on the dynamics including the stability of the origin, existence, stability and semi-stability of a unique, exact two periodic solutions, and so on. We obtain sufficient conditions for the origin to be globally asymptotically stable, for the model to have a unique semi-stable periodic solution, and to have exactly two periodic solutions among which one is stable and the other is unstable, respectively. Numerical examples to support our theoretical results and brief discussions are also provided.",

The estimates measure the distance to a solution of the homogenized equation with the same initial condition, on bounded time intervals. The same estimates hold for $C^1$ convergence of local stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic equilibria. As a second example, we apply our abstract semigroup result to homogenization of the Navier--Stokes equations with spatially rapidly varying quasiperiodic forces in space dimensions 2 and 3. In both examples, a Diophantine condition on the spatial frequencies is crucial to our homogenization results. Our Diophantine condition is satisfied for sets of frequency vectors of full Lebesgue measure. In the companion paper [7], based on $L^2$ methods, these results are extended to quantitative homogenization of global attractors in near-gradient reaction--diffusion systems.",

Some of the main results of our paper coincide with results in their papers, but the methods are completely different. Our main tools are the Gelfand-Levitan integral equation and transmutation (transformation) operators. The results in the papers [1]--[3] are obtained under the assumption that the potential $q(x)$ belongs to $L^2(0,\\pi).$ Instead of this we suppose that the first derivative of $q(x)$ belongs to $L^2(0,\\pi).$ This assumption facilitates the proof of the differentiability of the function $\\mathcal{F}(x,y)$ (see below) but we omit the proof of differentiability.

This means that the chosen value of such a solution can be reached by starting from initial states which are sufficiently close to the initial value of the solution and by acting with controls distributed in a given small subdomain. So, a previous controllability result for the magnetohydrodynamic equations is improved in several directions. Our treatment reduces the local controllability for the magnetohydrodynamic equations to the global controllability for their linearizations by means of an infinite-dimensional variant of the local inversion theorem. The proof of the global controllability relies on a Carleman-type estimate for the adjoint linearized equations.",

    "abstract": "In this note an ${\\mathcal{R}}$-bounded ${\\mathcal{H}}^\\infty$-calculus for linear operators associated to cylindrical boundary value problems is proved. The obtained results are based on an abstract result on operator-valued functional calculus by N. Kalton and L. Weis; cf. [28]. Cylindrical in this context means that both domain and differential operator possess a certain cylindrical structure. In comparison to standard methods (e.g. localization procedures), our approach appears less technical and provides short proofs. Besides, we are even able to deal with some classes of equations on rough domains. For instance, we can extend the well-known (and in general sharp) range for $p$ such that the (weak) Dirichlet Laplacian admits an ${\\mathcal{H}}^\\infty$-calculus on $L^p(\\Omega)$, from $(3+\\varepsilon)'<p<3+\\varepsilon$ to $(4+\\varepsilon)'<p<4+\\varepsilon$ for three-dimensional bounded or unbounded Lipschitz cylinders $\\Omega$. Our approach even admits mixed Dirichlet Neumann boundary conditions in this situation.",

The goal of this paper is to make the nonlinear geometrical optics for wave trains with such a continuous oscillatory spectrum. This requires the introduction of new spaces, which are Wiener algebras associated to spaces of vector-valued measures with bounded total variation. We also make qualitative studies on the properties of wave trains with continuous oscillatory spectrum, and on the incidence of the nonlinearity on such oscillations.

The existence of such solutions was established in [5]. In this paper we are concerned with the uniqueness of entropy solutions. We first introduce additionally to the Oleinik entropy condition a cohesion condition. Both conditions together form our extended concept of an admissibility condition for solutions to the system. The cohesion condition is automatically satisfied by the solutions obtained in the existence results mentioned above. Further, we regularize such a given admissible solution so that generalized characteristics are well-defined. Through limiting procedures the concept of generalized characteristics is then extended to a very large class of admissible solutions containing vacuum states and singular measures. Next we use the generalized characteristics and the dynamics of the center of mass in order to prove that all entropy solutions are equal in the sense of distributions.",

The nonlinearity $f$ is a ``monostable'' function with equilibria $E^- < E^+ , ~E^-$ ``stable'' and $E^+$ ``unstable'', that depends not only on $u$ but also on $u_{x}$ and satisfies both conditions sufficient for a comparison principle to hold for (0.1) (so is ``weakly-coupled''), and also either a subquadratic growth condition in $u_x$ or alternatively a mild monotonicity property in $u_x$. It is shown that there exist ${c^{*}}$ and $c_{0}$ with $c^{*} \\geq c_{0}$ such that there is a ``stable-monotone direction'' at ${E^{+}}$ for all $c \\geq c_{0}$, and solutions $w_{c} (x-ct)$ of (0.1) that connect $E^-$ to ${E^{+}}$ exist for all $c \\geq c^{*}$ (${c^{*}} \\neq c_{0}$ in general). We then discuss the stability of fronts of speed $c > {c_{0}}$ in the framework of exponentially weighted spaces, using Sattinger's approach [36] that was also exploited by the Volperts in [41]. The stability of the travelling front $w_{c}$ depends on whether $w_{c}'$ belongs to a $c-$dependent space, $X_{c}$ say. If $w_{c}' \\in X_{c}$, the solution $u^{{E^{+}}hi}$ of (0.1) with initial data $\\phi \\in {BUC}^{1}$ converges in $X_{c}$ to a {\\em translate} of $w_{c}$ if $\\phi(x) - w_{c}(x)$ is small when $|x|$ is large and $\\phi$ behaves like $w_{c}$ in a neighbourhood of the ``unstable'' equilibrium ${E^{+}}$. If $w_{c}' \\not\\in X_{c}$, the theorem is local --- $u^{\\phi}$ converges in $X_{c}$ to $w_{c}$ if $\\phi$ is close to $w_{c}$ in $X_{c}$. We also show that, as for scalar equations, at most one front solution of the parabolic system (0.1) can have ``fast-decay'', and if such a front exists, its velocity must be $c=c^{*}$.",

Our proof of the $L^p$-$L^q$ type estimate of the Stokes semigroup is based on the local energy decay estimate obtained by investigation of the asymptotic behavior of the Stokes resolvent near the origin. The order of asymptotic expansion of the Stokes resolvent near the origin is one half better compared with the exterior domain case, because we have the reflection principle on the boundary in the half-space case unlike the whole space case, and, then, such better asymptotics near the boundary are also obtained in the perturbed half-space by a perturbation argument. This is one of the reasons why the result in the perturbed half-space case is essentially better compared with the exterior domain case.",

The analysis uses Sturm's theorem on zero sets for parabolic equations, scaling techniques, and the theory of gradient dynamical systems.

    "abstract": "We prove, in this paper, a long time existence result for a modified Boussinesq-Peregrine equation in dimension $1$, describing the motion of Water Waves in shallow water, in the case of a non flat bottom. More precisely, the dimensionless equations depend strongly on three parameters $\\epsilon,\\mu,\\beta$ measuring the amplitude of the waves, the shallowness and the amplitude of the bathymetric variations, respectively. For the Boussinesq-Peregrine model, one has small amplitude variations ($\\epsilon = O(\\mu)$). We first give a local existence result for the original Boussinesq Peregrine equation as derived by Boussinesq ([9], [8]) and Peregrine ([22]) in all dimensions. We then introduce a new model which has formally the same precision as the Boussinesq-Peregrine equation, and give a local existence result in all dimensions. We finally prove a local existence result on a time interval of size $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ in dimension $1$ for this new equation, without any assumption on the smallness of the bathymetry $\\beta$, which is an improvement of the long time existence result for the Boussinesq systems in the case of flat bottom ($\\beta=0$) by [24].",

Our main result shows that large solutions do exist if, and only if, the nonlinear diffusion is not too large. As a byproduct of the general theory developed by the authors in [3], those large solutions must be unstable with respect to the positive solutions of the parabolic counterpart of the elliptic model. This seems to be the first result of this nature available in the literature. Most precisely, as the diffusion becomes non-linear the metasolutions become unstable, so arising a classical steady-state gaining the stability lost by the metasolution. In particular, a dynamical bifurcation occurs from the linear diffusion case.",

The well-known invariance of domain theorem of Schauder about injective operators of the type $I+C,$ with $C$ compact, is extended to operators $T+C.$ Here, $T$ is a possibly densely defined operator with compact resolvents and $C$ is continuous and bounded, or $T$ is just maximal monotone and $C$ compact. The case of completely continuous resolvents of $T$ and demicontinuous operators $C$ is also covered. Another invariance of domain result is given for demicontinuous, bounded, and $(S_+)$-perturbations $C.$ This result makes use of the topological degrees of Browder and Skrypnik. Finally, three invariance of domain theorems are given for the case where $T$ is single-valued and both operators $T,~C$ are densely defined. These results make use of the topological degree theory that was recently developed by the authors for the sum $T+C,$ where $C$ satisfies conditions like quasiboundedness and $(S_+)$ with respect to $T.$ Applications to elliptic and parabolic problems are included.",

On the one hand, we obtain the global regularity of the 2D magnetic Bénard system with zero thermal conductivity. The main difficulty is the zero thermal conductivity. To bypass this difficulty, we exploit the structure of the coupling system about the vorticity and the temperature and use the Maximal $L_t^{p}L_x^{q}$ regularity for the heat kernel. On the other hand, we also establish the global regularity of the 2D magnetic Bénard system with horizontal dissipation, horizontal magnetic diffusion and with either horizontal or vertical thermal diffusivity. This settles the global regularity issue unsolved in the previous works. Additionally, in the Appendix, we also show that with a full Laplacian for the diffusive term of the magnetic field and half of the full Laplacian for the temperature field, the global regularity result holds true as long as the power $\\alpha$ of the fractional Laplacian dissipation for the velocity field is positive.",

This implies the boundedness of the solutions of the renormalized (approximate) equation. In the dissipative case, we also investigate the higher-order renormalized equations, pursuing [16]: in particular, we show for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$ that the solutions of these equations are bounded and that the dissipativity property of the original system carries over in a modified form. This is shown by a simple estimate based on the above leading-order result, and, alternatively, by a \"shadowing\" argument.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the existence of sign-changing solutions for fractional elliptic equations of the form \\begin{equation*} \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} (-\\Delta)^s u=f(x,u) & \\text{in}\\ \\Omega , \\\\ u=0 & \\text{in}\\ \\mathbb R^N\\setminus \\Omega, \\end{array} \\right. \\end{equation*} where $s\\in(0,1)$ and $\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb R^N$ is a bounded smooth domain. Since the non-local operator $(-\\Delta)^s$ is involved in the equation, the variational functional of the equation has totally different properties from the local cases. By introducing some new ideas, we prove, via variational method and the method of invariant sets of descending flow, that the problem has a positive solution, a negative solution and a sign-changing solution under suitable conditions. Moreover, if $f(x,u)$ satisfies a monotonicity condition, we show that the problem has a least energy sign-changing solution with its energy is strictly larger than that of the ground state solution of Nehari type. We also obtain an unbounded sequence of sign-changing solutions if $f(x,u)$ is odd in $u$.",

    "abstract": "The renormalization group method of Chen, Goldenfeld, and Oono offers a comprehensive approach to formally computing asymptotic expansions of the solutions to singular perturbation problems and multi-scale problems. In particular, the RG method applies to a broad array of problems customarily treated with disparate methods, such as the method of multiple scales, boundary layer theory, matched asymptotic expansions, Poincare-Lindstedt theory, the WKBJ method with and without turning points, the method of averaging, and others. For problems in which the expansions are in powers of the small parameter, it has been shown that the RG method leads to uniformly valid asymptotic expansions of the solutions. In addition, it has been shown that the RG condition constitutes an invariance condition, that the RG method is effectively a resummation technique, and that it is equivalent to normal form theory for certain broad classes of perturbed ordinary differential equations. However, there has not yet been an analysis of the validity of the RG method, i.e.,i> a demonstration that it leads to uniformly valid asymptotic expansions, for problems in which the expansions also involve logarithms of the small parameter as gauge functions. The aim of this article is to provide this justification of the RG method. In particular, we extend the approach developed in DeVille, et ali>. Physica D 237 no. 8, 1029 {-}1052] from the classes of autonomous and non-autonomous perturbations considered there to include the non-autonomous systems subject to singular perturbations for which the solutions involve logarithmic gauge functions.

    "abstract": "For reaction-diffusion equations, equilibrium solutions or traveling wave solutions with thin transition layers are constructed by singular perturbation methods. It is usually difficult to study their stability. This is because the linearized eigenvalue problem has a critical eigenvalue in a small neighborhood of zero, and its location is difficult to determine. The SLEP method is known as one of the most powerful tools to study this critical eigenvalue. To apply this method rigorously, a uniform convergence theorem for the inverse of a differential operator, for instance the inverse Allen-Cahn operator, in some function space plays a crucial role. However, there has been a significant difficulty in the cases of unbounded intervals including those of traveling waves, and no rigorous result was available previously. This paper presents a uniform convergence theorem in a general framework. Our new uniform convergence theorem makes the SLEP method applicable to various kinds of problems including stability of traveling waves.",

    "abstract": "Let $X, Y$ be real Banach spaces and $B_r(0)$ the open ball in $Y$ with center at zero and radius $r> 0.$ Let $G$ be an open subset of $X.$ One of the problems that constantly arise in the study of perturbations of maximal monotone and $m$-accretive operators is the verification of the invariance of a degree function on parameter-dependent domains. For example, these domains can be of the type $A_tG, $ $t\\in [0,1],$ where $A_t:X\\to 2^Y$ has a continuous inverse $A_t^{-1}:Y\\to X$ and $D(A_t)\\cap G \\neq \\emptyset.$ Browder has shown that such degrees are invariant in various situations where the operator $A_t$ is a local homeomorphism, but no such result is known (or can be easily derived from known results) when $A_t$ is a discontinuous (possibly densely defined and/or multi-valued) mapping. The main purpose of this paper is to show that, under certain natural conditions, the Leray-Schauder degree $d(I-H(t),A_tG\\cap B_m(0),0)$ is well defined and constant for all $t\\in [0,1]$ and all sufficiently large $m,$ where $H(t):Y\\to Y$ is an appropriate compact homotopy. This fundamental result can be used to improve various results in the perturbation theory of $m$-accretive and maximal monotone operators. In particular, results by Hirano and Kartsatos, involving saddle point conditions in real Hilbert spaces, are improved. Ideas from the main theory are also used to create new degree theories for perturbed $m$-accretive operators as well as demicontinuous accretive operators defined on closures of bounded open subsets of $X$ when $X^*$ is uniformly convex.",

Finally the temperature is fixed by energy conservation; that is, the sum of kinetic energy (temperature) and gravitational energy remains constant in time. This model is thermodynamically consistent, obeying the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. We prove local existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for the system, using a Schauder fixed-point theorem.

Under the necessary conditions of spectral and hyperbolic stability, together with transversality of the connecting profile, we establish detailed pointwise estimates on perturbations from a sum of the viscous shock profile under consideration and a family of diffusion waves which propagate perturbation signals along outgoing characteristics. Our approach combines the recent $L^p$-space analysis of Raoofi [33] with a straightforward bootstrapping argument that relies on a refined description of nonlinear signal interactions, which we develop through convolution estimates involving Green's functions for the linear evolutionary PDE that arises upon linearization of the regularized conservation law about the distinguished profile.

Assuming that we can act on the system through a hierarchy of controls, to each leader, we associate a Nash equilibrium (two followers) corresponding to a bi-objective optimal control problem. Then we look for a leader that solves an exact boundary controllability problem. We mainly consider the case of a semilinear hyperbolic PDE where all the controls (leader and followers) act on small parts of the boundary. In view of the lack of regularity, the arguments usually invoked to prove controllability do not work here. Accordingly, we carry out a fixed-point approach based on weak compactness in $L^1$. To this purpose, we apply Dunford-Pettis' Theorem. We also consider the case where the followers act in small subsets of the domain.",

Our main result is the fact that the sets of the root vectors (generalized eigenvectors) of these operators form Riesz bases in the corresponding energy spaces. This result has several applications. The first one is the fact that the aforementioned operators are spectral in the sense of N. Dunford, and, therefore, we have a new nontrivial class of spectral operators. Another application is a precise estimate on the rate of the energy decay, which is equal to the spectral abscissa of the corresponding semigroup. Finally, we use the results of our spectral analysis to formulate the solutions of several problems in control theory of systems governed by damped wave equations (the proofs are given in another work).",

    "abstract": "First we prove certain pointwise bounds for the fundamental solutions of the perturbed linearized Navier-Stokes equation (Theorem 1.1). Next, utilizing a new framework with very little $L^p$ theory or Fourier analysis, we prove existence of global classical solutions for the full Navier-Stokes equation when the initial value has a small norm in a new function class of Kato type (Theorem 1.2). The smallness in this function class does not require smallness in $L^2$ norm. Furthermore we prove that a Leray-Hopf solution is regular if it lies in this class, which allows much more singular functions then before (Corollary 1). For instance this includes the well-known result in [25]. A further regularity condition (form boundedness) was given in Section 5. We also give a different proof about the $L^2$ decay of Leray-Hopf solutions and prove pointwise decay of solutions for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations (Corollary 2, Theorem 1.2). Whether such a method exists was asked in a survey paper [2].",

Moreover, we characterize the limit as a weak solution to limit equations, which are the damped and weighted Navier–Stokes equations on the limit surface. We also prove the strong convergence of the average of a strong solution to the bulk equations towards a weak solution to the limit equations by showing estimates for the difference between them. In some special case, our limit equations agree with the Navier–Stokes equations on a Riemannian manifold in which the viscous term contains the Ricci curvature.

We prove that, in the multi-dimensional half space, solutions of the problem with prescribed contact angle asymptotically converge to a self-similar solution of the associated problem under a suitable rescaling. Several properties of the profile function of the self-similar solution are also investigated. We show that the profile function has a corner and that the angles are determined by points at which the equation is degenerate. We also study the depth of the groove, which is represented by the value of the profile function at the boundary. Among other results it turns out that, as the contact angle tends to zero, the depth of the groove is well approximated by the linearized problem.",

On the other hand the vorticity of the fluid which is entering into the domain from the sources is prescribed. In this paper, we investigate the existence of weak solutions to this system by relying on {\\it a priori} bounds of the vorticity, which satisfies a transport equation associated with the fluid velocity vector field. Our results cover the case where the vorticity has a $L^p$ integrability in space, with $p $ in $[1,+\\infty]$, and prove the existence of solutions obtained by compactness methods from viscous approximations. More precisely we prove the existence of solutions which satisfy the vorticity equation in the distributional sense in the case where $p > \\frac43$, in the renormalized sense in the case where $p > 1$, and in a symmetrized sense in the case where $p =1$.",

This type of solution is called a $BV$-entropy solution.

However either of the part of conservation laws and that of porous medium type diffusion term may not be treated as a perturbation of the other.

Simple initial-boundary value problems, which will be referred to as problems of type I, can be solved via a classical transform pair. For example, the Dirichlet problem of the heat equation can be solved in terms of the transform pair associated with the Fourier sine series. Such transform pairs can be constructed via the spectral analysis of the associated spatial operator. For more complicated initialboundary value problems, which will be referred to as problems of type II, there does not exist a classical transform pair and the solution cannot be expressed in terms of an infinite series. Here we pose and answer two related questions: first, does there exist a (non-classical) transform pair capable of solving a type II problem, and second, can this transform pair be constructed via spectral analysis? The answer to both of these questions is positive and this motivates the introduction of a novel class of spectral entities. We call these spectral entities augmented eigenfunctions, to distinguish them from the generalised eigenfunctions introduced in the sixties by Gel’fand and his co-authors.

We first prove the existence of $\\mathbb{H}^1$-random attractors for the stochastic flow generated by 2D SCBF equations (for the absorption exponent $r\\in[1,3]$) perturbed by an additive noise on Poincaré domains $\\mathcal O$. Furthermore, we deduce the existence of a unique invariant measure in $\\mathbb{H}^1(\\mathcal O) $ for the 2D SCBF equations defined on Poincaré domains. In addition, a remark on the extension of these results to general unbounded domains is also provided. Finally, for 2D SCBF equations forced by additive one-dimensional Wiener noise, we prove the upper semicontinuity of the random attractors, when the domain changes from bounded to unbounded (Poincaré) domain.",

The dynamics is anticipated to minimize an appropriate grand canonical free energy; we make this notion precise by introducing a metric on a set of positive Borel measures without pre-prescribed mass and demonstrating that the dynamics is a gradient flow with respect to this metric. Moreover, we develop a JKO-type scheme suitable for these problems. The latter ideas have general applicability to a class of second order non-conservative problems. For this particular system we prove, using the JKO-type scheme, that under certain conditions – not too far from optimal - convergence to the uniform stationary state is exponential with a rate which is independent of the volume. By contrast, in related conservative systems, decay rates scale (at best) with the square of the characteristic length of the system. This suggests that a grand canonical approach may be useful for both theoretical and computational study of large scale systems.",

    "abstract": "We consider a well-known model for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) with variable dielectric permittivity, involving a parabolic equation with singular nonlinearity. We study the touchdown, or quenching, phenomenon. Recently, the question whether or not touchdown can occur at zero points of the permittivity profile $f$, which had long remained open, was answered negatively for the case of interior points. The first aim of this article is to go further by considering the same question at points of positive but small permittivity. We show that, in any bounded domain, touchdown cannot occur at an interior point where the permittivity profile is suitably small. We also obtain a similar result in the boundary case, under a smallness assumption on $f$ in a neighborhood of the boundary. This allows in particular to construct $f$ producing touchdown sets concentrated near any given sphere. Our next aim is to obtain more information on the structure and properties of the touchdown set. In particular, we show that the touchdown set need not in general be localized near the maximum points of the permittivity profile $f$. In the radial case in a ball, we actually show the existence of “M”-shaped profiles $f$ for which the touchdown set is located far away from the maximum points of $f$ and we even obtain strictly convex $f$ for which touchdown occurs only at the unique minimum point of $f$. These results give analytical confirmation of some numerical simulations from the book [P. Esposito, N. Ghoussoub, Y. Guo, Mathematical analysis of partial differential equations modeling electrostatic MEMS, Courant Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 2010] and solve some of the open questions therein. They also show that some kind of smallness condition as above cannot be avoided in order to rule out touchdown at a point. On the other hand, we construct profiles $f$ producing more complex behaviors: in any bounded domain the touchdown set may be concentrated near two arbitrarily given points, or two arbitrarily given $(n-1)$-dimensional spheres in a ball. These examples are obtained as a consequence of stability results for the touchdown time and touchdown set under small perturbations of the permittivity profile.",

The latter step involves transformations where the frequency appears in the denominator. In this paper, we are interested in situations where the frequency at the bifurcation point is small, and it would be of interest to consider bifurcated solutions with amplitudes on the same order as the frequency. In this case, the Birkhoff normal form breaks down, and the bifurcation equations become significantly more complex. We consider the Hopf bifurcation on the hexagonal lattice in this context. A possible application arises in the two-layer Bénard problem.",

This equation is coupled with Poisson's equation for the potential generated by the density distribution. The system preserves mass by imposing a zero-flux boundary condition. Finally the temperature is fixed by energy conservation; that is, the sum of kinetic energy (temperature) and gravitational energy remains constant in time. This model is thermodynamically consistent, obeying the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. We prove local existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for the system, using a Schauder fixed-point theorem.

    "abstract": "1. Introduction.The Cauchy problem for nonlinear strictly hyperbolic equations is C 1 well-posed ([4]).Later the Cauchy problem was studied for not necessarily strictly hyperbolic equations; these are called weakly hyperbolic.We remind the reader in this context of [14], where the characteristics had to be of constant multiplicity or smooth.The case of characteristics of variable multiplicity was considered for linear hyperbolic equations in [23] and for systems of nonlinear hyperbolic equations in [13].But in all these weakly hyperbolic cases the wellposedness of the Cauchy problem could be proved only in all Gevrey classes of order s, 1 < s < d/(d 1), with respect to the spatial variables.Here d denotes the highest multiplicity of the characteristic roots of a suitable main symbol which are real in the weakly hyperbolic case.The critical exponent arises in a natural way.For that we have only to take into consideration the fact that the Cauchy problem for u (m) t u x = 0 is globally well-posed if and only if 1  s < m/(m 1) (for m = 2 see [8]).One has to assume so-called Levi conditions to include Gevrey classes of order s > d/(d 1) or C 1 .To explain this kind of conditions we consider two model equations.Let us be given the weakly hyperbolic equation with time degeneracy of finite order (t l ) u tt t 2l u xx + at k u x = 0.It follows from [11,12,17] that the Cauchy problem is well-posed in all Gevrey classes and in C 1 if and only if k l 1.In opposition to this result the Cauchy problem for the weakly hyperbolic equation with spatial degeneracy of finite order (x l ) is well-posed in all Gevrey classes and in C 1 if and only if k l ([11, 12, 19]).Both types of this kind of degeneracy were combined in [10,19,22,24].In the following we restrict ourselves to the case of spatial degeneracy.In [26,27] a general concept of necessary and su cient conditions for the C 1 well-posedness was proposed even for higher-order weakly hyperbolic equations.Let us illustrate some conditions for the equation u tt + b(x, t)u xt a(x, t)u xx + c(x, t)u x + d(x, t)u t + g(x, t)u = f (x, t).(1.1)",

Using the semigroup method the local existence for initial data that are an $L^2$ perturbation of a traveling-wave profile is proved. We also obtain a regularity property of these solutions. The solution operator generated by the linearized equation plays a crucial role. Using the energy method we establish a priori estimates. These estimates, when combined with the local existence, lead to the desired global-in-time existence as well as the time-asymptotic decay of solutions with initial data close to a monotone traveling wave.",

A proper maximal solution $u(x,t) \\ge 0$ is the limit of a monotone decreasing sequence of smooth strictly positive solutions of the regularized problems, which are assumed to be well-posed. The solutions exhibit finite interface propagation on the singular level $\\{u=0\\}$. The geometric theory reduces the study of the PDE to a family of the ODEs. We show that existence, Bernstein-type gradient estimates, moduli of continuity, interface regularity, the interface equation, etc. are directly connected with the family of ODEs associated with the nonlinear PDE. For the autonomous PDEs we utilize a complete set $B=\\{V\\}$ of particular travelling wave solutions $V(x,t)=f(x-{\\lambda} t)$, where $f(\\xi)$ solves a nonlinear ODE with a parameter ${\\lambda} \\in {{\\bf R}}$. The proofs rely on intersection comparison techniques of the solutions $u(x,t)$ with the family $B$ which are based on the classical Sturm Theorem on zero sets for linear parabolic equations. We study the regularity properties and derive the interface equations for several types of the quasilinear and fully nonlinear equations from combustion, filtration and detonation theory.",

Using a partial Hodograph-Legendre transform and the implicit function theorem, we prove the higher order Hölder regularity for the regular free boundary, if the associated coefficients are of the corresponding regularity. For the zero obstacle, this yields an improvement of a full derivative for the free boundary regularity compared to the regularity of the coefficients. In the presence of inhomogeneities, we gain three halves of a derivative for the free boundary regularity with respect to the regularity of the inhomogeneity. Further, we show analyticity of the regular free boundary for analytic coefficients. We also discuss the set-up of $W^{1,p}$ coefficients with $p>n+1$ and $L^p$ inhomogeneities. Key ingredients in our analysis are the introduction of generalized Hölder spaces, which allow to interpret the transformed fully nonlinear, degenerate (sub)elliptic equation as a perturbation of the Baouendi-Grushin operator, various uses of intrinsic geometries associated with appropriate operators, the application of the implicit function theorem to deduce (higher) regularity.",

For classes of asymptotically linear nonlinearities the existence of at least one nontrivial solution is captured as the preimage of a mountain pass or a linking critical point of the dual functional. In all the cases, information on the eigenvalues of the inverse of the linear operator is needed and demonstrated.

    "abstract": "We are investigating regularity issues for parabolic almost minimizers of integral functionals with polynomial growth structure. In particular, we are interested in functions with values in the target space $\\mathbb R^N$ for a dimension $N > 1$ and our aim is to prove Hölder continuity for the spatial gradient of an almost minimizer on an open set of full Lebesgue measure. As classical counter examples show, the regularity results which we achieve are optimal if we are dealing with general almost minimizers and dimensions of the target space strictly greater than one. However, the results are also valid in the case $N=1$, even if they are not optimal in that case. Our contribution can be seen as a natural generalization of the elliptic regularity theory for the gradient of vector--valued almost minimizers, which was developed in the 1980s to the framework of time-dependent, parabolic, problems. The parabolic nature of the problem, in combination with the fact that almost minimizers, in general, do not satisfy any associated parabolic partial differential equation, causes a variety of difficulties in regularity theory, which have to be overcome. The first part of the paper covers integral functionals, which involve merely the spatial gradient of the almost minimizing function. In this case, we obtain a partial Hölder regularity result for the spatial gradient with a Hölder exponent, which can be determined in a quantified way in dependence of the data of the problem. In the second part, we develop the theory for integrands, which involve not only the spatial gradient, but also the almost minimizer itself. In this more general case, the proof becomes substantially more involved, since a priori higher integrability of the spatial gradient has to be used. As a consequence, the explicit control on the Hölder continuity exponent gets lost. This is also in accordance with the elliptic theory where the same phenomenon occurs.",

However, systems of such equations have also received consideration, and there is now theory for pure initial-value problems where data are given on the entire space or on the torus. Here, consideration is given to non-homogeneous initial-boundary-value problems for a class of BBM-type systems having the form \\begin{equation*} \\begin{aligned} u_t + u_x -u_{xxt} + P(u,v)_x \\, = \\, 0, \\\\ v_t + v_x - v_{xxt} + Q(u,v)_x \\, = \\, 0, \\end{aligned} \\end{equation*} where $P$ and $Q$ are homogeneous, quadratic polynomials, $u$ and $v$ are real-valued functions of a spatial variable $x$ and a temporal variable $t$, and subscripts connote partial differentiation.

This consists in introducing a quasi-periodic fundamental solution and the related layer potentials, showing how they are used to construct the solutions of quasi-periodic boundary value problems, and how they behave when we perform a singular perturbation of the domain. To show an application, we study a nonlinear quasi-periodic Robin problem in a domain with a set of holes that shrink to points.",

We extend these results to the case of a general smooth nonlocal diffusion function $a(\\cdot)$ and show that bifurcations may be pitchfork or saddle-node, both subcritical or supercritical. Concerning hyperbolicity, we specifying necessary and sufficient conditions for its occurrence.

In terms of a characteristic algebraic system introduced for the problem, we obtain a clear and simpler presentation of both the critical Fujita exponent and the blow-up rate for this complicated coupled system containing six nonlinear exponent parameters. The proof for establishing the critical exponents is based on careful constructions of the comparison functions, especially for the blow-up case, by using the Barlenbratt-type solutions. The analysis of the blow-up rate relies on the appropriate scale transformation of the independent and the dependent variables with some differential inequalities satisfied by the $L^\\infty$-norm of blowing up solutions. This paper provides a complete result for such a coupled degenerate parabolic system.",

We assume that the two-dimensional cavity $\\Omega=(0,1)\\times (0,1)$ is occupied by an elastic, inviscid, compressible fluid. The potential $\\phi$ of the velocity field satisfies the linear wave equation. The boundary of $\\Omega$ is divided in two parts, $\\Gamma_{0}$ and $\\Gamma_{1}$. The first one, $\\Gamma_{0}$, is flexible and occupied by a dissipative vibrating string. The transversal displacement of the string, $W$, satisfies a non homogeneous one-dimensional wave equation. On $\\Gamma_{0}$ the continuity of the normal velocities of the fluid and the string is imposed. The subset $\\Gamma_{1}$ of the boundary is assumed to be rigid and therefore, the normal velocity of the fluid vanishes. This constitutes a non homogeneous dissipative system of two coupled wave equations in dimensions two and one respectively. The non homogeneous term acting on the flexible part of the boundary (an elastic force or an exterior source of noise) is assumed to be periodic. We are interested in the existence of periodic solutions of this system. Due to the localization of the damping term in a relatively small part of the boundary and to the effect of the hybrid structure of the system, the existence of periodic solutions holds for a restricted class of non homogeneous terms. Some resonance-type phenomena are also exhibited.",

    "abstract": "The subject of this paper is the behavior of the director field of a nematic liquid crystal in flow through a tube with circular cross-section. Both the flow and the director field are assumed to have cylindrical symmetry. The requirement of finite Frank-Oseen energy forces ``admissible\" director fields to be axially directed at the location of the symmetry axis. Thus, the angle between the axis and the director field at the location of the axis amounts to $k\\pi$, $k$ being an integer. In the steady case, it is shown that $k$ is largely (but not uniquely) determined by the (Dirichlet) boundary conditions. In particular, this may give rise to line singularities with finite energy density. Moreover, the associated Dirichlet problem may have several distinct solutions with identical value of $k$. Analogously to the heat flow of harmonic mappings, finite-time blow-up phenomena for the associated parabolic problem are established.",

These assumptions are satisfied by the main strain energies generally considered. The domain is assumed to be bounded, and mixed boundary conditions are considered. Our approach is based on a nonlinear parabolic regularization technique, involving the $p$-Laplace operator. First we prove the existence of a local-in-time solution for the regularized system, by a fixed point technique. Next, using an energy estimate, we show that if the data are small enough, bounded by $\\varepsilon >0$, then the maximal time of existence does not depend on the parabolic regularization parameter, and the behavior of the lifespan $T$ is $\\gtrsim \\log (1/\\varepsilon)$, defining what we call here almost global existence. The solution is thus obtained by passing this parameter to zero. The key point of our proof is due to recent nonlinear Korn's inequalities proven by Ciarlet and Mardare in $W^{1,p}$ spaces, for $p>2$.",

On the other hand, Ishizeki and Nagasawa showed that the Möbius energy can be decomposed into three parts that are Möbius invariant. Each part has an $L^2$ representation of the first variation. In this paper, we discuss the $L^2$ representation of the second variation for each decomposed part of the Möbius energy, and derive explicit formulas for it.

Instead, the second model couples the same hyperbolic equation this time with a thermoelastic plate (or beam), either of parabolic type or else of {\\em hyperbolic-dominated} type, defined on its flexible (flat) wall. The thermoelastic component may be supplemented by any canonical boundary conditions (B.C.), including the coupled free B.C. Moreover, its differential operators may have variable coefficients (in space). In either of the two models, coupling takes place on the elastic wall. This coupled PDE system (possibly with hyperbolic/parabolic interaction) generates a strongly continuous contraction semigroup $e^{At}$ on a natural energy space $Y$. The main result of the present paper is a backward uniqueness theorem for such structural acoustic semigroups: $e^{AT} y_0 = 0$ for some $T > 0$ and $y_0 \\in Y$ implies $y_0 =0$.",

The basic assumption is the existence (and weak continuity) of the spectral density in a functional setting. Spectral identities for the time evolution of such operators are derived, enabling results concerning “best constants” for smoothing estimates. When combined with suitable “comparison principles” (analogous to those established in [39]), they yield smoothing estimates for classes of functions of the operators. An important contribution of this study involves the comparison of the spectral density of an operator $H$ and its perturbation $H+V.$ It entails a derivation of global spacetime estimates for $H+V$ on the basis of analogous estimates for $H.$ A number of applications are given, including smoothing estimates for fractional Laplacians, Stark Hamiltonians and Schrödinger operators with potentials.",

    "abstract": "One of the simplest formulas of the calculus of several variables says that, when applied to spherical symmetric functions $u=u(\\rho)$ in $\\mathbb R^n$, the Laplace operator takes the form $\\Delta u=u''(\\rho)+(n-1)u'(\\rho)/\\rho$. In this paper, we derive the analogous explicit expression for the polyharmonic operator $\\Delta^k$ in the case of spherical symmetry. Moreover, if $B$ is a ball centered at the origin and $u\\in H^k_0(B)$ is spherical symmetric, then, we deduce the functional \\[ J[u]= \\begin{cases} \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\Omega} (\\Delta^{k/2} u(x))^2\\,dx&\\text{if $k$ is even}\\cr \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla \\Delta^{(k-1)/2} u(x)|^2\\,dx&\\text{if $k$ is odd},\\cr \\end{cases} \\] of which $(-\\Delta)^k$ is gradient as a sum of integrals in one variable. The results are based upon nontrivial combinatorial identities, which are proved by means of Zeilberger's algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, variational inclusions of Euler--Lagrange types, governed by two-dimensional isotropic-anisotropic singular diffusions, are considered. On that basis, we focus on the geometric structures of free boundaries where anisotropic conditions tend to isotropic. In this light, a limit-set of special piecewise-constant solutions will be presented. The objective in this paper is to give some observations on the upper bounds of the limit set with geometric characterizations. As a consequence, it will be shown that the isotropic free boundaries, as in the limit set, consist of a finite number of $ C^{1,1} $-Jordan curves, and these have certain geometric connections with the approaching anisotropic situations. Observations for the lower bounds will be studied in the sequel to this paper.",

This ODE can be regarded as a boundary condition. This model allows the complete analysis of the time evolution of the system: there is always a global attractor. We show that, depending on physical parameters, the attractor contains one or three equilibria. The latter case has special physical interest: the two equilibria represent attractors (\"extinction\" or \"ignition\") and the third equilibrium is a saddle.

All these cases are relevant in sub-Riemannian geometry and have in common the existence of a homogeneous norm that we use for building Lyapunov-like functions for each operator. We give explicit sufficient conditions on the size and sign of the first and 0-th order terms in the equations and discuss their optimality.

In the singular limit, solutions converge to functions which take on only two different values in bulk regions. We also derive an equation describing the motion of the interface between the two bulk regions. To the lowest order, the normal speed $s(\\nu)$ of the interface depends only on the unit normal vector $\\nu$, where the wave speed $s(\\nu)$ is determined by nonlinear reaction and convection terms. When the convection term is even and the reaction term is odd in their argument, the wave speed $s(\\nu)$ vanishes identically for all directions $\\nu$. In this situation, a parabolic scaling reduces the equation to another singularly perturbed equation for which we also establish convergence of solutions in the singular limit. The singular limit dynamics is governed by an anisotropic mean curvature flow, in which the anisotropy comes from the convection term. Our method of proof for convergence consists of constructing approximate solutions of any order and using the comparison principle.",

These assumptions are satisfied by the main strain energies generally considered. The domain is assumed to be bounded, and mixed boundary conditions are considered. Our approach is based on a nonlinear parabolic regularization technique, involving the $p$-Laplace operator. First we prove the existence of a local-in-time solution for the regularized system, by a fixed point technique. Next, using an energy estimate, we show that if the data are small enough, bounded by $\\varepsilon >0$, then the maximal time of existence does not depend on the parabolic regularization parameter, and the behavior of the lifespan $T$ is $\\gtrsim \\log (1/\\varepsilon)$, defining what we call here almost global existence. The solution is thus obtained by passing this parameter to zero. The key point of our proof is due to recent nonlinear Korn's inequalities proven by Ciarlet and Mardare in $W^{1,p}$ spaces, for $p>2$.",
