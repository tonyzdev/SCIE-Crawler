    "abstract": "Abstract With an increase in antibiotic resistance, a growing interest in developing new antimicrobial agents has gained popularity. Metal‐ and metal‐oxide‐based nanoparticles, surface‐to‐volume is able to distinguish bacterial cells from mammalian cells and can provide long‐term antibacterial and biofilm prevention. These nanoparticles elicit bactericidal properties through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are able to target physical structures, metabolic pathways, and DNA synthesis of prokaryotic cells leading to cell death. In this progress report, a critical analysis of current literature on antimicrobial effect of metal and metal‐oxide nanoparticles are examined. Specifically, the antimicrobial mechanisms of metal ions and metal nanomaterials are discussed. Antimicrobial efficiency of nanomaterials is correlated with the structural and physical properties, such as size, shape, and/or zeta potential. A critical analysis of the current state of metal and metal‐oxide nanomaterial research advances our understanding to overcome antibiotic resistance and provide alternatives to combat bacterial infections. Finally, emerging approaches to identify and minimize metallic poisoning, specifically for biomedical applications, are examined.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There exists a technological need for advanced materials with improved properties for emerging biomedical applications. Recent developments in macroporous materials have demonstrated their applicability as indispensable tools in biomedical research. Cryogels, which are materials with a macroporous 3D structure, are produced as a result of controlled freezing during polymerization with a highly interconnected polymer network. Cryogels’ interest lies in their ability to address some of the limitations of their hydrogel analogues. In this review, hydrogel and cryogel basic concepts are discussed as a short primer for readers unfamiliar with the cryogels literature. Next, a general overview of the methods for synthesis and characterization of cryogels is provided, highlighting key concepts relevant to cryogels and explaining their unique properties. Finally an in‐depth overview of specific technologies and fields where cryogels have been applied is given. It is argued that the latest advances in cryogel technologies are able to address challenges in bioseparation, tissue engineering, and other emerging bioengineering disciplines.",

As it cleaves phosphate substructures from drugs, auxiliary agents, and even from the surface of nanocarriers, this enzyme enables the design of drug delivery systems that can alter their properties in the body on demand. Anionic nanocarriers exhibiting bioinert properties can alter their surface to interactive once having reached the target site as due to an ALP‐triggered cleavage of anionic phosphate groups from their surface charge converts to cationic improving for instance cellular uptake. Moreover, features such as the accumulation of nanocarriers at the target site or a targeted drug release triggered by ALP can be introduced. In addition, ALP is utilized to improve the potential of numerous diagnostic systems. Within this review, one provides an overview about the activity, selectivity, and distribution of this enzyme, as well as the great variety of applications in drug delivery and diagnostics making use of it.",

This review focuses into the pivotal role of ECM alterations in facilitating tumor metastasis and explores therapeutic strategies aimed at counteracting these changes. We analyse targeted interventions against collagen, including approaches to inhibit its biosynthesis and disrupt associated signalling pathways critical for tumor architecture and cell migration. Additionally, therapies addressing hyaluronan are reviewed, highlighting methods to suppress its synthesis and enzymatic strategies to degrade it, thereby mitigating its tumor‐promoting effects. The discussion extends to innovative approaches for modulating ECM stiffness, focusing on the roles of cancer‐associated fibroblasts and lysyl oxidases, which are key contributors to ECM remodelling and mechanical signalling. By strategically modifying these ECM components, these interventions aim to enhance the efficacy of existing cancer treatments, tackle resistance mechanisms, and achieve more durable therapeutic outcomes. Insights from recent studies and clinical trials highlight the promise of these strategies in overcoming treatment resistance and improving patient outcomes. Advancing our understanding of ECM biology leads to the development of innovative and more effective cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of brain endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, which build a tight cellular barrier. Therapeutic (macro)molecules are not able to transit through the BBB in their free form. This limitation is bypassed by apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-functionalized polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) that are able to transport drugs (e.g. dalargin, loperamide, doxorubicin, nerve growth factor) across the BBB via low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor mediated transcytosis. Coating with polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188 facilitates ApoE adsorption onto polymeric NPs enabling recognition by LDL receptors of brain endothelial cells. This effect is even enhanced when NPs are directly coated with ApoE without surfactant anchor. Similarly, covalent coupling of ApoE to NPs that bear reactive groups on their surface leads to significantly improved brain uptake while avoiding the use of surfactants. Several in vitro BBB models using brain endothelial cells or co-cultures with astrocytes/pericytes/glioma cells are described which provide first insights regarding the ability of a drug delivery system to cross this barrier. In vivo models are employed to simulate central nervous system-relevant diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease and cerebral cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory skin disease associated with a colonization of Propionibacterium acnes ( P. acnes ), which can cause both physiological and psychological impact to the patients. Although antibiotic cream is commonly used to treat acne, limited transport of drug to the lesions within the pilosebaceous unit leads to poor bactericidal effect. Here, the authors described a new method of drug administration using a reactive oxygen species (ROS)‐responsive microneedle (MN) patch for anti‐acne therapy. Compared to the commonly used anti‐acne cream, enhanced efficacy toward dermis lesions can be achieved through the skin penetration by MNs. A controlled and sustained drug release in response to the over‐generated ROS within acne is also important for improving the antibacterial effect and reducing the side effects. In addition, the patch base, formed by hyaluronic acid (HA) and diatomaceous earth (DE) with high physical adsorption capability, is beneficial for accelerating healing of skin via the absorption of pus and dead cell debris. In vivo studies in a P. acnes ‐induced mouse model demonstrated this bioresponsive patch with adsorption capability could efficiently reduce the skin swelling and inhibit the bacterial growth.",

Although genetics, age, and environmental factors affect the disease, the cause of AD is not yet fully known. Various drugs have been proposed for the prevention and treatment of AD, but the delivery of these therapeutic agents to the brain is difficult. The blood–brain barrier prevents systemic drugs from accessing the central nervous system and designing a suitable system to overcome this barrier has attracted much attention. The intranasal pathway, given its proximity to the brain, provides a great opportunity for drug delivery. Understanding the physiological characteristics of the nose can be useful in selecting the appropriate carrier and material. Some of the emerging vehicles used for nose‐to‐brain delivery of anti‐AD drugs are natural (such as chitosan) and polymeric (such as poly(lactic‐ co ‐glycolic acid) and polyethylene glycol) nanoparticles (NPs). This review discusses the hypotheses for AD pathogenesis and highlights recent advances in the applications of natural and polymeric NPs for treatment. The fundamental and applied aspects of this approach for nasal drug delivery to the brain are reviewed here with thoughts on what is needed for the field to mature also provided.",

However, as the core element of phototheranostics, most phototheranostic agents are activated by the UV–visible light, which falls outside of the phototherapy window and results in poor tissue penetration capability. Moreover, they are in general only capable of generating reactive oxygen species or heat. To integrate photodynamic and photothermal therapies into a single treatment modality is thus expected to broaden the applicability and improve the efficiency of this technique. In this work, carbon dots (CDs) with absorption range up to 1100 nm are synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of 1,3,6‐trinitropyrene and Na 2 SO 3 . The CDs could simultaneously present strong fluorescence and generate 1 O 2 through two‐photon excitation mechanism, and they also show outstanding photothermal conversion capability under irradiation by an 800 nm femtosecond pulsed laser. Moreover, the broad absorption spectrum of the CDs enable them to be used as an agent for photoacoustic (PA) imaging. The in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the CDs have good biocompatibility and can serve as multifunctional phototheranostic agents for PA/fluorescence imaging, and photodynamic/photothermal synergistic cancer therapy using a single near‐infrared laser.",

Exposure of a fluid of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) to an alternating magnetic field (AMF) operating at biologically benign conditions leads to heat dissipation within the tumor and ultimate apoptosis and/or necrosis. Despite use in a clinical setting, there are still impediments preventing widespread use of MFH. These include insufficient heat dissipation potency of IONP fluid, inadequate dose or concentration of deposited fluid to the tumor, inhomogeneous distribution of fluid inside the tumor, the lack of control of real‐time monitoring of temperature rises during treatment, and exposure of the patients to X‐ray radiation produced by computed tomography (CT) scans. Accordingly, massive efforts have been put forth to promote the successful clinical adoption of MFH. In this contribution, the technique of MFH is described, including the present state of clinical MFH. The physical mechanisms behind heat dissipation by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) that instigate cell death pathways are discussed, as is recent technological progress in the field toward the advancement of MFH. Finally, an outlook on the future considerations required to accelerate the clinical adoption of MFH is presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nanomedicines exploit the unusual physicochemical and biological properties of nanoparticles, including their nanoscopic size, high surface‐area‐to‐volume ratio, easy surface modification, and biocompatibility. Among various therapeutic and diagnostic applications of nanomedicines, cancer‐targeted drug delivery systems (DDS) have been found to be a promising area of research. Effective DDS rely on two major factors: slow and sustained release of chemotherapeutic drugs and their targeted delivery to tumor sites. Both the drug release and targeting ability of nanoparticles are greatly affected under in vivo conditions by the “protein corona,” a tightly packed layer of protein molecules, formed around nanoparticles upon contact with biological fluids. Owing to the adsorption of proteins onto the surface of nanoparticles, their identity is significantly altered, and they can readily be cleared from systemic circulation by the mononuclear phagocytic system. In this context, scientists have employed various strategies, including the use of different ligands, stealth polymers, and protein corona shields/pre‐coating with specific proteins to modulate protein corona formation and retain the targeting ability of nanoparticles. This review article focuses on the recent progress of these different strategies with a special emphasis on the protein corona shields/artificial protein corona approaches for the development of effective cancer targeting nanomedicines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract mRNA‐based therapeutics are a unique class of drugs for treatment of human diseases. Since in vitro transcribed mRNA molecules have relatively low stability and their surface charge prevents them from direct cell entry, they need to be packaged into specially designed delivery platforms to exert their activities. Multiple nanotechnology‐based delivery platforms have been developed for mRNA delivery, such as polymer‐based polyplex, lipid‐based lipoplex, and lipid‐coated polymer‐based lipopolyplex. In this review, an overview of the nanoplatforms for mRNA delivery is provided. A number of applications in biotechnology including cell reprogramming and gene editing are also described. In addition, their clinical translational potential for protein replacement therapy and for infectious disease and cancer treatment is introduced.",

PDZ domains play a role in several cellular functions, from cell-cell communication and polarization, to regulation of protein transport and protein metabolism. PDZ domain proteins are also crucial in the formation and stability of protein complexes, establishing an important bridge between extracellular stimuli detected by transmembrane receptors and intracellular responses. PDZ domains have been suggested as promising drug targets in several diseases, ranging from neurological and oncological disorders to viral infections. In this review, the authors describe structural and genetic aspects of PDZ-containing proteins and discuss the current status of the development of small-molecule and peptide modulators of PDZ domains. An overview of potential new therapeutic interventions in PDZ-mediated protein networks is also provided.",

However, the effective incorporation of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles into biomedical systems requires in vitro and in vivo stability, good biocompatibility, high loading efficacy, and controlled drug release. Surface‐functionalized magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles created using engineered surface ligands have presented new strategies for the applications of MNP‐based drug delivery systems in cancer imaging and therapy to overcome these obstacles. Moreover, the development and design of stimuli‐responsive ligands has been combined with the engineering of multiple physicochemical features into MNPs to enhance the performance of the MNP‐based delivery system. This review briefly overviews the latest developments in the design of multifunctional and stimuli‐responsive MNP‐based drug delivery systems and summarizes their applications in the diagnostic imaging and treatment of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glucose oxidase (GOx), which catalyzes the conversion of glucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) in the presence of oxygen (O 2 ), has aroused growing interest for cancer therapy. GOx can starve tumor cells to death by depleting glucose, which is very important for their energy supply, and the generated H 2 O 2 is can be used for oxidation therapy. In addition, GOx‐catalyzed glucose oxidation exerts a variety of effects on the tumor environment, such as enhancing hypoxia and increasing acidity. The full use of these characteristics can effectively reduce side effects and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of GOx‐related cancer therapies. As is generally acknowledged, it is difficult to completely eliminate tumors with a single treatment, whereas combining two or more therapies may yield super‐additive results because when properly designed, different treatments can compensate for the shortcomings of the other treatments and bring out the best in each other. In view of these facts, enhanced therapies and combination therapies related to glucose oxidation have been widely studied, and this review provides a systematic overview of recent research on GOx‐related cancer therapies (especially starvation therapy) from the perspective of glucose oxidation (including the reaction itself, oxygen, enzymes, gluconic acid, and H 2 O 2 ) and other combination therapies.",

A diverse array of cytokines have been studied in preclinical disease models since the 1950s, some of which became successful biopharmaceutical products with the advancement of recombinant protein technology in the 1980s. However, following these early approvals, clinical translation of these natural immune signaling molecules has been limited due to their pleiotropic action in many cell types, and the fact that they have evolved to act primarily locally in tissues. These characteristics, combined with poor pharmacokinetics, have hindered the delivery of cytokines via systemic administration routes due to dose-limiting toxicities. However, given their clinical potential and recent clinical successes in cancer immunotherapy, cytokines continue to be extensively pursued in preclinical and clinical studies, and a range of molecular and formulation engineering strategies are being applied to reduce treatment toxicity while maintaining or enhancing therapeutic efficacy. This review provides a brief background on the characteristics of cytokines and their history as clinical therapeutics, followed by a deeper discussion on the engineering strategies developed for cytokine therapies with a focus on the translational relevance of these approaches.",

Unfortunately, potent responses to immunotherapy have only been achieved in subsets of patients. Nanomedicines and biomaterials have enormous potential for making immunotherapy work better in more patients, which has been suggested by a large number of preclinical studies. However, it remains unclear whether and how these materials will really benefit cancer patients treated by immunotherapy. Therefore, reviewing current clinical studies on nanomedicines and biomaterials in immuno‐oncology may provide valuable information for future translation research. In this work, the clinical landscape of cancer immunotherapy involving nanomedicines and biomaterials, mainly Abraxane, Doxil, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) nanovaccines, and a biomaterial scaffold‐supported autologous vaccine, is reviewed. Clinical results demonstrate the high potential of nano/biomaterials in immunotherapy, achieved by rationalized utilization of their targeted delivery and reduced toxicities/side effects. Future clinical translation in this field will likely benefit from designing rational combinations of nanomedicines and biomaterials with the right immunotherapeutics applied in the right patients/tumors, and this should be achieved with the help of immune biomarker analysis. By rationally utilizing the unique features and advantages of nanomedicines and biomaterials, they will highly impact patient care in combination with immunotherapy.",

Artificial protein polymers derived from elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), which are based on the repeating sequence of tropoelastin (the water-soluble precursor to elastin), provide a promising platform for creating nanostructures due to their biocompatibility, ease of synthesis, and customizable architecture. By designing the sequence and composition of ELPs at the gene level, their physicochemical properties can be controlled to a degree that is unmatched by synthetic polymers. A variety of ELP-based nanostructures are designed, inspired by the self-assembly of elastin and other proteins in biological systems. The choice of building blocks determines not only the physical properties of the nanostructures, but also their self-assembly into architectures ranging from spherical micelles to elongated nanofibers. This review focuses on the molecular determinants of ELP and ELP-hybrid self-assembly and formation of spherical, rod-like, worm-like, fibrillar, and vesicle architectures. A brief discussion of the potential biomedical applications of these supramolecular assemblies is also included.",

In this comprehensive review, the principles of these gene manipulation tools as well as advances and barriers for their application in modern therapies are discussed.

Here we describe a phenotypic, human-on-a-chip (HoaC) electrical conduction model of two rare autoimmune demyelinating neuropathies, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), and explore the efficacy of TNT005, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the classical complement pathway. Patient sera was shown to contain anti-GM1 IgM and IgG antibodies capable of binding to human primary Schwann cells and induced pluripotent stem cell derived motoneurons. Patient autoantibody binding was sufficient to activate the classical complement pathway resulting in detection of C3b and C5b-9 deposits. A HoaC model, using a microelectrode array with directed axonal outgrowth over the electrodes treated with patient sera, exhibited reductions in motoneuron action potential frequency and conduction velocity. TNT005 rescued the serum-induced complement deposition and functional deficits while treatment with an isotype control antibody had no rescue effect. These data indicate that complement activation by CIDP and MMN patient serum is sufficient to mimic neurophysiological features of each disease and that complement inhibition with TNT005 was sufficient to rescue these pathological effects and provide efficacy data included in an investigational new drug application, demonstrating the model's translational potential.",

Similar to drugs that need to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) to gain access to the central nervous system (CNS), drugs must cross the peripheral nerve barriers (PNB), formed by the perineurium and blood-nerve barrier (BNB) to modulate peripheral axons. Despite significant progress made to develop effective strategies to enhance BBB permeability in therapeutic drug design, efforts to enhance drug permeability and retention in peripheral nerves and nerve roots are relatively understudied. Guided by knowledge describing structural, molecular and functional similarities between restrictive neural barriers in the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS), we hypothesize that certain CNS drug delivery strategies are adaptable for peripheral nerve drug delivery. In this review, we describe the molecular, structural and functional similarities and differences between the BBB and PNB, summarize and compare existing CNS and peripheral nerve drug delivery strategies, and discuss the potential application of selected CNS delivery strategies to improve efficacious drug entry for peripheral nerve disorders.",

Diverse characterization methodologies are employed in order to validate the multiple steps of the synthesis process.

Currently, IBD therapy relies on the induction of clinical remission followed by maintenance therapy using anti‐inflammatory drugs and immunosuppressants; however, a definite cure of the disease is still out of scope. Established approaches are characterized by adverse drug‐related side effects that can even be potentially life‐threatening. In contrast, increased interest and remarkable scientific progress in targeted drug delivery systems offer a promising approach to reduce systemic adverse events, delivering the therapeutic substances only to inflamed tissue. All alteration in gastrointestinal barrier integrity, especially a disturbed epithelial barrier, a unique pattern of the receptors on cell surface and/or an oxidative stress milieu in inflamed areas can be used as effective approaches for targeted and controlled drug delivery. Hence, this review focuses on the pathophysiology of the inflamed GI tract as a potential strategy for targeted polymeric nanoparticles for IBD treatment. Interdisciplinary efforts between the polymeric chemistry and gastroenterology/immunology promise to create novel synergies that improve the development of effective nanoparticle systems with significant clinical impact.

The prevalent therapeutic options, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, pose detrimental side effects. Consequently, non‐invasive and selective therapeutic strategies are sought, such as nanoparticle‐mediated photothermal therapy (PTT). This technique employs benign photothermal agents that gather within tumors post‐injection. Under near‐infra‐red light exposure, these agents induce localized hyperthermia, killing tumor cells. Here, the laboratory development, recent advances, and clinical status of photothermal therapy are examined. Despite two decades of development, photothermal therapy has yielded few clinical trials. A standout agent, the gold nanoshell, holds promise for prostate cancer treatment as the only one in human clinical trials. To provide context, PTT is compared to photodynamic therapy, which has over 250 human trials in 40 years, highlighting the need to bridge the gap for effective photothermal therapy translation. Therefore, we delve into the gap of clinical implementation between photothermal therapy and similar technologies, such as photodynamic therapy, laser interstitial thermal therapy, and cancer nanomedicines, offering insights and potential solutions.",

Tissue tolerability was assessed on porcine skin using direct counting for bactericidal effectiveness and SEM for validation, with histological analysis for tissue effects. Plasma Care demonstrated significant bactericidal capabilities (4 logs against S. aureus in 60 seconds on PCL), minimal tissue disruption, and required short treatment times, functioning independently of target conductivity. Both J-Plasma and Piezo Brush PZ3 showed variable outcomes influenced by treatment duration and target surface conductivity, affecting both bactericidal activity and tissue tolerance.

The elevation in copper level in the tumor microenvironment (TME) activates oncogenic pathways to drive the neovascularization and sustained growth of malignancies. However, the same reliance on copper offers a unique weakness that can be leveraged for innovative therapeutic interventions. The recent advances in nanomedicine enable the synthesis of nanostructures that can help modulate the level of copper with precision offering multifaceted approaches for copper‐based cancer therapy with controlled release mechanism, optimized structures to induce cuproptosis, selective eradication of cancer cells with minimum and systemic toxicity. This review explores the dual role of copper in cancer biology, emphasizing its contribution to the progression of tumors and its emerging application in targeted cancer therapy. The review also highlights the potential of nanostructures in harnessing copper‐based therapies and their transformative potential from bench to bed side with novel, highly effective, and clinical safety.",

RNA‐based therapeutics are one of the most attractive classes of drugs for treating a variety of diseases. In principle, RNA‐based therapeutics offer numerous advantages compared to the conventional small‐molecule‐based therapies. However, there are several drawbacks to overcome in the application of RNA‐based therapeutics, including the instability of RNAs and presence of various biological barriers. In the past decades, there have been various attempts to overcome these key challenges. Here, the authors present an overview of RNA‐based therapeutics and recent advances including their delivery systems and clinical applications. In addition, the current challenges of RNA‐based drugs are discussed, followed by perspectives with regard to the development of these promising drug candidates to elicit successful clinical outcomes.",

Tunable multifunctionality, convenient programmability, adequate biocompatibility, biodegradability, capability of precise molecular recognition, and high versatility have made DNA an irreplaceable building block for the construction of novel 3D hydrogels. DNA can be used as the only component of a hydrogel, the backbone or a cross‐linker that connects the main building blocks to form hybrid hydrogels through chemical reactions or physical entanglement. Responsive constructs of DNA with superior mechanical properties are very commonly reported nowadays, which can undergo macroscopic changes induced by various triggers, including alteration in ionic strength, temperature, and pH. These hydrogels can be prepared by various types of DNA building blocks, such as branched double‐stranded DNA, single‐stranded DNA, X‐shaped DNA, or Y‐shaped DNA through intermolecular i‐motif structures, DNA hybridization, enzyme ligation, or enzyme polymerization. These hydrogels are envisioned for a variety of applications, such as drug delivery, sensing, tissue engineering, 3D cell culture, and providing template for nanoparticle synthesis. This review highlights the design of ideal DNA hydrogels from biological and material points of view for future biomedical applications.",

In order to solve these problems, the authors develop a near‐infrared (NIR) responsive PEGylated gold nanorod (GNR‐PEG) and doxorubicin (DOX) loaded dissolvable hyaluronic acid (HA) microneedle (GNR‐PEG&amp;DOX@HA MN) for human epidermoid cancer therapy. The as‐made GNR‐PEG&amp;DOX@HA MNs has good skin penetration capability and heating ability. The heating can be transferred to the center of the tumor sites and the temperature is shown to rise up to 60 °C within 5 min. Meanwhile, the release behavior of the DOX from GNR‐PEG&amp;DOX@HA MNs can be controlled by NIR light. The GNR‐PEG&amp;DOX@HA MNs shows good cell inhibition, and the photothermal effect is shown to completely destroy A431 cells in vitro. For in vivo antitumor study, the group treated with GNR‐PEG&amp;DOX@HA MNs transcutaneously reveals a remarkable antitumor efficacy, such that all mice are cured without recurrence under only one treatment. Hence, this novel transdermal drug delivery strategy offers hope to human epidermoid cancer therapy, and GNR‐PEG&amp;DOX@HA MN may serve as a promising candidate in clinical translation for human epidermoid cancer therapy.",

This heterogeneity results in critical problems that interfere with the eradication of cancer tumors such as multidrug resistance, drug efflux capacity, narrow therapeutic window, and undesired side effects. Nanomedicine has introduced new platforms for drug delivery to enhance therapeutic efficiency of anticancer drugs. In addition to drug delivery, nanocarriers such as liposomes, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and metallic nanoparticles can be designed for detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Recent studies support the idea that a combination of two or more nanoparticle‐mediated therapies can result in a synergistic therapeutic outcome to improve current cancer treatments. In this progress report, recent advances in nanoparticles‐based combination therapies are discussed. A brief overview of the complexity of cancer tumor's microenvironment is presented, followed by discussion of combinatorial therapies categorized based on chemotherapeutic agents, nucleic acid or therapeutic proteins, energy‐based therapies and imaging techniques for theranostic application. Different nanotechnological platforms are developed for combination therapy as tools with a great potential to tackle the most critical issues of current cancer treatments.

Transcutaneous oxygen delivery for the hypoxic tissue has been shown to be an effective method for enhanced wound regeneration, for example, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and topical oxygen therapy. However, these techniques' clinical applications are limited by high cost and complicated protocols. To combat this, a bioactive living hydrogel based on photosynthetic microorganisms is designed for enhanced wound healing by production and local delivery of oxygen to alleviate acute and chronic tissue hypoxia. Spirulina platensis (SP), a type of photosynthetic bacteria is coated with the natural polymer carboxymethyl chitosan to obtain the SP gel, which keeps the oxygen generation capability of the SP while promoting its adhesion to the infected wound. Moreover, chlorophyll, a natural photosensitizer, is released from the SP irradiated with 650‐nm laser, and generates reactive oxygen species, thereby causing photodynamic destruction of bacteria in the infectious area. Cytotoxicity assays and in vivo toxicity assessment demonstrate the excellent biocompatibility of the gel. The SP gel is easy to obtain, cheap for mass production, and convenient for usage, which is promising for clinical application.",

Advances have been made in treating these diverse pathologies but there still remain many challenging areas. Amongst the most difficult are those involving highly potent and/or cytotoxic agents which present the inherent problem of adverse off‐target effects. Of key importance is to widen the therapeutic window for such agents by reducing access to non‐diseased cells and enhancing release at targeted sites. Spatiotemporal controlled release can be achieved by exploiting physical, chemical, or biological stimuli present at the specific diseased area. A crucial strategy involves drug‐carrier linkages able to respond to physiological or biochemical stimuli present in the disease region, and there is now significant literature on (polymeric) prodrugs based on the drug + carrier + cleavable linker philosophy, predominantly for cancer applications. The authors therefore focuse this mini‐review primarily on single/multistimuli‐responsive prodrugs for cancer therapies, covering prominent examples of prodrug chemistries used to endow polymers with controlled and site‐specific drug delivery properties. Additionally, the possibilities for exploiting similar approaches to disease‐associated stimuli present in bacterial and viral infections, inflammatory and immune diseases, and in degenerative disorders are emphasized.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The appearance and rapid spread of drug resistant strains of tuberculosis (TB), one of the deadliest infectious diseases, pose a serious threat to public health and increase the need for shorter, less toxic, and more effective therapies. Developing new drugs is difficult and often associated with side effects, so nanotechnology has emerged as a tool to improve current treatments and to rescue drugs having elevated toxicity or poor solubility. Due to their size and surface chemistry, antimicrobial‐loaded nanocarriers are avidly taken up by macrophages, the main cells hosting Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Macrophages are continuously recruited to infected areas, they can transport drugs with them, making passive targeting a good strategy for TB treatment. Active targeting (decorating surface of nanocarriers with ligands specific to receptors displayed by macrophages) further increases local drug concentration, and thus treatment efficacy. Although in in vivo studies, nanocarriers are often administered intravenously in order to avoid inaccurate dosage in animals, translation to humans requires more convenient routes like pulmonary or oral administration. This report highlights the importance and progress of pulmonary administration, passive and active targeting strategies toward bacteria reservoirs to overcome the challenges in TB treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and long‐term disability worldwide, yet availability of current treatments is limited. The downstream events resulting from cerebral ischemia lead to an imbalance in the production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) over endogenous antioxidant mechanisms. Thus, treatments that can reduce this imbalance can limit the extent of injury resulting from ischemic stroke. In this work, the potential of novel ROS‐scavenging PEGylated polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) composed of poly(propylene sulfide) (PPS) (PPS‐NPs) for ischemic stroke therapy is evaluated in vitro and in a mouse model of stroke. In vitro results show that PPS‐NPs display remarkable anti‐oxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties, whilst exhibiting negligible cytotoxicity. NPs administered intravenously rapidly accumulate in ischemic brain regions as visualized through fluorescence imaging, reduced infarct volume, blood‐brain barrier damage, neuronal loss, and neuroinflammation as determined by immunohistochemistry, and improved recovery of neurological function as determined through behavioral analyses.

The findings provide new strong evidence that these NPs may be an effective antioxidant therapy for ischemic stroke.",

We describe the benefits of SQ3370 (lead candidate of CAPAC) to achieve systemic anti-tumor responses in mice bearing two tumors. SQ3370 consists of a biopolymer, injected in a single lesion, followed by systemic doses of an attenuated protodrug™ of doxorubicin (Dox). SQ3370 was well-tolerated at 5.9-times the maximum dose of conventional Dox, increased survival by 63% and induced a systemic anti-tumor response against injected and non-injected lesions. The sustained anti-tumor response also correlated with immune activation measured at both lesions. SQ3370 could potentially benefit patients with micro-metastatic lesions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In 2019/2020, the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) resulted in rapid increases in infection rates as well as patient mortality. Treatment options addressing COVID‐19 included drug repurposing, investigational therapies such as remdesivir, and vaccine development. Combination therapy based on drug repurposing is among the most widely pursued of these efforts. Multi‐drug regimens are traditionally designed by selecting drugs based on their mechanism of action. This is followed by dose‐finding to achieve drug synergy. This approach is widely‐used for drug development and repurposing. Realizing synergistic combinations, however, is a substantially different outcome compared to globally optimizing combination therapy, which realizes the best possible treatment outcome by a set of candidate therapies and doses toward a disease indication. To address this challenge, the results of Project IDentif.AI (Identifying Infectious Disease Combination Therapy with Artificial Intelligence) are reported. An AI‐based platform is used to interrogate a massive 12 drug/dose parameter space, rapidly identifying actionable combination therapies that optimally inhibit A549 lung cell infection by vesicular stomatitis virus within three days of project start. Importantly, a sevenfold difference in efficacy is observed between the top‐ranked combination being optimally and sub‐optimally dosed, demonstrating the critical importance of ideal drug and dose identification. This platform is disease indication and disease mechanism‐agnostic, and potentially applicable to the systematic N‐of‐1 and population‐wide design of highly efficacious and tolerable clinical regimens. This work also discusses key factors ranging from healthcare economics to global health policy that may serve to drive the broader deployment of this platform to address COVID‐19 and future pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glioblastoma (GB) is the most lethal type of primary tumor in the central nervous system. Current treatments include surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. With this therapeutic regimen, the median survival is less than two years. However, these treatments do not much improve the overall survival of GB patients. GBs are highly angiogenic and invasive tumors and often acquire resistance to therapy. The invasive nature of the disease limits the ability to achieve complete resection of the tumor and the majority of GB patients will experience disease relapse. Moreover, GB is highly heterogeneous, harboring different mutations and presenting different phenotypes. As the brain is considered to be an immune‐privileged tissue, GB is defined as a cold tumor for which current immunotherapies have not yet been demonstrated to improve survival. On top of these challenges, the blood brain barrier (BBB) restricts the uptake of drugs by the brain, thus limiting the therapeutic options. Therefore, enormous efforts are being dedicated to the development of novel nanomedicines, which will be able to cross the BBB and specifically target the cancer cells. Here, the current achievements in drug delivery and novel therapeutic approaches for GB therapy are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Targeting the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway with cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), the natural STING agonists, is a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer. However, the clinical application of natural CDNs as therapeutics is greatly hindered by their intrinsic properties including negative charges, small molecular weight, and high susceptibility to enzymatic degradation. Mn 2+ ions have been recently discovered to directly activate the cyclic GMP‐AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) and augment cGAMP‐STING binding affinity. Here, a PEGylated manganese(II) phosphate (MnP‐PEG) nanocluster is developed with high biocompatibility and potent capacity to stimulate the cGAS‐STING pathway. MnP‐PEG nanoclusters activate the immature bone marrow‐derived dendritic cells (DCs) leading to 57.3‐ and 13.3‐fold higher production of interferon β and interleukin‐6 than free cGAMP, respectively. The potent STING activation capacity is likely due to the efficient cellular internalization of MnP‐PEG nanoclusters by DCs and acid‐triggered release of Mn 2+ ions in the endolysosomes. Intratumoral administration of MnP‐PEG nanoclusters markedly enhances tumor infiltration as well as maturation of DCs and macrophages, and promotes activation and cytotoxicity of T cells and natural killer cells in the tumor. MnP‐PEG nanocluster in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor leads to significant tumor regression in the B16F10 murine melanoma model without any overt toxicities.",

There are reports of the Egyptians and Greek philosophers using such treatments as far back as 3000 BC and 500 BC respectively for various solid tumors. Albeit, in these cases, the treatment was not very controlled and consisted of hot sticks or blades placed against tissue in order to thermally ablate the tumor. It was not until recent times that the application of heat through various mediums enabled a more controlled, localized, and consistent method of treating tumors. While the therapeutic potential of this treatment has become more apparent, the mechanisms related to its efficacy are only recently beginning to surface. This review discusses the evidence associated with the effects of localized heat on the hallmarks of cancer. Key literature describing modulations to vasculature, cell viability, DNA damage and repair, metabolism, immune system, and tumor metastasis in response to heat will be reviewed along with considerations for its optimal implementation in the clinic to enhance the efficacy of conventional treatments.",

All cells are electrically active, in that they possess bioelectric circuitry generating a resting membrane potential and endogenous electric fields that influence cell functions and communication. There is now an accepted paradigm that cancer is characterized by malfunctions in cells’ bioelectrical circuitry. This yields opportunities for bioelectronic medicine as novel treatments for cancer by manipulating its bioelectrical properties. To highlight the possibilities a bioelectrical approach can offer cancer therapy, the relevance of bioelectrical activity in cancer is reviewed and also how such activity can be hijacked in novel treatments. This includes sensing or measuring the electrical activity of cells for diagnostic and prognostic applications, controlling or altering bioelectricity including both ionic and faradaic current processes, and eliciting morphological changes using electric fields. Importantly, key links between cellular ionic and faradaic processes that contribute to cancer phenotypes are presented, which if considered and understood as a whole, can bring broad‐reaching improvements to cancer therapy.",

Among them, manganese oxide nanozymes are advantageous because of remarkable biocompatibility and their good biodegradability. It is herein reported that phospholipid coated Mn 3 O 4 nanozymes mimic both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to effectively eliminate ROS that exacerbate inflammation and cause damages to tissues and organs. With the help of phospholipid decoration, the Mn 3 O 4 nanozymes are well dispersed and show good stability. Moreover, the coating enables the successful fluorescence labelling to study their biodistribution and fate. Excitingly, the Mn 3 O 4 nanozymes exhibit superior therapeutic efficacy for both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) in mouse models over aminosalicylic acid, a first‐line medication for IBD, under the same dosage. Thus, the Mn 3 O 4 nanozymes in this work offer a promising nano‐medication for inflammation‐related disease therapy and broaden the spectrum of biomedical application of nanozymes.",

Improving the percentage of RNA LNPs that can escape from endosomes and enter the cytoplasm is therefore an area of active research interest that could lead to improved safety profiles and reduced manufacturing costs of mRNA drugs. Here, tannic acid mRNA LNPs [TA(+) mRNA LNPs] are reported as an effective delivery platform for the delivery of mRNA payloads. The formulation, characterization, and stability of TA(+) mRNA LNPs are described; two different approaches via confocal microscopy are then utilized to quantify the endosomal escape of the TA(+) mRNA LNPs; and lastly, the biodistribution and tolerability of the TA(+) mRNA LNPs are evaluated in mice following intravenous and intramuscular dosing regimens. To isolate the effect that TA imparts on each of these properties, mRNA LNPs that do not contain TA [TA(−) mRNA LNPs] are evaluated side‐by‐side in each of these studies. A collective analysis of these results suggests that TA(+) mRNA LNPs are effective carriers for mRNA payloads and that the incorporation of TA within each formulation improves the endosomal escape of mRNA LNPs.",

Nanomedicines can be designed for selectively delivering probes and anticancer agents to tumors for achieving improved diagnostic or therapeutic efficacy, while relieving potential side effects. In particular, the number of formulations based on self‐assembled nanostructures under clinical evaluation is increasing due to their unique advantages for elegant and facile preparation, working at the biointerface and spatiotemporally controlling the function of drugs. Here, the current status of clinically used self‐assembled nanomedicines is presented, and recent advances of candidates in clinical trials are reviewed.

    "abstract": "Abstract Low‐molecular‐weight gelators (LMWGs) are an important class of soft materials that offer various potential applications including drug delivery. Structural diversities of the reported LMWGs and lack of molecular‐level understanding of the self‐assembly process of gelation make it difficult to design a gelator a priori. Most often gelators are discovered in a serendipitous manner and second‐generation gelators are designed by modifying known gelling scaffolds. Since gel network within which the solvent molecules are immobilized is often found to be crystalline, a supramolecular synthon approach in the context of crystal engineering is demonstrated to be quite effective in designing LMWGs for various applications including therapeutics. Self‐drug‐delivery systems, wherein the need for a delivery vehicle does not exist, are becoming an effective alternative to conventional drug delivery systems. In the form of a simple gel (for non‐invasive topical application) or injectable gel (for invasive subcutaneous applications), LMWGs derived from drugs provide an effective way to develop self‐drug‐delivery systems. This review article encompasses the early development of LMWG research, describes gradual transition from discovering just a gelator to a gelator having potential material applications including drug delivery, and highlights the merit of supramolecular synthon approach in designing LMWGs for self‐drug‐delivery applications.",

They self‐assemble into a variety of architectures by weak intermolecular interactions such as π‐effects, van der Waals forces, ionic attraction, the hydrophobic effect, and hydrogen bonding, resulting in many advantages in cancer treatment. Self‐assembling peptide nanostructures perform two functions: they act as nanocarriers to deliver drugs to tumor sites, and they regulate drug properties, for example, enhancing drug stability, improving the optical properties of photosensitizers, and increasing the immune response. This review focuses on peptide‐based supramolecular nanodrugs or nanocarriers for different cancer treatment modalities, such as chemotherapy, phototherapy, and immunotherapy. In particular, peptides with special bioactive properties, such as tumor targeting, microenvironmental responsiveness, and antigenicity, will be highlighted for their utility in the effort to conquer cancer.",

Reprogramming M2‐like TAMs toward tumoricidal M1 phenotype is especially intriguing in terms of the restoration of antitumor immunity for anticancer immunotherapy. In this review, the recent advances of nanomedicine‐mediated reprogramming of TAMs from M2 to M1 to elicit the antitumor immunity are discussed. This reprogramming can be achieved via direct re‐education by targeted delivery of various active agents to TAMs and indirect re‐education by modulating the abnormal tumor microenvironment.

Taking advantage of the excellent properties of silicon‐containing nanodots (SiNDs), a self‐traceable nanogel‐based DDS formed by the co‐assembly of a “soft” copolymer and a “hard” fluorescent SiND is developed, which has tunable size/fluorescence, high encapsulation efficiencies (60–92%) for various small molecule drugs, and pH‐responsive drug release capability. As a proof of concept, 5‐aminolevulinic acid, a hydrophilic prodrug of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), and tirapazamine (TPZ), a water‐soluble hypoxia‐responsive drug, are successfully and stably encapsulated into the nanogels. The drug‐loaded green‐emissive nanogels achieve the selective biosynthesis of red‐fluorescent PpIX in tumors and can serve as a ratiometric probe for accurate cancer diagnosis. Moreover, the in situ synthesized PpIX can consume oxygen to produce toxic singlet oxygen in the tumor microenvironment under light irradiation, thus activating the hypoxia‐dependent cytotoxicity of TPZ. Thanks to the less PpIX production and the neutral/normoxic environment in normal tissues, the nanoagents elicit negligible toxicity to normal cells even under light irradiation. Overall, this work develops a novel strategy for constructing a series of smart nanogels as universal DDSs and realizes precision cancer theranostics.",

Nanoscale technologies have shown great promise to provide higher transfection efficiency and lower cell perturbation than conventional viral, biochemical and electroporation techniques due to their small size and localized effect. Although this has significant implications for using cells post-transfection, it has not been thoroughly studied. Here, we developed the nano-electro-injection (NEI) platform which makes use of localized electric fields to transiently open pores on cell membrane followed by electrophoretic delivery of DNA into cells. NEI provided two-folds higher net transfection efficiency than biochemicals and electroporation in Jurkat cells. Analysis of cell doubling time, intracellular calcium levels and mRNA expression changes after these gene delivery methods revealed that viruses and electroporation adversely affected cell behavior. Cell doubling times increased by more than 40% using virus and electroporation methods indicative of higher levels of cell stress, unlike NEI which only minimally affected cell division. Finally, electroporation, but not NEI, greatly altered the expression of immune-associated genes related to immune cell activation and trafficking. These results highlight that nanoscale delivery tools can have significant advantages from a cell health perspective for cell-based research and therapeutic applications.",

The successful functionalization is confirmed by several physico‐chemical characterization techniques. The selectivity of the YIGSR‐CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles is first validated in vitro using a micropatterned array of 67 kDa laminin receptor. Next, the specificity of YIGSR‐CMCht/PAMAM dendrimers nanoparticles toward laminin receptor is further confirmed both in 2D and 3D settings using HCT‐116 colorectal cancer cells and L929 fibroblasts in co‐culture. Finally, gemcitabine‐loaded YIGSR‐CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles induce a targeted mortality on HCT‐116 cancer cells in a co‐culture scenario. Overall, the study shows solid evidence that YIGSR laminin receptor binding peptide coupled to CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles may be employed as an anticancerous target for the specific and intracellular delivery of chemotherapeutic agents.",

However, systemwide immunomodulation is undesirable due to the severe side effects that typically accompany such strategies. In order to circumvent these undesired, harmful effects, scientists have turned to tailorable biomaterials that can achieve localized, potent release of immune-modulating agents. Specifically, \"stimuli-responsive\" biomaterials hold a strong promise for delivery of immunotherapeutic agents to the disease site or disease-relevant tissues with high spatial and temporal accuracy. This review provides an overview of stimuli-responsive biomaterials used for targeted immunomodulation. Stimuli-responsive or \"environmentally responsive\" materials are customized to specifically react to changes in pH, temperature, enzymes, redox environment, photo-stimulation, molecule-binding, magnetic fields, ultrasound-stimulation, and electric fields. Moreover, the latest generation of this class of materials incorporates elements that allow for response to multiple stimuli. These developments, and other stimuli-responsive materials that are on the horizon, are discussed in the context of controlling immune responses.",

Encapsulation of ultra‐small GQDs is expected to reduce their quick excretion from the body and increase their bioimaging efficiency. To expand the functionality of protein nanocages as multi‐modal imaging nanoprobes capable of both fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), GQDs and iron are encapsulated inside the core of AfFtn‐AA (an engineered ferritin nanocage derived from the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus ). The co‐encapsulation is achieved through an iron‐mediated, self‐assembly of ferritin dimers resulting in the formation of GQD–iron complex in the ferritin nanocages ((GQDs/Fe)AA). The (GQDs/Fe)AA shows high relaxivities in MRI and pH‐sensitive fluorescence with strong fluorescence at low pH values and on MDA‐MB‐231 cells. As an imaging agent and a drug nanocarrier, (GQDs/Fe)AA exhibits negligible cytotoxicity on the cells and a high loading capacity (35%) of doxorubicin.

As an alternative to solute OVA, engineering approach is developed herein towards protein nanoparticles (pNPs) based on reactive electrospraying. The resulting pNPs are comprised of polymerized OVA, where individual OVA molecules are chemically linked via poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) units. Controlling the PEG/OVA ratio allows for fine‐tuning of critical physical properties, such as particle size, elasticity, and, at the molecular level, mesh size. As the PEG/OVA ratio decreased, OVA pNPs are more effectively processed by dendritic cells, resulting in higher OT‐I CD8+ cells proliferation in vitro. Moreover, pNPs with lower PEG/OVA ratios elicit enhanced lymphatic drainage in vivo and increased uptake by lymph node macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells, while 500 nm OVA pNPs show poor draining lymph nodes delivery. In addition, pNPs with lower PEG/OVA ratios result in higher anti‐OVA antibody titers in vivo, suggesting improved humoral immune responses. Importantly, OVA pNPs result in significantly increased median survival relative to solute OVA antigen in a mouse model of B16F10‐OVA melanoma. This work demonstrates that precisely engineered OVA pNPs can improve the overall anti‐tumor response compared to solute antigen.",

    "abstract": "Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a cancer treatment that utilizes antibody-photoabsorber (IR700) conjugates to selectively kill target cells by exposing them to NIR light. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) is a major immune checkpoint ligand mediating antitumor immune suppression. Local depletion of CTLA4 expressing cells in the tumor bed with NIR-PIT could enhance antitumor immune responses by both blocking the CTLA4-axis and depleting immune suppressive cells. The aim of this study is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of CTLA4-targeted NIR-PIT using four murine tumor models, MC38-luc, LL/2-luc, MOC2-luc, and MOC2. The CTLA4-targeted NIR-PIT depletes intratumoral CTLA4 expressing cells which are mostly regulatory T cells. In vivo CTLA4-targeted NIR-PIT yields complete responses in 80% of MC38-luc, 70% of LL/2-luc and 40% of MOC2-luc tumors prolonging survival in all cases. After CTLA4-targeted NIR-PIT, activation and infiltration of CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment is observed. In conclusion, CTLA4-targeted NIR-PIT can effectively treat tumors by blocking the CTLA4-axis as well as by eliminating CTLA4-expressing immune suppressor cells, resulting in T cell mediated antitumor immunity. Local CTLA4-expressing cell depletion in tumor beds using NIR-PIT could be a promising new cancer immunotherapy for safely treating a variety of tumor types.",

Remarkably, biocompatible bismuth‐based nanomaterials can be effectively activated by near‐infrared (NIR) light to fight bacterial infections and tumors.

The three most commonly used NIR‐responsive bismuth‐based nanomaterials including pristine bismuth nanomaterials, bismuth‐based compound nanomaterials, and bismuth‐based composite nanomaterials are exemplified. Furthermore, their photothermal and photodynamic therapy mechanisms, antibacterial, and antitumor applications are summarized. In addition, their NIR phototherapy enhancement strategies are also highlighted. Finally, the key issues and future directions of bismuth‐based nanomaterial phototherapy systems are discussed in detail.

Following stroke, highly reactive astrocytes and pro-inflammatory microglia can release cytokines and lead to a cytotoxic environment that causes further brain damage and prevents endogenous repair. Paradoxically, these same cells also activate pro-repair mechanisms that contribute to endogenous repair and brain plasticity. Here, we show that the direct injection of a hyaluronic acid based microporous annealed particle (MAP) hydrogel into the stroke core in mice reduces the percent of highly reactive astrocytes, increases the percent of alternatively activated microglia, decreases cerebral atrophy and preserves NF200 axonal bundles. Further, we show that MAP hydrogel promotes reparative astrocyte infiltration into the lesion, which directly coincides with axonal penetration into the lesion. This work shows that the injection of a porous scaffold into the stroke core can lead to clinically relevant decrease in cerebral atrophy and modulates astrocytes and microglia towards a pro-repair phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Abstract DNA nanogel exhibits properties of both the DNA and hydrogel, for example, remarkable biocompatibility, programmability, high drug loading capacity, and rapid stimuli‐responsive nature to microenvironment, which make it a potential ideal carrier for drug and gene delivery. In this review, DNA nanogels are categorized into two types, that is, rolling circle amplification‐based nanogel and hybridization‐based nanogel. Construction methods, design ideas for different functions, and applications in chemotherapy, gene therapy, and immunotherapy of nanogels are discussed. It is believed that this review will help readers to have a deeper understanding of the basic design strategies of DNA nanogels for specific targeting, loading of various anticancer agents, and stimuli‐responsive degradation of nanogels for the controlled release of drugs, which will ultimately help to design more effective delivery system for better therapeutic effects. It is very likely that DNA nanogel, as an intelligent drug carrier, will play a greater role in cancer treatment in future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Diabetes is one of the most pressing healthcare challenges facing society. Dysfunctional insulin signaling causes diabetes, leading to blood glucose instability and many associated complications. While the administration of exogenous insulin is then essential for achieving glucose control, issues with dosing accuracy and timing remain. Hydrogel‐based drug delivery systems have been broadly explored for controlled protein release, including for applications in long‐lasting and oral insulin delivery. More recently, efforts have focused on injectable hydrogels with glucose‐directed controlled release of insulin and glucagon, aiming for more autonomous and biomimetic approaches to blood glucose control. These materials typically use protein‐based sensing mechanisms or glucose binding by synthetic aryl boronates for glucose‐directed release. Despite advancements in this area, there remains a need for more precise timing of therapeutic availability to afford healthy blood glucose homeostasis, providing an opportunity for further research and innovation. This review summarizes the current state of hydrogel‐based delivery of insulin and glucagon, with insights into the potential benefits, future directions, and challenges that must be overcome to achieve clinical impact.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biofilms formed by antibiotic‐resistant bacteria in wound beds challenge the treatment of wound infections. In this work, the activity of a novel electrochemical bandage (e‐bandage) composed of carbon fabric and controlled by a wearable potentiostat, designed to continuously deliver low amounts of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), is evaluated against methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug‐resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR‐PA) and mixed‐species (MRSA and MDR‐PA) wound infections. Wounds created on Swiss Webster mice are infected with the above‐named bacteria and biofilms allow to establish in wound beds for 3 days. e‐Bandages, which electrochemically reduce dissolved oxygen to H 2 O 2 when polarized at −0.6 V Ag/AgCl , are placed atop infected wound beds and polarized continuously for 48 h. Polarized e‐bandage treatment results in significant reductions ( p &lt;0.001) of both monospecies and mixed‐species wound infections. After e‐bandage treatment, electron microscopy shows degradation of bacterial cells, and histopathology shows no obvious alterations to the inflammatory host response. Blood biochemistries show no abnormalities. Taken all together, results of this work suggest that the described H 2 O 2 ‐producing e‐bandage can reduce in vivo MRSA, MDR‐PA, and mixed‐species wound biofilms, and should be further developed as a potential antibiotic‐free strategy for treatment of wound infections.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Current treatment modalities of cutaneous wound infections are largely ineffective, attributed to the increasing burden of antimicrobial resistance. S. aureus , a commonly wound‐associated pathogen continues to pose a clinical challenge, suggesting that new alternative therapeutic materials are urgently required to provide optimal treatment. A layered allotrope of phosphorus termed Black Phosphorus nanoflakes (BPNFs) has emerged as a potential alternative antibacterial material. However, wider deployment of this material requires extensive biological validation using the latest pre‐clinical models to understand its role in wound management. Here, the antibacterial potential of BPNFs against wound pathogens demonstrates over 99% killing efficiency at ambient conditions, while remaining non‐toxic to mammalian skin cells. In addition, in vivo validation of BPNFs using a preclinical model of S. aureus acute wound infection demonstrates that daily topical application significantly reduces infection (3‐log reduction) comparable to ciprofloxacin antibiotic control. Furthermore, the application of BPNFs also accelerates wound closure, increases wound re‐epithelization, and reduces tissue inflammation compared to controls, suggesting a potential role in alleviating the current challenges of infected cutaneous wounds. For the first time, this study demonstrates the potential role of BPNFs in ambient light conditions for clearing a clinically relevant wound infection with favorable wound healing properties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Some wounds do not follow the typical healing trajectory and show very little, if any, progress. They dreadfully threaten the patients' quality of life and may even lead to limb amputation and death. Several interrelated systemic and local factors may cause a delay in wound healing. The microenvironment of these wounds can be different from wounds that heal spontaneously or with standard treatment. As discussed in the present work, proteases’ levels or activity can be elevated in some cases of chronic ulcers; infection can aggravate the situation. A detailed overview of the proteases’ effect on wound healing is presented in this work. Assuming untimely or irregularly excessive proteolytic activity plays a pathological role, some researchers targeted attenuation of protease level as a strategy to promote healing. This can be done via different approaches, including physical removal, inhibiting their activity, and controlling their expression directly through gene silencing or indirectly, for instance, by resolving infection. Apart from targeting protease modulation as a therapeutic strategy, many studies have examined the protease state to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms by which a remedy, dressing, or specific therapy has affected the healing process. This study aims to provide an overview of the studies in these two categories. Of course, various proteases are involved in the healing process, but in each study, usually, only one or some of them are investigated; matrix metalloproteinase‐2 (MMP‐2), MMP‐9, and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) are among them. Furthermore, in some cases, cumulative proteolytic activity is evaluated in terms of gelatinolytic, collagenolytic, or caseinolytic activity, which is also absolutely beneficial. Some research groups have considered the potential of proteases as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker and have tried to develop some sensors or indicators; this topic is also covered in the present work.",

This study investigates the potential of angstrom‐scale silver particles (F‐AgÅPs) to selectively target and eliminate MM cells, focusing on their susceptibility and underlying mechanisms. F‐AgÅPs are synthesized using a pure physical high‐efficiency evaporation‐condensation method and coated with fructose, and their cytotoxic effects on MM cell lines are evaluated through cell viability assays and flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are measured to elucidate oxidative stress, while the role of nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (NRF2) is examined via western blotting and quantitative PCR. In vivo, the therapeutic potential of F‐AgÅPs is assessed using a MM xenograft mouse model. F‐AgÅPs exhibited significant cytotoxicity in MM cells at low concentrations, with higher ROS levels leading to oxidative damage and NRF2 accumulation. This effect is mitigated by the ROS scavenger N‐acetyl‐l‐cysteine. Additionally, the NRF2 activator dimethyl fumarate (DMF) enhanced F‐AgÅPs‐induced cytotoxicity in vitro and suppressed myeloma growth in vivo. These findings suggest that combining DMF with F‐AgÅPs is a promising therapeutic strategy for MM, effectively targeting ROS‐induced oxidative damage through NRF2 activation.",

Hydrogels are extensively employed in several domains, such as water treatment and biomedicine. Because of hydrogels' unique potentials like their tissue resemblance and ease of processing, significant progress is achieved in these domains. However, based on a thorough examination of hydrogel microstructures, it is difficult for conventional homogeneous hydrogels to concurrently address various demands due to the growth of in vitro and in vivo necessities in controlled drug delivery, cartilage repair, cell encapsulation, and other utilities. Thankfully, research on heterogeneous dual‐layered hydrogels has developed and is now a remarkable area of hydrogel engineering. This review abridged the current developments in multi‐layered hydrogels according to their structural design, fabrication techniques, and recent experimental findings along with special attention to the therapeutic applications of double‐layered hydrogels. The report concluded by discussing the challenges in the design of double‐layered hydrogels and pointed out a new direction of 3D printing, which may offer a new approach to designing double‐layered hydrogels and expand the range of in vitro and in vivo therapeutic studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The benefit that antibiotics confer to the welfare of mankind is threatened by bacterial resistance. Resistance to daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide frequently used for the treatment of complicated bacteremia, is a prime example of this alarming situation. As the restricted number of antibacterial drug targets limits de novo development, chemical modification of existing compounds represents an alternative development option for future antimicrobials. This approach involves altering compounds to target bacteria through multiple mechanisms and/or to reinforce them against resistant strains. Herein, the conjugation of polycationic peptides to daptomycin enhances its effectiveness against a highly daptomycin‐resistant laboratory strain of Staphylococcus aureus and clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium with reduced daptomycin sensitivity. Notably, unlike daptomycin, the activity of these conjugates does not necessarily depend on the calcium concentration. In addition to regaining bacteriolytic activity, the findings indicate the acquisition of an additional or amended mode of action as evidenced by pore formation and the disruption of membrane potential. The combination of enhanced in vitro potency, in vivo activity, and tolerability highlights the potential of this drug modification strategy in combating multidrug‐resistant bacteria.",

The use of appropriate nano‐drug delivery vehicle can overcome these issues. Cannabidiol (CBD) has the potential to be used as a novel therapeutic agent for treating cancer. The study utilizes colostrum‐derived exosomes as nano‐carriers for the delivery of CBD to overcome its low oral bioavailability. Exosomes are isolated from colostrum powder by sequential ultracentrifugation. Following CBD loading the formulations (ExoCBD and FA‐ExoCBD) are characterized for their physical parameters (size, charge, and zeta potential). Cell culture assays (MTT, colony forming) are performed to analyze the anti‐cancer activity of CBD and ExoCBD against drug‐sensitive and resistant lung cancer cells and followed by orthotopic lung tumor xenograft mouse‐model. FA‐functionalized exosomal formulation of CBD provides a drug load of 20–24%. CBD and its exosomal formulations show antiproliferative and anti‐inflammatory activities against both lung cancer cells and reduce the colony forming ability. Mechanistically, CBD decreased the expression of CB2, cell cycle markers, NF‐κB, and IκBα, while increasing GPR3 levels in both drug‐sensitive and drug‐resistant lung cancer cells, as well as MDR‐1 in drug‐resistant cells. Orally administered FA‐ExoCBD shows superior tumor growth inhibition as compared to free CBD (80% vs 60%) at one‐half the dose of 7.5 mg kg −1 versus 15 mg kg −1 . FA‐ExoCBD can be developed as a potential targeted oral drug in the quest of lung cancer management.",

Whilst small molecules have dominated the therapeutic landscape for decades, the design and application of peptide drugs is emerging among the pharmaceutical industries and academia. Although highly selective and efficacious, peptides are characterized by poor pharmacokinetic properties and amelioration of their bioavailability remains a major hurdle. Incorporation of conformational constraints within the peptide (such as peptide stapling) has been extensively used to improve the bioavailability of these molecules; consequently, it is not surprising that a plethora of stapling techniques has been developed and has had a significant impact on the development of peptide therapeutics. Among the numerous stapling techniques known, two‐component methodologies allow facile and divergent functionalization of peptides. The authors have pioneered a stapling technique that makes use of the double Cu‐catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition between di‐azido peptides and functionalized di‐alkynyl staples. In recent years, the authors have created biologically active, conformationally constrained peptides functionalized with cell‐penetrating peptides, fluorescent tags, and photo cross‐linking moieties, demonstrating the wide applicability of this methodology.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death. Despite the huge progress in the field of cancer drugs and therapies, the treatment outcome is still bleak for most cancer patients. Nanotechnology has revolutionized cancer therapeutics. By using nano‐sized particles as delivery systems, therapeutic biomolecules are transported efficiently to the target sites. Moreover, these particles are designed to carry out multiple cancer treatments simultaneously. Near‐infrared (NIR) light‐responsive nanomaterials have gained much attention as NIR light has a greater penetration depth, minimal phototoxicity, lower autofluorescence, and reduced light scattering. Among the available NIR light‐responsive nanomaterials, gold nanorods, upconversion nanoparticles, carbon dots, transition metal dichalcogenide, metal oxides, black phosphorus, and polymeric nanomaterials have become attractive options owing to their excellent optical properties, ease of synthesis and modification, outstanding photodynamic and photothermal conversion properties, and most importantly, favorable toxicity level and biocompatibility which are prerequisites for biological applications. In this review, the outstanding properties, synthesis, and surface functionalization of the aforementioned NIR light‐responsive nanomaterials are introduced in detail. Recent advances of these nanomaterials for various cancer treatment modalities are summarized to highlight their versatility and potential in cancer theranostics. Finally, a perspective is proposed on future research directions and their clinical translation.",

To develop a suitable drug candidate, a high resolution (2.05 Å) co‐crystal structure of the CD73 inhibitor PSB‐12379, a nucleotide analogue, in complex with human CD73 is determined. This allows the rational design and development of a novel inhibitor (PSB‐12489) with subnanomolar inhibitory potency toward human and rat CD73, high selectivity, as well as high metabolic stability. A co‐crystal structure of PSB‐12489 with CD73 (1.85 Å) reveals the interactions responsible for increased potency.

Due to the strong influence of surface chemistry, chemical modulation of bioinert exosomes with chargeable and traceable small molecule fluorophores has a significant effect on the targeting, stability, and toxicity of the final conjugates. In this study, charge‐variable exosomes are designed by conjugating their surface proteins with near‐infrared fluorophores to control the in vivo fate of exosomes. Interestingly, zwitterionic fluorophore‐labeled exosomes show rapid renal clearance with minimum to none nonspecific tissue uptake, whereas anionic exosomes are excreted through the hepatobiliary route with high uptake in the liver. The biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of exosome conjugates are comparable to their corresponding free fluorophores, demonstrating that the surface characteristics govern the fate of final conjugates in the living organism. Such unique surface properties of chemically modulated exosomes are confirmed in the lymphatic system after intradermal administration, which results in distinctive kinetic profiles in the secondary lymphoid tissues. This finding can subsequently serve as the foundation for developing tissue‐specific exosome‐based therapeutics.",

This has driven the development of new targeted treatment modalities, including several based on the conversion of optical light into heat energy (photothermal therapy, PTT) and sound waves (photoacoustic imaging, PA) that can be applied locally. These approaches are especially effective when combined with photoactive nanoparticles that preferentially accumulate in tissues of interest and thereby further increase spatiotemporal resolution. In this study, two clinically-used materials that have proven effective in both PTT and PA - indocyanine green and gold nanoparticles - were combined into a single nanoformulation. These particles, \"ICG-AuNP clusters\", incorporated high concentrations of both moieties without the need for additional stabilizing or solubilizing reagents. The clusters demonstrated high theranostic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo, compared with ICG alone. Specifically, in an orthotopic mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer, ICG-AuNP clusters could be injected intravenously, imaged in the tumor by PA, and then combined with near-infrared laser irradiation to successfully thermally ablate tumors and prolong animal survival. Altogether, this novel nanomaterial demonstrates excellent therapeutic potential for integrated treatment and imaging.",

However, cationic moieties at high dosage tend to induce severe cytotoxicity due to the interference on cell membrane integrity.

    "abstract": "Abstract Oral glucocorticoids are backbones for the acute management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the clinical effectiveness of conventional oral dosage forms of glucocorticoids is hindered by their low delivery efficiency and systemic side effects. To overcome this problem, a smart drug delivery system with high loading capacity and colonic release by coating functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with a pH‐responsive polymer Eudragit S100 is proposed. In vitro dissolution tests show that Eudragit‐coated MSNs can limit the burst release of loaded prednisolone and budesonide in the gastric environment with more than 60% of the drugs released only at colonic pH (i.e., pH ≥ 7). In vivo therapeutic efficacy of budesonide‐loaded nanoparticles is tested in a murine model of dextran sodium sulfate‐induced colitis. An oral budesonide dose of 0.2 mg kg −1 nanoparticles with Eudragit coating improves the disease activity index compared to other groups. Interestingly, both coated and uncoated nanoparticles show pathological improvements demonstrated by similar levels of histological colitis score. However, coated nanoparticles significantly decrease mRNA expression of the cytokines ( Il‐1β, Il‐17 , and Il‐10 ) particularly in proximal colon, indicating colonic delivery. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a simple method to fabricate targeted nanomedicine for the treatment of IBD.",

Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a potent antiretroviral drug, with numerous long-acting (LA) delivery systems under development to improve PrEP adherence. However, none has undergone preventive efficacy assessment. Here we show that LA TAF using a novel subcutaneous nanofluidic implant (nTAF) confers partial protection from HIV transmission. We demonstrate that sustained subcutaneous delivery through nTAF in rhesus macaques maintained tenofovir diphosphate concentration at a median of 390.00 fmol/106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 9 times above clinically protective levels. In a non-blinded, placebo-controlled rhesus macaque study with repeated low-dose rectal SHIVSF162P3 challenge, the nTAF cohort had a 62.50% reduction (95% CI: 1.72% to 85.69%; p=0.068) in risk of infection per exposure compared to the control. Our finding mirrors that of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) monotherapy, where 60.00% protective efficacy was observed in macaques, and clinically, 67.00% reduction in risk with 86.00% preventive efficacy in individuals with detectable drug in the plasma. Overall, our nanofluidic technology shows potential as a subcutaneous delivery platform for long-term PrEP and provides insights for clinical implementation of LA TAF for HIV prevention.",

The 3‐μm diameter capsules are assembled via layer‐by‐layer deposition of the natural polyphenol tannic acid and poly( N ‐vinylpyrrolidone) with 4 nm iron oxide nanoparticles incorporated in the capsule wall. The nanoparticle‐modified capsules exhibit excellent T 1 and T 2 MRI contrast in a clinical 3T MRI scanner. Loaded with the anticancer drug doxorubicin, these capsules circulate in the blood stream for at least 48 h, which is a remarkable improvement compared to nonencapsulated nanoparticles. The application of focused ultrasound results in targeted drug release with a 16‐fold increase in doxorubicin localization in tumors compared to off‐target organs in a mouse model of breast cancer. Owing to the active contrast, long circulation, customizable size, shape, composition, and precise delivery of high payload concentrations, these materials present a powerful and safe platform for imaging‐guided precision drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "Current \"fast-acting\" insulin analogues contain amino acid modifications meant to inhibit dimer formation and shift the equilibrium of association states toward the monomeric state. However, the insulin monomer is highly unstable and current formulation techniques require insulin to primarily exist as hexamers to prevent aggregation into inactive and immunogenic amyloids. Insulin formulation excipients have thus been traditionally selected to promote insulin association into the hexameric form to enhance formulation stability. This study exploits a novel excipient for the supramolecular PEGylation of insulin analogues, including aspart and lispro, to enhance the stability and maximize the prevalence of insulin monomers in formulation. Using multiple techniques, it is demonstrated that judicious choice of formulation excipients (tonicity agents and parenteral preservatives) enables insulin analogue formulations with 70-80% monomer and supramolecular PEGylation imbued stability under stressed aging for over 100 h without altering the insulin association state. Comparatively, commercial \"fast-acting\" formulations contain less than 1% monomer and remain stable for only 10 h under the same stressed aging conditions. This simple and effective formulation approach shows promise for next-generation ultrafast insulin formulations with a short duration of action that can reduce the risk of post-prandial hypoglycemia in the treatment of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joints and a leading cause of physical disability in adults. Intra‐articular (IA) therapy is a popular treatment strategy for localized, single‐joint OA; however, small‐molecule drugs such as corticosteroids do not provide prolonged relief. One possible reason for their lack of efficacy is high clearance rates from the joint through constant lymphatic drainage of the synovial tissues and synovial fluid and also by their exchange via the synovial vasculature. Advanced drug delivery strategies for extended release of therapeutic agents in the joint space is a promising approach to improve outcomes for OA patients. Broadly, the basic principle behind this strategy is to encapsulate therapeutic agents in a polymeric drug delivery system (DDS) for diffusion‐ and/or degradation‐controlled release, whereby degradation can occur by hydrolysis or tied to relevant microenvironmental cues such as pH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protease activity. In this review, the development of clinically tested IA therapies for OA and recent systems which have been investigated preclinically are highlighted. DDS strategies including hydrogels, liposomes, polymeric microparticles (MPs) and nanoparticles (NPs), drug conjugates, and combination systems are introduced and evaluated for clinical translational potential.",

This review discusses the current trends and potential future approaches for developing COVID-19 therapeutics, including repurposed drugs, vaccine candidates, immune-modulators, convalescent plasma therapy, and antiviral nanoparticles/nanovaccines/combinatorial nanotherapeutics to surmount the pandemic viral strain. Many potent therapeutic candidates emerging via drug-repurposing could significantly reduce the cost and duration of anti-COVID-19 drug development. Gene/protein-based vaccine candidates that could elicit both humoral and cell-based immunity would be on the frontlines to prevent the disease.

    "abstract": "Abstract Nanocarriers have the capability to deliver a variety of drugs to disease sites. Different biological barriers prevent the successful delivery of nanoformulations to target sites, thereby limiting effective therapeutic response. Although numerous efforts have been made to design novel nanocarriers by incorporating various functionalities to get better therapies, most strategies have failed to translate drug delivery systems to the clinic. Impediments such as the incapability to hold drugs stably in nanocarriers during circulation, non‐specific distribution, and inadequate delivery of therapeutic agents to target sites due to complex tumor microenvironment remain a challenge. Herein, different organic polymer and lipid‐based nanocarriers and their encouraging therapeutic effectiveness to treat cancer are discussed. Recent development in multifunctional and stimuli sensitive nanocarriers is also highlighted. Finally, the challenges and innovative strategies to overcome various obstacles and limitations for their successful translation into the clinic are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Unlike viral vectors with their undesired safety or immunogenicity concerns, biocompatible polymeric nonviral vectors as gene delivery systems are more promising in gene or cell therapy. Evidence has demonstrated that the rational design of polymeric nonviral gene vectors with optimal structure, charge density, biocompatibility, and stimulus responsiveness can deliver therapeutic genes or gene vaccines (in terms of deoxyribonucleic acid DNA or ribonucleic acid RNA) into tumor‐associated immunocytes (i.e., macrophages, T cells, or dendritic cells) in an effective and controllable manner for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. However, a timely and systematic summary of this subject is lacking. This review presents an overview of polymeric nonviral carriers with immune cell transfection ability and their potential applications in cancer immunotherapy; it also provides a tutorial for designing polymeric immune‐cell genetic modification vector, although there are still few vectors in the product pipeline. With the rapid growth of immunotherapy in cancer treatment and knowledge accumulation in vector structure design, polymeric nonviral gene delivery systems may provide new hope for tumor therapy.",

Yet, the therapeutic efficacy of CDNs has been limited by poor delivery and biostability. Here, STING-activating DNA nanovaccines (STING-NVs) are developed, which biostabilize, deliver, and conditionally release CDG in the endosome of immune cells, elicit potent antitumor immune responses in murine and human immune cells, ameliorate immunosuppression in vitro and in the tumor microenvironment, and mediate potent cancer immunotherapy in a murine melanoma model. STING-NVs have PLA-b-PEG in the core and cytosine (C)-rich i-motif DNA on the surface. i-Motif DNA undergoes characteristic pH-responsive conformational switch, allowing efficient CDG loading via C:G base pairing at physiological pH, and CDG release in sensitive response to acidic environment such as cell endosome. STING-NVs protect CDG from enzymatic degradation. STING-NVs facilitate cell delivery. Remarkably, STING-NVs promote the endosome escape of CDG by ninefold, and potentiate antitumor immunity. STING-NVs repolarize immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages into antitumor M1-like macrophages in vitro and in the tumor microenvironment of melanoma. In a poorly immunogenic murine melanoma model, intralesional STING-NVs outperform liposomal CDG and fluoride-CDG for melanoma immunotherapy. These results suggest the great potential of STING-NVs for cancer immunotherapy.",

However, current approaches for exosomal PD‐L1 detection are poorly sensitive, laborious, and time‐consuming. Here, a new method, named Aptamer‐RPA‐TMA‐Cas13a Assay (ARTCA) is established, which enables exosomal PD‐L1 to be detected directly in serum with a lower limit of 10 particles mL −1 . Mechanistically, using DNA aptamer specifically binding to exosomal PD‐L1, the aptamer is amplified twice by recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) coupled with transcription‐mediated amplification (TMA) and simultaneously the TMA products are detected in real‐time with CRISPR/Cas13a system. Utilizing ARTCA, PD‐L1 levels in circulating exosomes seem to be a reliable marker of PD‐L1 expression in tumor tissue. The level of circulating exosomal PD‐L1 increases significantly in patients with tumor progression. Ultra‐trace detection of serum exosomal PD‐L1 by ARTCA provides a potentially convenient way for dynamic monitoring of tumor progression for patients undergoing immunotherapy. These results demonstrate the use of CRISPR‐Cas13a for protein detection, and circulating exosomal PD‐L1 levels seem to be a reliable marker as well as PD‐L1 expression in tumor tissue, opening up new avenues for monitoring tumor progression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Near‐infrared fluorescent agents generally exhibit typical push‐pull electron characteristics, and their optical behaviors are closely related to their molecular structures. Benzobisthiadiazole moiety as a classic electron acceptor has been typically used to design the Donor‐Acceptor‐Donor (D‐A‐D) type of fluorescent/photoacoustic agents with emission in the second near‐infrared window. In this work, two strategies are examined to intensify their absorption/fluorescence and fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging performance: 1) the conjugated bridges are amplified by installing two electron‐rich thiophenes and one styrene on two sides of the benzobisthiadiazole core and 2) the N , N ‐dimethylamino group is employed to replace the traditional diphenylamine to strengthen the electron donor. This agent shows the maximum absorption and fluorescence emission at 942 and 1302 nm, respectively. Its superior in vitro and vivo data confirms that the nanoparticles of this compound complexed with 1,2‐distearoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphoethanolamine‐N‐[methoxy(polyethyleneglycol)] (DSPE‐PEG) can not only perform real‐time and high‐contrast noninvasive near‐infrared fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging of tumors (980 nm laser irradiation) but also effectively ablate the tumor cells by photothermal therapy implementing the dual‐modality imaging method. In particular, its longer wavelength absorption and emission successfully improves the fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging performance. These observations highlight its potential to be used as a promising therapeutic platform for cancer.",

This paper presents novel ultrasound‐responsive delivery microbubbles (UDMs), with chemotherapeutic‐encapsulated hydrogel shells and therapeutic gas cores. These are developed using microfluidic electrospray to treat pancreatic tumors. As the hydrogel shells are composed of thermo‐sensitive poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), they can contract under mild hyperthermia generated by the acoustic‐wave‐induced oscillation of the encapsulated gas. Thus, by triggering with ultrasound, the chemotherapeutic Gemcitabine (Gem) encapsulated in the hydrogel shells and the hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) encased in the cores can be controllably released. Based on the UDMs, it is demonstrated that the multiple drug‐loaded microcarriers exhibit an excellent tumor‐killing effect through combination therapy. The Gem and H 2 S coloaded UDMs have good therapeutic efficacy and adaptability in an orthotopic pancreatic implantation tumor model established in mice. These results indicate that the proposed UDMs have a large potential for codelivery of multiple drugs for treating deep‐seated tumors and for realizing combination drug treatment to avoid untoward reactions.",

The development of broadly neutralizing antibodies that engage evolutionarily conserved epitopes on coronavirus spike proteins represents a promising strategy to improve therapy and prophylaxis against SARS‐CoV‐2 and variants thereof. Herein, a facile multivalent engineering approach is employed to achieve large synergistic improvements in the neutralizing activity of a SARS‐CoV‐2 cross‐reactive nanobody (VHH‐72) initially generated against SARS‐CoV. This synergy is epitope specific and is not observed for a second high‐affinity nanobody against a non‐conserved epitope in the receptor‐binding domain. Importantly, a hexavalent VHH‐72 nanobody retains binding to spike proteins from multiple highly transmissible SARS‐CoV‐2 variants (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) and potently neutralizes them. Multivalent VHH‐72 nanobodies also display drug‐like biophysical properties, including high stability, high solubility, and low levels of non‐specific binding. The unique neutralizing and biophysical properties of VHH‐72 multivalent nanobodies make them attractive as therapeutics against SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Immunotherapy efficacy depends on T cell trafficking to tumors and migrating to malignant cells to kill them. One barrier to T cell homing is the tumor blood vessel wall, which inhibits T cell attachment and transmigration through the endothelin B receptor, but antagonizing this receptor has not led to a clinically approved drug. One reason may be tumor hypo‐perfusion, which limits the area of perfused vessels for T cell attachment. If collapsed vessels can be decompressed and re‐perfused by alleviating tumor stiffness, then endothelin B receptor antagonism can improve immunotherapy. Here, it is tested whether the nonselective endothelin receptor blocker, bosentan, by simultaneously interfering with endothelin A receptor induced fibrosis, can normalize the tumor microenvironment thereby acting as a “mechanotherapeutic.” Tumor stiffness is monitored with ultrasound elastography and nanomechanical properties with atomic force microscopy to find an optimal dose, which reprograms cancer‐associated fibroblasts resulting in reduced collagen thereby decompressing vessels. Through this mechanism, T cell association with tumor vessels increases and immunosuppressive hypoxia is reduced. Additionally, bosentan increases the CD8 + T cells proliferating fraction. Ultrasound stiffness measurements correlate well with response to immunotherapy, suggesting the potential role of ultrasound elastography as a predictive biomarker of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The number of people affected by diabetes mellitus increases globally year on year. Elevated blood glucose levels may result from a lack of insulin to manage these levels and can, over a prolonged period, lead to serious repercussions. Diabetes mellitus patients must monitor and control their blood‐glucose levels with invasive testing and often alongside administration of intravenous doses of insulin, which can often lead to suboptimal compliance. To mitigate these issues, “closed‐loop” insulin delivery systems are deemed to be among superior options for rapid relief from the demanding and troublesome necessity of self‐directed care. The reversible dynamic covalent chemistry of boronic acid derivatives and their competitive affinity to 1,2‐ and 1,3‐diols (such as those present in saccharides) allows for the design and preparation of responsive self‐regulated insulin delivery materials which respond to elevated and changing glucose levels. A range of meritorious and noteworthy contributions in the domain of boron‐mediated insulin delivery materials is surveyed, and providing a multidisciplinary context in the realisation of the ambitious goal of ultimately addressing the desire to furnish glucose‐responsive insulin delivery materials through innovative synthesis and rigorous testing is targetted.",

The conserved properties of the membrane fusion domain of the spike (S) protein across SARS‐CoV‐2 make it a promising target to develop pan‐CoV therapeutics. Herein, two clinically approved drugs, Itraconazole (ITZ) and Estradiol benzoate (EB), are found to inhibit viral entry by targeting the six‐helix (6‐HB) fusion core of SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein. Further studies shed light on the mechanism that ITZ and EB can interact with the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region of the spike protein, to present anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in vitro, indicating they are novel potential therapeutic remedies for COVID‐19 treatment. Furthermore, ITZ shows broad‐spectrum activity targeting 6‐HB in the S2 subunit of SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV S protein, inspiring that ITZ have the potential for development as a pan‐coronavirus fusion inhibitor.",

Choosing a low abrasion silicon tubing prevented siRNA loss due to adsorption. Mannitol and trehalose formulations preserved siRNA integrity regardless of excipient concentration and temperature at T‐Out below the siRNA melting temperature. Trehalose formulations allowed full siRNA recovery whereas mannitol formulations resulted in spray drying induced losses of ≈20% siRNA and of 50–60% polymer. Mannitol formulations showed optimal aerodynamic characteristics as confirmed by next generation impaction analysis based upon siRNA content. All spray dried formulations resulted in green fluorescent protein (GFP) silencing comparable or better than freshly prepared polyplexes. To test if the observed results could be transferred, formulations of siRNA and transferrin‐PEI conjugates are spray dried, characterized, and used to transfect primary human T cells ex vivo.

Nevertheless, there are several challenges in transporting sufficient drugs to the tumor using these nanoconstructs, which are discussed in this review. Additionally, the current opportunities that improve the biodistribution of nanoconstructs, tumor penetration and drug accumulation are elaborated. The distinct features of currently available strategies do not adequately fit the classical passive and active targeting categories; therefore, in this review, they are regrouped into autonomous and nonautonomous drug delivery systems. Autonomous systems are defined as self‐directed systems that can enhance nanoparticle retention and distribution in solid tumors without the need to align with the blood flow direction, while non‐autonomous systems primarily rely on the blood flow direction, longevity in the circulation and specific affinity to the target cells. Moreover, the effectiveness of the existing delivery systems could be further improved through the correct choice of route of administration. The role of the route of administration in improving these drug delivery methods and some recent examples of locoregional cancer therapy are discussed. These findings could stimulate improvements in the delivery of multifunctional nanoconstructs, which could facilitate successful cancer treatments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Post‐operative adhesions are fibrous bands of scar tissue formed between internal tissues and organs causing clinical morbidity and their prevention represents a critical unmet need. Over 20 million Americans undergo invasive surgery each year and 95% of those patients develop post‐operative adhesions. More specifically, peritoneal adhesions forming as a result of abdominal surgery can result in severe complications such as chronic pain or adhesive small bowel obstruction requiring secondary adhesiolysis surgery. Additionally, adhesiolysis increases operation times during reoperative procedures and increases the risk of hemorrhage and organ injury upon reentry. This work reports the use of a dynamically crosslinked polymer‐nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel adhesion barrier comprised of hydrophobically modified hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and biodegradable PEG‐PLA nanoparticles. These materials have desirable viscoelastic and flow properties, long‐term physical stability during storage, permit administration via spraying, enable local retention in the abdominal cavity for 2 weeks, and definitively reduce peritoneal adhesion formation. Using a rodent ischemic button model to generate peritoneal adhesions ( n &gt; 4), the PNP hydrogel significantly reduced peritoneal adhesion severity compared to commercial control products when assessed by a standardized 5‐point scale (3.18 ± 1.07 versus 1.35 ± 0.63; p = 0.0014). These results suggest that the PNP hydrogel adhesion barrier is a simple and effective solution for the prevention of peritoneal adhesions.",

Currently, diverse nanodrug delivery systems have been used to deliver biomacromolecules because they can maintain stability, significantly increase bioavailability, and improve targeted distribution of biomacromolecules, thereby improving efficacy and reducing toxicity. In recent years, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted increasing interest as stable, efficient, and reusable biomacromolecule immobilization carriers. COFs exhibit good stability and biocompatibility with no biological toxicity, making them outstanding host materials for immobilizing biomacromolecules. However, the synthesis of COFs requires severe experimental conditions; the commonly used strategies for immobilizing biomacromolecules in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), such as biomimetic mineralization, one‐pot synthesis, and coprecipitation, are likely not applicable to COFs. Herein, three strategies for immobilizing biomacromolecules in COFs and the multifunctional biomedical applications of the biomacromolecule@COF composite systems are reviewed. Next, the superior properties and cutting‐edge applications of MOFs are mentioned and then the advantages of COF–MOF hybrid materials are highlighted.",

Microneedles (MNs) are particularly promising because of their straightforward, cost‐effective, and safe administration. But precise control over their degradation rate within the skin remains a challenge. Here, porous silicon microneedles (pSi MNs) with controlled degradation rate, tunable porosity, high payload capacity, and mechanical stability are introduced for transdermal delivery of bioactive molecules. pSi MNs are fabricated by combining dry and wet etching methods. After creating MNs via deep reactive ion etching, a porous surface is obtained by electrochemical anodization, producing pSi MNs of about 42 µm length, tip diameter &lt; 1 µm, and conformal porous layers. The biodegradability and the mechanical properties of pSi MNs are adjusted by changing the thickness of the porous layer from 1.5 to 4.0 µm. Both small and macromolecular drug molecules are uniformly loaded into the porous layer of the pSi MN arrays. Ex vivo penetration experiments on porcine tissue demonstrate efficient transdermal delivery using pSi MNs. The novel pSi MNs with tunable porosity, biodegradability, and mechanical strength offer opportunities for the delivery of biotherapeutics through the skin, engendering innovations in pharmaceutical sciences.",

Metal‐doped carbon dots (CDs), a crucial branch of carbon‐based nanozymes, exhibit efficient antibacterial properties using the reactive oxygen species (ROS) effect. In this study, iron‐doped carbon dots (Fe‐CDs) are synthesized with high peroxidase‐like (POD‐like) activity using natural hemin as a precursor for the first time. The formation of Fe‐CDs remarkably improves the water solubility of hemin showing excellent biocompatibility. Additionally, iron is doped from hemin to the CDs surface, reducing the risk of trial‐and‐error associated with adding an external iron source. The Fe‐CDs‐hydrogel system is constructed via the incorporation of Fe‐CDs into a dual‐crosslinked injectable hydrogel, taking advantage of the synergistic effects. The system enhances the mechanical properties of hydrogel and serves as an excellent carrier for Fe‐CDs. It exhibits effective antibacterial activity at low hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) concentrations (10 −4 m ) via the activation of Fenton‐like reaction‐triggered POD‐like catalytic activity and the electrostatic interactions. The system further demonstrates excellent healing efficacy in a bacteria‐infected wound model by reducing inflammation levels and accelerating the regeneration of tissues.

    "abstract": "Abstract Nowadays, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is regarded as an endogenous gaseous signaling molecule in mammals. As a gas transmitter, it induces important biological effects in many physiological and pathological processes, and possesses great therapeutic potentials. However, this bioactive gas has concentration‐related toxicity, rapid evaporation, and high reactivity, making it inconvenient to use as a therapeutic agent. As an exogenous source of H 2 S, various H 2 S donors are developed to release H 2 S after triggering the response under specific conditions, so as to supplement the level of H 2 S in the body. Meanwhile, to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and reduce the possible toxicities of the H 2 S donors, various new materials or methods for H 2 S delivery are studied, realizing sustained/controlled release profiles as well as achieving triggered, long‐term, local or targeted delivery approaches for the gas. This review summarizes the representative H 2 S donors and the latest progress of hydrogen sulfide donor‐based delivery systems, and the applications of such delivery systems in a series of target diseases that are suitable and expected to be treated by H 2 S, in order to provide reference for the design of secure and efficient H 2 S donor drug delivery system.

However, lack of precise recapitulation of the heterocellular complexity, interactions in oversimplified 2D models, and physiological differences in animal models lead to discrepancy in anticancer drug response. Three‐dimensional (3D) in vitro bioengineered models that physiologically resemble in vivo TME are apt to overcome the discrepancy in the preclinical drug testing outcome. Here, a compartmentalized 3D in vitro triculture triple‐negative breast cancer (TC‐TNBC) model is bioengineered using silk‐fibroin (SF) scaffold and GelMA hydrogel for recapitulating stromal and tumor extracellular niche, respectively. The model features the cellular heterogeneity of stromal niche by incorporating most representative cell types in breast tissue, i.e., adipocytes and endothelial cells, and MDA‐MB‐231 cells in the tumor niche. The TC‐TNBC model exhibits enhanced tumorigenic potential in the presence of stromal cells. Screening of model anticancer drugs (doxorubicin (Dox) and cisplatin (Cis)) exhibits an increase in IC 50 concentration in TC‐TNBC as compared to monoculture, suggesting crucial role of stromal cells in drug response. Drug sensitivity and cytotoxicity behavior mimick the in vivo like drug response. This model provides a facile and adaptable platform to represent tumor‐stromal heterogeneity and high‐throughput anticancer drug screening.",

This PSR‐MNs system provides an advanced injection‐free platform to significantly enhance the current treatment of obesity with GLP‐1RAs, addressing concerns related to pain, needle phobia, high cost, and the need of medical facilities/personnel in traditional injections to administer the drug.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite decades of intense research, glioma remains a disease for which no adequate clinical treatment exists. Given the ongoing therapeutic failures of conventional treatment approaches, nanomedicine may offer alternative options because it can increase the bioavailability of drugs and alter their pharmacokinetics. Here, a new type of synthetic protein nanoparticles (SPNPs) is reported that allow for effective loading and controlled release of the potent cancer drug, paclitaxel (PTX) – a drug that so far has been unsuccessful in glioma treatment due to hydrophobicity, low solubility, and associated delivery challenges. SPNPs are prepared by electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jetting of dilute solutions of PTX‐loaded albumin made by high‐pressure homogenization. After EHD jetting, PTX SPNPs possess a dry diameter of 165 ± 44 nm, hydrated diameter of 297 ± 102 nm, and a zeta potential of −19 ± 8 mV in water. For the SPNP formulation with a total PTX loading of 9.4%, the loading efficiency is 94%, and controlled release of PTX is observed over two weeks (6% burst release). PTX SPNPs are more potent (68% lethality) than free PTX (45% lethality using 0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide). PTX SPNPs in combination with IR show a significant survival benefit in glioma‐bearing mouse models, avoid adverse liver toxicity, and maintain a normal brain architecture. Immunohistochemistry reveals a dramatic tumor size reduction including 40% long‐term survivors without discernible signs of tumor. Using flexibly engineered SPNPs, this work outlines an efficient strategy for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs that are otherwise notoriously hard to deliver.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Calixarenes are third generation of macrocyclic molecules with excellent biocompatibility currently being researched extensively for their diverse potential as therapeutic candidates and for delivery of drugs and biologics. This review discusses the unique structural features which allow them to selectively bind to a wide variety of guest molecules within their hydrophobic cavity, as well as complex with other molecules on their upper and lower rims to enable their application for encapsulation of drugs for targeted and controlled release, molecular carriers for antigens and nucleic acids, and as biomedical sensors. The calixarenes’ unique host–guest chemistry enables encapsulation of lipophilic drugs in the latter's cavity, while the head groups and side chains on the upper and lower rim can be functionalized readily with various targeting moieties as peptides and biological ligands which specifically recognize and bind to cancer cells via surface receptors. The design of calixarene constructs help incorporation of multiple functionalities into a single platform. This active targeting approach enhances the accumulation of the drug at the tumor site while reducing its distribution in healthy tissues, thereby minimizing side effects. Ongoing research in exploration and optimization of calixarenes for application as targeted drug and gene delivery agents has been discussed.",

These sEVs exert multiple therapeutic effects comparable or superior to their parental stem cells while avoiding the limitations of stem cell‐based therapy. The two routine modalities of sEV administration are systemic injection and local delivery. Various biomaterials are developed to assist their local delivery to improve the targeting of organs, minimize nonspecific accumulation in vital organs, and ensure the protection and release of sEVs. This comprehensive, up‐to‐date, specialty‐specific, disease‐oriented, and preclinical review is presented to expound on the surgical application and potential of stem cell‐derived sEVs. The local delivery of stem cell‐derived sEVscan treat numerous diseases encountered in orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, general surgery, urology, otorhinolaryngology, ophthalmology, obstetrics and gynecology, and dental surgery. In addition, the biomaterials utilized encompass a wide range of sources (e.g., natural, synthetic, and hybrid polymers), format (e.g., scaffold, patch, spray, microneedle), and responsiveness (e.g., temperature, pH, and protein), which enables customized sEV therapy tailored to specific diseases. This review demonstrates biomaterial‐facilitated local delivery of stem cell‐derived sEVs as a viable alternative or even a superior option to systemic sEV therapy.",

Peptide vaccines hold the minimalistic amount of biochemical information required for generating antigen‐specific T cells to elicit anticancer responses.

This may stem from a number of reasons, such as tumor‐mediated immunosuppression, limited T cell‐tumor infiltration, or insufficient T cell numbers induced in response to the vaccine. On their own, immunization with naked peptides usually does not induce a satisfactory response, so adjuvants and/or delivery systems are required. Beyond the traditional aluminum salts, oil emulsions, and carrier protein conjugates, next generation peptide delivery systems hold potential to induce stronger or broader responses that could eventually provide for improved immunotherapy outcomes.

This often leads to sub‐optimal responses, or even none at all. Similarly, fixed intensity training can lead to plateaus in learning trajectories and training outcomes. This barrier will impact the field of digital therapeutics, where drug‐based therapies may be complemented or replaced by learning and training platforms. A potential solution is to optimize training by identifying N‐of‐1 (single subject) training profiles that can then enhance learning trajectories through individualized training regimens. In this study, CURATE.AI, a mechanism‐independent and indication‐agnostic artificial intelligence (AI) platform, is used to identify N‐of‐1 learning trajectory profiles for healthy volunteers trained on the Multi‐Attribute Task Battery (MATB), a flight deck simulator developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and United States Air Force. By leveraging modulated MATB training intensity in a prospective study, CURATE.AI successfully develops N‐of‐1 learning trajectory profiles that may actionably mediate training optimization on the single‐subject level, by dynamically identifying training inputs that drive the best possible scoring outcome. Therefore, CURATE.AI‐guided training may serve as a powerful optimization platform for digital therapy, student learning, cognitive decline prevention, and other indications.",

Current approaches are energy intensive and involve presenting the API in a nanoparticle form that is then combined with other additives into a stable formulation. Here, a bottom‐up and scalable method that formulates nanoparticles (crystalline or amorphous) of poorly water‐soluble APIs directly embedded in composite hydrogel beads is presented. Using nanoemulsions prepared from a low energy method as templates, the flexible approach allows to vary the embedded API nanoparticle size from 100 to 500 nm and the hydrogel bead size from 100 to 1200 µm, and subsequently achieve control over the dissolution kinetics. To better understand the dissolution process, a physical model is build that allows to collapse the kinetic data onto a master curve and predict the dependence of release rates on size of both API nanoparticles and hydrogel beads. Lastly, it is demonstrated that the dissolution kinetics of multiple drugs embedded in the same hydrogel matrix can be tuned simultaneously, an attractive property for commercial multi‐drug dosage applications. The new approach not only leads to process intensification, but also improved performance.",

Despite the promise of using nanoparticles to deliver hydrophobic PTX, achieving sufficient drug loading while maintaining small particle size and stability in biological media remains a challenge. Here, a PTX nanoparticle (NP) formulation with small size and great stability is presented that targets breast cancer cells and enables controlled release of PTX. This NP formulation (NP‐PTX‐FA) comprises a superparamagnetic iron oxide core coated with short‐ and long‐chain polyethylene glycol: the former for conjugation of hydrophobic PTX and folic acid (FA), and the latter as an outer layer for improved hydrophilicity. The NP‐PTX‐FA has a uniform size distribution (averaging 28.2 ± 0.64 nm) and high drug loading capacity of 22.8 wt% (vs &lt;10 wt% normally). NP‐PTX‐FA releases the drug under conditions mimicking the acidic intracellular pH of breast cancer cells and the FA conjugation leads to higher NP uptake by target cells, enhancing the cytotoxicity to target cells compared to free PTX. This NP formulation holds great promise to improve breast cancer therapy and potential to deliver other hydrophobic drugs for treating various cancer types.",

Despite their promising results in vitro, HAPs have failed to make a clinical impact. This is largely because tumor hypoxia is located far from blood vessels, making it difficult for HAPs to accumulate in therapeutically sufficient concentrations. Here, a generalized strategy to overcome this barrier by employing macrophages as drug carriers to enhance the penetration and accumulation of HAPs deep in solid tumors is reported. The system leverages the chemotactic and phagocytic abilities of macrophages to improve delivery of nanoparticles encapsulating a model HAP, tirapazamine (TPZ), to the hypoxic regions of solid tumors. A sequence of in vitro assays is used to refine the properties of the system by minimizing carrier cell toxicity while maximizing therapeutic efficacy. It is demonstrated in vivo that the system improves drug accumulation in hypoxic areas of 4T1 breast tumors and slows their growth by itself and in combination with irinotecan. The results provide early evidence that macrophages can significantly improve the transport and efficacy of HAPs by improving their tumor penetration, highlighting a potential strategy to advance them into the clinic.",

Therapeutic antibodies such as Trastuzumab inhibit tumor growth through blockade of HER2 receptors. However, the short lifespan of such therapeutic antibodies necessitates repeat administrations with ensuing cardiac toxicity and development of resistance, while offering no protection against relapse. Cancer vaccines targeting HER2 can overcome these shortcomings of passive immunotherapy by instigating an endogenous and sustained immune response and memory against the cancer antigen. The efficacy of a viral nanoparticle (VNP)‐based cancer vaccine is demonstrated here in activating a potent anti‐HER2 immune response that delays progression of primary tumors as well as metastases and prolongs survival in mice. The results illustrate that the VNP‐based vaccine instigates HER2‐specific antibodies as well as effector and memory T cells, which contributes to the effectiveness of the vaccine. Given the highly aggressive course of HER2 + cancers, inhibition of disease progression by such cancer vaccines could provide a critical window for interventions with other adjuvant therapies. Moreover, the immune memory generated by this viral nanoparticle‐based cancer vaccine could mitigate relapse of the disease.",

Glycosaminoglycans decorate a diverse range of extracellular matrix and cell associated proteoglycans conveying structural organization and physico‐chemical properties to tissues. They play key roles mediating cellular interactions with bioactive growth factors, cytokines, and morphogenetic proteins, and structural fibrillar collagens, cell interactive and extracellular matrix proteoglycans, and glycoproteins which define tissue function. Proteoglycan degradation detrimentally affects tissue functional properties. Therapeutic strategies have been developed to counter these degenerative changes. Neo‐proteoglycans prepared from chondroitin sulfate or hyaluronan and hyaluronan or collagen‐binding peptides emulate the interactive, water imbibing, weight bearing, and surface lubricative properties of native proteoglycans. Many neo‐proteoglycans outperform native proteoglycans in terms of water imbibition, matrix stabilization, and resistance to proteolytic degradation. The biospecificity of recombinant proteoglycans however, provides precise attachment to native target molecules. Visco‐supplements augmented with growth factors/therapeutic cells, hyaluronan, and lubricin (orthobiologicals) have the capacity to lubricate and protect cartilage, control inflammation, and promote cartilage repair and regeneration of early cartilage lesions and may represent a more effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of mild to moderate OA and deserve further study.",

Optimizing drug combinations can be challenging when dealing with limited resources, such as patient tumor biopsies. This is due to the difficulty in screening large numbers of drug‐dose combinations as well as heterogenous patient responses. Developing a data‐driven approach that can efficiently and accurately determine the best drug combinations with the smallest number of experiments will have broad applications in both drug development as well as precision medicine. Quadratic Phenotypic Optimization Platform (QPOP) is an artificial intelligence (AI) approach that utilizes small experimental drug response datasets to accurately identify globally optimal drug combinations. QPOP exploits orthogonal array composite design (OACD), a combination of two‐level fractional factorial and three‐level orthogonal array components, to generate a minimal set of drug combinations sufficient for second‐order model fitting that is necessary to derive optimal drug combinations. In this study, a more efficient resolution IV OACD is able to derive optimal drug combinations and parabolic response surface maps, despite requiring fewer experimental runs than resolution V. As such, this study provides the framework for a more efficient OACD that can be applied toward AI‐driven drug combination design in patient‐based drug development and precision medicine.",

Most protein‐based therapeutics require parenteral administration, due to their intrinsic vulnerability and susceptibility to enzyme‐mediated degradation. Among the routes of administration, the transdermal delivery system has been regarded as a promising technique to deliver protein therapeutics, offering the advantages of painless administration, ease of termination, and avoidance of first‐pass metabolism. However, unlike small molecular drugs, protein therapeutics have limited skin penetration, due to their macromolecular and hydrophilic properties. Both cheimcal adjuvants (CAs)‐treatment methods and physical penetration enhancer methods (PPEs) have been utilized to increase skin permeability for protein therapeutics. The CAs, which include chemical penetration enhancers and nanocarriers, permit the protein therapeutics to transport easily into the skin, by modifying the stratum corneum (SC) or fabricating their stable formulation. The PPEs, including iontophoresis, electroporation, and ultrasound, can improve the skin permeability of the therapeutic agent through disrupting the SC. In this review, the techniques of both chemical and physical enhancement methods are introduced and an overview of the latest approaches to the transdermal delivery of protein therapeutics is provided.",

In addition to the satisfactory MN technology design for various application prospects, safety issues during MN use are increasingly an important consideration. This review aims to gather data from published literature regarding safety evaluations on MNs in relation to pain, skin irritation, in vivo degradation, as well as storage stability. By analyzing the existing testing methods and the safety performance of MNs, the description of MN safety is updated as painless, minimally invasive, and stable during storage. However, the development of MNs that can degrade in a human body should be addressed to accelerate clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bioactive, small molecular compounds from a variety of plants and organisms have tremendous potential for use as treatments for cancer, microbial infections, inflammatory diseases, and other medical conditions. There have also been attempts to use naturally occurring bioactive compounds as delivery carriers. Such bioactive, natural compound‐derived nanocarriers are expected to have better biocompatibility than synthetic material‐derived drug‐delivery systems and also exhibit intrinsic therapeutic efficacy. Despite these expectations, however, research on the topic is limited and thus has been the subject of very few reviews. Here, the authors describe carriers derived from four typical naturally occurring bioactive compounds—curcumin, resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (an active ingredient in green tea), and bilirubin—that have been used for biomedical applications. In this review, the pros and cons of each bioactive small molecular compound and processes for synthesizing and preparing these compound‐derived delivery carriers are discussed. A number of examples that show the potential of these delivery carriers as disease treatments are considered, and their future prospects for biomedical applications are assessed. Nanoparticles that simply encapsulate or encase such bioactive compounds are outside the scope of this review and thus are not considered.",

    "abstract": "Abstract RNA interference (RNAi) offers the potential to selectively silence disease‐related genes in defined cell subsets. Translation into the clinical routine is, however, still hampered by the lack of efficient carrier systems for therapeutic siRNA, endosomal entrapment presenting a major hurdle. A promising siRNA delivery system has previously been developed on the base of polyethylenimine (PEI) and the targeting ligand transferrin (Tf) to specifically reach activated T cells in the lung. In the present work, the focus is on optimizing Tf‐PEI polyplexes for gene knockdown in primary activated T cells by improving their endosomal escape properties. Blending of the conjugate with membrane lytic melittin significantly enhanced endosomal release and thereby cytoplasmic delivery, while maintaining selective T cell targeting abilities and overall cell tolerability. The gathered data furthermore demonstrate that melittin addition also distinctly improves several other essential particle characteristics, such as siRNA encapsulation efficiency and stability in lung lining fluids. In conclusion, this results in a novel upgraded siRNA delivery system that is not only able to specifically deliver its payload to the desired target cells via receptor‐mediated endocytosis, but also shows enhanced release from endosomal vesicles in order to initiate RNAi in the cytoplasm.",

Here, a fucoidan/poly-lysine-functionalized layer-by-layer ginger-derived lipid vector (LbL-GDLV) was designed to target P-selectin (overexpressed by endothelial cells) and deliver a loaded drug into vascularized colon cancer. In vitro, LbL-GDLVs selectively bound to P-selectin, and the degradation of the fucoidan outer layer in a milieu similar to the cancer microenvironment resulted in rapid attachment of the cancer cell and internalization of the remaining positively charged poly-lysine coated-GDLVs. Upon enzymolysis of the poly-lysine layer inside the cancer cell, the GDLV core released loaded doxorubicin (Dox) which had the expected effects. In vivo bio-distribution studies showed that intravenously injected LbL-GDLVs exhibited enhanced accumulation at the vascularized tumor site (~ 4.4-fold higher than control vesicles), presumably due to P-selectin-mediated targeting plus the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). In two animal models used to screen anti-cancer efficacy (Luc-HT-29 and HCT-116 xenografts), Dox-loaded LbL-GDLVs (LbL-GDLVs/Dox) significantly inhibited tumor growth and demonstrated much better therapeutic efficiency than free Dox. More importantly, LbL-GDLVs/Dox exhibited excellent biocompatibility, and LbL-GDLVs encapsulation largely reduced the cardiotoxicity of free Dox and avoided the notorious drug resistance of colon cells against free Dox. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of our newly designed and highly biocompatible plant-derived LbL nanoparticles and their precise colon cancer drug delivery function.",

In this article, the advantages (i.e., improved charging effect and enhanced proteolytic stability) of star‐shaped poly( l ‐lysine)s (PLLs) over their linear analogs are extensively explored by the methods of computational simulation and experiments. A series of PEI‐ g ‐PLL with a hyperbranched polyethylenimine (PEI) core and PLL peripheral chains are designed as a class of versatile molecular scaffold for the development of star‐shaped antimicrobial peptides. Computational simulations and zeta‐potential measurements reveal that the change in PLL conformation from linear to star‐shaped significantly increases the cationic charge density, allowing enhanced binding affinity toward the bacterial membrane. The minimum inhibitory concentration and killing kinetics measurements demonstrate that PEI‐ g ‐PLLs exhibit higher antimicrobial activity and bactericidal efficiency in vitro than the linear PLL counterparts. The absence of hydrophobic segments in PEI‐ g ‐PLLs weakens the nonspecific interactions with eukaryotic cells and offers remarkable selectivity, as evidenced by their negligible hemolytic activity. Furthermore, PEI‐ g ‐PLLs demonstrate enhanced proteolytic stability and unprecedented antimicrobial activity in vivo. PEI‐ g ‐PLLs, with their high antimicrobial activity, enormous selectivity, and remarkable proteolytic stability, represent a new series of potent antimicrobial peptides to treat drug‐resistant infections.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, direct and effective intracellular delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids for homology‐directed repair is achieved by functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs). The functionalized MSNs (Cy5.5‐MSNs‐NLS) are synthesized by in situ labeling of a fluorescent dye (Cy5.5) and surface conjugation of nuclear localization sequence (NLS, PKKKRKV), showing a high loading efficiency (50%) toward the plasmids (PXN cutdown plasmid: GFP‐Cas9‐paxillin_gRNA and repair plasmid: AICSDP‐1: PXN‐EGFP). Subsequently, a polymeric coating of the poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride) (PDDA) is electrostatically deposited onto the plasmid‐loaded Cy5.5‐MSNs‐NLS by microfluidic nanoprecipitation. The coating layer offers effective protection against the denaturation of plasmids by EcoRV restriction enzymes, and is shown to prevent premature release. Moreover, owing to the positive charge and pH‐responsive disaggregation of PDDA, enhanced cellular internalization (16 h) and endosomal escape (4 h) of the nanocarrier are observed. After escape of nanocarrier system into the cytoplasm, the NLS on the surface of MSNs facilitates nuclear transport of the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids, achieving successful GFP‐tag knock‐in of the PXN genomic sequence in U2OS cells. This intracellular delivery system thus offers an attractive method to overcome physiological barriers for CRISPR/Cas9 delivery, showing considerable promise for paxillin‐associated focal adhesion and signaling regulator investigation.",

Severe visual loss in DR is primarily due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy, characterized by pathologic preretinal angiogenesis driven by retinal ischemia. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the retina, have emerged as a potentially important regulator of pathologic retinal angiogenesis. Corticosteroids including triamcinolone acetonide (TA), known for their antiangiogenic effects, are used in treating retinal diseases, but their use is significantly limited by side effects including cataracts and glaucoma. Generation-4 hydroxyl polyamidoamine dendrimer nanoparticles are utilized to deliver TA to activated microglia in the ischemic retina in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Following intravitreal injection, dendrimer-conjugated TA (D-TA) exhibits selective localization and sustained retention in activated microglia in disease-associated areas of the retina. D-TA, but not free TA, suppresses inflammatory cytokine production, microglial activation, and preretinal neovascularization in OIR. In addition, D-TA, but not free TA, ameliorates OIR-induced neuroretinal and visual dysfunction. These results indicate that activated microglia are a promising therapeutic target for retinal angiogenesis and neuroprotection in ischemic retinal diseases. Furthermore, dendrimer-based targeted therapy and specifically D-TA constitute a promising treatment approach for DR, offering increased and sustained drug efficacy with reduced side effects.",

Here, a brand‐new strategy for achieving tumor deep penetration is developed by exploiting the cellular recycling transferrin (Tf). Specifically, a new type of nanosonosensitizer self‐assembled from Tf and organic sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX is first designed, which exhibits expected biosafety, stability, and ultrasound‐activated cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production capability ensuring in vivo administration. More importantly, the nanosonosensitizers inherit the unique transferrin receptor (TfR)‐mediated endocytosis and exocytosis behaviors of Tf, enabling specific binding to TfR‐overexpressed tumor cells and thereafter TfR‐mediated sequential intercellular delivery of nanosonosensitizers. Consequently, tumor deep delivery of sonosensitizers is achieved in TfR‐overexpressed HeLa tumors, which is considerably beneficial for desired tumor‐suppression effect with ROS‐mediated sonodynamic therapy protocol. Such a TfR‐mediated sequential intercellular relay strategy offers an innovative concept for the deep delivery of nanomedicines in tumors.",

Among an enormous number of polymers developed for therapeutic purposes, pyridyl disulfide (PD) group functionalized polymers have attracted increasing attention over the past decades. The highly reactive PD group could be replaced by almost any thiol‐containing groups, leading to the production of a disulfide bond. More importantly, the redox‐sensitive disulfide bond generated from the replacement can be exploited to develop stimuli‐responsive polymer therapeutics which will protect the loaded cargoes from premature leakage, while programmably releasing them in response to endogenous redox stimuli such as glutathione. Herein, the development of PD‐incorporated polymers and summarized PD‐based monomers that have been synthesized to prepare various functional polymeric architectures are reviewed. Moreover, this review also discusses the difference between polymers with PD as repeating pendants or terminal groups and emphasizes on the diverse promising applications of these polymers as nanotherapeutic platforms in the biomedical field.",

A combination of additive manufacturing and salt leaching techniques to produce scaffolds of medical grade poly(ε‐caprolactone) that has macroscale pores of 300–500 µm and intrastrut microscale pores of 5–35 µm in size is used. The chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin (DOX), is loaded onto the porous scaffolds by soaking with the loading efficacy as high as 90%. The DOX‐loaded scaffolds display a biphasic monotonic drug release up to 28 d, and a dose‐dependent chemotherapeutic effect against breast cancer cells, MDA‐MB‐231. Compared to one‐time intravenous injection of 40 µg DOX, implantation of scaffolds containing only 2 or 8 µg of DOX after tumor removal in mice shows lower cardio‐cytotoxicity, reduced local cancer recurrence, and is correlated with a lower metastasis progression in lungs, liver, and spleen in 28 d of treatment.

NMJ functionality is tested by recording myotube contractions while stimulating MNs by field electrodes and a set of clinically relevant parameters is defined to characterize the NMJ function. Three ALS lines are analyzed, two with SOD1 mutations and one with an FUS mutation. The ALS‐MNs reproduce pathological phenotypes, including increased axonal varicosities, reduced axonal branching and elongation, and increased excitability. These MNs form functional NMJs with wild type muscle, but with significant deficits in NMJ quantity, fidelity, and fatigue index. Furthermore, treatment with the Deanna protocol is found to correct the NMJ deficits in all the ALS mutant lines tested. Quantitative analysis also reveals the variations inherent in each mutant line.

Herein, a hydrogel‐based multifunctional dressing weaved by drug‐loaded magnetothermally responsive [Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 ‐interpenetrating polymer network (IPN)] microfibers and human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell‐laden microfibers is developed. Magnetothermally responsive microfibers, as smart constructs, can release antibiotics on‐demand to prevent infection, due to the magnetothermal heating effect of the embedded magnetic nanoparticles and the thermoresponsive property of the IPN hydrogels. Furthermore, stem cell‐laden microfibers markedly promote cell proliferation and tissue remodeling, with improved re‐epithelization, granulation tissue formation, and collagen deposition at the wound site. Hydrogel‐based microfibers have the additional ability of absorbing exudate, providing a moist environment, and retaining the therapeutic cells. Therefore, functional microfibers and textiles significantly accelerate the healing process. An advanced dressing for wound healing, incorporating controlled drug delivery and stem cell‐based therapy is developed. Furthermore, the results of the present study reveal the potential of multifunctional dressings in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

Herein, the design, synthesis, and evaluation of small molecule inhibitors with naphthalene monoimide scaffold to ameliorate in vitro and in vivo amyloid induced neurotoxicity are reported. The detailed studies establish TGR63 as the lead candidate to rescue neuronal cells from amyloid toxicity. The in silico studies show the disruption of salt bridges and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions within Aβ42 fibrils by the interaction of TGR63, causing destabilization of Aβ42 assembly. Remarkably, TGR63 treatment shows a significant reduction in cortical and hippocampal amyloid burden in the progressive stages of APP/PS1 AD mice brain. Various behavioral tests demonstrate rescued cognitive deficits. The excellent biocompatibility, blood–brain barrier permeability, and therapeutic efficacy to reduce the amyloid burden make TGR63 a promising candidate for the treatment of AD.",

While the nanocarrier surface chemistry has long been the focus of protein corona formation, the influence of nanostructure has remained unclear despite established influences on biodistribution, clearance, and inflammation. Here, combinations of nanocarrier morphology and surface chemistry are engineered to i) achieve compositionally distinct protein coatings in human blood and ii) control protein‐mediated interactions with the immune system. A library of nine PEGylated nanocarriers differing in their combination of morphology (spheres, vesicles, and cylinders) and surface chemistry (methoxy, hydroxyl, and phosphate) are synthesized to represent properties of therapeutic and biomimetic delivery vehicles. Analysis by quantitative label‐free proteomic techniques reveal that specific surface chemistry and morphology combinations adsorb unique protein signatures from human blood, resulting in differential complement activation and elicitation of distinct proinflammatory cytokine responses. Furthermore, nanocarrier morphology is shown to primarily influence uptake and clearance by human monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. This comprehensive analysis provides mechanistic insights into rational design choices that impact the immunological identity of nanocarriers in human blood, which can be leveraged to engineer drug delivery vehicles for precision medicine and immunotherapy.",

Vaccine candidates were developed using bacteriophage Qβ-based virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying antigens of PCKS9, ApoB, and CETP, respectively. Vaccine candidate mixtures were formulated as slow-release PLGA:VLP implants using hot-melt extrusion.

The reduction in PCSK9 and ApoB levels in plasma, inhibition of CETP (in vitro), and total plasma cholesterol decrease was achieved. All-together, we present a platform technology for a single-dose multi-target vaccination platform targeting cholesterol checkpoint proteins.",

    "abstract": "Abstract From recombinant insulin to monoclonal antibodies, proteins have become essential drugs in the therapeutic arsenal and respond to a broad spectrum of diseases. While commercially available proteins have an extracellular activity, intracellular targets can be a powerful alternative to treat many pathologies such as cancers and immune disorders, but also infectious diseases. Nevertheless, to enter the cell and reach the target organelle or molecule, therapeutic proteins have to face numerous barriers (internalization, endosomal escape, and cytoplasm trafficking). In view of the fragile nature and high heterogeneity of proteins in terms of size, charge, and hydrophilic/lipophilic profile, the development of an efficient cytoplasm delivery system remains a long‐standing challenge. The discovery of several gene editing tools (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR), involving caspase 9 (Cas9) protein (CRISPRCas9), transcription activator‐like effectors (TALEs) or other zinc‐finger proteins (ZFPs)) has particularly boosted this research field in the last decade. Among delivery systems that can be used in vivo, some synthetic nanovectors offer interesting opportunities. In this review, the authors describe the most recent progress in the development of inorganic (silica, gold, phosphate, metal–organic framework, carbon nanoparticles) as well as organic (polymer, lipid) nanoparticles, both applied to intracellular protein delivery.",

They show great potential as delivery systems for improving the therapeutic index of drugs, via biophysical targeting and more recently with more precision targeting. They are also important for intracellular delivery of nucleic acid based drugs. The same frameworks that have been successfully applied to improve the small molecule drug development can be adopted. This approach together with improved pathophysiological disease knowledge and critical developability considerations, imperative given the size and complexity of polymer therapeutics, provides a structured framework that should improve their clinical translation and exploit their functionality and potential. Progress in understanding the right target, gaining the right tissue and cell exposure, ensuring the right safety, selecting the right patient population is discussed. The right commercial considerations are outlined and the need for a multi‐disciplinary approach is emphasized. Crucial developability factors together with scientific and technical advancements to enable pharmaceutical development of a quality robust product are addressed. It is argued that by applying this structured approach to their design and development, polymer therapeutics will continue to grow and develop as important next generation medicines.",

In the present study, a novel 2D graphdiyne (GDY)‐based nanoplatform is utilized for the delivery of minocycline (MN), one drug candidate for PD treatment. These GDY nanosheets are prepared by sonication and exhibit excellent photothermal (PT) conversion ability (≈32%) without obvious toxicity in vitro. MN can be loaded onto GDY by π–π stacking (≈90%) and near infrared (NIR) irradiation is able to trigger the release of more than 30% of the payload. The BBB permeability of GDY is confirmed in both cellular and animal models. The behavioral defects of PD mice can be corrected after the PT and chemical synergistic treatment performed by GDY, with the dopaminergic neuron counting restored to normal level. Nanosheets‐mediated PT treatment exhibits comparable therapeutic effects to that of L‐DOPA, a commercialized PD drug. No obvious damage to major organs or circulation system is detected and physiological parameters remain stable during the behavioral study. This GDY‐based delivery system can serve as a promising platform for loading chemical drugs targeting neurodegenerative disorders.",

AD is characterized by fluctuating and recurrent eczematous lesions and intense itch, being associated with high physical and psychological impact leading to disturbed sleep quality, anxiety, and depression. Most of the patients have mild to moderate forms of atopic dermatitis and topical therapies (emollients, corticosteroids, calcineurin, and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors) are the mainstay of therapy for these patients. Hydrogels are explored in the field of cutaneous application and have proven to be a good solution as a topical vehicle for atopic dermatitis, due to their high water content, improved drug delivery, responsiveness to stimuli and versatility in terms of preparation and drug‐loading, representing a good alternative to regular ointments or creams. This review highlights some of the atopic dermatitis characteristics and the use of hydrogels in the management of this disease. An outline of hydrogels as drug delivery systems for bioactive compounds is discussed, as well as their major advantages and drawbacks when compared to other galenic forms, and also an overview of clinical trials and patents engaged in the past 20 years.",

We developed and tested a novel suicide gene and therapeutic microRNAs (miRs) combination therapy against lung metastases in vivo in mouse models after intranasal delivery using nontoxic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) formulated to carry these molecular therapeutics. We used AuNPs coated with chitosan-β-cyclodextrin (CS-CD) and functionalized with a urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) peptide to carry triple cancer suicide genes (thymidine kinase-p53-nitroreductase: TK-p53-NTR) plus therapeutic miRNAs (antimiR-21, antimiR-10b and miR-100). We synthesized three AuNPs: 20nm nanodots (AuND), and 20nm or 50nm nanostars (AuNS), then surface coated these with CS-CD using a microfluidic-optimized method. We sequentially coated the resulting positively charged AuNP-CS-CD core with synthetic miRNAs followed by TK-p53-NTR via electrostatic interactions, and added uPA peptide through CD-adamantane host-guest chemistry. A comparison of transfection efficiencies for different AuNPs showed that the 50nm AuNS allowed ∼4.16-fold higher gene transfection than other NPs. The intranasal delivery of uPA-AuNS-TK-p53-NTR-microRNAs NPs (pAuNS@TK-p53-NTR-miRs) in mice predominantly accumulated in lungs and facilitated ganciclovir and CB1954 prodrug-mediated gene therapy against TNBC lung metastases.

In the context of smart wound dressing, besides imparting anti‐infective characteristics in a nonconventional fashion, it is also essential to imbibe multifunctional attributes like excessive biofluid drainage, easy‐to‐peel, optimal gas permeation, etc., for which appropriate material design is a prime requisite. In this work, poly(ε‐caprolactone) (PCL)− an FDA approved biocompatible polyester− is chosen for imparting antimicrobial properties by surface derivatization with molecularly‐dispersed ionic silver over quaternary ammonium moieties through a facile room temperate and organic solvent‐free approach. To render the other characteristics mentioned above, two different systems comprising PCL with varying porosity, namely, electrospun fibers and polyester‐coated cotton gauze, are developed. The dressing materials are thoroughly characterized and assessed for their structural, surface chemical, morphological, wettability, antibacterial, and peel strength properties as a function of surface derivatization steps. The bactericidal performance of the quaternary ammonium‐functionalized surfaces has enhanced manifold (≈7–10) after derivatizing with ionic silver. The in vivo efficacy study employing the dressing materials reveals ionic silver derivatized electrospun fibers as the most promising candidate, followed by cotton gauze‐coated with 5% PCL.",

So far, single‐drug loaded nanoparticles are developed to target macrophages. Nevertheless, macrophage dysregulation can induce multiple conditions, i.e., inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, the simultaneous codelivery of a small molecule drug and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) for gene silencing may be beneficial to modulate macrophage dysfunction. Herein, hybrid lipid–polymer nanoparticles (LPNs) coloaded with both budesonide and enhanced green fluorescence protein siRNA (eGFP‐siRNA) as model anti‐inflammatory small molecule drug and siRNA, respectively, are developed by an optimized microfluidics method. Specifically, a poly(lactic‐ co ‐glycolic acid) core is coated by a lipid shell, and LPNs with size homogeneity and colloidal stability are obtained. Both payloads are loaded efficiently, and a controlled release is achieved. Additionally, LPNs are nontoxic in murine RAW 264.7 cells and human THP‐1 cells and are efficiently taken up by these cells. Finally, the transfection efficiency of dual‐loaded LPNs is high at low LPNs doses, thus proving the suitability of this nanosystem for gene silencing. Overall, the optimized LPNs are a suitable nanoplatform for the dual drug delivery to macrophages for the treatment of complex conditions requiring dual therapeutic approaches.",

Still, the translation of such nanomedicines into clinics is not straightforward owing to their preclinical screening in simplistic models, that do not mimic the complexity and heterogeneity of the CRC microenvironment. Herein, the development of a multicellular spheroid of CRC as an advanced preclinical model of CRC capable of screening the antiangiogenic potential of novel nanomedicines is proposed. For that, a quadruple co‐culture is established through the combination of HCT116 cells, human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HPMEC), fibroblasts, and macrophages. It is demonstrated that the developed model displays intrinsic CRC features, such as the organization of cells, expression of tumor microenvironment, extracellular matrix, and the formation of a necrotic core. Moreover, the model is shown to be composed mostly of HCT116 (93%), followed by hypoxia‐inducible factor (3%), HPMEC (3%), and macrophages (1%). Gellan gum/chitosan nanoparticles encapsulating BVZ exhibit superior antiangiogenic properties when compared to free BVZ. Overall, the developed nanoparticles can further be explored as a promising approach in CRC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract mRNA vaccines have long been recognized for their ability to induce robust immune responses. The discovery that mRNA vaccines may also contribute to antitumor immunity has made them a promising therapeutic approach against cancer. Recent advances in understanding of immune system are precious in developing therapeutic strategies that target pathways involved in tumor survival and progression, leading to the most reliable therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment history. Among all traditional cancer treatments, cancer immunotherapies are less toxic and more effective, even in advanced or recurrent stages of cancer. Recent advancements in genomics and machine learning algorithms give new insight into vaccine development. mRNA vaccines are designed to interfere with stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes pathways, activating more CD8+ T‐cells involved in destroying tumor cells and inhibiting tumor growth. A stronger immune response can be achieved by incorporating immunological adjuvants alongside mRNA. Nonformulated or vehicle‐based mRNA vaccines, when combined with adjuvants, efficiently express tumor antigens through antigen‐presenting cells and stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. Codelivery with additional immunotherapeutic agents, such as checkpoint inhibitors, further enhances the efficacy of mRNA vaccines. This article focuses on the current clinical approaches and challenges to consider when developing mRNA‐based vaccine technology for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The paucity of targeted therapies for triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) causes patients with this aggressive disease to suffer a poor clinical prognosis. A promising target for therapeutic intervention is the Wnt signaling pathway, which is activated in TNBC cells when extracellular Wnt ligands bind overexpressed Frizzled7 (FZD7) transmembrane receptors. This stabilizes intracellular β‐catenin proteins that in turn promote transcription of oncogenes that drive tumor growth and metastasis. To suppress Wnt signaling in TNBC cells, this work develops therapeutic nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized with FZD7 antibodies and β‐catenin small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The antibodies enable TNBC cell specific binding and inhibit Wnt signaling by locking FZD7 receptors in a ligand unresponsive state, while the siRNAs suppress β‐catenin through RNA interference. Compared to NPs coated with antibodies or siRNAs individually, NPs coated with both agents more potently reduce the expression of several Wnt related genes in TNBC cells, leading to greater inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and spheroid formation. In two murine models of metastatic TNBC, the dual antibody/siRNA nanocarriers outperformed controls in terms of inhibiting tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence. These findings demonstrate suppressing Wnt signaling at both the receptor and mRNA levels via antibody/siRNA nanocarriers is a promising approach to combat TNBC.",

This aggravates when delivering hydrophobic drugs, often requiring incorporation of drugs to nanoparticles and use of mucoadhesive systems. This paper aimed to develop an antifungal chitosan (CHI)‐based film loading itraconazole (ITZ) nanocrystals (NCs) with precisely controlled surface charge for enhanced mucoadhesion. Cationic and anionic ITZ NCs are prepared using wet media milling with mean particle sizes and zeta potentials of 226.9 ± 1.4 nm and 234.0 ± 2.90 nm, and +15.4 ± 2.8 mV and −16.2 ± 1.3 mV, for the cationic and anionic NCs, respectively. Cationic ITZ‐NCs exhibits a higher affinity to mucin particles. NCs‐loaded films showed stronger mechanical properties and adhesiveness compared with ITZ powder‐loaded films. Physicochemical analysis reveals that crystalline properties of the ITZ are preserved, with no drug‐excipients interaction. A significantly higher amount of ITZ mucosal deposition is obtained from films containing NCs (1360.23 ± 718.73 µg cm −2 ) compared with that from films containing ITZ powder (58.83 ± 37.45 µg cm −2 ). This work demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring the NCs surface, with the resultant systems showing potential for the management of fungal infections in mucosal tissues.",

Herein, microneedles are designed based on eutectic solvent gels (eutectogels) as transdermal carriers for hydrophobic APIs. A natural deep eutectic solvent (NADES) is combined to enhance the solubility of the hydrophobic APIs within the GelMA/PEGDA matrix for mechanical strength and sustained release from the resulting eutectogels microneedles (EU‐MNs). Using docetaxel, 5‐fluorouracil, and curcumin as hydrophobic APIs models, the superior drug‐loading capacity of the EU‐MNs is demonstrated. In vitro experiments revealed that the EU‐MNs provided a sustained release of distinct hydrophobic APIs over 4 days. Additionally, by properly adjusting the concentration and type of APIs, these microneedle patches do not exhibit cytotoxic effects on fibroblasts cell line (NIH/3T3), underscoring their potential for safe and effective transdermal drug delivery. These findings highlight the potential of EU‐MNs as versatile, eco‐friendly transdermal vehicles for large amounts of hydrophobic APIs, leading to more effective treatments for these drugs.",

However, the optimal amount of GC for coating and the specific mechanisms by which it facilitates PLGA endocytosis remain unclear. In this study, PLGA‐NPs are prepared using either single‐ or double‐emulsion methods and coated with varying amounts of GC. The results confirmed that GC‐coated PLGA NPs are internalized via both clathrin‐mediated and caveolae‐mediated endocytosis, whereas uncoated NPs relied on only clathrin‐mediated endocytosis in Caco‐2 and HT‐29 cells. The optimized GC‐coated PLGA‐NPs formulation is further modified by layering alginate to enhance the oral delivery of insulin. In subsequent in vivo studies, the GC and alginate‐coated PLGA NPs demonstrated stability and prolonged efficacy, achieving approximately a 50% reduction in blood glucose levels at 6 h post‐administration in streptozotocin‐induced diabetic mice. These findings provide compelling evidence of the optimal coating amount and molecular mechanisms for GC in the PLGA oral platform, underscoring the feasibility and commercial potential of oral delivery platform based on the optimized GC‐ and alginate‐coated PLGA NPs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Peripheral nerve injury is a common injury that impacts the quality of life of the affected individuals. Peripheral nerve is known to regenerate itself when the defect is small. The mechanism of nerve repair and regeneration is complex and is related to neuroimmunomodulation where there is crosstalk between Schwann cells and macrophages which respond to the injury of smaller dimensions immediately. However, regeneration of large defects requires the use of grafts. 3D bioprinting is one such promising technology with which bioengineered nerve conduits can be reproduced for the repair of injured peripheral nerves. This review outlines the mechanism of repair and regeneration of peripheral nerves and provides a detailed description of the latest developments in the fabrication of bioengineered nerve conduits. Further, various bioprinting techniques and bioinks that have been established in vitro for the fabrication of nerve conduits are discussed. In addition, this article aims to look at the in vivo applications of the bioprinted nerve conduits with respect to different types of peripheral nerve models. The challenges and future perspectives involved in fabricating bioprinted functional nerve conduits have also been discussed.",

GBM has an average survival of 12–18 months despite aggressive treatments, such as maximal safe resection, radiation, and chemotherapy with temozolomide. GBM is always associated with high incidences of treatment resistance and recurrence, which is largely driven by glioma stem cells and presents significant therapeutic challenges. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is the most significant obstacle in treating GBM since it restricts the delivery of therapeutic agents to the tumor site. Recent advancements in nanotechnology offer promising alternatives to overcome such restrictions, enabling targeted drug delivery and significantly reducing systemic toxicity. Additionally, discussing various types of nanoparticles such as liposomes, lipid‐based, dendrimers, polymeric, and metallic nanoparticles that have shown promise in preclinical models for GBM treatment has become pertinent. These nanoparticles can attach to glioblastoma cells using antigens and membrane receptors for site‐directed drug targeting. Furthermore, nanoparticles have the potential to cross the BBB, enhancing drug delivery and minimizing off‐target effects. This review explores the latest advancements in nanoparticle‐based therapies and their potential to revolutionize GBM treatment, particularly through the precise targeting and controlled release of therapeutic agents within the tumor microenvironment.",

As such, alternatives to standard antibiotic therapies have been highly sought after to address difficult‐to‐treat biofilm‐associated infections. A biomaterial‐based approach using the innate functions of mucins is hypothesized to modulate bacterial surface attachment and virulence can provide a new therapeutic strategy against biofilms. Based on the testing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, it is found that synthetic mucus biomaterials can inhibit biofilm formation and significantly reduce the thickness of mature biofilms. In addition, if synthetic mucus biomaterials can work synergistically with DNase and/or α‐amylase for enhanced biofilm dispersal is evaluated. Combination treatment with these antibiofilm agents and synthetic mucus biomaterials resulted in up to 2 log reductions in the viability of mature P. aeruginosa biofilms. Overall, this work provides a new bio‐inspired, combinatorial approach to address biofilms and antibiotic‐resistant bacterial infections.",

Traditional models, such as 2D cultures and animal studies, often fail to capture the TME's dynamic, multicellular, and spatially complex nature, limiting their predictive power for therapeutic outcomes. To overcome these limitations, this review examines innovative microphysiological systems (MPS) that enhance the understanding of tumor‐immune interactions and pave the way for more effective immunotherapeutic strategies. First the complex features of the TME and its key players are detailed, elaborating on their dynamic interplay with tumors. Importantly, it is highlighted how these components contribute to treatment resistance, offering crucial insights into therapeutic failures. Then, state‐of‐the‐art 3D in vitro organ‐on‐chip (OoC) models are presented that faithfully recapitulate the TME, incorporating patient‐derived tumors to enhance clinical relevance. These advanced systems not only overcome the limitations of traditional animal models and 2D cultures but also provide a robust platform for assessing and improving immunotherapeutic regimens. By bridging the gap between bench and bedside, MPS promises to accelerate the development of novel, more effective immunotherapies for solid tumors, potentially transforming cancer treatment in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During pregnancy, the maternal immune system adapts to balance tolerance of the semi‐allogenic fetus while protecting the fetus from pathogens. Dysregulated immune activity at the maternal–fetal interface contributes to pregnancy complications, such as recurrent pregnancy loss and preeclampsia. Compared to healthy placentas, preeclamptic placentas exhibit increased pro‐inflammatory signaling, including a predominance of inflammatory macrophages, leading to impaired tissue remodeling and restricted blood flow. However, the precise mechanisms driving this immune imbalance remain poorly understood, in part due to the lack of tools to probe individual pathways. Here, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are used to deliver cytokine‐encoded mRNA to placental cells, called trophoblasts, enabling local immunomodulation. LNP‐mediated delivery of IL‐4 and IL‐13 mRNA induced cytokine secretion by trophoblasts, leading to polarization of primary human monocytes toward anti‐inflammatory phenotypes. Notably, lowering the mRNA dose increased expression of alternatively‐activated macrophage markers, revealing an inverse relationship between dose and polarization status. Intravenous injection of LNPs in pregnant mice achieves placental secretion of IL‐4 and IL‐13 with minimal changes to pro‐inflammatory cytokines in the serum. These findings establish LNPs as tools for local immunomodulation in the placenta, offering a strategy to study and treat immune dysfunction in pregnancy and in other inflammatory conditions.",

However, their pleiotropic effects, short half‐life, and poor biodistribution have limited their clinical translation. Advances in protein engineering have enabled the design of modified cytokines with enhanced stability, receptor selectivity, and tissue‐targeting capabilities, offering new therapeutic opportunities for modulating immune activity and promoting tissue healing. Many of these engineering approaches have been pioneered in cancer immunotherapy, where cytokines are often designed to sustain inflammation and enhance cytotoxic immune responses. In contrast, regenerative medicine usually requires immune resolution, necessitating a distinct and sometimes opposite application of cytokine engineering strategies. This review explores the latest advancements in cytokine engineering for regenerative applications, focusing on strategies to enhance cytokine stability, modulate receptor affinity, improve targeting, and regulate endogenous cytokine signaling. Numerous approaches, highlighting how targeted immune modulation can enhance tissue healing while minimizing fibrosis and chronic inflammation, are discussed. These advances hold great promise for treating chronic wounds, fibrotic diseases, and tissue injuries with limited regenerative capacity, paving the way for precise, effective, and clinically translatable cytokine therapeutics.

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional monolayer cell cultures are routinely utilized for preclinical cancer drug screening, but the results often do not translate well when drugs are tested in vivo. To address this limitation, a biocompatible chitosan-PEG hydrogel (CSPG gel) was synthesized to create a gel that can be easily dispensed into 96-well plates at room temperature and neutral pH. The stiffness of this gel was tailored to be within the stiffness range of human glioblastoma tissue to promote the formation of tumor spheroids. Differences in cell morphology, proliferation rate, and dose-dependent drug cytotoxicity were compared among cell spheroids grown on CSPG gels, cells in monolayer culture on tissue culture polystyrene and cells cultured on Matrigel. Tumor spheroids on CSPG gels displayed statistically significantly greater resistance to chemotherapeutics than in the conditions where cells did not form spheroids. Gene expression analysis suggests that resistance of cells on CSPG gels to the therapy may be partially attributed to upregulation of ATP-binding cassette transporters and downregulation of DNA mismatch repair genes, which was stimulated by spheroid formation. These findings suggest CSPG gel generates tumor spheroids that better reflect the malignant behavior of GBM and provides a cost-effective substrate for preclinical, high-throughput screening of potential cancer therapeutics.",

One of the directions in the search for cure for these and other amyloid diseases focuses on the inhibition of protein aggregation by small molecules, short peptides, and nanoparticles. Nanoparticles seem to be particularly promising therapeutic candidates since they are stable, can be made biocompatible, and might readily traverse physiological barriers such as the blood–brain barrier. Here, a novel class of chiral amyloid inhibitors consisting of carbon quantum dots (C‐dots) that are synthesized from either d ‐ or l‐ lysine (Lys) as the sole carbonaceous building block are reported. The interactions of the chiral lys‐C‐dots with the amyloidogenic determinant of the prion peptide (PrP, 106–126 sequence) in the presence of lipid bilayers appears to be highly stereoselective, with the l ‐Lys‐C‐dots being superior to the d ‐Lys‐C‐dots in their ability to modulate the structural transformations and aggregation of PrP(106–126). This work provides new insights into chiral effects upon amyloid peptides and opens the way to developing chiral carbon‐based nanostructures as advanced amyloid inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Widespread application of cytokine‐based therapies is hampered by severe toxic side effects, resulting from off‐target (immune) cell stimulation. This emphasizes the need for more precise targeting of cytokines to immune cells. While cytokines are generally active as soluble proteins, it is demonstrated here that synthetic mimics of immune cells based on polyisocyanopeptides (PICs), called synthetic dendritic cells (sDCs) can efficiently present immobilized cytokines to T cells, when targeted by anti‐CD3 antibodies. Anti‐CD3/IL‐2‐functionalized PICs induce strong T cell activation and proliferation, when compared to PICs functionalized with interleukin‐2 (IL‐2) alone. In contrast to the semi‐flexible PICs, immobilization of IL‐2 on a rigid micro‐sized scaffold results in significant loss of IL‐2 activity, signifying the importance of molecular flexibility on the PIC polymers to maintain function. Similarly, anti‐CD3/IFNα‐functionalized PICs support long‐term proliferation of T cells. Interferon‐α containing sDCs additionally promote the development of cytotoxic effector functions of T cells with limited upregulation of the inhibitory immune checkpoint PD‐1. This high cytolytic activity and low PD‐1 expression are essential to maintain effective anti‐cancer activity. Together, these results demonstrate that PICs form unique nano‐sized scaffolds that efficiently present immobilized cytokines to T cells, thus creating a powerful tool to improve cytokine‐based immunotherapies without concomitant off‐target toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains highly lethal. This partially stems from the presence of brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs), a highly plastic cellular subpopulation that is resistant to current therapies. In addition to resistance, the blood–brain barrier limits the penetration of most drugs into GBMs. To effectively deliver a BTIC‐specific inhibitor to brain tumors, a multicomponent nanoparticle, termed Fe@MSN, which contains a mesoporous silica shell and an iron oxide core, is developed. Fibronectin‐targeting ligands direct the nanoparticle to the near‐perivascular areas of GBM. After Fe@MSN particles are deposited in the tumor, an external low‐power radiofrequency (RF) field triggers rapid drug release due to mechanical tumbling of the particle resulting in penetration of high amounts of drug across the blood–brain tumor interface and widespread drug delivery into the GBM. The nanoparticle is loaded with the drug 1400W, which is a potent inhibitor of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). It is shown that iNOS is preferentially expressed in BTICs and is required for their maintenance. Using the 1400W‐loaded Fe@MSN and RF‐triggered release, in vivo studies indicate that the treatment disrupts the BTIC population in hypoxic niches, suppresses tumor growth and significantly increases survival in BTIC‐derived GBM xenografts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Trichomonas vaginalis is responsible for the most common non‐viral sexually transmitted disease worldwide. Standard treatment is with oral metronidazole or tinidazole, but resistance is emerging and adverse effects can be problematic. Topical treatment offers potential benefits for increasing local drug concentrations while reducing systemic exposure, but none are currently approved for trichomoniasis. The anti‐rheumatic drug, auranofin (AF), was recently discovered to have significant trichomonacidal activity, but has a long plasma half‐life and significant adverse effects. Here, this drug is used as a model to develop a novel topical formulation composed of AF‐loaded nanoparticles (NP) embedded in a thermoresponsive hydrogel for intravaginal administration. The AF‐NP composite gel shows sustained drug release for at least 12 h, and underwent sol–gel transition with increased viscoelasticity within a minute. Intravaginal administration in mice shows excellent NP retention for &gt;6 h and markedly increases local AF levels, but reduces plasma and liver levels compared to oral treatment with a much higher dose. Furthermore, intravaginal AF‐NP gel greatly outperforms oral AF in eliminating vaginal trichomonad infection in mice, while causing no systemic or local toxicity. These results show the potential of the AF‐NP hydrogel formulation for effective topical therapy of vaginal infections.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As a typical characteristic of solid tumors, hypoxia diminishes the efficiency of oxygen‐dependent cancer therapy, such as type II photodynamic therapy (PDT). Tumor‐targeted multifunctional nanomedicine that overcomes hypoxic resistance is therefore highly desirable. The authors present an efficient strategy against hypoxic tumors based on aptamer‐targeting and 808 nm laser‐triggered three phototherapeutic pathways, which uses a hybrid with carbon dots, IR820 dye, and anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor aptamer as a novel nanomedicine (CD‐IR820‐Aptamer) with simultaneous type I PDT (PDT I), type II PDT (PDT II), and photothermal therapy (PTT) under single 808 nm laser irradiation. The obtained CD‐IR820‐Aptamer exhibits tumor‐targeting and mitochondrial accumulation. Direct phosphorescent spectra and photothermal imaging analyses demonstrates that CD‐IR820‐Aptamer can elicit O 2 •− , • OH (for PDT I), 1 O 2 (for PDT II), and heat (for PTT) via three pathways triggered by single 808 nm laser irradiation. The oxygen‐independent production of • OH and heat ensures the applicability of CD‐IR820‐Aptamer under hypoxic conditions. Through three phototherapeutic pathways are simultaneously triggered by 808 nm laser irradiation, the proposed nanohybrid displayed high efficiency for treating solid tumors. This work provides a basis for constructing new types of photoactive nanomedicines with targeting ability and improved therapeutic efficiency under hypoxic conditions that can be further used for cancer therapy in clinical trials.",

It is well established that the β‐amyloid peptide (Aβ) species existing in several forms, such as soluble monomers, oligomers, and insoluble aggregates, play an essential role in the pathophysiology of AD. Therefore, much effort has been made to specifically detect Aβ species and to inhibit Aβ aggregation for the treatment of AD. In this review, an overview of recent advances in detecting different Aβ forms mainly containing Aβ aggregates, Aβ oligomers, and Aβ protofibrils is provided. In addition, photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) are considered to be promising modalities for the treatment of AD because of the minimal invasiveness and high spatial selectivity. Herein, the strategies of inhibiting Aβ aggregation and dissociating Aβ aggregates using PDT, PTT, and Aβ inhibitors for the treatment of AD are summarized.",

In the treatment of hypoxic human solid tumors, many conventional therapeutic approaches (e.g., oxygen‐dependent photodynamic therapy, anticancer drug‐based chemotherapy or X‐ray induced radiotherapy) become considerably less effective or ineffective. In recent years, various strategies have been explored to deliver or generate oxygen inside solid tumors to overcome tumorous hypoxia and show promising evidence to improve the antitumor efficiency. In this review, the extrinsic regulation of tumor hypoxia via nanomaterial delivery is discussed followed by a summary of the mechanisms through which the modulated tumor hypoxic microenvironment improves therapeutic efficacy.

Creating a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐MOF NP platform as a basis for a theranostic drug delivery system is considered an auspicious approach, as MRI is a routinely used clinical method allowing real‐time imaging. So far clinically approved MRI contrast agents (CAs) have not been investigated systematically for the visualization of loading and release from MOF NPs. Here, loading and release of six clinically approved CAs from the MOF MIL‐100(Fe) are investigated in a clinical MRI setting. Standard procedures, beginning with sample preparation up to MRI methods, are established for that purpose. Results are reproduced and verified by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP‐AES) and thiocyanate testing. The macrocyclic CA gadoterate meglumine is identified as the best CA candidate for labeling MIL‐100(Fe). The CA is successfully loaded after 1 h, and also effectively released within the first hour. The MR‐active CA and iron residuals in supernatants are differentiable based on MRI only and concentrations can be successfully calculated. The presented systematic approach suggests procedures and MRI‐methodology that can be used as blueprint strategy when labeling porous NPs with clinically approved MRI CAs.",

Carbon nanomaterials have been widely exploited in various fields from electronics and materials science to nanomedicine. The studies on their effect on the immune system have revealed that they possess intrinsic anti‐inflammatory properties, reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and modulating immune cell maturation. In addition, their large specific surface area associated with high biocompatibility allows their use as carriers for the delivery of anti‐inflammatory agents. They can also contribute to the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases as biosensors for low‐limit detection and quantification of inflammation‐related biomarkers in body fluids and tissues allowing to monitor the concentration of drugs in urine and guide personalized drug usage. Finally, they are used as adsorbents for blood plasma purification in the clinical treatment of sepsis through efficient removal of certain cytokines. This review focuses on the intrinsic anti‐inflammatory properties of carbon nanomaterials. An overview is provided on their use as carriers of anti‐inflammatory drugs, as biosensors, and for blood purification in the context of inflammatory diseases. The potential of carbon nanomaterials for clinical translation is also critically discussed.",

Several therapeutic strategies have been applied to treat bone tumors, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical resection. However, these strategies have intrinsic drawbacks, such as the serious side effects of chemotherapy or the necessary reconstructive surgery of surgical resection. To help develop more satisfactory bone tumor treatment strategies, biomaterial scaffolds have been proposed. Biomaterial scaffolds are often applied for repairing bone defects after surgical resection due to their biocompatibility, osteoinductivity, and osteoconductivity as well as excellent physicochemical properties. Simultaneously, the function of bone tumor therapy offers biomaterial scaffolds to eliminate residual tumor cells, thus avoiding tumor recurrence. This review summarizes recent advances in biomaterial scaffolds which are combined with chemotherapy or hyperthermia therapy for treating bone tumors and further bone regeneration. Moreover, the progress in synergistic therapy of bone tumors based on biomaterial scaffolds is also discussed. This review aims to inspire researchers to develop novel fabrication or functionalization strategies for constructing multifunctional biomaterial scaffolds with anti‐tumor properties.",

Moreover, using magnetic resonance imaging, MCG PAMs show enhanced targeting and successful detection of plaques in diseased mice in vivo and act as contrast agents for molecular imaging. Through the collagenase-cleaving peptide sequence of collagen [VPMS-MRGG], MCG PAMs can compete for collagenases that degrade the fibrous cap of plaques, providing therapy.

The suggested solution is to exploit 3D inkjet printing freedoms. A reactive prodrug is used that can polymerize into drug‐attached macromolecules during 3D printing and by tuning the hydrophilicity, hydrolysis can be facilitated or hindered, which in turn controls drug release. To demonstrate this approach, ibuprofen is attached to 2‐hydroxyethyl acrylate through a cleavable ester bond, formulated for inkjet 3D printing, and then printed to produce a solid dosage form. This allows a much higher loading than is usually achievable—in this case up to 58 wt%. Of equal importance, the 3D inkjet printing freedoms mean that the drug delivery device is highly tuneable: by selection of spacer monomers to adjust the hydrophilicity; through geometry; by spatially varying the components. Consequently, hierarchical release systems are created bespoke, from the molecular to macro. This approach represents a new paradigm for the formulation of printable inks for drug‐loaded medical devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oral administration of nucleic acids, such as small interfering RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides, represents a potent modality for treating many gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. However, their use is limited due to a lack of carriers that can effectively mediate their delivery through GI barriers, including gastric enzymes and mucus membranes. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are an emerging delivery system that can protect nucleic acids from degradation and mediate their intracellular delivery, but few studies have evaluated their ability to overcome oral delivery barriers. Here, a high‐throughput in vivo screening platform is developed to accelerate the design of LNPs for oral delivery of nucleic acids. A library of LNPs that encapsulate DNA barcodes (b‐DNAs) was pooled and orally administered to mice, and their delivery was quantified by deep sequencing. Sequencing results indicated that increases in the molar ratio of cholesterol to lipid‐anchored polyethylene glycol conjugate in LNPs enhanced their GI content retention and that the presence of an LNP carrier improved b‐DNA delivery to GI tissues, relative to the delivery of naked b‐DNA. Collectively, these results suggest that high‐throughput in vivo screening can accelerate the discovery of LNPs for GI tract nucleic acid delivery upon oral administration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Therapeutic antibodies, due to their high affinity and specificity toward their biological targets, may demonstrate reduced harmful side effects compared with traditional drug moieties. While most of the as‐yet clinically approved antibody therapeutics have targeted extracellular or membrane‐bound domains, the ability to target intracellular antigens with antibodies opens up tremendous opportunities for imaging, diagnosis, and therapeutic applications. Generally, delivery concerns have limited the ability to target intracellular antigens, as many antibodies cannot easily cross the cell membrane due to their size and surface chemistry. Delivery platforms have been explored to address this issue, including physical methods, fusion protein/peptide techniques, and synthetic carrier‐based systems. This review summarizes the progress of carrier‐based intracellular antibody delivery systems employing synthetic lipids, polymers, and inorganic nanomaterials. Antibodies targeting various epitopes have been loaded through adsorption, conjugation, or physical encapsulation strategies. Successful intracellular deliveries have been demonstrated largely through fluorescence imaging using dye‐labeled antibody cargos. Specific synthetic delivery platforms have great potential for ex vivo and in vivo therapeutic applications. Challenges and opportunities are further discussed for material scientists to explore in this research area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The poly (lactic‐ co ‐glycolic acid) nanoparticle (PLGA NP) has been widely used in the biomedical field. However, it is insensitive to degradation upon laser irradiation, resulting in a limited increase in drug release, which compromises the therapeutic efficacy. To actively promote drug release, the biphasic α‐tocopheryl succinate (TPGS) functionalized PLGA NPs (PTNPs) are developed by introducing TPGS into the aqueous and organic phase to generate pores in the PLGA core during preparation. Paclitaxel and indocyanine green are encapsulated in the PTNPs to realize chemo‐photothermal combined therapy, and PTNPs are delivered through dissolving microneedles (DMNs) for local treatment in melanoma. PTNPs show enhanced drug release and improved cytotoxicity due to their greater ability in inhibiting cell microtubule depolymerization. In vivo tumor suppression investigation and ki‐67 immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue further show the superiority of PTNPs loaded DMNs against tumor growth, and photothermal therapy synergistically enhances the chemotherapeutic effect of PTNPs. Moreover, the living imaging of mice demonstrates that the drug is successfully retained in the tumor tissue to avoid it entering into the circulation and producing adverse effects. Therefore, the PTNPs loaded DMNs show a favorable prospect in the treatment of superficial tumor.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria constitutes a key threat to global health. Infections caused by multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria are particularly challenging to treat due to the ability of pathogens to prevent antibiotic penetration inside the bacterial membrane. Antibiotic therapy is further rendered ineffective due to biofilm formation where the protective Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS) matrix limits the diffusion of antibiotics inside the biofilm. We hypothesized that careful engineering of chemical groups on polymer scaffolds could enable polymers to penetrate the barriers of Gram-negative bacterial membrane and biofilm matrix. Here, we present the use of engineered polymeric nanoparticles in combination with antibiotics for synergistic antimicrobial therapy. These polymeric nanoparticles enhance the accumulation of antibiotics inside Gram-negative bacteria and biofilm matrix, resulting in increased potency of antibiotics in combination therapy. Sub-lethal concentrations of engineered polymeric nanoparticles reduce the antibiotic dosage by 32-fold to treat MDR bacteria and biofilms. Tailoring of chemical groups on polymers demonstrate a strong-structure activity relationship in generating additive and synergistic combinations with antibiotics. This study demonstrates the ability of polymeric nanoparticles to 'rejuvenate' antibiotics rendered ineffective by resistant bacteria and provides a rationale to design novel compounds to achieve effective antimicrobial combination therapies.",

However, most targeted anticancer molecular platforms are constructed in liquid phase with multi‐step synthesis and complex purification. This work describes a general and modular solid‐phase synthesis strategy to engineer novel targeted anticancer therapeutics based on aptamer‐functionalized small molecule drugs (ASMD). Specifically, anticancer agent Combretastatin A4 (CA4) is transformed into a phosphoramidite module, and then is incorporated into aptamer Sgc8c via automated DNA synthesis technique to obtain intracellular phosphatase‐responsive Sgc8c‐CA4 conjugate (SC). In the rational design, SC retains excellent recognition ability and cytotoxicity against its target colorectal cancer cells. SC shows more efficient and safer therapy than CA4 both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the cellular events of SC are systematically visualized when they encounter the target cancer cells. The visualizing mechanism gives a clear picture of the anticancer function of targeted therapeutics against cancer cells. These results may pave the way for utilizing molecularly engineered ASMDs to develop more novel targeted cancer therapeutics for the treatment of different cancer types.",

The results demonstrate that the nanoliposomes significantly decrease the cell viability of breast cancer cells compared to combination treatment with the free drugs. Furthermore, the chemotherapeutics coloaded nanoliposomes dramatically decrease the tumor growth and improve survival times, while combination treatment with Gemzar and Taxol has a modest effect on cancer progression. Moreover, pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrates that nanoliposomes increase the half‐life of gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel 6.3‐fold and 1.7‐fold, respectively.

In contrast, nanocarrier based therapeutics provide a broad range of opportunities due to their ability to encapsulate substances with different aqueous solubility, transport distinct types of cargo, target therapeutics specifically to the deceased organ, cell, or cellular organelle limiting adverse side effects and increasing the efficacy of therapy. Moreover, many nanotherapeutics can be delivered by inhalation locally to the lungs avoiding systemic circulation. In addition, nanoscale based delivery systems can be multifunctional, simultaneously carrying out several tasks including diagnostics, treatment and suppression of cellular resistance to the treatment. Nanoscale delivery systems improve the clinical efficacy of conventional therapeutics allowing new approaches for the treatment of respiratory diseases which are difficult to treat or possess intrinsic or acquired resistance to treatment.

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite the high medical need for oral peptide delivery, instability in the gastrointestinal tract and low mucosal permeation still impede this preferred route of administration. Herein, a liposomal nanocarrier combining two self‐reliant strategies to overcome these delivery barriers is reported. This approach enables the design of a nanocarrier system with synergistic properties: tetraether lipids derived from archaea are incorporated into liposomes to provide the particles with the stability required to traverse the stomach. When the surface of the resulting inert particles is modified with cell‐penetrating peptides, mucosal permeation can be achieved. The designed nanocarrier is proven effective by the high mucosal uptake of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin in Ussing chamber studies. Efficacy in vivo is demonstrated in naïve rats, where a highly increased oral bioavailability is obtained for vancomycin, a drug known to be minimally absorbed. In contrast, administration of liposomes with single modification (tetraether lipids) leads to a substantially lower bioavailability. Therapeutic efficacy is proven by the antimicrobial activity of vancomycin in a Galleria mellonella and a systemic infection mouse model. The high oral bioavailability in absence of cytotoxic effects demonstrates that this nanocarrier delivery strategy might boost the oral application of macromolecular drugs in general.",

In this study, a d ‐peptide library is screened to identify a small 8‐amino acid dg‐ B can‐ T argeting P eptide (BTP) candidate, called BTP‐7 that binds dg‐Bcan with high affinity and specificity. BTP‐7 is preferentially internalized by dg‐Bcan‐expressing patient‐derived GBM cells. To demonstrate GBM targeting, BTP‐7 is radiolabeled with 18 F, a radioisotope of fluorine, and increased radiotracer accumulation is found in intracranial GBM established in mice using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. dg‐Bcan is an attractive molecular target for GBM, and BTP‐7 represents a promising lead candidate for further development into novel imaging agents and targeted therapeutics.",

However, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment always hinders the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Herein, ferrocene‐containing polymersome nanoreactors are engineered by co‐loading glucose oxidase (GOD) and STING agonist, symmetry‐linked amidobenzimidazole (DiABZI), for enhanced STING activation and combination chemodynamic‐immunotherapy. After intravenous injection, the polymersomes can accumulate in tumor tissues. The tumor acidity‐triggered polymersome membrane permeability allows the entrance of tumoral glucose and oxygen for H 2 O 2 production by GOD, which is further transformed into hydroxyl radicals (•OH) under the catalysis of ferrocene moieties. Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) based on •OH can induce efficient cellular apoptosis and release of fragmented DNA and tumor‐associated antigens to promote endogenous STING activation and reverse immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Simultaneously, pH‐responsive release of DiABZI activates STING pathway to elicit antitumor immune responses. Therefore, DiABZI and CDT synergistically enhance the antitumor immunity via combination chemodynamic‐immunotherapy. The primary tumors are completely ablated and the growth of distant tumors that are established after treatment is also suppressed efficiently. The polymersome nanoreactor‐mediated chemodynamic‐immunotherapy represents a promising treatment strategy toward primary solid and metastatic tumors.",

Thus, there is an increasing need for new alopecia drugs and alternative delivery systems for future alopecia treatment. Researchers have developed dissolving microneedle (DMN), a transdermal drug delivery system, which can be used with minimal invasion. However, DMN has limited application for the alopecia treatment owing to its unsuccessful implantation on the hairy scalp. Here, it is suggested that TOP‐M119 (M119), a novel drug acting as a vasodilator in the scalp, and M119‐loaded DMN with a specially designed shape can be used for the alopecia treatment.

Enhanced hair follicle targeting drug delivery and superior alopecia treatment efficacy of specially designed shaped DMN and M119 has been demonstrated through in vitro and ex vivo studies. Moreover, M119‐loaded DMN system shows enhanced in vivo efficacy in mouse skin and through expression markers related to hair growth, such as β‐catenin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, MECA 32, and versican.",

Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from various parts of the placenta (PMSCs) are established as a rich, allogeneic, and sustainable source of MSCs in comparison to bone marrow MSCs (BM‐MSCs). PMSCs can be banked postnatally for future autologous and allogeneic applications in the treatment of diseases. PMSCs can be categorized as an intermediary between BM‐MSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as it is devoid of adverse aspects associated with the employment of ESCs accompanied with primitive and enhanced properties in comparison to BM‐MSCs. PMSCs are employed in the treatment of various diseases including cancer, neurological, bone, and cardiovascular disorders. This utility of PMSCs is due to its superior inherent characteristics in comparison to BM‐MSCs, which renders PMSCs more attractive for clinical translation. Herein, this review describes the superior inherent characteristics of PMSCS in contrast to BM‐MSCs including accessibility, higher expansion abilities, enhanced immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive properties, ability to differentiate beyond mesodermal lineages, pathotropic and regenerative abilities, lower immunogenicity, and anti‐cancer strategy that are correlated to its therapeutic application in the treatment of various diseases including corona virus infection started in 2019 in recent preclinical and preclinical studies.",

Emerging at the interface between bioadhesives and regenerative medicine, a new generation of regenerative bioadhesives is created to possess dual functions of seamless tissue adhesion and effective tissue repair. This bioadhesive innovation has wide clinical applications, ranging from wound management to the regeneration of musculoskeletal tissues such as tendons and intervertebral discs. This perspective covers the design principles of regenerative bioadhesives in considering both mechanical and biological elements. Case studies of regenerative bioadhesives for load‐bearing organs such as skin, tendon, and intervertebral discs are presented here.

    "abstract": "Abstract Fungal keratitis/mycotic keratitis or keratomycosis, is characterized by the inflammation of underlying stroma of corneal epithelium due to fungal infection. Multi‐drug resistance and subsequent recurrence of infection limits the clinical outcomes of anti‐fungal agents such as Amphotericin B and Natamycin; and therefore, demands research on newer anti‐microbial strategies. In this study, the authors have synthesized and characterized ethosomes (IAEs) encapsulating a NIR dye, Indocyanine green (ICG), and an anti‐fungal drug, Amphotericin B, for a combinational photothermal therapy of fungal keratitis. The in vitro anti‐fungal efficacy of the IAEs is validated against Candida albicans by colony formation assay, calcofluor staining, and SEM analysis. The results indicate that the IAEs, upon NIR irradiation, displays a synergistic anti‐fungal efficacy. The IAEs are highly biocompatible when tested using a human corneal epithelial (HCE) cell line model (in vitro) and a Draize eye test model in rabbits (in vivo). Further, it is observed that the IAEs,upon NIR laser exposure significantly eliminate the fungal infection in rat model of occular fungal keratitis. The research indicates that the IAEs nano‐formulation exhibits a synergistic and sustained anti‐fungal effect paving its way for further translation from bench to bedside for the efficient management of fungal keratitis.",

The features for neuropathological identification of PD include α‐synuclein (α‐syn) protein aggregates, oxidative stress, metal ion dyshomeostasis, neurotransmitter deficiencies, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Currently, no definite treatment paradigm can completely cure PD patients, which is increasing globally over the past few decades. The existence of the blood‐brain barrier (BBB) restricts the conventional treatment processes and makes the therapeutic delivery to the brain a bit more challenging. Therefore, developing new useful medicines for improving brain distribution is vital to overcome BBB and helping the early diagnosis and treatment of PD. In this review, the current limitations of conventional drugs are highlighted and the development of new medicines to overcome such limitations is covered. This work will provide insight into the direction for designing novel efficient nanomedicines for the early diagnosis and treatment of PD.",

But despite new optimism, no Food and Drug Administration approved product exists for the treatment of orthopedic disorders. Non‐viral gene delivery is a promising alternative to recombinant protein administration and viral gene transduction for orthopedic tissue engineering. When applied using appropriately designed systems, it enables temporal control of the overexpression of therapeutic genes, leading to local production of regulatory factors at physiologically relevant levels. Incorporating genetic material into 3D scaffold biomaterials, that is, gene activated scaffolds or hydrogels, presents a particular opportunity to utilize non‐viral gene therapy for in situ transfection of host cells and the regeneration of damaged tissues and organs. But controlled non‐viral gene delivery for musculoskeletal regeneration depends on a multifactorial design in which the choice of gene delivery method, therapeutic gene, and supportive biomaterial play a central role for the success of this strategy. This paper reviews the different modalities of non‐viral gene delivery used for the repair of bone and cartilage, and explores the current challenges and opportunities for the engineering of functional orthopedic tissues using gene activated scaffolds.",

Compared with the traditional visible/first near‐infrared (NIR‐I, 650–900 nm) light‐emitting optical probe, a nanoprobe capable of generating the second near‐infrared (NIR‐II, 1000–1700 nm) emission is emerging as the next‐generation optical imaging technique with high‐sensitivity, and high spatial/time resolution owing to its remarkably reduced photon scattering losses. However, a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform incorporated with the new advanced NIR‐II optical imaging and PTT has not yet been explored. Herein, a general strategy for designing theranostic nanoplatforms by integrating NIR‐II optical bioimaging with photothermal functions via in situ growth of Cu 2− x S quantum dots on the lanthanide nanorods is demonstrated. The as‐prepared NaLnF 4 :Yb/Er@Cu 2− x S hybrid nanoprobes with a core‐satellite structure present excellent NIR‐II emission centered at 1525 nm, highly stable photothermal effects and good biocompatibility. These designed theranostic nanoprobes are utilized for NIR‐II optical imaging, small tumor detection (5 mm in diameter), and PTT. More importantly, non‐invasive brain vessel visualization with high spatial resolution (44.2 µm) through scalp and skull without craniotomy is demonstrated. Therefore, these results pave the way to designing new multifunction theranostic nanoplatforms for highly sensitive NIR‐II optical‐guided tumor detection, non‐invasive blood vessel imaging, and PTT.",

We recently discovered a PCBP2 siRNA that reverses fibrogenesis in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which are the key players in liver fibrogenesis. However, targeted delivery of siRNAs to HSCs still remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a new strategy to fabricate a multicomponent nanocomplex using siRNA/PNA hybrid instead of chemically conjugated siRNA, thus increasing the scalability and feasibility of the siRNA nanocomplex for animal studies. We modified the nanocomplex with an insulin growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R)-specific peptide, which specifically binds to activated HSCs. The siRNA nanocomplex shows a controllable size and high serum stability. The nanocomplex also demonstrates high cellular uptake in activated HSCs in vitro and in vivo. Anti-fibrotic activity of the siRNA nanocomplex was evaluated in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis. Treatment with the PCBP2 siRNA nanocomplex significantly inhibits the mRNA expressions of PCBP2 and type I collagen in fibrotic liver. Histology study revealed that the siRNA nanocomplex efficiently reduces the protein level of type I collagen and reverses liver fibrosis. Our data suggest that the nanocomplex efficiently delivers the siRNA to fibrotic liver and produces a potent anti-fibrotic effect.",

This study presents a new approach for the treatment of GBM patients using a 3D‐printed hydrogel‐based mesh (GlioMesh), loaded with TMZ‐releasing microparticles, that is capable of delivering TMZ over several weeks at the tumor site. Given the challenges associated with loading the amphiphilic TMZ in polymeric substrates, a novel encapsulation strategy is developed using an oil‐in‐oil emulsion method that improves the encapsulation efficiencies of TMZ in poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic acid) (PLGA) from &lt;7% to about 61%. The cytotoxic effects of GlioMesh on GBM cells are evaluated in vitro by investigating the resultant levels of DNA break, autophagic activity, and mitochondrial damage. It is shown that GlioMesh produces significantly higher susceptibility to the drug in comparison with free TMZ by maintaining the level of autophagic activity and inducing larger degrees of mitochondrial damage. Sustained delivery of TMZ holds promise for suppressing chemoresistance to TMZ that is normally developed in GBM cells in systemic administration of the drug due to the induction of autophagy.",

In this review, the authors summarize and discuss recent progress in the rational design and fabrication of multifunctional mesoporous silica‐based composite nanoprobes for versatile bioimaging applications. Four kinds of methodologies for the fabrication of these mesoporous silica‐based nanoprobes are discussed, including encapsulating functional nanoparticles within a mesoporous silica shell, assembling functional nanoparticles on the surface of MSNs, dispersing nanoparticles into the nanometer‐scale mesopores of MSNs, and doping functional moieties into the framework of MSNs. The applications of mesoporous silica nanoprobes in magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, computed tomography imaging, fluorescence imaging, positron emission computed tomography, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, and even multimodality imaging are discussed in detail. The biosafety of MSN‐based composite nanoplatforms as bioimaging nanoprobes is also highlighted, accompanied by a deep discussion on facing the challenges and future developments for guaranteeing their further potential clinical translation.",

Stem cell‐based therapies have been studied for MI treatment over the last two decades with promising outcomes. Here, the past work in this field is critically reviewed to elucidate the advantages and disadvantages of treating MI using pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) including both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), adult stem cells, and cardiac progenitor cells. Overall, PSCs (particularly iPSCs) have more advantages than the other cells for cardiac regeneration. However, the use of iPSCs is also facing critical challenges, which may be resolved by using biomaterials to engineer stem cells for reduced immunogenicity, improved immobilization/survival in the heart, and increased integration with the host cardiac tissue to eliminate arrhythmia. Biomaterials have also been applied in the derivation of CMs in vitro to increase the efficiency and maturation of cardiac differentiation. Collectively, a lot has been learned from the past failures of simply injecting intact stem cells or their derivatives in vivo for treating MI, and bioengineering stem cells with biomaterials may be a valuable strategy for advancing stem cell therapy towards its widespread application for MI treatment in the clinic.",

Nanoscale drug delivery systems, including graphene oxide (GO) flakes, may circumvent some of these issues bypassing biological barriers, delivering multiple cargoes to impact several pathways simultaneously, or targeting the immune compartment. Here, the interactions of GO flakes with in vitro (U‐87 MG three‐dimensional spheroids, without stromal or immune compartments) and in vivo (U‐87 MG orthotopic xenograft) models of glioblastoma are investigated. In vitro, GO flakes translocated deeply into the spheroids with little internalization in tumor cells. In vivo, intracranially administered GO also show extensive distribution throughout the tumor and demonstrate no impact on tumor growth and progression for the duration of the study. Internalization within tumor cells is also scarce, with the majority of flakes preferentially taken up by microglia/macrophages. The results indicate that GO flakes could offer deep and homogenous distribution throughout glioblastoma tumors and a means to target their myeloid compartment. Further studies are warranted to investigate the mechanisms of GO flakes transport within the tumor mass and their capacity to deliver bioactive cargoes but, ultimately, this information could inform the development of immunotherapies against glioblastoma.",

To date, no targeting epitopes or mechanisms have been established in ischemia/reperfusion injury that allow specific molecular targeting for either diagnosis or therapy, a deficiency that contributes to myocardial infarction being the leading cause of mortality and a major contributor to morbidity worldwide. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are locally increased at the site of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Utilizing these as a unique molecular targeting mechanism in developing ROS‐responsive nanoparticles, this study illustrates unique designed ROS‐responsive, self‐assembled fluorescent nanoparticles as tools for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting of tissue that is undergoing ischemia/reperfusion injury. This ROS‐responsive fluorescent nanoprobe has been evaluated in a mouse model of myocardial infarction, applying 1 h of ischemia via temporary ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and measuring fluorescence signals after reperfusion. This study shows highly specific targeting to the ischemic/reperfused myocardium throughout the first 24 h post reperfusion. Overall, this study identifies ROS‐responsive fluorescent nanoparticles as an ideal platform for the localized delivery of imaging agents and novel therapeutics to the infarcted myocardium.",

Here, the authors present for the first‐time, that integrin α6 is overexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and serves as a prognostic predictor and a cancer stem cell (CSC) biomarker. An NPC‐targeted peptide CRWYDENAC (dubbed RWY) with high specificity and affinity for integrin α6 is identified, and an integrin α6‐targeted nanotherapeutic against NPC is developed by encapsulating a cisplatin prodrug Pt(IV) with RWY‐grafted polymeric nanoparticles (dubbed RWY‐NP/Pt(IV)). The delivery of cisplatin prodrug Pt(IV) by RWY‐NP/Pt(IV) results in an approximately 100‐fold increase in cytotoxicity over free cisplatin, as well as a 5‐fold increase over Scramble‐NP/Pt(IV) control. RWY‐NP/Pt(IV) suppresses NPC tumor growth with an inhibition rate of around 78%, compared with the 44% and 41% achieved by free cisplatin and Scramble‐NP/Pt(IV) treatment. Loss of body weight is observed in free cisplatin treated mice but not in RWY‐NP/Pt(IV) treated mice. Taken together, RWY‐NP/Pt(IV) enhances the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin treatment and reduces deleterious side effects, suggesting the potential application of the integrin α6‐targeted RWY peptide for nanotherapeutics against NPC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nanomedicines have long been expected to significantly enhance cancer treatment. However, their clinical translation is still very limited despite the world's great efforts during the last two decades. One of the reasons is that the transport barriers within tumors restrict their penetration into tumors, with most nanomedicines remaining among the top submicrometer to several micrometers scale. Therefore, there is extensive interest in the field to understand the tumor microenvironment and develop techniques to boost the penetration of nanomedicines in tumors. This review emphasizes the need for smart nanotechnology to fit the changing requirements of nanomedicines for effective drug delivery, particularly the technologies for deep penetration of nanomedicines in tumor tissues, and explores their mechanisms in order to achieve multistage requirement during the applications of nanomedicines in patients. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of current approaches to facilitate the deep penetration of nanomedicines are discussed and possible future avenues for smart nanotechnology are identified.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conventional phototherapies have been thought to destroy the malignant cells through apoptosis or necrosis, shut down tumor microvasculature, and activate the host immune system. Accumulating evidence indicates that photothermal agents stimulate both innate and adaptive arms of host immune systems by i) priming tumor antigen–specific T‐cell responses, ii) attracting lymphocytes into the tumor site, and iii) modulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the salutary effect of traditional phototherapies is hindered by its limited penetration depth in tissues. Recent advances in cancer immunotherapies have significantly transformed the landscape of cancer treatment from conventional phototherapies to most standard cancer therapy regimen. Therefore, phototherapies synergized with immunotherapy, maximize the anticancer efficacy by overcoming immunosuppressive TME and elucidating immune responses outside the irradiation area. This synergism is further strengthened by nanomaterial‐based strategies to form innovative nanocarriers for efficient and simultaneous delivery of photosensitizers and immunomodulators at the desired target. These nanocarriers can improve the accumulation and retention of both photosensitizer and immunomodulators within the target location, thereby enhancing safety and efficacy. Herein, the systematic effects of phototherapies on the immune system are summarized and the ways in which nanomaterial‐based photoimmunotherapy can facilitate the eradication of both primary and metastatic tumors are discussed.",

However, the skin is also a formidable barrier which, while protecting us from physical, chemical, and immunological agents, requires appropriate technology for effective delivery. Today, the most effective administration method for large, lipophobic, and polar molecules continues to be hypodermic injection, which is associated with pain, needle phobia, and stick injury. As an alternative, a range of advanced strategies to overcome the skin barrier have been established over the last few decades including chemical enhancement, sonophoresis, iontophoresis, electroporation, thermal ablation, and mechanical approaches. Encouraged by the advances in nanotechnology, micro‐ and nanosystems have emerged as powerful tools to overcome the skin barrier, enabling significant advances on the existing methods. In particular, microneedle‐ and nanoparticle‐assisted transdermal delivery has gained significant traction and will most likely have a strong impact in the field. In this review, the most recent progress in the field of transdermal delivery based on microneedle and nanoparticle delivery systems is discussed and examples of key therapeutic application are provided.

An HIV patient is traditionally administered the same ART regimen for life, even if his/her viral load has been reduced by several orders of magnitude from the initial viral load. Dose reduction in ART has been clinically explored in a trial‐and‐error manner to reduce side effects and improve ART sustainability. Using artificial intelligence (AI), we have discovered that drugs and doses inputs can be related to viral load reduction through a Parabolic Response Surface (PRS). The AI‐PRS platform can rationally guide a clinically‐actionable approach to identify optimized population‐wide and personalized dosing. In this prospective pilot clinical trial, a combination regimen of tenofovir (TDF), efavirenz (EFV) and lamivudine (3TC) is administered to ten patients. Using AI‐PRS, a 33% reduction in the long‐term TDF maintenance dose (200 mg) is identified compared to standard regimens (300 mg). This regimen keeps the HIV viral load below 40 copies/mL with no relapse during a 144‐week observation period. This study demonstrates that AI‐PRS can potentially serve as a scalable approach to optimize and sustain the long‐term management of HIV as well as a broad spectrum of other indications.",

This triggers metabolic therapy and enhanced photodynamic therapy of malignant tumor via blocking of ATP and the diversion of endogenous oxygen. The nanosystem is synthesized by incorporating the drug resveratrol (RES) into porous coordination polymer PCN‐224 (RES@PCN). After RES@PCN nanoparticles target the tumor site by enhanced penetration and retention (EPR) effects, PCN delivery endows RES@PCN nanoparticles with the ability to target mitochondria. Subsequently, ATP overexpressed in the mitochondria of tumor cell disintegrates the PCN structure by coordination substitution. This also leads to release of entrapped drug RES. As an ATPase inhibitor, RES interferes with the metabolism of the respiratory chain of tumor cell, triggering an ATP‐blocked metabolic therapy. In addition, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration reduces the consumption of endogenous oxygen. The spare oxygen is used as an “oxygen depot” in photodynamic therapy for generation of toxic reactive oxygen species. Taken together, the mitochondria‐driven metabolic interference system successfully achieves synergistic photodynamic and metabolic therapy via a respiratory inhibition‐medicated oxygen diversion and an ATP blockade. This strategy has great potential for cancer treatment.",

In addition to negatively regulating inflammatory T cell function, TIM‐3 is a promising immunotherapy target. Herein, the aim is to develop an immuno‐positron emission tomography (immunoPET) probe for noninvasively characterizing TIM‐3 expression. Flow cytometry is used to detect the expression levels of TIM‐3 in B16F10 cells. RMT3‐23, a rat antimouse TIM‐3‐specific monoclonal antibody, is radiolabeled with 64 Cu and the performance of 64 Cu‐NOTA‐RMT3‐23 is interrogated by immunoPET in murine melanoma models before and after radiation therapies. Biodistribution and immunofluorescent staining studies are carried out after the immunoPET imaging studies. TIM‐3 is negatively expressed in B16F10 cells, and its expression is not induced by radiation therapies. ImmunoPET imaging with 64 Cu‐NOTA‐RMT3‐23 precisely tracks the unique distribution of TIM‐3‐positive lymphocytes in immunocompetent melanoma models, and tumor uptake of the radiotracer is not affected by either single‐dose or fractionated radiation therapies. The 64 Cu‐NOTA‐RMT3‐23 immunoPET imaging results are further mirrored by the immunofluorescent staining studies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of 64 Cu‐NOTA‐RMT3‐23 immunoPET in tracking TIM‐3 and highlight a new opportunity to optimize TIM‐3‐targeted immunotherapies with this novel imaging strategy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Boiling histotripsy (BH) is a completely non‐invasive ultrasonic technique that can be used to mechanically destroy tumor tissues. Studies have shown that BH has biological effects on immune responses, but the mechanisms involved in the induction and enhancement of systemic anti‐tumor immune responses after BH treatment are poorly understood. The present study therefore investigates the anti‐tumor immune responses triggered by BH exposure in vivo. In a syngeneic tumor model, BH treatment results in more dendritic cell maturation and increased intra‐tumoral infiltration of activated CD8 + T cells compared to those observed after thermal high‐intensity focused ultrasound exposure. The results clearly show that tumor antigens and danger signals released after BH exposure can lead to a sufficient anti‐tumor immune response with antigen‐presenting cell activation. In the 4T1 triple‐negative breast cancer model, BH‐induced mechanical ablation further enhances the therapeutic effect of immune checkpoint blockade, indicating a synergistic anti‐tumor immune effect. In conclusion, the results presented in this study suggest that BH is a promising option for boosting anti‐tumor immunity and can be beneficially combined with cancer immunotherapy.",

A well‐designed PDT delivery system to treat cancer can overcome some problems of current PDT such as prolonged photosensitivity and tumor specificity. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is difficult to treat with existing chemotherapy and often requires surgery because it quickly metastasizes throughout the body. Tumor associated macrophages (TAM) are known to be M2‐like macrophages, which are involved in processes of cancer progression, such as angiogenesis, matrix remodeling, and metastases. These roles are brought on by the expression of the CD206 (mannose receptor) on the surface of the macrophage. MOF nanoparticles around 50 nm are synthesized by a solvothermal reaction of Mn(III)‐tetrakis(4‐carboxyphenyl) porphyrin, tetrakis(4‐carboxyphenyl) porphyrin, and ZrOCl 2 . Through postsynthetic modification, Zn(II) is incorporated into the tetrakis(4‐carboxyphenyl) porphyrin sites and potassium maltotrionate is conjugated with the empty coordination sites on the Zr 6 O 4 (OH) 4 clusters.

Herein, 1) the viability of LOXL2 as a drug target for the treatment of metastatic disease through an investigation of its biological actions is determined; 2) the pitfalls of an antibody approach are considered; and 3) the small molecule approaches emerging in the scientific and patent literature are reviewed. This review identifies that LOXL2 is localized and active intracellularly and extracellularly in invasive cancer cells. LOXL2 has been implicated in a number of established signaling pathways involved in tumor progression, further highlighting its appeal as a target in metastatic disease. Previously, limited chemical inhibitors have been developed; however, their selectivity profile for the LOX family has proven controversial. Antibodies, such as simtuzumab, have been developed selectively against LOXL2. Simtuzumab, in particular, progresses into phase II trials but it was ultimately terminated.

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of β‐lactamase inhibitors in combination with β‐lactam antibiotics is an emerging area in drug discovery. This strategy allows the restoration of the therapeutic efficacy of these antibiotics in clinical use against multiresistant bacteria. These pathogens are drug resistant because they express β‐lactamase enzymes, which prevent the antibiotic therapeutic action by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the β‐lactam ring. These enzymes are quite diverse in both their structural architecture and hydrolytic capability, as well as in the mechanism of action. The ever‐increasing emergence of pathogens that are capable of coproducing different types of β‐lactamases has triggered the search for ultrabroad‐spectrum inhibitors capable of deactivating both serine‐ and metallo‐β‐lactamases. A recent breakthrough in this long‐pursued and unmet need is the discovery of bicyclic boronate inhibitors, specifically taniborbactam, VNRX‐7145, and QPX7728, which are currently under clinical development in combination with cefepime, ceftibuten, and QPX2014, respectively. The present article highlights the therapeutic potential of these inhibitors and their spectrum of efficacy is compared with those of other β‐lactam/β‐lactamase inhibitor combinations recently approved by the food and drug administration. The molecular basis of the ultrabroad‐spectrum of activity of boron‐based inhibitors is also discussed, on the basis of the available crystal structures and the results of computational studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Early revascularization is critical to reduce morbidity after myocardial infarction, although reperfusion incites additional oxidative injury. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an antioxidant that scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) but has low endogenous expression and rapid myocardial washout when administered exogenously. This study utilizes a novel nanoparticle carrier to improve exogeneous SOD retention while preserving enzyme function. Its role is assessed in preserving cardiac function after myocardial ischemia‐reperfusion (I/R) injury. Here, nanoparticle‐encapsulated SOD (NP‐SOD) exhibits similar enzyme activity as free SOD, measured by ferricytochrome‐c assay. In an in vitro I/R model, free and NP‐SOD reduce active ROS, preserve mitochondrial integrity, and improve cell viability compared to controls. In a rat in vivo I/R injury model, NP‐encapsulation of fluorescent‐tagged SOD improves intramyocardial retention after direct injection. Intramyocardial NP‐SOD administration in vivo improves left ventricular contractility at 3‐h post‐reperfusion by echocardiography and 4‐weeks by echocardiography and invasive pressure–volume catheter analysis. These findings suggest that NP‐SOD mitigates ROS damage in cardiac I/R injury in vitro and maximizes retention in vivo. NP‐SOD further attenuates acute injury and protects against myocyte loss and chronic adverse ventricular remodeling, demonstrating potential for translating NP‐SOD as a therapy to mitigate myocardial I/R injury.",

    "abstract": "Abstract RNA interference has garnered new hope for many difficult to treat diseases that have been “undruggable” using conventional small molecule drugs or monoclonal antibodies. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has shown great strides in targeting difficult to treat diseases as siRNA therapeutics are able to efficiently silence specific genes throughout the body. This review highlights major barriers in siRNA delivery and how nanoparticles have been used to circumvent these barriers. The authors outline many of the recent promising preclinical successes in siRNA delivery using nanoparticles. Importantly, the review examines current FDA‐approved siRNA therapeutics and provides a comprehensive analysis of current siRNA candidates in clinical trials. Lastly, the authors discuss future challenges and opportunities in this expansive field of research.",

Also, they exhibit a dual action by 1) inbuilt antimicrobial activity preventing infections and 2) promoting regeneration of granulation tissue and re-epithelialization with complete closure of complex wounds.

Blocking the SARS‐CoV‐2‐RBD/ACE2 interaction is, therefore, a potential strategy to inhibit viral infections. Using a novel biopanning strategy, a small anti‐ACE2 peptide is discovered, which shows high affinity and specificity to human ACE2. It blocks not only the SARS‐CoV‐2‐RBD/ACE2 interaction but also the SARS‐CoV‐1‐RBD/ACE2 interaction. Moreover, it inhibits SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in Vero‐E6 cells. The peptide shows negligible cytotoxicity in Vero‐E6 cells and Huh7 cells. In vivo short‐term lung toxicity study also demonstrates a good safety of the peptide after intratracheal administration. The anti‐ACE2 peptide can be potentially used as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for SARS‐CoV‐2 or other ACE2‐mediated viruses. The strategy used in this study also provides a fast‐track platform to discover other antiviral peptides, which will prepare the world for future pandemics.",

Distinct from central and effector memory T cells, T RM cells take up residence in home tissues such as the lung or urogenital tract and are ideally positioned to respond quickly to pathogen encounter. T RM are found to play a role in the immune response against many globally important infectious diseases for which new or improved vaccines are needed, including influenza and tuberculosis. It is also increasingly clear that T RM play a pivotal role in cancer immunity. Thus, vaccines that can generate this memory T cell population are highly desirable. The field of immunoengineering—that is, the application of engineering principles to study the immune system and design new and improved therapies that harness or modulate immune responses—is ideally poised to provide solutions to this need for next‐generation T RM vaccines. This review covers recent developments in vaccine technologies for generating T RM and protecting against infection and cancer, including viral vectors, virus‐like particles, and synthetic and natural biomaterials. In addition, it offers critical insights on the future of engineering vaccines for tissue‐resident memory T cells.",

As a result, engineered approaches using nanomaterials presenting T cell activation signals are a promising alternative due to their ability to be robustly manufactured with precise control over stimulation cues. In this work, we design synthetic APCs that consist of liposomes surface-functionalized with peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC). Synthetic APCs selectively target and activate antigen-specific T cell populations to levels similar to conventional protocols using non-specific αCD3 and αCD28 antibodies without the need for costimulation signals. T cells treated with synthetic APCs produce effector cytokines and demonstrate cytotoxic activity when co-cultured with tumor cells presenting target antigen",

This has prompted the exploration of new approaches, with extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerging as a focal area. EVs are nanosized, cell-derived particles that transport bioactive components (i.e., proteins, DNA, and RNA) between cells, enabling both normal physiological functions and disease progression depending on context. In particular, EVs have been identified as critical mediators of sepsis pathophysiology. However, EVs are also thought to constitute the biologically active component of cell-based therapies and have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory effects in sepsis models. The dual nature of EVs in sepsis is explored here, discussing their endogenous roles and highlighting their therapeutic properties and potential. Related to the latter component, prior studies involving EVs from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and other sources are discussed and emerging producer cells that could play important roles in future EV-based sepsis therapies are identified. Further, how methodologies could impact therapeutic development toward sepsis treatment to enhance and control EV potency is described.",

Intravesical instillation therapy of bladder cancer (BCa) is restricted greatly due to the short residence time and the low penetration ability of therapeutic agents in clinic. Therefore, improving the mucoadhesiveness and penetration of therapeutic agents are crucial factors in treatment of BCa. The development of NIR‐II light triggered photothermal transduction agents for enhanced penetration and photothermal ablation of BCa post‐intravesical instillation has not yet been investigated. Herein, Cu 2‐ x Se biocompatible particles are prepared through a fluorinated chitosan (FCS)‐mediated one‐pot aqueous approach, which possesses enhanced penetrating ability and high photothermal conversion capability for effective NIR‐II photothermal therapy (PTT). Owing to the outstanding transmucosal ability of FCS, FCS capped Cu 2‐ x Se nanoparticles exhibit much better transmucosal and penetration performance than their non‐fluorinated counterparts to significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of NIR‐II PTT to ablate orthotopic bladder tumors. This study presents a promising phototherapy agent based on Cu 2‐ x Se modified with FCS for efficient NIR‐II PTT for BCa treatment post‐intravesical instillation.",

In this study, two subcutaneous xenograft tumor models, that differed substantially in blood vessel density and stiffness, is treated with poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles and nanoparticle‐stabilized microbubbles combined with ultrasound. Improved nanoparticle accumulation and extracellular matrix (ECM) penetration is found. The stiffness and solid stress in the tumors are measured and it is discovered that sonopermeation can reduce the solid stress in both models, with the highest effect in the stiffest tumor model. This suggests that sonopermeation affects not only the blood vessel wall which has been described previously, but also the ECM to reduce solid stress and increase diffusion and transport of nanomedicines.",

As highlighted here, during the process of passing these innovations to the growing market of ureteral stents, one of the biggest challenges is to increase the predictive value of the in vitro assays and, consequently, reduce the number of in vivo tests needed. Thus, recommendations concerning in vitro standard testing of these devices are provided, with focus on medium, flow conditions, and microbiological parameters.

First, a detailed overview on the tumor genesis, progression, and resulting intricate microenvironment is presented. Thereafter, an extensive insight into the current treatments and their evolution throughout time, with a major focus on nanomedicine approaches, are offered to the reader.

    "abstract": "Abstract Vision impairment resulting from chronic eye diseases, such as macular degeneration and glaucoma, severely impacts patients’ quality of life and poses an immense global financial burden. Current standard of care for such diseases includes daily eye drops or frequent intravitreal (ITV) injections, which are burdensome treatment modalities resulting in low patient compliance. There remains a growing need for easily administered long‐acting delivery technologies for prolonging exposure of ocular therapeutics with each administration. Here, this work deploys a supramolecular polymer‐nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel for ITV delivery of the glaucoma drug bimatoprost. PNP hydrogels are shear‐thinning and self‐healing, key properties for injectability, and enable slow release of molecular cargo in vitreous humor (VH) mimics. An in vivo study in New Zealand white rabbits demonstrated intravitreally injected PNP hydrogels form depots that degrade slowly over time, maintaining detectable levels of bimatoprost in the VH up to 8 weeks following injection. Ophthalmic examinations and histopathology identified a mild foreign body response (FBR) to the hydrogel, characterized by rare clusters of foamy macrophages and giant cells associated with minimal, patchy fibroplasia. This work shows that PNP hydrogels exhibit numerous desirable traits for sustained drug delivery and further work will be necessary to optimize tolerability in the eye.",

Polymeric microparticles can overcome many of these issues to provide an improved influenza vaccine platform. Here, an acetalated dextran microparticle platform is used to encapsulate a broadly active influenza COBRA immunogen and the adjuvant cGAMP. Microparticles are fabricated via the highly scalable electrospray method. Mice vaccinated with acetalated dextran microparticles loaded with COBRA and cGAMP produced antibodies with the ability to neutralize antigenically distinct influenza viruses. The microparticles also induced a potent cellular response against the COBRA immunogen. Finally, after storage for 3 months at 40 °C or 6 months at 24 °C, the microparticles produced as strong of an immune response as microparticles stored at −20 °C for the same amount of time. Overall, acetalated dextran microparticles provide a promising platform for a broadly active influenza vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tendon diseases commonly lead to physical disability, exerting a profound impact on the routine of affected patients. These conditions respond poorly to existing treatments, presenting a substantial challenge for orthopedic scientists. Research into clinical translational therapy has yet to yield highly versatile interventions capable of effectively addressing tendon diseases, including tendinopathy. Stem cell‐based therapies have emerged as a promising avenue for modifying the biological milieu through the secretion of regenerative and immunomodulatory factors. The current review provides an overview of the intricate tendon microenvironment, encompassing various tendon stem progenitor cells within distinct tendon sublocations, gene regulation, and pathways pertinent to tendon development, and the pathology of tendon diseases. Subsequently, the advantages of stem cell‐based therapies are discussed that utilize distinct types of autologous and allogeneic stem cells for tendon regeneration at the translational level. Moreover, this review outlines the challenges, gaps, and future innovations to propose a consolidated stem cell‐based therapy to treat tendinopathy. Finally, regenerative soluble therapies, insoluble bio‐active therapies, along with insoluble bio‐active therapies, and implantable 3D scaffolds for tendon tissue engineering are discussed, thereby presenting a pathway toward enhanced tissue regeneration and engineering.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Obesity is a global health crisis, necessitating the development of biomaterial‐based treatments as alternatives to conventional chemical medications with adverse effects. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), nanosized lipid membrane vesicles containing bioactive components, have emerged as promising biomaterials owing to their biocompatibility, biodistribution, and minimal immune response. Although EVs have been extensively studied for anticancer and anti‐inflammatory properties, their potential for obesity therapy remains relatively unexplored. In this study, the therapeutic potential of spinach‐derived EVs (Spinex) against obesity is investigated. Spinex is successfully purified from spinach using size exclusion chromatography. Subsequent assessments reveals that Spinex efficiently penetrate preadipocytes without cytotoxicity. Stability assessments reveals that Spinex is stable under various temperatures and serum conditions, suggesting its suitability for storage and clinical use. In vitro studies on 3T3‐L1 cells demonstrate the ability of Spinex to suppress lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation. In a high‐fat diet‐induced mouse model, oral Spinex administration significantly reduces adipose tissue weight and body weight gain by downregulating key adipogenic transcription factors. Biodistribution analysis reveals that Spinex accumulated predominantly in the liver, with no apparent toxicity to the major organs. Collectively, the findings highlight Spinex as a promising natural biomaterial for combating obesity and pave the way for further clinical investigations.",

Due to its excellent biocompatibility, lipophilicity, and homing properties, EVs have been used as a new generation of drug delivery systems for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. Despite the potential clinical benefits of animal‐derived extracellular vesicles (AEVs), their large‐scale production remains sluggish due to the exorbitant cost of cell culture, challenging quality control measures, and limited production capabilities. This constraint significantly hinders their widespread clinical application. Plant‐derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) share similar functionalities with AEVs, yet they hold several advantages including a wide variety of source materials, cost‐effectiveness, ease of preparation, enhanced safety, more stable physicochemical properties, and notable efficacy. These merits position PEVs as promising contenders with broad potential in the biomedical sector. This review will elucidate the advantages of PEVs, delineating their therapeutic mechanisms in cancer treatment, and explore the prospective applications of engineered PEVs as targeted delivery nano‐system for drugs, microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, and beyond.

Here, chlorine e6 (Ce6) decorated tungsten nitride nanoparticles (WN NPs) with a folic acid (FA) modification are fabricated to produce FA‐WN‐Ce6 (FWC) NPs for enhanced photodynamic therapy against hypoxic tumors. FWC NPs can efficiently accumulate in tumor sites via FA‐mediated specific tumor targeting. With 630 nm laser irradiation, the WN in FWC can act as a photocatalyst for water splitting to provide oxygen (O 2 ), which significantly improves the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation ability of Ce6 in hypoxia and achieves an enhanced PDT effect both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the O 2 produced by FWC NPs can also weaken the hypoxia level in tumor tissue, and thus reduces the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Additionally, no apparent systemic toxicity is observed after the treatment of FWC NPs. Overall, these results indicate the great potential of FWC NPs as safe and effective nanoplatform for both enhanced tumor PDT and against metastasis.",

Glycoconjugates specifically interacting with bacterial lectins have emerged as a new class of materials for targeting bacteria. In this paper, galactosylated plasmonic copper sulfide nanocrystals (Cu 2− x S NCs) are used to target Pseudomonas aeruginosa via galactose–LecA interactions and kill the bacteria by simultaneous photothermal and photodynamic therapy. Galactosylated Cu 2− x S NCs are obtained by functionalizing the nanocrystals with tri‐thiogalactoside glycoclusters. The excellent specificity of galactosylated nanoparticles toward LecA with a LecA‐deficient P. aeruginosa strain as the control is first demonstrated. Afterward, a laser in the near‐infrared II window is used to kill the bacteria, and the critical role of targeted binding in efficient killing of bacteria is highlighted. This approach can be readily generalized to the targeting of other pathogens which have highly specific carbohydrate‐binding lectins.",

Current approaches to incorporate nanoparticles in MSCs rely on nonspecific endocytosis of nanoparticles or their conjugation to the cell surface via endogenous amines and thiols. These methods result in sub‐optimal drug loading, which hinders the widespread application of MSCs as drug carriers. An advanced nanoengineering strategy is reported here that involves generation of MSCs expressing azide functional groups on their surface and conjugation of dibenzyl cyclooctyne‐functionalized nanoparticles to the azide groups using copper‐free click chemistry. This novel strategy significantly improves the payload capacity of MSCs (≈48 pg of paclitaxel (PTX) per cell) relative to that reported previously (&lt;1–20 pg per cell), without affecting their native phenotype. In vivo, the nanoengineered MSCs significantly inhibit tumor growth ( p &lt; 0.05) and improve survival ( p &lt; 0.0001) compared to free or nanoparticle encapsulated PTX and Abraxane in an orthotopic ovarian tumor model. In summary, the nanoengineering strategy reported here allows for improved delivery and anticancer efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic agents using MSCs as drug carriers.",

Unfortunately, a promising class of TLRa based on nucleic acid derivatives is susceptible to degradation by nucleases, cause life‐threatening systemic toxicities, and is difficult to target to specific cell populations or tissues within the body. In this study a library of cationic polymeric nanoparticles (NP) is developed for encapsulation and delivery of the double‐stranded RNA structural mimic, poly(I:C) (pIC), to address these limitations. Using a combinatorial library screening approach, pIC/poly(β‐amino ester) (PBAE) NPs are identified that skew activation resulting in enhanced potency (13‐fold increase in type I interferon [IFN] production) and negligible toxicity. These highly potent adjuvant NPs increase the magnitude, duration, and affinity maturation of antigen‐specific antibodies following vaccination with a model subunit vaccine. This NP platform provides an opportunity to alter the immune response to pIC, creating a potent type I IFN‐producing adjuvant capable of driving stronger humoral responses to immunization and improving affinity maturation more than 14‐fold. This platform can be applied generally to develop more effective vaccines and immunotherapies.",

They exist as linear polysaccharide chains consisting of repeating disaccharide units that can be variably sulfated and carboxylated along their GAG chain length. These ionizable carboxyl and sulfate groups on GAGs create charged interactive motifs that convey cell regulatory properties important in tissue homeostasis and the maintenance of optimal tissue function. GAGs participate in a number of essential physiological processes including coagulation‐fibrinolysis, matrix assembly and stabilization, immune regulation, and the complement system. The high fixed charge density and the counter‐ions of GAGs is central to their role in the hydration of various connective tissues within the body. Charge transfer properties of GAGs make them amenable to electro‐stimulation and offers a potential mechanism for promoting or enhancing cellular tissue repair processes. This review is undertaken to illustrate these properties and to gain a better understanding of how these processes might be manipulated through electro‐stimulation to help improve tissue repair and the recovery of normal function in traumatized tissues. Weight‐bearing and tension‐bearing, collagen‐rich, avascular tissues have intrinsically poor repair properties and represent difficult clinical challenges. Electro‐stimulation represents a novel approach with significant potential in the stimulation of repair in these most intransigent of tissues.",

A previously developed protein nanoparticle-based platform (E2 nanoparticle) delivers cancer antigens to increase antigen-specific tumor responses. While prior work has focussed on prophylactic conditions, the objectives in this study are therapeutic. It is hypothesized that immune checkpoint inhibition, when augmented by antigen delivery using E2 nanoparticles containing CpG oligonucleotide 1826 (CpG) and a glycoprotein 100 (gp100) melanoma antigen epitope (CpG-gp-E2), would synergistically elicit antitumor responses. To identify a regimen primed for obtaining effective treatment results, immune benchmarks in the spleen and tumor are examined. Conditions that lead to significant immune activation, including increases in gp100-specific interferon gamma (IFN-휸), CD8 T cells in the spleen, tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells, and survival time are identified. Based on the findings, the resulting combination of CpG-gp-E2 and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) treatment in tumor-challenged mice yield significantly increased long-term survival; more than 50% of the mice treated with combination therapy were tumor-free, compared with 0% and ≈5% for CpG-gp-E2 and anti-PD-1 alone, respectively.

Among the various antimicrobial modalities that have recently emerged, photodynamic therapy has received considerable attention because of its various potential advantages, including the unlikelihood of inducing drug resistance. A facile synthetic approach is reported to prepare a phthalocyanine‐based photosensitizer conjugated with a cyclic bactenecin peptide. This one‐pot procedure that involves site‐selective alkylation of the two cysteine residues of a linear bactenecin peptide followed by Diels–Alder reaction leads to the formation of the conjugate labeled as cBac‐Pc in 27% isolated yield. As shown by confocal fluorescence microscopy, this conjugate shows selective affinity toward bacterial over mammalian cells. It can also induce synergistic cytotoxic effects due to the cyclic peptide and phthalocyanine against a spectrum of Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacterial strains, including two ATCC‐type strains and two clinical isolates of MDR bacterial strains. It is believed that the inhibition mechanism is based on the physical destruction of the cell membrane due to the cyclic peptide followed by photodynamic action induced by the phthalocyanine unit.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and ionic liquids (ILs) have shown promise as a platform to deliver drugs, particularly biologics, through transdermal and oral routes. This ability is made possible through several key DES/IL attributes, including protein solubilization and stabilization, enzyme inhibition, and enhanced permeation across epithelial barriers. It is hypothesized herein, that some of these attributes enable subcutaneous delivery. To test this hypothesis, a native (non‐analog) glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) is delivered subcutaneously in varying concentrations of a DES, choline geranate (CAGE). Native GLP‐1 is rapidly cleared from the circulatory system by enzymatic degradative action of dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4). However, when delivered in neat or diluted CAGE, the area under the curve (AUC) of GLP‐1 increases by up to four‐fold compared to that in saline, suggesting a notable increase in the peptide concentration in the circulatory system. Mechanistic studies reveal that CAGE inhibits the degradative activity of DPP‐4 and that CAGE undergoes self‐assembly, which may be responsible for the entrapment and sustained release of GLP‐1. These studies demonstrate that upon additional testing, CAGE can be a potential excipient to improve the pharmacokinetic profile of GLP‐1.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common male urogenital malignancy worldwide. Surgery, endocrine therapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are the main clinical management options for PCa. However, these three therapies each have limitations. For example, surgery is not suitable for the advanced PCa patients with extensive metastases, and radiotherapy causes serious side effects. Primary endocrine therapy promotes the progression of hormone‐sensitive PCa into the castration‐resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, considering these drawbacks, chemotherapy has become an effective and extensive treatment for PCa. Among the modern therapeutic strategies against advanced PCa, polymer‐nanocarrier‐incorporated formulations have gradually emerged due to their well‐controlled release profiles and improved tumor targeting abilities. The drug delivery systems based on polymer nanoplatforms passively target tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Simultaneously, stimuli‐responsive polymer nanoplatforms unload cargoes in response to certain stimuli in the tumor area. Furthermore, the active targeting ligand‐conjugated polymer nanoformulations against PCa‐specific markers have also achieved great success in PCa therapies. Herein, the advanced polymer nanoplatforms for PCa therapy are reviewed, while the future development of polymer nanoplatforms for PCa therapy is also predicted.",

Here, a synthetic, supramolecular, and self‐adjuvanting CD8 + T‐cell epitope vaccine assembled by the peptide amphiphile conjugated with an epitope derived from tyrosinase‐related protein 2 is described. It is found that the obtained hydrogel vaccine on its own stimulates the activation of dendritic cells and elicits comparable therapeutic antitumor efficiency, but a clearly stronger endogenous CD8 + T‐cell response, compared with the vaccine comprised of peptide, adjuvant and delivery system, which is commonly used in clinic. In addition, combining this novel epitope vaccine with anti‐programmed cell death protein 1 (anti‐PD‐1) therapy significantly improves the therapeutic efficiency against melanoma. The supramolecular assembly approach and the self‐assembling peptide should undoubtedly enable a wide range of T‐cell epitope vaccines without the additional use of adjuvant and delivery system, and also provide new possibilities for therapeutic peptide delivery for cancer immunotherapy.",

However, the effectiveness of PDT is impaired by the aggregation of photosensitizer and an inadequate oxygen supply in tumors. Here, to overcome above limitations, novel porous organic frameworks (POFs) are reported using photosensitizer porphyrin as building blocks connected through imine condensation reactions. Upon both characteristic with the high porosity and the large surface area, TAPP‐B4‐POFs exhibit excellent O 2 carrying capacity. After carrying O 2 , O 2 @TAPP‐B4‐POFs generate ROS efficiency in both normoxic and hypoxic environment, which can induce cancer cell apoptosis. Moreover, the antitumor experiment on 4T1 murine breast cancer model demonstrates that O 2 @TAPP‐B4‐POFs can almost completely suppress tumor progression with good security. These results reveal that photosensitizer‐based POFs materials are promising candidates as oxygen reservoirs to overcome tumor hypoxia for enhanced photodynamic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The clinical value of the last‐line antibiotic colistin is limited by its toxicity and the increasing prevalence of drug resistance in recent years. These two issues can be tackled by searching for adjuvant compounds that enhance colistin activity and facilitate reduction of treatment dosage. This study identifies a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved drug, econazole, which can act synergistically with colistin to effectively eradicate colistin‐resistant bacteria both in vitro and in a mouse infection model, and treat infections caused by colistin‐susceptible bacteria in lower doses. Structural analysis shows that econazole exhibits high lipid affinity and acts as an ionophore. Functional assays and microscopy analysis confirm that econazole causes dissipation of transmembrane proton motive force (PMF) and damage to the bacterial cell membrane. Its synergistic effect with colistin might be due to the combination of these two compounds causing further collapse of PMF, arrest of various cellular functions, and eventually cell death. These findings suggest that the econazole and colistin drug combination is highly effective in eradicating colistin‐resistant Gram negative bacterial pathogens regardless of their mechanism of colistin resistance.",

To address these issues, a nanovaccine system is designed to promote anti‐tumor T cell responses, and intratumoral infiltration is examined in various murine tumor models. Subcutaneous vaccination with nanodiscs carrying human papillomavirus (HPV)‐16 E7 antigen elicits as high as ∼32% E7‐specific CD8α+ T cell responses in circulation, representing a 29‐fold improvement over the soluble peptide vaccination. Importantly, nanodisc vaccination also promotes robust intratumoral T cell infiltration and eliminates HPV16 E6/E7‐expressing TC‐1 tumors at mucosal sites, including lungs, inner lip, and intravaginal tissues. In a benchmark study with a live Listeria vaccine combined with anti‐PD‐1 IgG, nanodiscs plus anti‐PD‐1 immune checkpoint blockade elicits comparable levels of T cell responses with anti‐tumor efficacy. Furthermore, compared with Complete Freund's Adjuvant combined with tetanus toxoid, nanodisc vaccination in HLA‐A02 mice generates &gt;200‐fold stronger IFN‐γ+ T cell responses against a neoantigen from an HLA‐A02 melanoma patient. Overall, these results show that the nanodisc system is a promising cancer vaccine platform for inducing anti‐tumor T cell responses.",

NO not only participates in the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of immune cells but also regulates the secretion and function of immune‐related cytokines. Meanwhile, NO plays an important role in regulating diversified pathological processes, such as cancer, autoimmune disease, pathogenic infection, and so on. Therefore, the intensive immunological study of NO has been expected to provide valuable approaches to the clinical prevention and treatment of these related diseases. Since NO has a wide range of chemical activities and biological functions, the pleiotropic effects of NO are affected by its production, concentration and duration, target cell types and subtypes, species, and pathogenesis of the immune‐related diseases. It is thus necessary to create and develop certain platforms of drugs and related preparations that can precisely regulate NO for immunotherapy. This review summarizes the regulatory functions exerted by NO in immune response, and the pathological mechanisms of tumor, autoimmune disease, and pathogenic infection in which NO is involved. The application and trend of therapeutic strategies based on the direct regulation of NO in immunotherapy are further discussed.",

More importantly, inhalation or intranasal delivery of SFD tamibarotene formulation displays broad‐spectrum antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and pandemic 2009 influenza A virus (H1N1) in mouse and hamster models by targeting lower or upper airways, and the efficacy is comparable or superior to the commercially available antivirals remdesivir and zanamivir against specific virus.

Despite the advantages of the introduction of senescence‐inducing compounds in the clinic, recent studies show that their side‐effects can be partially masking their antitumor potential. This is due to the deleterious effects that accumulation of senescent cells in tissues and organs causes on tissue microenvironment that confer tumor‐promoting properties. In this study, it is demonstrated that the presence of senescent endothelium favors cancer cell migration and show that palbociclib systemic treatment induces senescence in veins in an orthotopic triple‐negative breast cancer mouse model. Moreover, it is found that following palbociclib‐induced senogenesis, the elimination of senescent cells using the nanoencapsulated senolytic navitoclax ( NP(nav)‐Gal ) produces the selective elimination of endothelial senescent cells and induces a marked recovery of endothelial tissue functionality. Finally, the treatment with NP(nav)‐Gal produces a significant decrease of senescence in veins which is consistent with the decrease in metastasic burden observed. These results evidence the potential of reducing vascular senescence using senolytic therapies as a strategy to limit the metastatic dissemination of tumors cells in breast cancer patients subjected to chemotherapeutic treatments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hitchhiking is a phenomenon of cruising on surfaces. Inspired by this process, biomimetic delivery systems leveraging the intrinsic ability of circulatory cells to target tumors exhibit considerable potential in cancer theranostics. Besides human circulatory cell‐mediated hitchhiking, bacteria‐driven hitchhiking strategies also manifest promise in cancer therapy. Such tactics are primarily built using nonpathogenic invasive bacteria with tumor homing capabilities. The chemotherapeutic cargos are hitchhiked onto the circulatory cells or bacterial spores for tumor‐targeted delivery. By integrating the benefits of such cells and therapeutic cargo, numerous efficient delivery systems that implement the notion of hitchhiking for cancer therapy are generated. Following an overview of several hitchhiking concepts, this article reviews various cellular and bacterial hitchhiking approaches for cancer treatment. Additionally, the challenges and prospects in the field of cancer theranostics related to hitchhiking are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies are a staple in modern pharmacotherapy. Unfortunately, these biopharmaceuticals are limited by their tendency to aggregate in formulation, resulting in poor stability and often requiring low concentration drug formulations. Moreover, existing excipients designed to stabilize these formulations are often limited by their toxicity and tendency to form particles such as micelles. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a simple \"drop-in\", amphiphilic copolymer excipient to enhance the stability of high concentration formulations of clinically-relevant monoclonal antibodies without altering their pharmacokinetics or injectability. Through interfacial rheology and surface tension measurements, we demonstrate that the copolymer excipient competitively adsorbs to formulation interfaces. Further, through determination of monomeric composition and retained bioactivity through stressed aging, we show that this excipient confers a significant stability benefit to high concentration antibody formulations. Finally, we demonstrate that the excipient behaves as an inactive ingredient, having no significant impact on the pharmacokinetic profile of a clinically relevant antibody in mice. This amphiphilic copolymer excipient demonstrates promise as a simple formulation additive to create stable, high concentration antibody formulations, thereby enabling improved treatment options such as a route-of-administration switch from low concentration intravenous (IV) to high concentration subcutaneous (SC) delivery while reducing dependence on the cold chain.",

The present research paper reports the development of smartly engineered casein manganese oxide nanobiomaterials (CMnNP) using manganese chloride and casein under alkaline condition at room temperature. The CMnNP are systematically characterized by various analytical techniques. The biocompatibility of these nanomaterials is observed by in vitro cell viability and in vivo hemolysis assay. The nanomaterials (CMnNP) exhibit the pro‐angiogenic properties, established through various in vitro assays in endothelial cells and in vivo experiments. The interaction of manganese with different enzymes and angiogenic proteins is identified through in silico analysis that is further validated through in vitro western blot studies. This study also demonstrates the application of therapeutic angiogenesis of CMnNP for wound healing as well as hindlimb ischemia in C57BL/6J and BALB/c mouse model, respectively. The formation of redox signaling molecules (especially H 2 O 2 , O 2 ˙ − , and NO) in endothelial cells may be one of the plausible mechanisms for CMnNP‐mediated angiogenesis.

The approved drug‐delivery formulations show fairly accurate correlation between clinical results and nonrodent mammal bioavailability, including Beagle dogs for Rybelsus, indicating that Beagle dogs represent a translationally relevant model. Here, a nanocarrier formulation for the oral administration of peptide therapeutics is reported with systemic targets consisting of liposomes decorated with cyclic cell‐penetrating peptides, which significantly increase oral bioavailability in translationally relevant Beagle dogs. This nanocarrier formulation is optimized using the glycopeptide vancomycin, and results in a considerable oral bioavailability of 3.9%. Further, this nanocarrier system increases the oral bioavailability of the large linear peptide therapeutic exenatide 20‐fold, and consistently achieves effective plasma concentrations in Beagle dogs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Articular cartilage injuries and osteochondral defects are a significant clinical challenge, as conventional treatments often have limited success. Articular cartilage has limited self‐regeneration ability due to the absence of blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels, making it challenging to repair tissue defects and restore motor function in injured or aging populations. Additionally, the anatomical complexity and slow regeneration capacity of hyaline cartilage at the osteochondral interface pose significant problems in repairing osteochondral defects. Melt electrowriting, a novel technology particularly suitable for polycaprolactone (PCL) is expected to overcome the common limitations of 3D‐printed scaffolds, such as poor tissue‐porosity matching, low resolution, and inflexible shapes. In recent years, melt electrowriting (MEW) has become a promising strategy for repairing cartilage and osteochondral defects. However, there is still a lack of systematic understanding regarding the comparative characteristics and application value of MEW compared with commonly used 3D printing technologies such as extrusion printing, inkjet printing, and fusion deposition modeling. This review paper compares the characteristics and advantages of MEW and common 3D printing technologies, providing a comprehensive summary of the significant progress and applications of MEW for cartilage/osteochondral repair. Finally, the challenges and key directions for future research in MEW technology will also be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pancreatic cancer is characterized by a high mortality rate and unfavorable prognosis. This is primarily attributed to poor accumulation of therapeutic agents at the target site due to the presence of a highly complex tumor microenvironment surrounding the pancreatic cancer tissue. However, a promising avenue for targeted drug delivery has emerged in the form of stimuli‐responsive materials. These advanced nanocarriers, encompassing both external and internal stimuli‐responsive nanoparticles, can be formulated to control the release of therapeutic agents precisely in response to specific activation. By harnessing external stimuli such as light, ultrasound, or magnetic fields, as well as intrinsic biological triggers including pH, redox potential, hypoxia, and temperature, these nanomaterials exhibit ‘intelligent’ and selective responses within complex biological environments. These responsive nanoparticles have been shown to address challenges associated with poor vascularity and thick desmoplastic stromal layers, which are hallmarks of pancreatic cancer, by promoting enhanced drug accumulation and release at the target site relative to conventional therapy. This work explores the design strategies for advanced stimuli‐responsive nanomaterials, integrating both internal and external stimuli, with the potential to enhance drug delivery efficacy in pancreatic cancer. It addresses the challenges and prospects in their development and offers insights for future clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Diabetic wounds are a significant complication of diabetes that is characterized by delayed wound healing and a high risk of amputation. The overexpression of pro‐inflammatory macrophages (M1) and matrix metallo protease‐9 (MMP‐9) plays a crucial role in the extended inflammatory phase, which is characteristic of these wounds. This study develops multifunctional lipid nanoemulsions known as Quercetin and Rosemary Oil Lipid Nanoemulsions (Q‐RLNEs) that can effectively convert M1 to M2 macrophages, inhibit MMP‐9 and prevent microbial infections, thereby expediting the healing of diabetic wounds. Q‐RLNEs exhibit excellent biocompatibility, cellular uptake, ROS scavenging, macrophage polarization, MMP‐9 inhibition, and potent antimicrobial properties against Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. In vivo experiments further reveal Q‐RLNE's ability to accelerate complete wound healing in diabetic‐induced rats by reducing inflammation, promoting angiogenesis, and facilitating proper collagen deposition and dermal projection regeneration. This study introduces the application of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). SAM combines attention‐fusion and hybrid fusion strategies for accurate segmentation, enabling comprehensive analysis of wound attributes over time and guiding treatment decisions. The SAM analysis results also align with Q‐RLNE in vitro and in vivo. The findings of this study suggest that Q‐RLNE is a promising new therapeutic agent for accelerating diabetic wound healing.",

Therefore, it is of particular importance to develop novel approaches for treating this ever‐growing challenge to human health. To address this challenge, herein a copper nanostructure is developed giving combined photothermal and chemodynamic therapies for focal infection treatment. The Cu‐based nanostructures with intrinsic catalytic properties are prepared by D‐L or L cysteine (Cys) as ligand and copper ions. It is shown that the multifunctional copper‐Cys (Cu‐Cys) nanostructures can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and they exhibit near infrared (NIR)‐enhanced catalytic activities to improve ROS production for highly efficient eradication of bacteria. Moreover, the results proved O 2 evolution property of the Cu‐Cys nanoparticles (NPs).

First, the successes of nanoparticles in improving the safety profiles and pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic properties are explored but also the concepts of threshold dosing and targeting of tumor‐associated macrophages. Current barriers to systemic delivery of nanomedicines are detailed and methods to overcome these barriers and increase tumor targeting are evaluated, namely: tuning the nanomedicine size and surface charge for enhanced tumor accumulation and penetration; non‐spherical nanomedicine morphologies for macrophage evasion and targeted delivery to endothelial cells; and, surface functionalization for stealth coatings and targeting receptor‐mediated endocytosis. The advantages of using silk as a nanomedicine with reference to its structure, composition, biological performance, and formulation are discussed. While batch methods for silk processing enable the formation of nano to microparticles, continuous technology can overcome bottlenecks of the deployed engineering methods such as low throughput and poor reproducibility. Finally, the chemical modification of silk using homogeneous and heterogenous chemistries is assessed within the nanomedicine context.

In this study, the use of nanodiamonds (NDs) as a platform for enhanced intracellular delivery of therapeutic peptides is investigated. SALL4 is found to contribute to tumor progression in many types of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therapeutic peptides specifically targeting SALL4 demonstrate an effective, but limited, inhibitory effect on SALL4‐driven HCC tumor cell growth. Nanodiamond‐based delivery of SALL4‐inhibitory peptides is found to improve peptide stability and cellular peptide retention. Stimuli‐responsive release of SALL4‐inhibitory peptide from nanodiamonds ensures intracellular‐specific delivery of functional SALL4‐inhibitory peptides. The observed enhanced peptide stability and intracellular‐specific delivery of SALL4‐inhibitory peptides by nanodiamonds result in improved therapeutic efficacy by ND‐peptide complexes against SALL4‐driven HCC. As such, nanodiamonds serve as a promising platform for stimuli‐responsive intracellular‐specific delivery of therapeutic peptides.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fluorescent nanodiamonds (fNDs) are unique carbon‐based nanomaterials due to their outstanding optical and magnetic properties. However, realization of the full potential of fNDs is often limited by their processability because fNDs aggregate strongly in both organic and aqueous solutions. Therefore, robust and potentially universal coating strategies are urgently needed to address these limitations. Derived from mussel foot proteins, the polymerization of l ‐3,4‐dihydroxyphenylalanine ( l ‐DOPA) provides important surface functional groups including amines, carboxylic acid, alcohols, and conjugated Michael acceptors. Herein, l ‐DOPA is polymerized on fNDs with a high control over the shell thickness. Photoluminescence and optically detected magnetic resonance studies reveal that the unique photophysical properties of fNDs are preserved after thin poly( l ‐DOPA) film coating. Subsequently, conjugation of transferrin, a heme protein that provides efficient receptor‐specific cellular transport, improves the colloidal stability and cellular uptake of the poly( l ‐DOPA)‐coated fNDs. The loading of FDA‐approved indocyanine green as a photothermal agent yields an integrated biohybrid material exhibiting an amplified photothermal effect in cells at very low energy intake (≈90 mW cm −2 ).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacterial infections cause a wide range of host immune disorders, resulting in local and systemic tissue damage. Antibiotics are pharmacological interventions for treating bacterial infections, but increased antimicrobial resistance and the delayed development of new antibiotics have led to a major global health threat, the so‐called “superbugs.” Bacterial infections consist of two processes: pathogen invasion and host immune responses. Developing nanotherapeutics to target these two pathways may be effective for eliminating bacteria and restoring host homeostasis, thus possibly finding new treatments for bacterial infections. This review offers new approaches for developing nanotherapeutics based on the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The mechanisms through which nanoparticles target infectious microenvironments are outlined, alongside a discussion of techniques that used target phagocytes to deliver antibiotics to eliminate intracellular pathogens. A new concept is also reviewed—host‐directed therapy for bacterial infections, such as targeting immune cells for the delivery of anti‐inflammatory agents and vaccine developments using bacterial‐membrane‐derived nanovesicles. This review demonstrates the translational potential of nanomedicine for improving infectious disease treatments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fibroblasts are an abundant cell type in tumor microenvironments. Activated fibroblasts, known as carcinoma‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs), interact with cancer cells through biochemical signaling and render cancer cells proliferative, invasive, and resistant to therapeutics. Targeting CAFs–cancer cells interactions offers a strategy to block cancer progression. 2D and 3D co‐cultures of human mammary fibroblasts and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells are used to investigate the impact of heterotypic cellular interactions on the proliferation of matrix invasion of TNBC cells. The results show that fibroblasts secreting a chemokine, CXCL12, significantly enhance proliferation of TNBC cells expressing the chemokine receptor, CXCR4. Disrupting this interaction with a receptor antagonist normalizes cancer cell proliferation to that of a co‐culture model lacking this signaling. When co‐culture spheroids are embedded in collagen, fibroblasts producing CXCL12 promote collagen invasion of TNBC cells. Although co‐cultures containing normal fibroblasts also lead to TNBC cell spreading into the matrix, a morphological analysis of cells and inhibition of chemokine‐receptor signaling shows that this spreading is due to the incompatibility of fibroblasts and cancer cells leading to the segregation of the two cell types from the spheroid.",

Over recent decades, the application of photoactivation strategies has seen remarkable growth and made a significant impact on rapid advances in the field of drug delivery. This Review aims to summarize the fundamental concepts and practical applications demonstrated recently in numerous therapeutic areas from cancers to infectious diseases. Its scope is defined by a focus on those photoactivation strategies that occur via either linker cleavage, nanocontainer gating, or disassembly. Each of these is discussed with specific examples and underlying mechanisms that comprise linker photolysis, photoisomerization, photothermal heating, or photodynamic reactions with reactive oxygen species.

When these radiolabeled targeted exosomes are injected into breast tumor‐bearing mice, exosomes accumulate at the periphery of the primary tumor, metastatic foci in the lungs, spleen, and liver. Ex vivo quantification of radioactivity also shows similar distribution. Injecting DiI dye‐labeled exosomes into the same mice shows adherence of exosomes to the CD206‐positive M2 macrophages on ex vivo fluorescent microscopy imaging. In addition, these engineered exosomes are utilized to carry the Fc portion of IgG2b with the intention of augmenting antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity.

AgNPs are particularly useful as endocytosis probes as they can be rapidly dissolved with a biocompatible etching solution to eliminate extracellular NPs.Here, affinity‐targeted AgNPs are evaluated as therapeutic carriers of a potent cytotoxic compound, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). AgNPs are coated with MMAE via a lysosomal protease cathepsin B sensitive linker and functionalized with a prototypic CendR peptide (RPARPAR) that targets neuropilin‐1 (NRP‐1). This gives the AgNPs dual tumor specificity as both cathepsin B and NRP‐1 are overexpressed in many types of solid tumors. Cellular imaging, flow cytometry, viability assays, and high‐performance liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry (HPLC‐MS) analysis show that the RPARPAR–MMAE–AgNPs are internalized and induce apoptotic cell death in NRP‐1‐positive PPC‐1 prostate cancer cells while sparing NRP‐1‐negative M21 melanoma cells. Furthermore, in a mixed culture of PPC‐1 and M21 cells, RPARPAR–MMAE–AgNP treatment selectively eliminates NRP‐1‐positive PPC‐1 cells. The study demonstrates that affinity‐targeted AgNPs can be used as carriers to selectively deliver and potentiate the activity of cytotoxic compounds in vitro, and that treatment with a biocompatible etching solution can be used to control the internalization and, thus, the cytotoxicity of these AgNPs.",

Four different tumor‐penetrating peptides (TPPs) (iRGD, RPARPAR, Linear TT1 (LinTT1), and cyclic TT1 (TT1)) are associated to an IP that blocks the interaction between the protein phosphatase PP2A and its binding protein SET, generating new bifunctional peptides able to intracellularly target the PP2A/SET interaction in malignant B cells and tumoral hepatocytes. The TPPs are able to penetrate into B cells of patients suffering chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and into tumoral hepatocytes but not into B cells from healthy donors and healthy hepatocytes. The association of cargo does not affect the penetration of the TPPs in CLL B cells. All the bifunctional peptides induce apoptosis in human CLL B cells and tumoral hepatocytes, and stability tests reveal that iRGD‐IP, RPARPAR‐IP, and TT1‐IP are stable after 24 h incubation in human serum. The iRGD associated with the IP significantly increases the survival of mice bearing xenograft models of CLL without any symptom of toxicity, suggesting that the bifunctional peptides may have a therapeutic application for selective tumoral targeting of PP2A/SET interaction, which is deregulated in several cancers, including CLL.",

In this study, TLR7/8 agonists are covalently attached to the highly dense end-groups of hyperbranched polymers synthesized by controlled radical polymerization techniques.

When co-administered in a model subunit vaccine, with ovalbumin or the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120, these hyperbranched polymeric adjuvants potentiate an enhanced immunoglobulin response and near-immediate type-switching to IgG2c, suggesting they promote the type of strong T helper cell 1 immune response that is desirable for the treatment of intracellular pathogens such as mycobacterial and viral infections.

Microneedle (MN) patches can increase coverage by easing logistics through simplified administration and improved stability. This study demonstrates the thermostability of a bivalent measles and rubella vaccine MN patch. The data show that rubella vaccine stability requires pH buffering during drying; potassium phosphate buffer at neutral pH is optimal for both vaccines. Screening 43 excipients for their ability to retain potency during drying and storage yields sucrose‐threonine‐potassium phosphate buffer formulation at pH 7.5 as an optimal formulation. MN patches made with this formulation have no significant loss of vaccine titer after 1 month and remain within a one log 10 titer loss cutoff after 3–4 months at 5, 25, and 40 °C. Finally, these patches are shown to be immunogenic in juvenile rhesus macaques. This work demonstrates the potential for MN patches for measles and rubella vaccination to be removed from the cold chain, which is expected to decrease vaccine cost and wastage, and increase vaccination coverage.",

The efficiency of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by photosensitizers (PSs) directly affects PDT efficacy. Conjugated polymers (CPs) exhibit excellent light‐harvesting capabilities and effective intra‐ and intermolecular energy transfer between CPs and traditional PSs by the “molecular wire effect,” leading to a significant improvement in ROS generation efficiency when PSs are carefully paired with suitable CPs as energy donors. The recently proposed “polymerization‐enhanced photosensitization effect” further reveals that donor–acceptor type CPs can directly function as high‐performance PSs. Recently, two‐photon excitation and chemiluminescence excitation technologies are employed to enhance the penetration depth, a common challenge in phototherapy of CP‐based PDT systems. Furthermore, if precisely designed, CPs can endow the system with useful functions such as photothermal effects and drug‐delivery capacity, which can lead to a synergistic therapy with PDT. Here, recent advances are summarized in CP‐based PDT, including its underlying phenomena, mechanisms, and applications. Strategies for improving PDT performance are the focus of the discussions. In the conclusion, challenges and opportunities are discussed by considering further perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To investigate the effect of resonant thermal radiation from electric graphene films (GFs) to the immunoactivity of T cells in situ and the benefits to cancer immunotherapy. This work utilizes externally applied GFs to regulate the immunoactivity of T cells through the eminent resonant thermal radiation effect. The GFs are fabricated with high emissivity and well‐matched far‐infrared emission peaks between the GFs and living bodies. The T‐cell antigen receptor signaling mechanisms and the ensuing immunoactivity of T cells by GFs treatment, compared with traditional metal films (MFs), are studied both in vitro and in vivo. The resonance thermal radiation decreases the activation threshold of T cells by increasing the influx of calcium ions, neutralizing the negative charge of intracellular membranes and triggering the phospho‐CD3ζ event. As a result, GF treatment elicits an enhanced T‐cell‐based immune response and serves as an externally applied “adjuvant” to T‐cell activation, which shows remarkable efficiency in combination with aPD‐L1 immunotherapy in multiple mouse models. This work centers the unmet needs of regulating the immunoactivity of intratumoral T cells in situ, in which the auxiliary use of GFs with high efficiency and little safety concern has great promise to translational study regarding cancer immunotherapy in future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The development of treatments to restore damaged cartilage that can provide functional recovery with minimal risk of revision surgery remains an unmet clinical need. Gene therapy shows increased promise as an innovative solution for enhanced tissue repair. Within this study a novel microRNA (miR)‐activated scaffold is developed for enhanced mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) chondrogenesis and cartilage repair through the delivery of an inhibitor to microRNA‐221 (miR‐221), which is known to have a negative effect of chondrogenesis. To fabricate the miR‐activated scaffolds, composite type II collagen‐containing scaffolds designed specifically for cartilage repair are first manufactured by lyophilization and then functionalized with glycosaminoglycan‐binding enhanced transduction (GET) system nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating the miR‐221 inhibitor. Subsequently, scaffolds are cultured with human‐derived MSCs in vitro under chondrogenic conditions for 28 days. The miR‐activated scaffolds successfully transfect human MSCs with the miR‐221 cargo in a sustained and controlled manner up to 28 days. The silencing of miR‐221 in human MSCs using the miR‐activated scaffold promotes an improved and more robust cell‐mediated chondrogenic response with repressed early‐stage events related to MSC hypertrophy. Taken together, this innovative miR‐activated scaffold for the delivery of a miR‐221 inhibitor demonstrates capability to improve chondrogenesis with promise to enhance cartilage defect repair.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aims to explore the use of polymeric microneedles (MNs) for the transdermal delivery of drugs, a noninvasive and convenient method that avoids first‐pass metabolism and gastrointestinal complications. Specifically, a double‐layered MN formulation is developed using polyvinylpyrrolidone and cross‐linked poly(methyl vinyl ether‐ alt ‐maleic acid), comprising a dissolvable layer and a hydrogel‐forming layer. Meloxicam serves as the model drug, and no organic solvents are employed in the manufacturing process to reduce toxicity. Coherent anti‐Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) is utilized to confirm that the manufacturing process does not alter the drug's physical properties. In vitro and ex vivo studies demonstrate that the double‐layered MN formulation exhibits faster drug release in the first few hours, followed by a slower release. This results in extended bioavailability in vivo compared to the commercial oral formulation of meloxicam. Preliminary results indicate that the MN formulation is also effective in pain relief and inflammation reduction. The short‐term stability of the MN formulation is also confirmed, including its mechanical properties, sustained skin permeability, drug physical properties and distribution within MNs using CARS microscopy. Overall, these results suggest that the double‐layered MN formulation holds significant potential for transdermal drug delivery, offering a safer and more effective alternative to traditional oral administration.",

However, the in vivo behavior and fate of encapsulins are poorly understood. In this study, the interactions between the model encapsulin from Thermotoga maritima (TmEnc) and key biological barriers encountered by NDDS are probed. Here, a purified TmEnc formulation that exhibits colloidal stability, storability, and blood compatibility is intravenously injected into BALB/c mice. TmEnc has an excellent nanosafety profile, with no abnormal weight loss or gross pathology observed, and only temporary alterations in toxicity biomarkers are detected. Notably, TmEnc demonstrates immunogenic properties, inducing the generation of nanocage‐specific IgM and IgG antibodies, but without any prolonged pro‐inflammatory effects. An absence of antibody cross‐reactivity also suggests immune‐orthogonality among encapsulin systems. Moreover, TmEnc forms a serum‐derived protein corona on its surface which changes dynamically and appears to play a role in immune recognition. TmEnc's biodistribution profile further reveals its sequestration from the blood circulation by the liver and then biodegrades within Kupffer cells, thus indicating clearance via the mononuclear phagocyte system. Collectively, these findings provide critical insights into how encapsulins behave in vivo, thereby informing their future design, modification, and application in targeted drug delivery.",

Magnetically actuated surface rolling microrobots, or magnetic surface microrollers, have shown potential for navigation in physiologically relevant environments due to their robust locomotion characteristics. Although much is known about their locomotion abilities in various environments, the full extent of their potential in medical applications has yet to be fully explored. Here, the potential of surface microrollers for combined chemo‐ and photothermal ablation therapy under medical imaging modalities is demonstrated. The surface microrollers are half‐coated with magnetic material, allowing for photothermal heating and magnetic locomotion, and loaded with a biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) class IV anti‐cancer drug, Docetaxel (DTX), for combined therapy. Synergistic action of on‐demand photothermal ablation and the controlled release of DTX result in the efficient elimination of cancer cells. Furthermore, microrollers can be detected ex vivo with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and photoacoustic imaging (PA), highlighting the potential of surface microrollers for future targeted medical applications.",

This further demonstrates the important role of Cu and promotes Cu‐involved biomedical research.

Although the conjunction of chemotherapeutic agents, like nanoparticle albumin‐bound paclitaxel (nab‐PTX), and immune checkpoint inhibitors, exemplified by the anti‐PD‐1 antibody (aPD‐1), has surfaced as a promising modality for TNBC treatment, the optimization of their synergistic therapeutic impact while concurrently curtailing associated adverse reactions poses a persistent challenge. Here, a soluble microneedle (MN) delivery platform (designated as aPD‐1/PTX NPs@MN) for the codelivery of nab‐PTX and aPD‐1 is developed. The soluble MN‐based delivery system is anticipated to enhance the local accumulation of therapeutic agents, reducing the adverse effects associated with systemic administration. Simultaneously, heightened concentrations of glutathione within the tumor microenvironment may trigger the liberation of nab‐PTX and aPD‐1, inducing immunogenic cell death to promote antitumor T cells infiltration and activation by blocking the immunosuppressive PD‐1 pathway, potentially culminating in a triumphant chemoimmunotherapy strategy for TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate is an important signaling molecule in the nervous system and its extracellular levels are regulated by amino acid transporters. Studies on the role of glutamate transport have benefitted from the development of small molecule inhibitors. Most inhibitors, however, cannot be remotely controlled with respect to the time and place of their action, which limits their application in biological studies. Herein, the development and evaluation of inhibitors of the prokaryotic transporter Glt Tk with photo‐controlled activity, enabling the remote, reversible, and spatiotemporally resolved regulation of transport is reported. Based on a known inhibitor, seven inhibitors, bearing a photoswitchable azobenzene moiety, are designed and synthesized. The most promising photo‐controlled inhibitor, shows in its non‐irradiated form, an IC 50 of 2.5 ± 0.4 μ m for transport by Glt Tk . Photoswitching results in a reversible drop of potency to an IC 50 of 9.1 ± 1.5 μ m . This 3.6‐fold difference in activity is used to demonstrate that the transporter function can be switched on and off reversibly through irradiation. As a result, this inhibitor could be a powerful tool in studying the role of glutamate transport by precisely controlling the time, and the specific tissue or groups of cells, in which the inhibitor is active.",

Herein a new approach toward structurally optimized gene vector design based on the preparation of clickable poly(allylamino‐phosphazene)s that can be converted to several cationic and anionic derivatives via thiol–ene addition is described. Simultaneous co‐incubation of alkylamine‐ and alkylcarboxylate‐poly(phosphazenes) with polynucleotide generates binary polyelectrolyte nanoparticles. Screening of a series of these complexes for transfection in glioblastoma cells shows that the inclusion of 6‐mercaptohexanoic acid substituted poly(phosphazene)s in the complexes results in six‐fold and 19‐fold higher luciferase expression in U87MG cells and GBM1 primary cells, respectively. This effect is attributed to the specific ionization properties of these materials that improved polyplex intracellular trafficking. Transfection in 3D‐spheroid models and subcutaneous xenograft U87MG tumors confirms higher transgene expression for the binary cationic/anionic poly(phosphazene) complexes compared to the related polycation‐pDNA complexes and to PEI‐pDNA complexes. The data also indicate a notable capacity of the mixed complexes to deliver genes to the inner cores of tumor spheroids. Extension of this approach to siRNA delivery shows that the mixed poly(phosphazene) complexes can silence DYRK1A, a gene implicated in glioblastoma initiation and progression, reducing U87MG cell renewal in vitro and delaying tumor growth in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection continues to pose a major infectious disease threat worldwide. It is characterized by the depletion of CD4+ T cells, persistent immune activation, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections. Advances in the development of antiretroviral drugs and combination antiretroviral therapy have resulted in a remarkable reduction in HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) leads to effective suppression of HIV replication with partial recovery of host immune system and has successfully transformed HIV infection from a fatal disease to a chronic condition. Additionally, antiretroviral drugs have shown promise for prevention in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment as prevention. However, ART is unable to cure HIV. Other limitations include drug-drug interactions, drug resistance, cytotoxic side effects, cost, and adherence. Alternative treatment options are being investigated to overcome these challenges including discovery of new molecules with increased anti-viral activity and development of easily administrable drug formulations. In light of the difficulties associated with current HIV treatment measures, and in the continuing absence of a cure, the prevention of new infections has also arisen as a prominent goal among efforts to curtail the worldwide HIV pandemic. In this review, the authors summarize currently available anti-HIV drugs and their combinations for treatment, new molecules under clinical development and prevention methods, and discuss drug delivery formats as well as associated challenges and alternative approaches for the future.",

The biodegradable albumin‐based nanocarriers reveal high‐contrast tumor imaging and efficient drug delivery in a preclinical TNBC xenograft model, where the xenografts are grown on the chorioallantoic membrane of fertilized chick eggs. dcHSA‐Gd‐Dox is injected intravenously, and the distribution of the compound is monitored by MRI and inductively coupled optical plasma emission spectrometry. dcHSA‐Gd‐Dox is rapidly taken up into MDA‐MB‐231 cells and exhibits significant cytotoxic efficacy. dcHSA‐Gd‐Dox combines high tissue enrichment with low systemic toxicity and high‐contrast MRI rendering it an attractive nanotheranostic for TNBC.",

Specifically, the microfluidic system is designed to induce a double deformation on the cell membrane at the squeezing zones to maximize intracellular delivery. Additionally, the flow rate, ionic concentration, and the molecular weight of the cargo are optimized for maximum efficiency. The optimized device enables cytosolic diffusion of small (3 kDa) and large molecules (70 kDa) without inducing any apoptotic effect.

    "abstract": "Abstract Nanomaterials for targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics have received significant attention owing to their potential to enhance the accumulation of therapeutics in diseased tissue. However, in diseases with poor vascularization, such as colorectal cancer (CRC), intravenously injected materials have reduced access to the site of interest. To overcome this challenge, oral administration of targeted nanomedicines is highly desirable. Here, a multicomponent drug delivery system incorporating a degradable alginate microcapsule, formulated to encapsulate micelles targeted to the CD44 receptor is presented. Functional micelles are generated by coupling hyaluronic acid (to target CD44 receptor) to block copolymers of poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate and poly(methyl methacrylate). When encapsulated into alginate microcapsules, these micelles form the basis of a novel oral delivery system that offers protection from degradative compartments of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and regio‐specific release. The microcapsules demonstrate desirable site‐specific degradation properties in an orthotopic CRC xenograft mouse model, yielding enhanced accumulation of micelles within CD44+ colorectal tumors. The results illustrate that such materials successfully navigate the GIT, regio‐specifically release targeted micelles at the tumor site, and consequently accomplish enhanced accumulation within tumor tissue. Such multi‐component nanomaterials offer a promising means for addressing challenges in treating CRC and difficult to treat diseases.",

Fluorinated polycation (F‐PCX) with an inherent ability to inhibit C‐X‐C receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is synthesized and used as a surfactant in the preparation of F‐PCX@PFC nanoemulsions. The nanoemulsions are loaded with siRNA against signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) for combined treatment of lung metastasis in osteosarcoma. Intratracheal instillation of the treatments significantly prolonged the survival of animals with established lung metastases. The treatment with F‐PCX@PFC/siSTAT3 emulsion polyplexes decreased the number of myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumors, while increasing CD8 + T cells infiltration and IFNγ secretion to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

Recently, immunotherapy based on intratumoral injection of mannan‐BAM, toll‐like receptor ligands and anti‐CD40 antibody (MBTA) demonstrated promising potential to modulate the immune phenotype of injected tumors. The strategy promotes the phagocytosis of tumor cells to facilitate the recognition of tumor antigens and induce a tumor‐specific adaptive immune response. Using a syngeneic colon carcinoma model, MBTA's potential to augment CD8 + T‐cell tumor infiltrate when administered intratumorally or subcutaneously is demonstrated as part of a whole tumor cell vaccine. Both immunotherapeutic strategies prove effective at controlling tumor growth, prolong survival, and induce immunological memory against the parental cell line. Collectively, the investigation demonstrates MBTA's potential to trigger a potent anti‐tumor immune response.",

This work reports development of a nanotherapeutic utilizing hyperbranched polymers as a platform for conjugating doxorubicin (DOX) and camptothecin (CPT) as potential synergistic therapies. The carrier also includes cyanine‐5 (Cy5) as an imaging tracer to monitor distribution and efficacy of the therapeutic, and a bispecific antibody (BsAb) as a cell targeting agent to increase accumulation and specificity for tumor tissue. The synergism of this drug combination is investigated by utilizing both redox‐ and hydrolytic release mechanisms of CPT and DOX, respectively. Drug release and cellular uptake studies confirm the proposed delivery mechanisms and subsequent intracellular trafficking of the drugs. In this particular case, a superadditive effect is observed in vitro for the two drugs when delivered by nanocarrier. This is enhanced when the carrier is targeted to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is upregulated in the tumors. Moreover, tumor regression studies show that the synergistic therapeutic effect of combination nanocarriers has greater inhibition of xenograft tumor growth compared to treatments that deliver DOX or CPT alone, suggesting that codelivery of dual therapeutics using modular hyperbranched polymer carriers offers unique potential to regulate tumor growth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the slipstream of targeting the adaptive immune system, innate immunotherapy strategies are being developed. In this context, technologies based on natural carrier vehicles that inherently interact with the innate immune system, are increasingly being considered. Immunoregulatory nanotherapeutics based on natural apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) are discussed here. This protein is a helical, amphipathic macromolecule and the main constituent of high‐density lipoprotein. In that capacity, apoA1 interacts specifically with innate immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, to collect and transport lipophilic molecules throughout the body. Exactly these unique features make apoA1 a compelling elementary constituent of biocompatible self‐assembled nanotherapeutics. Such apoA1‐based nanotherapeutics (A1‐nanotherapeutics) can be engineered and functionalized to induce or mitigate an innate immune response or to orchestrate an adaptive immune response through antigen delivery to dendritic cells. The authors first discuss apoA1's properties and how these can be exploited to generate libraries of A1‐nanotherapeutics using advanced manufacturing approaches such as microfluidics or continuous flow methods. Using high‐throughput in vitro screening methods and in vivo imaging to identify promising formulations are then recommend. Finally, three distinct immunotherapy strategies are proposed to effectively treat a variety of diseases—including cancer, infection, and cardiovascular disease—and promote allograft survival in transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Gold nanostars (AuNSs) are actively explored for a range of theranostic and nanomedicine applications. While their biological applications are widely demonstrated, the fundamental interactions of these anisotropic nanomaterials with innate immune cells and their implication for cancer immunotherapy are less investigated. Specifically, it remains unclear how AuNSs interact with macrophages of different phenotypes and how these interactions influence the behavior of macrophages, especially their phagocytic and cancer modulating activities. Herein, the interactions between AuNSs of different shapes and macrophages of different phenotypes, including the naïve M0, pro‐inflammatory M1‐like, and anti‐inflammatory M2‐like phenotypes, are systematically interrogated. This study reveals that the morphology of AuNSs significantly impacts their interactions with macrophages. Macrophage viability, oxidative stress response, cytokine release, and phagocytotic ability depend on the macrophage phenotype as well as AuNS shape tip‐to‐core ratio. The selective response of macrophages toward AuNSs, particularly those of M1‐like phenotype, may be potentially leveraged for realizing cancer immunotherapy. Overall, it is anticipated that the findings of this study will further shape the understanding of the interactions between innate immune cells and Au nanomaterials and potentially open new opportunities for cancer therapy.",

While most studies focus on the co‐stimulatory receptor CD28, little is known about the role of the other co‐stimulatory receptors in T‐cell signaling. A deeper understanding of how co‐stimulatory receptor signaling cooperates with TCR signaling could improve the ability to control T‐cell function and benefit the design of T‐cell based immunotherapies. Artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) enable tight control over the signals given to T cells. In this study, filamentous polyisocyanopeptide (PIC) polymers (immunofilaments) are used as nanosized aAPCs to study the role of the engagement of six distinct co‐stimulatory molecules on human T‐cell phenotype, function, and fate in the context of TCR signaling. The immunofilaments highlight important roles for CD28 and CD2 signaling in T‐cell priming, proliferation, cytokine production, and multifunctionality. Taken together, this work provides insight into the role of combined TCR and co‐stimulation on T‐cell phenotype, function, and fate using immunofilaments. Notably, the findings on the roles of co‐stimulatory molecule function can be used for the rational design of future cancer immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As a result of the looming antimicrobial resistance crisis, there is an urgent need for novel antimicrobial treatments. This is particularly true for hard‐to‐treat Gram‐negative bacteria, as many antimicrobial agents are unable to cross the cell membrane to gain access to the cell interior, and thus elicit a therapeutic response. Herein, evidence is provided of the use of anionic supramolecular self‐associating amphiphiles (SSAs) as antimicrobial efficacy enhancers for commonly used antimicrobial agents, to which there is known resistance, against Gram‐negative bacteria. The co‐administration of the SSAs with antimicrobials is shown to sensitize traditionally hard to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa to both rifampicin and novobiocin, from which structure activity relationships can be elucidated. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy is performed, indicating membrane permeabilization to be the likely mode of action of drug efficacy enhancement by the SSAs. These results offer an alternative strategy in antimicrobial adjuvant design, expanding focus beyond cationic peptides and into the realm of anionic small molecules. Finally, the self‐assembly of the SSAs in the presence of these antimicrobials is investigated through a combination of quantitative NMR, tensiometry, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential studies, demonstrating the impact of these agents on SSA self‐association events.",

Metabolic reprogramming toward heightened glycolysis accompanies M1 macrophage polarization, with approaches aimed at lessening glycolytic metabolism in macrophages standing to impact disease progression. The objective is to decrease the inflammatory response in atherosclerotic lesions by inducing favorable metabolic phenotypes in macrophages using an innovative mitochondrial transplantation strategy. The hypothesis is that delivery of mitochondria, functionalized with a dextran and triphenylphosphonium (Dextran‐TPP) polymer conjugate for enhanced cellular transplantation, to atherosclerotic plaques properly regulates M1 macrophage bioenergetics, attenuating inflammatory processes and preventing plaque progression. Dextran‐TPP mitochondria transplantation to M1 macrophages has profound effects on cell bioenergetics, resulting in increased oxygen consumption rate and reduced glycolytic flux that coincides with a decreased inflammatory response. Upon intravenous delivery to ApoE −/− mice fed a high fat diet, Dextran‐TPP mitochondria accumulate in aortic plaques and co‐localize with macrophages. Importantly, Dextran‐TPP mitochondria treatment reduces the plaque burden in ApoE −/− mice, improving cholesterol levels, and ameliorating hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Findings highlight Dextran‐TPP mitochondria as a novel biological particle for the treatment of atherosclerosis, underlining the potential for macrophage metabolic regulation as a therapy in other diseases.",

A new biomimetic nanocarrier is discovered using heparin (HP) that effectively passes the BBB and targets glioblastoma. Specifically, HP‐coated gold nanoparticles (HP‐AuNPs) are designed that are labeled with three different imaging modalities namely, fluorescein (FITC‐HP‐AuNP), radioisotope 68 Gallium ( 68 Ga‐HP‐AuNPs), and MRI active gadolinium (Gd‐HP‐AuNPs). The systemic infusion of FITC‐HP‐AuNPs in three different mouse strains (C57BL/6JRj, FVB, and NMRI‐nude) displays excellent penetration and reveals uniform distribution of fluorescent particles in the brain parenchyma (69–86%) with some accumulation in neurons (8–18%) and microglia (4–10%). Tail‐vein administration of radiolabeled 68 Ga‐HP‐AuNPs in healthy rats also show 68 Ga‐HP‐AuNP inside the brain parenchyma and in areas containing cerebrospinal fluid, such as the lateral ventricles, the cerebellum, and brain stem. Finally, tail‐vein administration of Gd‐HP‐AuNPs (that displays ≈threefold higher relaxivity than that of commercial Gd‐DTPA) in an orthotopic glioblastoma (U87MG xenograft) model in nude mice demonstrates enrichment of T1‐contrast at the intracranial tumor with a gradual increase in the contrast in the tumor region between 1 and 3 h.

Though fundamental studies supporting its utility abound, few clinical trials are performed on its use. This may be due to failures in the translation of treatment protocols used in fundamental studies into clinically viable protocols. This study seeks to develop a clinically viable protocol for the treatment of colorectal cancer using nanoparticle‐based PDT by using three complementary animal models. Using the porphysome nanoparticle as a model photosensitizer, several theoretical and practical challenges to the clinical delivery of PDT are addressed including the required drug‐light interval (DLI), the route of administration, and the method of light irradiation delivery. This study finds that nanoparticle‐based PDT can effectively ablate colorectal cancer tumors, that PDT can be effectively delivered after a relatively short DLI, and that safety concerns related to off‐target effects can be mitigated through the peritumoral administration of the photosensitizer and the transanal intraluminal placement of light irradiation. These findings lay the framework for future clinical trials investigating the use of PDT as a component of the multi‐modal approach to the treatment of colorectal cancer.",

Photoacoustic (PA) imaging with the second near‐infrared window (NIR‐II) and photothermal therapy are important ways to address high‐resolution imaging of in vivo deep tumor tissue and high‐effect therapy of cancer. A gold nanocluster (AuNCs) encapsulated nanorod (AuNRs) (AuNRs@MEA/DTGA@AuNCs, hereafter AMDAs) is prepared. The AuNRs are first modified using β‐mercaptoethylamine (MEA) to form AuNRs@MEA. Dithioglycolic acid (DTGA) is coupled with AuNRs@MEA to obtain AuNRs@MEA/DTGA (AMD). Finally, AuNCs are attached to AuNRs@MEA/DTGA surface to form AMDAs. In this nanocomposite materials, the encapsulation of the AuNRs by the AuNCs obscures NIR‐II PA signal of AuNRs. The high expressed glutathione in the TME react with the AMDAs via redox reaction, the detachment of the AuNCs from the AuNRs surface, and detection of the NIR‐II PA signal from the AuNRs, thus enabling NIR‐II PA imaging of tumor tissues. In addition, due to the high intensity light absorption of AuNRs in the NIR‐II region, the release of AuNRs also enhance tumor photothermal imaging and therapy. This work establishes an accurate and efficient integrated platform for nanodiagnosis and treatment of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Procuring a sufficient amount of cells is essential for cell‐based regenerative therapy. However, the application of senescent cells replicated using cell culture is limited because the cells have lost their regenerative ability or produce deleterious senescence‐associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs). In this study, using a senomorphic (epigallocatechin gallate [EGCG]), which could modulate SASP secretion from senescent cells, nonsenescent and senescent dedifferentiated fat cells from rats (rDFAT cells), and congenital cleft‐jaw defects in rats, the authors show that the senomorphic (EGCG)‐conjugated cellular scaffold restores the bone regenerative ability of senescent multipotent progenitor cells, even in vivo. In this osteogenic process, the EGCG‐conjugated scaffold attenuates the production of representative SASPs (i.e., interleukin [IL]‐6 and tumor necrosis factor‐α) and reactive oxygen species in vivo and in vitro. In polymerase chain reaction arrays in vitro, the EGCG‐conjugated cellular scaffold suppresses the expression of genes associated with deleterious SASP factors for bone formation (e.g., Csf2 , IL‐1a , and others) from senescent rDFAT cells and elevates the expression of potential osteogenesis‐ and bone remodeling‐ related gene (e.g., Cxcl13 and Spp1 ). These results provide insights to expand the application of senomorphics and senescent stem/multipotent progenitor cells in cell‐based regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transdermal drug delivery is a promising strategy characterized by minor fluctuations in blood concentrations, few adverse effects, convenience, and excellent patient compliance, especially for biomacromolecules. Conversely, traditional delivery methods are limited by their poor penetration abilities and complex preparation and application techniques. However, some inherent properties of biomacromolecules, such as large sizes, complex structure, and poor stability, can affect their ability to overcome skin barriers and reach deeper layers. Ionic liquids (ILs) are organic salts composed of asymmetric cations and anions in liquid form below 100 °C. ILs provide excellent protection for biomacromolecules and can facilitate their passage through the stratum corneum to cells for therapeutic effects. Therefore, they represent one of the most promising approaches to promoting transdermal penetration. Here, the barriers to effective transdermal delivery, including skin properties and the stability and biocompatibility of IL‐based biomacromolecule formulations, are highlighted and the current status of IL‐based biomacromolecule formulations are focused on, the tremendous advantages of using ILs based on current challenges in transdermal drug delivery are discussed, and light is shed on several ILs frequently used in the delivery of biomacromolecules.",

Intraperitoneal administration of these NCs resulted in the regression of melanoma tumor in C57BL/6J mouse model. Further, these NCs displayed green fluorescence inside MCF‐7 cells facilitating in vitro live‐cell imaging and sense hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) in cellular level (B16F10 and MCF‐7) using their fluorescence enhancement property in presence of H 2 O 2 .The results (in vitro and in vivo) altogether demonstrate the promising multifunctional applications of bimetallic nanocomposites (NCs) that can be utilized as promising transformative drugs in cancer theranostics applications.",

The rabies vaccine, for example, requires multiple immunizations for effective protection and each dose is cost prohibitive, and therefore inaccessibility disproportionately impacts low‐ and middle‐income countries. In this work, an injectable hydrogel depot technology for sustained delivery of commercial inactivated rabies virus vaccines is developed. In a mouse model, it is shown that a single immunization of a hydrogel‐based rabies vaccine elicited comparable antibody titers to a standard prime‐boost bolus regimen of a commercial rabies vaccine, despite these hydrogel vaccines comprising only half of the total dose delivered in the bolus control. Moreover, these hydrogel‐based vaccines elicited similar antigen‐specific T‐cell responses and neutralizing antibody responses compared to the bolus vaccine. Notably, it is demonstrated that while the addition of a potent clinical Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist adjuvant to the gels slightly improved binding antibody responses, inclusion of this adjuvant to the inactivated virion vaccine is detrimental to neutralizing responses. Taken together, these results suggest that these hydrogels can enable an effective regimen compression and dose‐sparing strategy for improving global access to vaccines.",

It often leads to problems such as decreased quality of life in patients and interferes with the normal course of radiation therapy (RT). With the rising incidence of tumors and the burgeoning number of patients undergoing RT, the care of RSI is of crucial importance in cancer patient treatment. Currently, drugs and biomaterials are widely used in the care of RSI. However, there is no international consensus on the current protocol for the therapeutic care of RSI. Many drugs and biomaterials cannot be applied to the appropriate type of radiation dermatitis, resulting in unfavorable results in the therapeutic care of RSI. The choice of appropriate drugs and biomaterials for the therapeutic care of the different types of RSI is essential to improving the quality of life of patients. This article first reviews the main mechanisms of acute and chronic RSI. Subsequently, the application of drugs and novel biomaterials in the preventive, acute, and chronic phases of the care of RSI is summarized. Finally, the suggestions and protocols for the application of novel biomaterials in the care of RSI are discussed, as are the current challenges and future prospects for the development of combined biomaterials and integrated care solutions.",

However, every single imaging modality has its distinct drawbacks that cannot fully fulfil the diagnosis requirement.

The hybrid PET/MRI has drawn increasing attention since its first clinical application. Imaging probes play an essential role in achieving qualified figures with accurate information of diseases. The application of nanotechnology promotes the development of versatile molecular probes for PET/MRI technique. Though there is an emerging clinical requirement, only a small number of multimodal PET/MRI probes have been investigated in preclinical research. Thus, this review tries to thoroughly summarize the nano‐sized PET/MRI probes on their design, preparation and biological application. By discussing the strength and limitations of these current available PET/MRI multimodal probes, this work aims to figure out the further research direction and promote the possible clinic translation of the novel PET/MRI probes.",

However, current chemotherapy screening techniques do not adequately recapitulate this FSS environment and are not predictive of a drug response. In this study, MCF7 and MDA‐MB‐231 cells under FSS are used as an in vitro model of CTCs. The effects of doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel on sheared cells using WST8 assay and stemness (CD44 + /CD24 − ) and apoptosis (Annexin V + /7‐AAD + ) using flow cytometry are tested. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction is used to test gene expression. It is shown that suspension‐cultured and FSS treated MCF7 cells increase in drug resistance, especially with DOX. There is a synergistic increase in the CD44 + /CD24 − CSC‐like population and an increase in drug resistance‐related gene expression in MCF7 cells co‐treated with FSS and drugs. There is also a correlated increase in STAT3 and NANOG expression under FSS. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report to suggest that the increase in CSC‐like cells from FSS contributes to drug resistance via the STAT3/NANOG pathway. This increase in CTC drug resistance also highlights the importance of implementing FSS, which is unavailable in current drug screening techniques.",

Mechanistic studies revealed that gramicidin A (gA) and gramicidin‐inspired octapeptide (LD8) induce cytotoxic effects, mitochondrial depolarization, and apoptotic cell death against metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA‐MB‐231. Doxorubicin loaded LD8 peptide (LD8‐Dox‐NP) and doxorubicin loaded gramicidin (gA‐Dox‐NP) show cytotoxicity determined by MTT assay and apoptosis as evidenced by DNA fragmentation study and Western blot analysis of poly (ADP‐ribose) polymerase (PARP) expression and cleavage. gA‐Dox‐NP and LD8‐Dox‐NP treated MDA‐MB‐231 cells show upregulation of tumor suppressor protein p53, which can inhibit cell proliferation. Interestingly, cell cycle analysis suggests that gA‐Dox‐NP and LD8‐Dox‐NP induce S and G2 phase cell cycle arrest, respectively.

However, higher biothiol concentrations in tumor cells will decrease the efficacy of PDT. To tackle the above challenges, a distinctive spinach‐based carbon nanomaterial called “chlorophyll‐rich biomass quantum dots” (CBQDs) with near‐infrared emission is prepared, and the CBQDs are further bound with copper ions forming CBQD‐Cu nanocomposites, which are used as a new fluorescence nanoprobe and highly efficient photosensitizer for simultaneous in vivo near‐infrared fluorescence imaging of biothiol and dual‐enhanced PDT of tumors. The mechanism of action is studied and it is shown that the binding of chlorophyll and copper ions on the surface of CBQDs reduces the energy level difference of the chlorophyll molecules, which results in an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) achieving enhanced PDT. On the other hand, the copper ions on the CBQD‐Cu surface can also bind with biothiol which decreases the concentration of free biothiol in tumor cells, and further enhances PDT. At the same time, the combination of copper ions and biothiol opens the fluorescence of CBQDs, which realizes near‐infrared fluorescence imaging of biothiol. Hence, the CBQD‐Cu is used as a highly effective nanomedicine for the recognition and treatment of tumors.",

Such nanomaterials exhibit a high material economy due to high drug contents and minor amounts of inactive additives. The antifolate pemetrexed (PMX) which is used for the treatment of lung cancers contains two carboxy functions that are able to undergo coordinative binding of metal ions. This study presents the development of a multilayer PMX NP system where each layer serves a distinct purpose. The metal‐drug NP core is assembled in a bottom‐up approach by coordinative interactions between zirconium (IV) ions and PMX molecules. Since the NP core is generated from drug molecules as essential units, it features a very high drug content of almost 80%. The NP core is stabilized against serum with a shell of a polymerized oligoamine‐modified trimethoxysilane derivative (TMSP). As external layer, a polyglutamate‐ block ‐polysarcosine‐N 3 (pGlu‐ b ‐pSar) coating mediates efficient colloidal stabilization and enables introduction of targeting functionalities by click chemistry. Attaching folate or transferrin ligands to the polymer layer enhances NP uptake into target receptor positive KB and L1210 cells.

Drug delivery systems (DDSs) such as liposomes provide the opportunity to deliver antigens and immunostimulatory molecules to DCs, which in turn initiate an antigen‐specific immune response. To address predominantly DCs, DDSs need to be equipped with targeting moieties. This study evaluates liposomes, bearing the oligosaccharide trimannose on their surface, for their ability to address DCs in vitro and in vivo. Trimannose as a saccharidic structure is known to be recognized by receptors on the surface of DCs. To obtain trimannosylated liposomes, azide‐bearing trimannose is coupled to alkyne‐functionalized hyperbranched polyglycerol ( hb PG) with a bis(hexadecyl)glycerol (BisHD) anchor in a Cu(I)‐catalyzed alkyne‐azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). To enable tracking of the liposomes in vivo, the trimannosylated BisHD‐ hb PG lipids are radiolabeled with 18 F in a CuAAC. Subsequently, liposomes are produced via the thin‐film hydration method followed by extrusion. The behavior of the trimannosylated liposomes is evaluated in in vitro cell binding assays and in vivo µPET and ex vivo biodistribution studies in healthy C57BL/6 mice and the results are compared to similar liposomes not bearing trimannose on their surface.",

Therefore, there is a great motivation to develop a unique delivery system, targeted to the tumor, in which we can combine several active entities, increase the therapeutic index by reducing systemic exposure, and enhance their synergistic activity. To meet these goals, we chose the biocompatible and biodegradable poly(α,L-glutamic acid) (PGA) as a nanocarrier that facilitates extravasation-dependent tumor targeting delivery. The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway when aberrantly activated in melanoma, can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation, induced invasion, and reduced apoptosis. Here, we selected two drugs targeting this pathway; a MEK1/2 inhibitor (selumetinib; SLM) and a modified BRAF inhibitor (modified dabrafenib; mDBF), that exhibited synergism in vitro. We synthesized and characterized our nanomedicine of PGA conjugated to SLM and mDBF (PGA-SLM-mDBF). PGA-SLM-mDBF inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cells and decreased their migratory and sprouting abilities without inducing a hemolytic effect.

    "abstract": "Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is a large burden on public health worldwide. As a result, there is an urgent demand for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the control and prevention of TB. In this study, an efficient liquid biopsy strategy for TB diagnosis and a novel TB granuloma imaging‐guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) strategy for TB treatment are constructed based on functionalized nanomaterials. New biomarkers of leukocyte transcriptional signatures for TB are screened, and the seven best‐performing genes are selected for construction of a combined diagnosis strategy. This work produces a new liquid biopsy strategy for TB based on a nanodiagnostic platform. Furthermore, functionalized nanomaterials encapsulating aggregation‐induced emission fluorophores and upconversion nanoparticles are creatively developed to specifically target and image the lesions of tuberculous granulomas in vivo. The visual information could guide subsequent PDT with efficient antimicrobial activity. Hence, functionalized nanomaterials have the potential to be the next generation of theranostics and show outstanding performance that allows them to serve as a novel paradigm for the diagnosis and therapy of TB.",

Sporopollenin microcapsules from natural pollen grains have recently been engineered to overcome these multifaceted challenges. Using four morphologically different sporopollenin shells and two inbred mouse strains, this study addresses three key questions regarding sporopollenin shell's application for oral vaccine delivery: i) the impact of sporopollenin shell surface morphology on the immune response, ii) the duration of the immunity, and iii) the applicability of the delivery system across a diverse genetic background population. Using ovalbumin (OVA) as a model vaccine antigen, this study demonstrates that OVA can adsorb on the sporopollenin shell surfaces. Mice orally vaccinated with a sporopollenin shell‐based OVA formulation show sustained antibody responses for 454 days after the immunization that are correlated with the generation of OVA‐specific plasma cells in the vaccinated mice bone marrow. Sporopollenin shell surface spikes have a greater impact on immune responses than the shell size and shape. A spiky ragweed sporopollenin formulation induces systemic and mucosal responses in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Together, this study provides a framework to select sporopollenin shells based on the surface morphology to use as a microcapsule for oral vaccination.",

In this work, the efficacy and mechanistic studies of the newly developed pheophorbide a (Ppa)‐hydrazone‐doxorubicin (DOX) (PhD) nanoparticles (NPs) as a triple‐modal therapeutic agent, including chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, and photodynamic therapy, to improve bladder cancer care are reported. Spherical PhD NPs are ≈71 nm in diameter. Treatments with light and/or pH similar to the acidic tumor microenvironment accelerate DOX drug release. In comparison with DOX, trimodal therapy with PhD NPs increases cytotoxicity by 58 and 109 times in 5637 and TCCSUP cell lines, respectively, and antitumor efficacy is light‐dose dependent. In vivo studies on patient‐derived xenografts reveal that trimodal therapy of PhD NPs induces anti‐tumor effects and overcomes drug resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapy matches the underlying genetic alteration of PI3K activation mutation. Both the in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo anti‐tumor activity are realized by the inhibition of both AKT and ERK pathways and caspase‐3 mediated apoptosis. In conclusion, PhD NPs with multiple therapeutic functions show enormous potential to improve bladder cancer treatment and overcome resistance.",

These materials are based on components in clinical use, or known to be biodegradable, and retain the same fundamental chemistry across “AB” and “BAB” block architectures. In MCF7 and MDA‐MB‐231 breast cancer cells, nanoparticles of &lt;100 nm are internalized most rapidly, by both clathrin‐ and caveolin‐mediated pathways. In THP‐1 cells, polymer architecture and length of the hydrophilic block is the most important factor in the rate of internalization. The organ distributions of systemically injected nanoparticles in healthy mice indicate highest accumulation of the BAB‐blocks in lungs and liver and the lowest accumulation in these organs of a methoxyPEG 5000 ‐pLA‐pTBPC polymer. Conjugation of doxorubicin via a serum‐stable urea linker to the carbonate regions of PEG 5000 ‐pLA‐pTBPC generates self‐assembling nanoparticles which are more cytotoxic in 2D, and penetrate further in 3D spheroids of triple negative breast cancer cells, than the free drug. In an aggressive orthotopic triple negative breast cancer mouse model, the methoxyPEG 5000 ‐pLA‐pTBPC is of similar potency to free doxorubicin but with no evidence of adverse effects in terms of body weight.",

However, abnormally increased RONS levels can damage DNA, protein, and tissue, or even impair cellular signaling. Consequently, when this state is present for a long time, it can lead to severe inflammatory disorders, such as lupus, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Although antioxidant therapies have been developed for a long time to treat acute or chronic inflammatory diseases, small molecule‐based antioxidants showed relatively low therapeutic effects due to rapid clearance and low stability in the bloodstream. As one of the solutions to overcome such limitations, incorporating polymers would provide enhanced blood stability, bioavailability, and even enhanced therapeutic effects. Herein, diverse polymeric antioxidant materials are introduced that are categorized into simple loading strategies and polymers with inherent antioxidative activity. Further, preclinical and clinical studies of polymeric antioxidant materials for anti‐inflammatory therapy are discussed and a better direction is provided for these to be pursued and improved in anti‐inflammatory therapy.",

However, their narrow administration time window, rapid clearance, and possible inactivation limit their efficient and wider application. Most importantly, they present a substantial risk of fatal bleeding complications, which are a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Improving the therapeutic outcomes of pharmacological thrombolysis, including alleviating associated side effects, is an urgent challenge. In this context, nano‐drug delivery systems have attracted major interest. State‐of‐the‐art nanodelivery systems have achieved reduced immunogenicity and a significant prolongation of the biological half‐life of drugs, the latter allowing their application as boli instead of infusions. Recent research focuses on theranostic systems capable of image‐guided thrombolysis, clot targeting strategies, and stimuli‐responsive systems. The latter are designed so that an external or internal stimulus triggers the drug release, offering unique spatiotemporal control over the treatment and potentially minimizing side effects. In this review, the authors discuss the different nanodelivery platforms and focus on stimuli‐responsive systems, highlighting their therapeutic advantages and the challenges for their clinical translation.",

Although multiple treatments are available, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, these conventional therapies barely improve the functional prognosis and life quality of patients with glioblastoma. Immunotherapy, has become a promising approach for treating GBM because of the ability to overcome the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and complicated unique tumor immune microenvironment. Developing an efficient immunotherapy for GBM requires understanding the glioblastoma immune microenvironment; accordingly, this study begins by summarizing this and what it indicates for the development of immunological effects. Then current immunotherapy management for GBM and advanced studies including checkpoint inhibitors, cell vaccines, and extracellular vesicle‐based immunotherapy is reviewed. Because monotherapies are inadequate for treating GBM, combinational GBM immunotherapy with other classical cancer therapies, especially chemo‐immunotherapy, radiotherapy‐immunotherapy, and the combination of gene therapy and immunotherapy, is introduced and discussed. The recent progress introduced in this review suggests that cancer immunotherapy and its combinatory therapies are highly promising treatment modalities for glioblastoma patients. However, systematical and in‐depth investigations are required to improve the efficacy of GBM immunotherapy for future clinical translation.",

A promising solution is the use of biodegradable polymers because the continuous release of therapeutics without introducing toxic compounds is desirable. Using a microneedle approach lends the polymeric microneedle the capability to be placed inside of the scala tympani, releasing drugs overtime. Poly(lactic‐ co ‐glycolic acid) (PLGA) microneedles is prepared by dissolving dimethyl sulfoxide with either a) Rhodamine B, to study the drug release profile in vitro, b) FM1‐43, to study the drug release profile in vivo, or c) dexamethasone (DXM), to protect hair cell (HC) loss in vivo. The Rhodamine B studies show that the dye begins release from the microneedles within 30 min. The ototoxicity assessment of the DXM‐coated microneedles in vitro shows a significant reduction of HC losses when compared to control microneedles in an ototoxic environment. In vivo data show reduced hearing threshold for animals treated with DXM‐infused microneedles, providing a proof of concept of the methodology developed. Drug‐infused polymeric microneedles provide a promising method to deliver DXM to the inner ear over controlled periods of time protecting hair cells, thus minimizing hearing loss (HL).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oral delivery is the most widely used modality for drug administration, but its efficiency is hampered by the limited drug absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. To address this issue, neonatal‐Fc‐receptor‐targeted liposome (Fc domain‐binding peptide (FcBP)‐Lip) is designed in this study. It is discovered that FcBP modification, by adapting to longitudinal pH gradience of the intestine, increases the unidirectional transport of liposomes from the apical to the basolateral side of the intestinal epithelium. In addition, FcBP‐Lip circumvents the lysosomal sequestration and engages the endoplamic reticulum (ER)–Golgi secretion pathway, together contributing to another mechanism that enhances epithelium transcytosis. Moreover, it is discovered that FcBP‐Lip is subject to paracellular and lymphatic transportations by activating specific intracellular kinases and forming chylomicron, respectively. Owing to the vigorous involvement of the miscellaneous transepithelial transport pathways, oral absorption of FcBP‐Lip in vivo is significantly increased. Finally, the insulin that is encapsulated into FcBP‐Lip elicits a stronger hypoglycemic effect than the native form. Notably, insulin‐loaded FcBP‐Lip efficiently elevates hepatic insulin accumulation, insulin receptor level, and glycogen production, leading to blood glucose homeostasis in diabetic rats.",

Currently, nano-medicines that incorporate fluorophores emitting in the near-infrared-I (NIR-I, 700-900 nm) spectral region into their systems have been adopted to afford thrombosis theranostics. However, several unsolved problems such as limited penetration depth and image quality severely impede further applications of such nano-medicine systems. Fortunately, the ability to incorporate fluorophores emitting in the NIR-II (1000-1700 nm) window into nano-medicine systems can unambiguously identify biological processes with high signal-to-noise, deep tissue penetration depth, and high image resolution. Considering the inherently favorable properties of NIR-II fluorophores, we believe such have enormous potential to quickly become incorporated into nano-medicine systems for thrombosis theranostics.

    "abstract": "Abstract Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) not only exhibits aggressive progression and metastasis, but also responds to neither hormone therapy nor checkpoint blockade therapy. Thus, combinatorial chemotherapy is indispensable for TNBC treatment. However, due to the different pharmacokinetics of individual drugs and weak synergistic effects caused by random drug molar ratio in tumor, direct coadministration is far from satisfactory. Constructing a nanoscale drug delivery system with fixed drug molar ratios and maximum drug content is an urgent problem. Herein, an active targeting nanoparticle self‐assembled from cisplatin‐palbociclib amphiphiles with optimal drug ratio is reported. The combination of cisplatin and palbociclib at a molar ratio of 1:2 is found to have the best synergistic effect and is selected for follow‐up studies. After conjugating two palbociclib molecules to one cisplatin molecule, a fixed cisplatin/palbociclib (1:2) molar ratio is enabled and this amphiphilic conjugate can self‐assemble into nanoparticles. A small amount of iRGD coupled 1,2‐distearoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphoethanolamine‐N‐polyethylene glycol‐2000 (DSPE‐PEG‐iRGD) that further stabilizes the nanoparticle is introduced to fabricate the desired nanoparticle (iRGD‐PCN) and endow active tumor‐targeting ability. On an orthotopic TNBC mouse model, iRGD‐PCN efficiently accumulates in tumors and inhibits tumor growth. Additionally, the formation of lung metastasis nodes is also significantly suppressed. In general, the active targeting nanoparticles self‐assembled from cisplatin‐palbociclib amphiphiles provide options for combinatorial chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hypertension is a global public health challenge that imposes a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. Conventional treatment involves dose escalation of an antihypertensive drug, and if the desired response is not achieved, patients are prescribed another drug, often in combination with other therapies. Importantly, drug synergy is dose‐, time‐ and patient‐dependent. Coupled with the challenges of intra‐ and inter‐individual variability, standard care can lead to sub‐optimal outcomes, additional visits, and adherence issues. Furthermore, these factors can cause the additional complication of patients being misperceived as refractory to regimens that are sub‐optimally administered. A scalable strategy that can longitudinally optimize patient response would be a powerful advance for chronic disease management. This four‐patient case series reports the application of CURATE.AI as a mechanism‐independent and disease‐agnostic platform for a retrospective N‐of‐1 (personalized) dose optimization using each patient's own data, including drug doses and corresponding changes in blood pressures. This approach may enable the rapid prediction of treatment response and the identification of optimal doses that may yield improved outcomes. CURATE.AI can be implemented in clinical workflows without creating additional burden of extensive data collection. The findings from this study support the prospective validation of CURATE.AI to optimize hypertension management.",

Excessive inorganic phosphate burden is being considered as another stimulator, until now there is no well‐designed study to examine the potential benefits of reducing phosphate burden on cancer progression. Sevelamer microspheres, a polymeric phosphate binder, are introduced as embolic material for interventional treatment of rabbit VX2 liver cancer model. This technique is named as “transarterial sevelamer embolization (TASE).” The microspheres prove to be highly biocompatible, and TASE is found to be a safe local‐regional technique. Compared with conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), TASE is found to not only occlude the tumor‐feeding vessel, but simultaneously deplete intratumoral inorganic phosphate (Pi), thereby inducing severe necrosis as well reducing metastasis and recurrence. Reduced Pi stress inhibits tumor vascularity, invasion, and metastasis by downregulating the angiogenic factors and oncoprotein expression. Energy metabolomics indicate that Pi stress also suppresses tumor anaerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis. This systemic anti‐cancer effect indicates a promising new application for sevelamer and TASE as a potential alternative to conventional TACE for liver cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Noble metals and their alloy‐based nanomaterials are widely used in biomedicine, especially in the fields of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) on tumors, due to their remarkable physicochemical properties. Nonetheless, novel doping strategies with unexpected efficacies are still challenging and formidable. Herein, a photosensitizer‐alloy nanosystem is designed for highly efficient PDT and PTT. Specifically, the optimized Pt/Ag alloy nanoparticles are facilely synthesized in one step at room temperature and are simultaneously endowed with enhanced peroxidase‐like activity and photothermal conversion, and further activated cytotoxic singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) productivity after covalent functionalization of chlorin e6 (Ce6). A small amount of Ag doping can kill two birds with one stone by simultaneously enhancing the synergistic PDT and PTT potential of Pt/Ag‐PEG‐Ce6 nanoparticles. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental results indicate that the significant temperature increase triggered by 808 nm laser and a large amount of toxic 1 O 2 excited by 671 nm laser synergistically and strongly kill tumor cells. Therefore, through proper doping and improved physicochemical properties, this nanosystem achieves effective PDT and PTT of tumors and also inspires the advanced design of noble metal‐based nanomedicine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite advances by recently approved antibody‐drug conjugates in treating advanced gastric cancer patients, substantial limitations remain. Here, several key obstacles are overcome by developing a first‐in‐class ultrasmall (sub‐8‐nanometer (nm)) anti‐human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)‐targeting drug‐immune conjugate nanoparticle therapy. This multivalent fluorescent core–shell silica nanoparticle bears multiple anti‐HER2 single‐chain variable fragments (scFv), topoisomerase inhibitors, and deferoxamine moieties. Most surprisingly, drawing upon its favorable physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, clearance, and target‐specific dual‐modality imaging properties in a “hit and run” approach, this conjugate eradicated HER2‐expressing gastric tumors without any evidence of tumor regrowth, while exhibiting a wide therapeutic index. Therapeutic response mechanisms are accompanied by the activation of functional markers, as well as pathway‐specific inhibition. Results highlight the potential clinical utility of this molecularly engineered particle drug‐immune conjugate and underscore the versatility of the base platform as a carrier for conjugating an array of other immune products and payloads.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chemotherapy combined with nanocarriers has received increased attention as a thriving strategy for tumor therapy. However, drug resistance (DR), poor circulation, and retention in cells are the main challenges of this therapy. Herein, a novel strategy is developed to target drug delivery via π–π stacking interactions to overcome DR and short circulation and retention in cells. Carbon quantum dots (CDs) and gambogic acid (GA) are assembled via a π–π stacking interaction, which increases the drug‐loading capacity of CDs as well as the circulation and retention of GA‐loaded CDs (CDs/GA). CDs/GA significantly inhibit cell proliferation because CDs enter the nucleus and avoid drug pump recognition. GA released from CDs/GA promotes apoptosis by inducing the production of reactive oxygen species via the mitochondrial pathway. As a result, the delivery system of CDs/GA via π–π stacking displays a significant therapeutic effect on hepatoma (HepG2) and cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. The mechanisms of DR and induction of apoptosis are further investigated. The results suggest that chemotherapy combined with CDs can facilitate the targeting of the nucleus, thereby inducing apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) based on Fenton‐like reaction possesses great potential for anticancer therapy with high efficiency and specificity. However, CDT still suffers low therapeutic efficiency due to intratumoral insufficient H 2 O 2 or unfavorable tumor microenvironment. To enhance tumor treatment and in particular prevent tumor recurrence, the combined strategies with CDT are essentially needed. Herein, a nanocomposite based on Mn 2+ and cytosine‐phosphate‐guanine oligonucleotides (CpG ODNs) (MnCpGPNCs) is constructed to combine CDT with immunostimulating responses by exploiting Mn 2+ ‐induced CDT and Mn 2+ /CpG ODNs‐coinduced immunotherapy against mouse colon tumor cells. Specifically, MnCpGPNCs efficiently deliver and sensitively release Mn 2+ in tumor cells to trigger Fenton‐like reaction, causing cell apoptosis. Importantly, Mn 2+ also promotes the stimulator of interferon genes pathway to increase the production of type I interferons, thus increasing cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, dendritic cell maturation, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Furthermore, CpG ODNs serve as immune adjuvant enhanced the antigen presentation and immune‐eliciting potency. The combination of Mn 2+ ‐based CDT with augmented immunotherapy efficiently inhibits the primary/distance tumors and prevents tumorigenesis. Overall, this newly developed metal‐CpG system demonstrates a paradigm to expand chemodynamic agents as immunotherapy boosters to complement current treatments for tumor elimination and prevention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Microvesicles (MVs) are heterogeneous membrane‐bound sacs formed by direct plasma membrane budding, that have promising potential for targeted drug delivery and therapy. However, to date, they have limited application to lymph node (LN) targeting due to their large size. Herein, the direct size conversion of erythrocyte‐derived MVs (eMVs) via incubation with an ApoA‐I mimetic peptide (R4F) capable of binding phospholipids is performed. The interaction between the R4F peptide and phospholipid bilayers of eMVs limits the maximum possible length of the lipid‐bound conformation and induces the formation of small‐sized eMVs, which further endows them with SR‐B1 receptor and LN targeting functions. In a lymphadenitis model, dexamethasone (Dex)‐loaded eMVs functionalized with R4F peptide can specifically suppress the macrophage inflammatory response through the NF‐κB and p38 MAPK pathways along with reducing inflammatory cell infiltration to improve lymphadenitis. Moreover, celastrol (Cel)‐loaded eMVs functionalized with R4F peptide can significantly inhibit LN metastasis by selectively killing SR‐B1–overexpressing 4T1 tumor cells and inducing T cell‐mediated systemic antitumor immune responses in LN metastatic model of breast cancer. Thus, small R4F peptide‐decorated eMVs with SR‐B1–targeting ability provide an excellent drug delivery system for the targeted treatment of LN‐associated diseases, opening new frontiers for LN‐targeted drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The rise of antibiotic resistant strains, as methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), challenges the current treatment of infections. In the case of ocular infections, antibiotic eye drops are commonly prescribed. However, their efficacy is usually compromised by the low viscosity of these formulations and the eye drainage. To overcome these drawbacks, deep eutectic solvent (DES)‐based microemulsions with thermo‐responsive character, that increase their viscosity upon contact with the eye have been developed. Using betaine‐based DES aqueous solutions, it is possible to increase up to 140‐fold the water solubility of the antibiotic chloramphenicol, typically used in ocular infections. The DES solutions containing the antibiotic are applied as water phases in water‐in‐oil‐in‐water (w/o/w) microemulsions, being stable up to 3 months. Furthermore, a sustained‐release and a higher permeation of the antibiotic through the cornea than that of commercialized eye drops is achieved, while presenting comparable cytotoxicity profiles (cell viabilities &gt; 88%). Higher antimicrobial activity and faster action of the antibiotic in case of infection with MRSA is observed compared to the commercialized formulations (7 log 10 of inactivation in 48 h vs 72 h). Overall, these microemulsions comprising DES are a promising strategy to achieve higher antibiotic effectiveness in the treatment of resistant bacterial infections.",

The human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) significantly ( p ‐value &lt;0.001) lose their viability upon exposure to ox‐LDL treatment (100 µg/ml). An exposure of HUVECs to resveratrol (RSL)‐unloaded 3D stent slightly lowers the cell viability as compared with untreated control group. On the contrary, RSL‐loaded 3D stent exposure groups maintain initial cell viability. The amounts of TNF‐α and IL‐β released from zebrafish embryos (1.82 ± 0.75 and 1.87 ± 0.24) in the group treated with the RSL‐loaded 3D stents are significantly lower ( p &lt; 0.001) than those from the LPS alone treated group (8.13 ± 2.29 and 23.79 ± 3.82, respectively). It is found that RSL‐loaded 3D stent at a RSL dose of 1 m m shows no mortality during the developmental stages, but RSL‐loaded 3D stent at a dose of 2 m m shows a lowered survival rate (93.3 ± 3.3%), shorter length of larvae, pericardial and yolk sac edemas of 53.3 ± 23.3% and 3.3 ± 3.3%, respectively. The RSL‐loaded 3D stents efficiently downregulate the proinflammatory cytokines, and protect an organism against oxidative stress, while producing minimal developments defects in zebrafish embryos.",

The optimal printing angle is 30°, resulting in needle tip and base diameters of ≈50 and ≈330 µm and heights of ≈550/850/1180 µm. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) MNs produced with varying levofloxacin concentrations show variability of ≈4% in tip and 3% base diameters and 15% in height compared to the 3D‐printed MNs. Geometry B is used to produce levofloxacin‐loaded PVA MNs and tested against Klebsiella pneumoniae colony biofilms. Levofloxacin is released gradually, as assessed by spectrofluorimetry. The minimum inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin against the K. pneumoniae clinical isolate is 4 µg mL −1 but this concentration is insufficient to cause any effect on K. pneumoniae biofilms. Only concentrations ≥32 µg mL −1 are statistically different compared to the unloaded MNs. 3D printing is an attractive solution to produce molds for fabricating biopolymeric MNs for topical drug delivery.",

However, to be effective, transdermal patches must have optimal adhesion and drug‐loading capacity. In this study, an adhesive composite hydrogel patch consisting of poly( N ‐2,3‐dihydroxypropyl aspartamide) (PDHPA), a polyaspartamide derivative, and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are developed. To prepare the hydrogel, boric acid (BA) is utilized as a crosslinker to form reversible bonds between multiple hydroxyl groups in the polymer and BA. The PDHPA‐BA hydrogel exhibits dynamic reversibility, self‐healing properties, and a pH‐dependent sol–gel transition. The addition of MSNs with abundant hydroxyl groups improves the mechanical performance, adhesion properties, and self‐healing rate of the PDHPA‐BA hydrogel. In addition, MSNs enable the loading of hydrophobic drugs, such as dexamethasone (Dex), onto the hydrogel. Using the Dex‐loaded adhesive composite hydrogel as a transdermal patch, the severity of atopic dermatitis in a mouse model indicated by suppression of dermatitis score, epidermal thickness, number of mast cells, and serum interleukin‐4 levels is successfully reduced. These results suggest that the composite hydrogel patch is a highly promising transdermal drug delivery system for effectively treating inflammatory skin diseases.",

Its ability to release Ca 2+ and H 2 O 2 into the tumor microenvironment has positively modulated abnormal calcium signaling and kinetic therapy. Moreover, the indirectly produced O 2 2− by CaO 2 can alleviate hypoxic conditions. On the one hand, the accumulation of Ca 2+ can lead to various tumor cell apoptosis events, such as calcium overload and tumor calcification. On the other hand, the released H 2 O 2 can convert into more toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) via exogenous stimulation and endogenous regulation, thereby making nano‐CaO 2 a versatile tool in modern medicine, exhibiting its invaluable and irreplaceable medical value in tumor therapy. Hence, a comprehensive review of the recent advances in the nano‐CaO 2 platform is imperative. This review provides an overview of the conventional synthesis strategies for nano‐CaO 2 . It elucidates the potential role of the nano‐CaO 2 nanoplatforms in various tumor treatment strategies, including monotherapy and combination therapy, in detail. Given the remarkable outcomes achieved to date and the challenges that of future clinical translation, this work predicts the future research directions.

While the role of individual growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, Ephrin‐B2, angiopoietins, and platelet‐derived growth factor‐BB (PDGF‐BB) is well studied, the temporal influence of growth factor secretion, and the effect of their concentrations and combinations on in vitro vascularization inside hydrogels, have not been systematically investigated. Here, combinations of angiopoietin‐1, angiopoietin‐2, and PDGF‐BB improve vascularization of a human umbilical vein endothelial cells‐fibroblast coculture inside polyethylene glycol‐based hydrogels the most, while the optimal concentrations and time points of growth factor addition are determined. Moreover, fibroblasts, pericytes, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are compared as supporting cells, of which MSCs best promote vascularization in coculture. Additionally, the resulting blood vessels align with magnetically oriented rod‐shaped microgels when cultured inside the Anisogel. To mimic fibrosis, transforming growth factor‐beta is added, resulting in significantly smaller vessels and more collagen secretion. This in vitro study reveals that a cascade of growth factors can improve vascular formation in 3D hydrogels, which is important to create viable tissue‐engineered constructs for therapies and in vitro healthy and diseased tissue models.",

In addition to blocking mutated oncogene downstream signaling, the immunological mechanism(s) underlying the anti‐tumor effect of targeted‐immuno‐therapy is not clear. In this study, anlotinib, a novel pan‐targeted tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor (pTKI), is combined with anti‐PD1 (αPD1) as a therapeutic regimen applying to an immunocompetent mouse tumor model. Anlotinib induces immunogenic cell death (ICD), elicits anti‐tumor inflammation and infiltration, and activation of DCs and CD8 + T cells, which are enhanced by αPD1. Furthermore, anlotinib reduces KC/MCP‐1 secretion by attenuating educational effect that cancer cells imposed on tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) and prevents their M2 polarization by inhibiting AKT/mTORC1 and Pparδ pathways. Importantly, anlotinib plus αPD1 prolongs median progression‐free survival time compared with standard chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab as the 1 st line treatment in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Thus, anlotinib treatment elicits both innate and adaptive anti‐tumor immune responses while αPD1 enhances its potency. This study provides strong evidence that combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy is a promising regimen for treating NSCLC.",

This is due to Bi‐TCPP's strong ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer (LMCT) events that form singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ). Further, when the electrons and holes above the bandgap relax to the band edge, the excess energy is converted into heat. In vitro and in vivo experiments show excellent antibacterial and repair effects.

    "abstract": "Abstract Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most life‐threatening metabolic disorders, with 9% of the global prevalence, and it is estimated to be rising to 12.2% in 2045. Currently, there is no definitive treatment for DM. Although life‐saving, insulin administration to control blood sugar is not a cure for DM and is insufficient to prevent DM‐related complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, or retinopathy. For this reason, studies are continuing to develop treatments that will provide β‐cell regeneration while suppressing autoimmunity. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells with a high proliferation capacity, immunosuppression, and immunomodulation ability. MSCs have gained therapeutic importance with these properties besides their differentiation ability. The immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory properties of the cells arise from the soluble and insoluble factors they secrete into the extracellular environment. Therefore, the culture medium where these cells grow has therapeutic value and is named conditioned medium (CM). In this context, CM obtained from MSCs can provide a similar therapeutic effect with fewer safety concerns. Furthermore, preconditioning of MSCs can improve the effectiveness of these cells and associated cellular products. So, this review summarizes the recent advances in MSC‐derived CMs and their therapeutic potential for DM and related complications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nanotechnology has been widely used in drug design in recent years, showing great potential and advantages in tumor therapy. However, the application of most traditional nanomedicines is still limited by low drug loading rate, poor targeting ability, and systemic toxicity. Based on the characteristics of tumor microenvironments, numerous studies indicate that the construction of stimuli‐responsive nanocarriers can effectively solve the above problems by improving delivery efficiency, reducing side effects, and enhancing targeting. A significant feature of responsive nanocarriers is that they can release and activate drugs at specific sites under stimulus, including internal stimuli (e.g., pH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), enzyme, hypoxia, adenosine‐triphosphate (ATP), etc.) and external stimuli (e.g., light, thermo, ultrasound, etc.). Of note, learning about various pathways of responses can enable researchers to effectively design responsive nanocarriers for tumor therapy. Herein, this review focuses on the stimuli‐responsive strategies of nanocarriers for tumor therapy. In addition, the role of responsive nanocarriers in synergistic tumor therapy is also discussed. The expectation of this review is to provide ideas for the design of practical and effective responsive nanocarriers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Maintaining the homeostasis of the skin's immune microenvironment is crucial for skin's health. In inflammatory skin conditions (like psoriasis), the immune microenvironment is dysregulated, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and T cell overactivation. In addition to promoting inflammation and excessive keratinocyte proliferation, ROS upregulation in psoriasis also induces glucocorticoid resistance, which poses a significant challenge to the effectiveness of glucocorticoid treatment (e.g., dexamethasone, Dex) in psoriasis. To conquer this problem, epigallocatechin‐3‐gallate (EGCG) is used to eliminate ROS production in psoriasis. Application of EGCG reduces ROS levels and improves the antipsoriasis effect of Dex in vitro. Benefiting from the unique characteristics of microneedle (MN) for transdermal drug delivery, a dissolvable MN patch containing EGCG and Dex (DEX/EGCG‐MN) is constructed, which can directly codelivery the two elements to the lesion area without stratum corneum barrier. The MN alleviates psoriasis‐like manifestations in imiquimod‐induced psoriasis mouse model, indicated by epidermal thickness and dorsal skin signs. Besides, DEX/EGCG‐MN corrects the disorder of immune cells, including innate and acquired immune cells. As a result, it mediates the balance in the skin's immune microenvironment. Meanwhile, the MN also ameliorates the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions. It is believed that this approach may offer insights for further developing antipsoriasis assays.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacteria‐based agents are emerging as promising tools for cancer therapy due to their ability to actively target tumors, trigger localized inflammation, and induce tumor regression. There has been growing interest in using bacteria that are responsive to external cues, such as magnetic fields, to facilitate the formation of robust colonies in tumors and achieve the threshold for clinical efficacy. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of innately magnetically responsive bacteria, known as magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), as steerable agents. However, their immunostimulatory properties, which play a central role in their function as therapeutic agents, have not yet been adequately studied. Here, key aspects of human immune cell response to MTB strain Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB‐1 in physiological environments are characterized. The ability of MTB to maintain magnetic properties, remain viable in whole blood, elicit cytokine production by macrophages, and stimulate uptake of cancer cell material by dendritic cells is examined. This study also investigates the use of MTB–liposome complexes for effective delivery of therapeutic payloads in vitro and explores response to the agent in vivo. Overall, this work establishes the potential of MTB as a versatile, combined delivery platform for immune‐mediated cancer therapy.",

Recent research has highlighted the potential of celecoxib (CXB), a potent COX‐2 selective inhibitor, for enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapy by blocking the COX‐2/PGE2 axis. However, the clinical application of CXB for cancer treatment is still hindered by its systemic adverse effects and lack of tumor‐targeting. Here, to address these limitations, PEGylated prodrug CXB‐derived nanoparticles (CXB‐NPs) are developed, a nanomedicine designed to improve the tumor delivery of CXB while minimizing its adverse side effects. CXB‐NPs demonstrate enhanced tumor accumulation and effectively inhibit tumor growth by improving the immunosuppressive TME in immunocompetent mice, surpassing the performance of parental CXB. Furthermore, when combined with anti‐PD‐1 antibody (αPD‐1) immunotherapy, CXB‐NPs exhibit superior suppression of CT26 tumor growth compared with αPD‐1 monotherapy. This combination approach reduces the infiltration of immunosuppressive immune cells while promoting the infiltration and cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells. The findings indicate that CXB‐NPs capable of remodeling the TME provide a new combination therapy strategy for potentiating antitumor efficacy.",

Because of the advantages of cargo protection, targeting delivery, controlled release, and so on, nanoparticles are widely applied in cancer therapies. However, bare nanoparticles prove not potent enough. Obstacles of immune rejection, low targeting rate, and insufficient circulation time limit the application of bare nanoparticles against cancer. Therefore, inspired by surface modification, invention of cell membrane coating technology has solved the above problems. Nanoparticles camouflaged in cell membranes not only improve biocompatibility, but also benefit from weak immunogenicity, homotypic fusion, prolonged circulation time, and other specialized properties bestowed by source cells accordingly. Through combination of cell membrane vesicles and other novel techniques, innovative methods of cancer diagnosis and treatment are feasible. Here recent advances in cell membrane coating technology are discussed. Apart from introducing methodology of cell membrane vesicle fabrication and characterization, examples of cell membrane vesicle with diverse source cells are given to present specialized application properties.

Currently, the treatment of PD is limited due to the challenge of macromolecular drugs crossing the blood‐brain barrier (BBB). Black phosphorus (BP) has antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory effects and shows potential for neuroprotection. To solve the restriction of the BBB, innovative BP microbubbles (BP@MBs) combined with focused ultrasound (FUS) are constructed to facilitate BBB opening. Additionally, the biocompatibility and safety of BP@MBs with varying dimensions are investigated, including BP quantum dot microbubbles (BPQDs@MBs) and BP nanosheet microbubbles (BPNSs@MBs). The findings indicate that low concentrations of BP have good biosafety and that BPQDs@MBs exhibit better biocompatibility than BPNSs@MBs both in vitro and in vivo at the same concentrations. Moreover, a 6‐hydroxydopamine (6‐OHDA)‐induced PD cell model and an animal model are established to verify the anti‐PD effects of BPQDs@MBs and BPNSs@MBs. The results confirmed that BPQDs@MBs and BPNSs@MBs have antioxidant effects that reduced neuronal apoptosis and improved the motor symptoms of PD in rats. BPQDs@MBs combined with FUS may be a promising option for the clinical treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Melanoma is one of the most common types of skin cancer with a bad prognosis and limited treatment options in advanced stages. Immunotherapy has changed the landscape of oncology. Cancer cells can activate various mechanisms to suppress immune responses, such as the immunological checkpoint programmed cell death‐1 (PD‐1)/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1), whose blockage reactivates immune killing of melanoma cells. Moreover, exposure to inhibitory cytokines such as transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF‐β) induces T regulatory cell differentiation, which promotes cancer immunosuppression. These advances provided exciting outcomes in the clinical treatment of melanoma, however, there are still limitations, and a combination of several treatments is usually needed. Based on the above, inhibition of the TGF‐β production and the PD‐1/PD‐L1 checkpoint may be a feasible strategy to increase T cell infiltration and cytotoxicity and thus overcome tumor immune escape. Here, mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with a PD‐L1 inhibitor (JQ1, a thienotriazolodiazepine and a potent bromodomain family inhibitor) and capped with polyethyleneimine and a small interfering RNA targeting TGF‐β are reported. An efficient PD‐L1 downregulation and TGF‐β silencing are achieved using the nanoparticles, along with the promotion of cancer death. This system demonstrates to be a specific and innovative therapeutic approach for the treatment of melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the biggest obstacles in treating glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the plasticity and adaptability of GBM cells, which renders monotherapy ineffective. Novel drug combinations that target multiple pathways are required to overcome this challenge. In the current study, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is identified as a crucial component in GBM cell survival using the KEGG database and literature search. Hence, it is hypothesized that a potential synergistic therapy can be achieved by targeting different stages of this pathway by combining disulfiram (DSF) and 7‐ethyl‐10‐hydroxycamptothecin (SN‐38). The efficacy of this drug combination is evaluated using 2D and 3D in vitro assays, which exhibited a significant synergism with 5 × 10 4 times lower IC50 than that of temozolomide (TMZ), the gold‐standard drug. The combination treatment increases intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, and ROS inhibition by using N ‐Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) reduced the cytotoxicity substantially, indicating that ROS played a crucial role in the synergistic cytotoxicity. The combination treatment inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration, and stem cell marker expression. Mechanistically, the DSF+SN‐38 combination is found to increase p53 expression, inhibit PI3K signaling, and activate caspase 9. Altogether, this study demonstrates that the DSF+SN‐38 combination can present a promising therapeutic strategy for treating GBM.",

In the current study, two irrigated nano‐formulations of immunological adjuvant‐fluorinated chitosan (FCS) and therapeutic antibody‐FCS are developed for synergistic immunotherapy against BCa. In this system, FCS is employed as a transepithelial carrier to assemble with bovine serum albumin (BSA)‐flubendazole (FBZ) complex and anti‐PD‐1 (αPD‐1) respectively, to facilitate efficient transepithelial delivery of intravesical FBZ‐BSA and αPD‐1 though transiently regulating the distribution of tight junction proteins on bladder epithelium. In addition, the FBZ–BSA complex exhibits tumor microenvironment‐responsive charge reversal and BSA carrier‐broken effects to drive tumor‐targeted dissociation and drug release of FBZ–BSA/FCS. Moreover, FBZ not only promotes apoptosis and inhibits glycolysis in cancer cells but also displays adjuvant properties to activate potent immune responses through IL‐12/IFN‐γ pathway. Interestingly, combined perfusion of FBZ–BSA/FCS and αPD‐1/FCS nano‐formulations can significantly activate the tumor immune microenvironment, especially CD8 + T cell infiltration and αPD‐1 sensitivity, and finally remarkably inhibit tumor growth in the mouse orthotopic BCa model. Thus, this study presents a novel intravesical delivery platform for ICB antibodies and a smart adjuvant system to achieve potent synergy immunotherapy, which is promising for bladder‐preserving treatment against BCa.",

The in vivo efficacy is of the dual therapy is additionally tested by treating pulmonary KLP infections in mice. Much greater effectiveness are observed in bacterial clearance and survival of mice receiving the dual therapy than that of singly treated or untreated mice. It is found that in in vitro the dual therapy increased reactive oxygen stress in treated bacteria. Combination therapy impacted KLP catalase, but not superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Finally, alterations in KLP genes encoding 6‐phosphogluconate phosphatase or cytochrome C assembly protein are found to be associated with increased resistance to combination gallium therapy, raising the MIC to both Ga(NO 3 ) 3 and GaPP by 4‐fold. These cumulative data lend validation to the potential for the use of Ga(NO 3 ) 3 and GaPP combination therapy against KLP and suggest that increased oxidative stress is involved in the mechanism of action.",

AMD is a leading cause of vision loss in individuals over the age of 65, particularly more common in Caucasians than in other racial groups. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) have emerged as highly promising nanomaterials in the treatment of AMD due to their potent antioxidant properties. In pathological damages of AMD conditions, characterized by oxidative stress resulting from an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), CNPs possess significant promise for attenuating the pathogenic processes and advancing therapeutic interventions.

Here, the antioxidative activity of glycol chitosan‐coated CNPs (namely, GCCNPs) and their behavior in mouse primary RPE (mRPE) cells are reported through an in vitro trafficking study. This findings demonstrate that GCCNPs effectively neutralize excessive ROS and prefer to exclusively accumulate in cytosol without any uptake in the nucleus and mitochondria of the mRPE cells.

However, these peptides often suffer from short plasma half‐life, rapid clearance, and low in vivo chemical stability; requiring higher dosages and frequent administration.

Here, a subcutaneously (SC) administrable porous silicon microparticle (pSiMP) platform for the sustained release of GLP‐1R agonist peptides is reported. The proof‐of‐concept involves using FDA‐approved exenatide, a potent GLP‐1R agonist, showcasing the platform's efficacy for therapeutic GLP‐1R peptides. pSiMPs with tailored particle size, pore dimensions, and surface chemistry unlock the potential for optimized loading and release of this peptide.

    "abstract": "Abstract Boosting the response rate of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy to improve treatment efficacy is a primary goal in cancer immunotherapy. One of the promising approaches involves focal tumor ablation to reduce tumor burden and trigger the in situ vaccination. Even though this combination strategy has demonstrated enhanced therapeutic outcomes in both preclinical research and clinical trials, limited research has comparatively investigated diverse ablation techniques. The optimal choice among focal therapy techniques remains largely unknown. In a murine colorectal cancer model (MC‐38), the therapeutic efficacy of anti‐PD‐1 in combination with thermal ablation, cryoablation, and irreversible electroporation (IRE) is evaluated, utilizing well‐characterized miniature probes. In this model, ICB monotherapy has limited effect in controlling tumor growth. IRE exhibits the most favorable synergistic effect with anti‐PD‐1 immunotherapy than thermal ablation or cryoablation, leading to the greatest primary tumor growth delay, longest tumor‐free survival, and highest protection against secondary tumor challenge. Furthermore, the co‐administration of IRE and anti‐PD‐1 significantly fosters the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor coupled with a remarkable stem‐like progenitor phenotype. The findings demonstrate that IRE stands as a promising modality that can potentiate the antitumor efficacy when the tumor is poorly responding to ICB monotherapy.",

Herein, an oral colon‐targeting Se‐Probiotic@Alginate bead (BLSe) with ROS‐scavenging ability and gut immune‐microbiota microenvironment remodeling ability is developed using alginate as the primary outer shell encapsulated with probiotics Bacillus licheniformis (BL) and selenium nanoparticles stabilized by yeast glucan (SeNPs). In vitro studies have shown that SeNPs possess antioxidant activity and BLSe exhibits excellent stability in gastric fluids and are released in intestinal fluids. In vivo studies have also shown that BLSe significantly alleviated dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)‐induced colitis in mice by inhibiting colon shortening, enhancing antioxidant activity, reducing pro‐inflammatory cytokine secretion, and protecting the intestinal mucosal barrier. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing shows that BLSe can remodel the composition of the gut microbiota by improving bacterial diversity and restoring the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria in the colon. Overall, this study advances a promising probiotic‐based nanomedicine for managing IBD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Research into mechanisms and potential applications of nanomaterials in medicine has expanded steadily in recent decades, with increasing translational focus. Development costs, including for clinical trials, are often cited as factors limiting the translational viability of novel nanomedicines, especially compared to small new molecular entities (NMEs) and therapeutic biologics. Yet, to date, there has been no systematic investigation into the clinical programs or costs of translating and commercializing nanomedicines, nor a comparison to NMEs and therapeutic biologics, to support these claims. Here, nanomedicines approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) from 2011 to 2023 are systematically identified and categorized. Nanomedicines were identified as formulations where submicron particle size contributes to product function. Like biologics and NMEs, nanomedicines are most frequently approved for oncological indications. Notably, all anti‐cancer nanomedicines are indicated to treat orphan diseases, which is representative of the potential for nanomedicines to occupy pharmaceutical niches in treating diseases affecting smaller patient cohorts. The median estimated cost of pivotal trials for nanomedicines is 47% that of biologics and NMEs approved in the same timeframe. The findings indicate higher manufacturing costs in nanomedicine development may be mitigated by savings elsewhere, increasing translational viability.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive advances in cancer research, glioblastoma (GBM) still remains a very locally invasive and thus challenging tumor to treat, with a poor median survival. Tumor cells remodel their microenvironment and utilize extracellular matrix to promote invasion and therapeutic resistance. We aim here to determine how GBM cells exploit hyaluronan (HA) to maintain proliferation using ligand-receptor dependent and ligand-receptor independent signaling. We use tissue engineering approaches to recreate the three-dimensional tumor microenvironment in vitro, then analyze shifts in metabolism, hyaluronan secretion, HA molecular weight distribution, as well as hyaluronan synthetic enzymes (HAS) and hyaluronidases (HYAL) activity in an array of patient derived xenograft GBM cells. We reveal that endogenous HA plays a role in mitochondrial respiration and cell proliferation in a tumor subtype dependent manner. We propose a tumor specific combination treatment of HYAL and HAS inhibitors to disrupt the HA stabilizing role in GBM cells. Taken together, these data shed light on the dual metabolic and ligand - dependent signaling roles of hyaluronan in glioblastoma.",

However, transdermal drug delivery using conventional photosensitizers faces major challenges due to skin barriers, diminishing the effectiveness of drug penetration and therapeutic efficacies.

    "abstract": "Abstract Tissue regeneration involves dynamic dialogue between and among different cells and their surrounding matrices. Bone regeneration is specifically governed by reciprocity between osteoblasts and osteoclasts within the bone microenvironment. Osteoclast‐directed resorption and osteoblast‐directed formation of bone are essential to bone remodeling, and the crosstalk between these cells is vital to curating a sequence of events that culminate in the creation of bone tissue. Among bone biomaterial strategies, many have investigated the use of different material cues to direct the development and activity of osteoblasts. However, less attention has been given to exploring features that similarly target osteoclast formation and activity, with even fewer strategies demonstrating or integrating biomaterial‐directed modulation of osteoblast‐osteoclast coupling. This review aims to describe various biomaterial cues demonstrated to influence osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function, emphasizing those that enhance a material construct's ability to achieve bone healing and regeneration. Additionally discussed are approaches that influence the communication between osteoclasts and osteoblasts, particularly in a manner that takes advantage of their coupling. Deepening the understanding of how biomaterial cues may dictate osteoclast differentiation, function, and influence on the microenvironment may enable the realization of bone‐replacement interventions with enhanced integrative and regenerative capacities.",

However, cell transplantation has to overcome a number of hurdles, such as cell quality control, clinical practicality, low cell retention/engraftment, and immune reactions when allogeneic cells are used. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have been developed as potential agents in cancer immunotherapy but their application is sparse in cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, BsAbs are designed by chemical cycloaddition of F(ab′) 2 fragments from monoclonal anti‐CD34 and anti‐ cardiac myosin heavy chain (CMHC) antibodies, which specifically targets circulating CD34‐positive cells and injured cardiomyocytes simultaneously. It is hypothesized that intravenous administration of stem cell re‐directing (SCRD) BsAbs (anti‐CD34‐F(ab′) 2 –anti‐CMHC‐F(ab′) 2 ) can home endogenous BMSCs to the injured heart for cardiac repair. The in vivo studies in a mouse model with heart ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury demonstrate the safety and therapeutic potency of SCRD BsAb, which supports cardiac recovery by reducing scarring, promoting angiomyogenesis, and boosting cardiac function.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Designing multi‐drug regimens often involves target‐ and synergy prediction‐based drug selection, and subsequent dose escalation to achieve the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each drug. This approach may improve efficacy, but not the optimal efficacy and often substantially increases toxicity. Drug interactions depend on many pathways in the omics networks and further complicate the design process. The virtually infinite drug–dose parameter space cannot be reconciled using conventional approaches, which are largely based on prediction. This barrier at least partially accounts for the low response rates that are observed with conventional mono‐ and combinatorial chemotherapy. A combination of nonstandard therapies for colorectal cancer (AGCH: adriamycin, gemcitabine, cisplatin, and herceptin) at ¼ MTD is used to treat the rats, the tumor response rates varied in a wide range. Some of the tumor response rates are close to that of control group. This work harnesses an artificial intelligence (AI) platform that is mechanism free and can dynamically optimize combinatorial therapy in rats. The individually optimized AGCH regimen reveal starkly different drug–dose parameters, which can converge each rat toward the same and low tumor response rate. Importantly, this AI‐based drug–dose optimization technology is an actionable platform, which can achieve N‐of‐1 therapy.",

However, typical chemical conjugation methods lack site‐selectivity and can negatively impact protein bioactivity. To overcome this problem, a site‐selective strategy is reported here for installing tetrazine groups on terminal poly‐histidines (His‐tags) of recombinant proteins. These tetrazine groups are then leveraged for bio‐orthogonal conjugation to poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel microparticles, which are subsequently assembled into microporous annealed particle (MAP) hydrogels. The efficacy of the strategy is demonstrated using recombinant, green fluorescent protein with a His‐tag (His‐GFP), which enhances fluorescence of the MAP hydrogels compared to control protein lacking tetrazine groups. Subsequently, to demonstrate efficacy with a therapeutic protein, recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein‐2 (His‐BMP2) is conjugated. Human mesenchymal stem cells growing in the MAP hydrogels respond to the conjugated BMP2 and significantly increase mineralization after 21 days compared to controls. Thus, this site‐selective protein modification strategy, coupled with bio‐orthogonal click chemistry, is expected to be useful for bone defect repair and regeneration therapies. Broader application to the integration of protein therapeutics with biomaterials is also envisioned.",

Considering that traditional approaches (e.g., surgery, exercise, steroid injections) have failed to reinstate tendon function following injury, recent efforts have been directed toward the development of cell‐based tendon repair and regeneration therapies. However, tenocytes readily lose their phenotype in culture and implantation of naïve stem cells is often associated with ectopic bone formation. To this end, there has been a surge in efforts to engineer the optimal tenogenic niche in vitro that will either maintain the phenotype of tenocytes or direct other cell types toward tenogenic lineage. Mono‐domain biochemical (e.g., media supplements, substrate coatings, oxygen tension), biological (e.g., growth factors, co‐culture systems), or biophysical (topography, rigidity, mechanical stimulation, macromolecular crowding) cues that replicate the native tendon milieu have shown some level of success, but they have failed to provide a functional therapy. Considering the complexity of the native tissue microenvironment together with recent advances in chemistry, biology, and engineering, it is anticipated that in the years to come multifactorial approaches are likely to yield a functional cell‐based therapy for tendon repair and regeneration.",

Here, the efficacy of sustained FMT release is investigated via a subcutaneously implanted nanofluidic delivery system (nF) to prevent muscle wasting. Pharmacokinetics of nF‐mediated sustained FMT delivery (nF‐FMT) in healthy mice is assessed for 56 days, which demonstrates an anabolic effect on skeletal muscles. Using a hind limb suspension unloading mouse model, it is shown that nF‐FMT treatment attenuates soleus mass loss in comparison to control mice. Further, the very first study of an implantable drug delivery device in microgravity in vivo is launched. The microgravity environment aboard the International Space Station is leveraged to assess the atrophy prevention capability of nF‐FMT in mice for 29 and 55 days. Muscle hypertrophy is observed in both ground control and spaceflight mice treated with nF‐FMT compared to their respective vehicle controls. Overall, the nF system is presented as a viable platform for sustained delivery of FMT for therapeutic intervention of skeletal muscle atrophy.",

The present study aims to investigate the response of cardiac cells to ectopic Oct3/4 , Sox2 , Klf4 , and cMyc (OSKM) expression in vivo using a non‐integrating adenoviral vector. Direct intramyocardial injection of this vector achieves effective and transient OSKM overexpression in the healthy heart and after myocardial infarction. The expression of these factors induces transient upregulation of a number of endogenous pluripotency ( endo‐Oct3/4 , Gdf3 ) and reprogramming related ( Cdh1, Fut4 ) genes, confirming the induction of cell reprogramming. Despite the initiation of reprogramming, markers of fully de‐differentiated cells including Nanog remain silenced, consistent with a partially reprogrammed state. Furthermore, no indications of tumorigenesis or teratoma formation are observed. Overall, these data suggest that adenoviral mediated OSKM delivery can be utilized to induce partial in vivo reprogramming. However, the absence of any clear regenerative effects after myocardial infarction indicates that further optimization of vector mediated reprogramming strategies is essential to overcome barriers to therapeutic efficacy.",

Here, the characterization of a macrocyclic peptide (p101) capable of blocking the PD‐L1/PD‐1 immune checkpoint is reported at the interface of cancer and immune cells. NMR and other physicochemical data demonstrate that the macrocycle binds to PD‐L1 to sterically hinder its interaction with PD‐1. The crystal structure of the complex highlights the detailed features of the binding site and demonstrates that the interaction is primarily guided by hydrophobic forces. A reporter PD‐L1/PD‐1 blockade bioassay demonstrates that p101 is able to inhibit the interaction in the cellular environment. Finally, it is shown that p101 releases the immune response of primary human T‐cells from PD‐L1 mediated inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, 75% of which are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Generally, chronic inflammation and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment are steadily activated in HCC. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for use as a clinically advanced HCC treatment, their efficacy in the clinical setting is not satisfactory. Moreover, only a small fraction of antibody reaches the target via systemic circulation due to neutralization of antibodies and off‐target delivery. To enhance the localized effects of ICIs, iron oxide nanoparticles (≈10 nm) are conjugated with an antiprogrammed death‐1 (anti‐PD1) antibody and introduced the ironized antibodies into orthotopic HCC tumors via the systemic circulation. When mice are sacrificed 13 days after the final treatment, mice treated with ironized anti‐PD1 significantly regulate tumor‐infiltrating leukocytes (TILs), particularly amplifying T‐cell functions and recruiting M1 macrophages. More importantly, biochemical indices indicate that mice treated with ironized anti‐PD1 recover liver function. This work presents iron oxide nanoparticles integrated with an anti‐PD1 antibody that immunomodulates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to generate synergistic effects that achieve tumor inhibition and immune response activation in the context of HCC therapy.",

To date, a myriad of synthetic vehicles, including liposomes, polymers, and other nanoparticle platforms, have been developed to improve the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of STING agonists in preclinical mouse models. Compared to synthetic materials, protein‐based carriers represent an attractive delivery platform owing to their biocompatibility, amenability to genetic engineering, and intrinsic capacity to form well‐defined structures. Here, the immune adaptor STING is engineered as aprotein‐based delivery system for efficient encapsulation and intracellular delivery of CDNs. Through genetic fusion with a protein transduction domain, the recombinant STING can spontaneously penetrate cells to markedly enhance the delivery of CDNs in a mouse vaccination model and a syngeneic melanoma model. As certain tumor cells can evade immune surveillance via loss of STING expression, authors further unveiled that the STING platform can serve as a functional vehicle to restore the STING signaling in cell lines with impaired STING expression. Altogether, their delivery platform may offer a unique direction toward targeting STING‐silenced tumors and augmenting the efficacy of STING‐based vaccine adjuvants.",

Relevant clinical therapy encounters challenges of infection recurrence, poor vascularization, and bone destruction. Engineered substitutes endowed with multiple functions of bacterial eradication, osteoconductivity, and angiogenesis are urgently needed to address these challenges. Herein, graphene oxide/copper (GO/Cu) nanocomposite‐decorated polylactide‐ co ‐glycolide (PLGA)/β‐tricalcium phosphate (TCP) (P/T/GO/Cu) scaffolds are fabricated using 3D printing technology. A comprehensive evaluation of material characteristics and biological activities of these scaffolds is conducted and compared. This novel bone substitute has unique surface characteristics, and the incorporation of GO/Cu nanocomposites into the scaffolds exhibits improved antimicrobial and osteogenic potential and displays acceptable cytocompatibility. A subcutaneous implantation model in rats confirms the effective inhibition of abscess formation and inflammatory reactions, satisfactory neovascularization and tissue integration, and good biosafety of the implanted P/T/GO/Cu scaffolds. Eventually, a bacteria‐contaminated bone defect model is established in rabbits and significantly better new cancellous bone formation featuring collagen or osteoid deposition is clearly found in the defect regions implanted with P/T/GO/Cu scaffolds. Thus, this novel bone substitute with excellent bacterial inhibition, osteogenesis, and angiogenesis capabilities represents a promising strategy to satisfy the multiple demands for the repair of bacteria‐contaminated bone defects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive intracranial tumor that occurs in the central nervous system (CNS) and has no effective treatment due to the fact of drug resistance. To combat drug resistance, TMZ is generally administrated in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs. Unfortunately, drug combinations used to date only show modest improvements in anti‐tumor effects and have increased toxicity. Herein, an ApoE peptide decorated GBM cancer cell membrane camouflaged nanomedicine (AMNPs@TMZ+LM) to specifically co‐deliver TMZ and the MGMT inhibitor lomeguatrib (LM) for combinatorial GBM treatment is developed. Incorporation of LM not only effectively suppresses the repair of damaged DNA, but also inhibits tumor cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest. Importantly, this biomimetic nanomedicine achieves high BBB penetration and enhances sensitivity to both TMZ‐resistant (U251‐TR) and GBM stem cells (GSCs). Notably, AMNPs@TMZ+LM results in significant inhibition of the growth of orthotopically implanted U251‐TR tumor in mice. In comparison, treatment with single drug loaded nanomedicines results in compromised anti‐GBM effects. Histological analyses and blood parameter studies show good biocompatibility of the nanomedicine. Hence, this biomimetic nanomedicine provides a potential new approach to overcome the limitations of current GBM chemotherapy regimens by co‐delivery of TMZ and the MGMT inhibitor LM.",

Here, novel 3D‐liver spheroid models are constructed from human hepatoma cells (HepG2)/ immortalized human hepatocyte‐like cells (imHCs) with primary hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) coculture using the ultralow attachment technique. Spheroid morphology, HSC distribution, metabolic activity, protein expressions, and drug penetration are evaluated. All developed 3D spheroid models exhibit in spherical shape with narrow size distribution, diameter between 639–743 (HepG2‐10%HSC) and 519–631 (imHC‐10%HSC) µm. Both imHC mono and coculture models significantly express normal liver biomarkers at the higher level than HepG2 models. While 3D‐HepG2 models significantly exhibit HCC biomarkers at the higher level than imHC models. HepG2 and imHC spheroids express basal cytochrom P450 (CYP450) enzymes at different levels depending on cell types, culture period, and ratio of coculture. Their metabolic activities for dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) tolbutamide (CYP2C9) and midazolam (CYP3A4) are routinely evaluated. For midazolam metabolism, imHC models allow the detection of phase II metabolic enzymes (UGT2B4 and UGT2B7).

Topical corticosteroids and non‐steroidal calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are used as first‐line therapies for AD, but various side effects limit their long‐term use. Here, the first synthetic bilirubin(IIIα)‐derived nanoparticle is reported, designated BRNP(IIIα), and shows that it exhibits robust antioxidative and immunomodulatory effects and effectively reduces the clinical symptoms of AD upon topical treatment. BRNP(IIIα) in 1% high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (BRNP(IIIα)/HA) readily infiltrates into the dermis layer, notably downregulates disease‐associated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, and suppresses the recruitment of leukocytes and mast cells to AD‐induced lesions. BRNP(IIIα)/HA also significantly reduces the tissue‐resident memory T cell population, suggesting that it may inhibit recurrence. Furthermore, BRNP(IIIα)/HA does not induce any adverse effect related to skin irritation/sensitization or eye irritation in human tissue. Collectively, the findings suggest that BRNP(IIIα)/HA may be useful as an alternative to corticosteroids or CNIs for the safe, effective, and long‐term topical treatment of AD.",

RA, which is typically associated with the accumulation of hyperactive immune cells (HICs), particularly M1 proinflammatory macrophages, is accompanied by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased pH in the synovial membranes of the joints. In this work, a nano‐delivery system (MTX‐Mn 3 O 4 @PDA) is designed that can deliver photothermal materials, ROS scavengers, and synovial fibroblast inhibitors at the joint site for the treatment of RA. After injecting MTX‐Mn 3 O 4 @PDA into the inflamed site of RA, photothermal therapy is initiated by near‐infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, which resulted in the death of activated inflammatory cells at the lesion site. While polydopamine (PDA) slowly dissociates under stimulation by a low pH microenvironment. Subsequently, excess ROS interacts with the Mn 3 O 4 nanozyme and the undissociated PDA nanozyme, promoting ROS clearance, while Methotrexate (MTX) inhibits the proliferation of synovial fibroblasts. Intra‐articular injection of MTX‐Mn 3 O 4 @PDA (7 mg kg −1 ) into collagen‐induced arthritis mice demonstrated efficacy in reducing toe swelling and significantly alleviating synovial inflammation, bone erosion, and cartilage degeneration.

Effective prevention of and recovery from IAI is complex, involving antibacterial treatment and the promotion of bone integration.

In this study, Lipopeptide 01 (LP01), a lipopeptide derived from the skin commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis is successfully immobilized, onto the porous surface of sulfonated Poly (ether‐ether‐ketone) (SPEEK) to create a novel artificial implant, LP01‐PS. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrates that LP01‐PS displays favorable material properties, biocompatibility, outstanding antibacterial characteristics, and the ability to promote bone formation. Mechanistically, LP01‐PS enhances antibacterial activities by triggering TLR2/P65 signaling, upregulating the expression of LL37 and β‐defensins in macrophages. Furthermore, it can boost the osteogenic differentiation capability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) through the β‐catenin signaling pathway, thereby facilitating bone formation. The discovery of LP01‐PS with dual antibacterial and osteogenic effects, coupled with insights into its mode of action, suggests that LP01‐PS can serve as a promising implant material to enhance the success rates of total joint replacement surgeries, mitigate the risks of infection and prosthetic loosening, and foster the repair and regeneration of bone tissue.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis and a profound therapy resistance that is most evident for the mesenchymal molecular subtype of glioblastoma. Targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)‐A by the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, despite failing to improve survival in randomized trials, yields relevant benefits in glioblastoma patients such as reduction of radionecrosis, an adverse event associated with radiotherapy. This demands for continued research to identify optimal combinations of anti‐VEGF‐A and standard therapies for glioblastoma treatment. We show here that blocking VEGF‐A in an immune competent orthotopic glioblastoma mouse model resembling the adverse mesenchymal molecular subtype increases the tumoricidal effect of computed tomography (CT)‐based fractionated radiotherapy and also rectifies irradiation‐induced expression of genes with known association to mesenchymal subtype enrichment as revealed by microarray‐based transcriptome analyses of explanted tumors. VEGF‐A blockade also decreases the expression of myeloid‐cell‐related gene patterns in irradiated tumors and lowers inflammatory response in normal brain tissue after tumor irradiation. Hence, these data both provide a hint how blockade of VEGF‐A increases the effect of radiotherapy in mesenchymal glioblastoma and a mechanistic base for clinical observations reporting reduced incidences of radionecrosis in glioblastoma patients treated with radiotherapy upon concurrent administration of bevacizumab.",

However, no specific inhibitors or drugs targeting SMYD4 are currently available. In this study, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to screen small molecule lead compounds binding to SMYD4 protein. CCK8 assay, colony formation assay, EdU assay were used to analyze the viability and proliferation of tumor cells. Flow cytometric analysis was used to evaluate cell apoptosis and cell cycle. Clorazepate, Ativan, Darifenacin and Eltrombopag were found to bind with SMYD4 with the highest probability and to meet the five principles of the drug class. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that Eltrombopag had the strongest binding capacity to SMYD4 protein. The functional analysis showed that Eltrombopag inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in vivo and in vitro at low density. Moreover, Eltrombopag enhanced ubiquitination of SMYD4 protein and promoted its degradation via thyroid hormone receptor interactor 12(TRIP12). These findings suggest that Eltrombopag is a potential inhibitor of SMYD4 protein, representing a novel leading compound for SMYD4 and applied for tumor treatment.",

Addressing this issue requires understanding resistance mechanisms and developing innovative solutions. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)‐associated systems (Cas), a genome‐editing tool derived from prokaryotic defense mechanisms, offers precise targeting of antibiotic‐resistant genes. By reprogramming CRISPR‐Cas, bacteria can be killed or resensitized to antibiotics through plasmid curing. However, clinical applications face challenges, particularly in delivering CRISPR‐Cas components effectively. Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising approach for targeted delivery to tissues and cells.

It highlights the use of nanoparticles (NPs) and nanoscale carriers to deliver CRISPR‐Cas components, reviewing recent studies that combine NPs and CRISPR to target resistance genes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive loss of cognition and its distinct hyperphosphorylated Tau (p‐tau) pathology. Both insulin resistance(IRT) and p‐tau share a causal relationship in AD, whereas the connective mechanism between them remains largely unknown. Tau protein is considered the primary target to combat AD as loss of Tau function triggers neuronal loss in AD. In the prior report, it is observed that self‐therapeutic gold nanoparticles alleviate Tauopathy in models of AD. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)─polyethylene glycol 2000 (PEG 2000 )─transferrin (Tf) nanoconjugate is synthesized for passive targeting to pharmacologically regulate neuronal tau. It is observed that AuNPs─PEG 2000 ─Tf decreases p‐tau while restores insulin receptor(IR) and activates protein kinase B (AKT) kinase in SHSY5Y cell overexpressing Tau. AuNPs─PEG 2000 ─Tf downregulates transferrin receptor by inhibiting recombinant divalent metal transporter 1 protein, affecting Fe 2+ accumulation. AuNPs─PEG 2000 ─Tf improves learning ability of mice in okadaic‐acid‐induced, stereotaxic model in a dose‐dependent fashion compared to memantine and subsequently decreases both p‐tau and acetyl tau levels and upregulates the AKT signal. Changes in p‐tau/Tau index from mouse brain homogenate is diminished following AuNPs─PEG 2000 ─Tf treatment as a desired therapeutic outcome. Given AuNPs─PEG 2000 ─Tf treatment restricts pathogenic conversion of Tau (p‐tau, acetyl Tau), further investigation is warranted to bridge the connection between gold‐nanoparticle‐mediated alteration of IRT and AD progression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Malaria remains a significant health challenge in sub‐Saharan Africa, accounting for 90% of the global burden of disease. Recent studies have reported an increase in the number of malaria cases and a decrease in deaths. However, these gains can be reversed by emerging resistance to artemisinin and changing climatic conditions. Over the past 30 years, Africa has adopted artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) to treat uncomplicated malaria. Increasingly, reports of parasitic mutations conferring tolerance to artemisinin have emerged in several countries, particularly in East Africa. Although markers of resistance to various partner drugs are known, the potential failure of artemisinin can rapidly alter the situation, especially as the Kelch 13 gene, which confers resistance to artemisinin, becomes less conserved. It is anticipated that there will be a need to switch from current ACTs to new combinations or create a framework for multiple first‐line deployment. However, this poses challenges ranging from timely review of policies, training of healthcare workers, access, and deployment to the most peripheral health facilities in remote areas. This review outlines several critical factors that can potentially influence decision making in this new paradigm shift, including insufficient funding and challenges in the development of pharmaceutical products.",

Therefore, the development of new strategies to treat gastric cancer becomes urgent. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have found that all‐trans retinoic acid (Tre) can induce the polarization of M2 macrophages toward M1 in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and therefore play a due role in this cancer treatment. This research proposes to load doxorubicin (DOX) and Tre in mesoporous silica, which is then loaded into sodium alginate slow‐release Gel to obtain the final product (GEL‐MSDT). Gel‐MSDT sustained‐release hydrogel can release DOX and Tre locally in tumor, kill tumor cells, induce tumor immunogenic death, regulate tumor‐associated macrophage phenotype, and promote anti‐tumor immune response. Gel‐MSDT hydrogel can coordinate chemotherapy with immunotherapy, and delay release locally to play a lasting anti‐tumor immune effect. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments show that hydrogel can significantly inhibit tumor growth, providing an effective new strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As the scientific community celebrates the centenary year of insulin discovery, developing oral insulin delivery systems remains challenging, with disappointing progress. On the contrary, injectable formulations, despite initial setbacks due to poor patient compliance and issues with painful daily injections, have improved considerably—and currently remain the mainstay of insulin therapeutics. Advanced microneedle technology has enabled insulin delivery with minimal nociception in conjunction with automated, user‐friendly delivery platforms. Furthermore, integrating modalities like insulin pumps delivering precise doses based on blood glucose monitoring has emerged. Conversely, oral insulin delivery continues to face arcane challenges, including the denaturation of insulin due to acidic gastric juice, a hostile gut mucus barrier that immobilizes and then removes particulate formulations, and a portal circulation that shunts the residue minuscule (nano)particulate dose from the bloodstream into the liver followed by macrophage activation and hepatobiliary elimination. Unless these barriers are negotiated, breaking the impasse in oral insulin delivery remains elusive. This perspective argues in favor of focusing solely on injectable insulin while deprioritizing, if not fully ceasing, further research toward developing oral insulin formulations to prevent wasting both taxpayers’ money and unethical consumption of animal lives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Premature ovarian failure (POF) is characterized by ovarian atrophy and decreased fertility. Puerarin (Pue), an isoflavone compound, exerts protective effects on ovarian, however, with undefined mechanisms in POF. POF models were established by cyclophosphamide, and Pue and silent information regulator sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor Selisistat (EX527) were used. Next, extracted primary rat ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) were treated with EX527 and autophagy activator rapamycin (RA). The data showed that in POF rats, Pue ameliorated estrous cycle, pathological damage, and senescence with higher ovarian index, anti‐Müllerianhormone, estradiol, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, mitochondrial DNA, and lower luteinizing hormone and follicle‐stimulating hormone levels. In GCs, Pue increased cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate levels, with decreased senescence and reactive oxygen species. Moreover, Pue induced mitophagy, enhanced peroxisome proliferators‐activated receptor‐γ coactivator‐1alpha (PGC‐1α), and reduced malondialdehyde, p16INK4a, p‐adenosine 5′‐monophosphate (AMP)‐activated protein kinase (AMPK)/AMPK, mitochondrial transcription factor A, nuclear respiratory factor 1, dynamin‐related protein 1, and mitochondrial fission 1 expression. Notably, the EX527 addition offset the above effects, while RA further reversed effects of EX527. In conclusion, Pue activated mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and mitophagy through up‐regulation of SIRT1/PGC‐1α pathway to ameliorate POF, providing a theoretical support for clinical application of Pue in POF.",

Here, an upconversion‐based strategy is described for remote deep brain modulation, which is an all‐optical solution for treating PD in rodent animals without any tethering interferences. It is demonstrated that both high frequency stimulation and inhibition of subthalamic nucleus (STN), can improve the motor function of Hemi‐Parkinsonian rodent models, potentially providing a specific and flexible therapeutic alternative for treating PD. A multi‐modal approach is further taken that combines optogenetics and electrophysiology recording, and found that high frequency optogenetic inhibition of STN work similarly as high frequency activation to rescue the pathologic electrical activity in the motor cortex and restore the motor deficiency in Hemi‐Parkinsonian rodents. It is also shown that indirect inhibitory modification of entopeduncular nucleus (EP) within the basal ganglia system, which is induced by either STN inhibition or activation, plays a critical role in the STN‐DBS induced therapeutic effects in the Hemi‐Parkinsonian animals. These results provide first experimental evidence supporting a working principle of STN‐DBS by disruption of anterograde signal transmission along the indirect pathway of basal ganglia, and can be instructive for future clinical treatment of PD with DBS.",

This review comprehensively examines the different strategies for synthesizing double‐network (DN) DNA hydrogels, delving into their classification based on their response to biological and nonbiological stimuli. This highlights the innovative methodologies that enable the design of these hybrid hydrogels, which guarantee high‐toughness and low‐cost materials. This review also reports certain recent studies on these hydrogels, emphasizing the intricate relationship between the structure and performance of DN DNA hydrogels and confirming their tailored mechanical properties achieved through programmable DNA sequences and versatile ligation techniques. This report not only provides an overview of the mechanical properties of DNA hydrogels from a synthetic standpoint for various applications but also discusses methods for regulating these properties. Therefore, this report anticipates that readers will procure an ample portrayal of innovative synthesis techniques, diverse classifications, and promising applications of DN‐DNA hydrogels, offering a roadmap for future research and development in this transformative area of materials science.",

Stem cell therapy (SCT) and skin replacement therapy (SRT) offer promising solutions by addressing prolonged inflammation, impaired cell proliferation, and reduced extracellular support. Here, based on the origin of cells, SCTs are categorized into embryonic, induced pluripotent, fetal, and adult stem cells (ASCs). Mesenchymal stem cells are among the most employed types of ASCs in clinical trials for treating DFUs. Furthermore, their delivery routes, and stem‐cell‐derived products are also discussed. However, the lack of phase III/V clinical trials limits their clinical use. SRTs are classified by tissue origin (human or animal) and product cellularity. Clinical trials and systematic reviews indicate that placenta‐based grafts (e.g., EpiFix), acellular dermal matrices from human cadaver skin (e.g., DermACell and Graftjacket), and bioengineered cell‐based products (e.g., Apligraf and Dermagraft) are the most effective and safe for SRT. Both SCT and SRT are evolving fields with ongoing challenges, including injection barriers, cell reprogramming risks, ethical concerns, foreign body reactions, and a lack of long‐term follow‐up studies.",

Anecdotally, patients report improved tissue healing outcomes following treatment. The most likely explanation for this is plasma‐generated reactive species which are inflammatory but also activate cellular signaling pathways, stimulate antioxidant responses, and activate immune cells. In this study, we aimed to determine the immediate and long‐term molecular effects of a single plasma treatment on surgically injured muscle and the soft tissue envelope. We used RNA sequencing, histology, and immunohistochemistry to determine changes to the tissue following treatment. Neutrophils and mast cells rapidly mobilize 6 h after treatment in conjunction with an upregulated cellular antioxidant response. Additionally, genes identified by RNAseq indicate upregulated pro‐regenerative muscle‐tissue‐protective gene transcripts and downregulated apoptotic pathway transcripts in the muscle tissue 6 h after treatment. The histology and RNAseq results from 4‐ and 14‐days post plasma treatment indicate that these early inflammatory and antioxidant events drive muscle regeneration to skew toward myogenic differentiation over adipogenesis. Thus, we conclude that a single plasma treatment results in an immediate inflammatory and antioxidant response that enhances long‐term muscle fiber repair through reduced adipogenesis.",

However, a strategy is still required to effectively overcome the metabolic adaptation of TNBC with thermotolerance during thermotherapy, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes. In this study, the polydopamine‐integrated nanomedicine is designed, with glucose oxidase (GOx) chemically conjugated to its surface and curcumin (Cur)‐loaded calcium phosphate (CaP) shell. The outer CaP layer disintegrates in response to the acidic environment of tumor cells, releasing calcium ions with the calcium efflux inhibitor Cur, which causes mitochondrial functional disruption by inducing mitochondrial calcium overload. Concurrently, GOx consumes intracellular glucose to inhibit glycolysis. The dual intervention of mitochondrial metabolism and glycolysis serves to counteract the metabolic adaptations in TNBC, effectively blocking the pathways of energy supply, which results in a 56.61% reduction of ATP. In addition, inhibition of ATP production by dual metabolic regulation can downregulate the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and sensitized PTT, the HSP70 level and HSP90 level are downregulated by 25.68% and 41.89%, respectively. This study provides new insights into combining metabolic therapy and PTT for the treatment of TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract KITENIN (KAI1 C‐terminal interacting tetraspanin, VANGL1) has oncogenic functions and plays a role in the progression of colorectal cancer by interacting with many proteins, including ErbB4, DVL2, RACK1, and KSRP. The receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4 forms a complex with KITENIN to activate the downstream AP‐1 signaling axis. Therefore, disrupting this oncogenic complex is a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study, the potential therapeutic effects of the flavonoid hispidulin on the KITENIN/ErbB4 oncogenic complex and its signaling are examined. The effects of hispidulin on the KITENIN/ErbB4 oncogenic complex and colorectal cancer progression are evaluated by in vitro and in silico studies, including the investigation of oncometabolite levels. The results show that hispidulin binds to ErbB4 and blocks the interaction between KITENIN and ErbB4, thereby reducing KITENIN‐mediated cell motility, AP‐1 signaling, transcriptional regulator expression, aerobic glycolysis, and levels of metabolites associated with energy metabolism in colorectal cancer. In addition, hispidulin causes the lysosomal degradation of ErbB4 and KITENIN. Hispidulin has a promising therapeutic effect on signaling mediated by the KITENIN/ErbB4 oncogenic complex.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Advancements in wound care have necessitated the development of innovative dressings that address the limitations of traditional options while enhancing the healing process. Bacterial cellulose (BC) stands out due to its exceptional properties, including high water retention, biocompatibility, mechanical strength, and modification adaptability. This review critically compares BC‐based wound dressings with traditional and next‐generation alternatives, highlighting their unique advantages and potential as ideal wound coverings. BC's ability to maintain a moist environment, promote tissue regeneration, and minimize secondary injuries during dressing changes positions it as a superior option in wound care. BC's nanoporous structure also supports its functionalization with bioactive agents, antimicrobial compounds, and advanced fabrication techniques such as 3D printing and electrospinning. These modifications allow for tailored solutions that meet specific wound care requirements. Despite high production costs and the absence of intrinsic antimicrobial properties, BC surpasses many traditional dressings by addressing key areas such as moisture retention, biocompatibility, and ease of use. This study emphasizes BC's potential to transform wound care by combining its inherent properties with innovative modifications. BC‐based dressings offer promising avenues for developing more effective, tailored, and sustainable wound management strategies by bridging the gap between traditional and next‐generation solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tumor vaccines have emerged as a transformative strategy in cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating substantial clinical potential. However, the genetic heterogeneity of tumor cells often leads to immune escape, limiting the effectiveness of traditional therapies that rely on a single antigen. Tumor cell‐derived antigens offer a significant advantage in this regard, as they represent the unique molecular profile of the tumor, allowing for a broader and more diverse activation of the immune system. This diversity enhances the ability to overcome immune escape mechanisms, increasing the effective tumor eradication and reducing the risk of relapse. This review systematically examines two major sources of antigens: exogenous antigens, including tumor cells, tumor lysates, tumor exosomes, and tumor cell membranes, and endogenous antigens, which arise from immunogenic cell death (ICD) and possess unique advantages in eliciting strong immune activation. This work investigates synergistic therapies aimed at boosting tumor immunogenicity and counteracting the immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work reviews recent advances and challenges in tumor cell‐derived antigen strategies for immune activation, emphasizing their potential to overcome limitations and facilitate the clinical translation of tumor vaccines.",

Here, a straightforward synthesis method is proposed to design bioresponsive nanoprobes capable of achieving high‐resolution bioimaging of liver fibrosis. Janus MnO 2 ‐coated Ag/Ag 2 S nanoparticles modified by polyethylene glycol (denoted as jMAP) can inherit both the activatable properties from Ag/Ag 2 S and MnO 2 components in the pathological microenvironment. Multiple lines of evidence supported that overexpressed levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in liver fibrosis efficiently transformed jMAP nanoprobes to Ag 2 S products, activating bright fluorescence in the second near‐infrared window (NIR‐II, 1000–1700 nm). In addition, the catalase‐like and superoxide dismutase‐like activities of jMAP probes reduce hypoxia and oxidative stress with a clearance rate of about 73.3% toward ROS, thereby downregulating hypoxia‐inducible factor (HIF‐1 α ) and NADPH oxidase‐4 (NOX‐4) by 49.5% and 47.9%, respectively. Overall, the developed jMAP probes demonstrate impressive diagnostic accuracy, offering transformative prospects for liver fibrosis diagnosis.",

This study evaluates the PBM effects on spatial working memory (WM) and cellular mechanisms in healthy adult male rats, focusing on CCO activity, c‐Fos, and synaptogenesis‐related proteins. PBM (810 nm, 40 Hz, 20 J cm −2 ) is applied for five consecutive days (PBM‐C) or five alternating days (PBM‐A). PBM improves spatial WM in both groups compared to controls. CCO activity decreases in the prefrontal and retrosplenial cortex, as well as in the hippocampus, suggesting more efficient energy use during cognitive tasks. PBM increases c‐Fos expression in the prefrontal and parietal cortex, reflecting heightened neuronal activity. Synapsin‐I levels rise in the prefrontal cortex for both protocols, while PBM‐C increases PSD‐95 in the hippocampus. GFAP expression decreases in cortical regions with both protocols, while PBM‐C increases it in the prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that PBM PBM‐C enhances prefrontal and hippocampal synapses, potentially underlying observed WM improvements.

However, critical concerns remain regarding their safety, in view of inducing systemic inflammation. To address this, semi‐synthetic bacterial vesicles (SyBV) have recently been developed, directly derived from bacterial cell membranes. These vesicles have reduced toxicity but retained immunomodulatory ability, which is important for immuno‐oncology purposes. In this study, the manufacturing process of SyBV has been further refined to meet Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. Multiple steps are reconsidered in the optimized method, including adaptation of centrifugation steps, benzonase treatment, and elimination of sonication steps, thereby producing a new set of optimized SyBV, designated as SyBV Opti . Similarly to SyBV isolated using the previous protocol, SyBV Opti do not activate macrophages but stimulate dendritic cells to produce IL‐12 in a dose‐dependent manner—moreover, these vesicles attenuate tumor growth in vivo in a model of malignant melanoma. Further, the optimized process applies to a GMP‐compatible Escherichia coli source for producing SyBV Opti under GMP conditions. Collectively, these findings describe a reliable technique for large‐scale production of SyBV with preserved therapeutic potential, allowing GMP manufacturing and translation of these bioactive vesicles into clinical practice.",

This perspective highlights how AI is bridging the gap between laboratory research and clinical application through three major pillars: 1) Mechanistic Decoding, where AI integrates multi‐omics data to understand immune system complexity and predict molecular interactions; 2) Therapeutic Innovation, where AI designs personalized immunotherapies, such as optimizing antibody‐antigen binding and immune receptor dynamics; and 3) Clinical Acceleration, where AI enhances clinical trial designs, speeds up drug development, and adjusts therapies in real‐time based on patient responses.

Multi‐characteristic Opsin (MCO) is an optogenetics therapy candidate that is undergoing multiple clinical trials, including randomized control trials. However, its cellular topography and mechanism of action have remained unknown. Here, we reveal the biophysical characteristics of the MCO molecule, including its unique structure and function, using a combination of predictive protein modeling, western blotting‐based protease protection assay, and electrophysiology. MCO’s first extracellular subunit forms a cation‐channel pore, while the second subunit is partially embedded in the membrane, extending to the third intracellular cytoplasmic subunit. Functional studies using whole‐cell recordings showed that MCO is activated by broadband visible light with fast on‐off kinetics with high photosensitivity, and large dynamic range across the visible spectrum, enabling best‐in‐class light‐activation of MCO‐expressing cells. Further, multi‐electrode array recording confirmed multi‐color light‐activation of MCO‐expressing neurons in the retina. The unique topological and functional activation features of fused MCO protein represent novel findings linking the in‐vitro and in‐vivo efficacy of this opsin, which is particularly important for neuromodulation leading to vision restoration in retinal degenerative diseases and other neurological therapies.",

Recently, ferroptosis has been identified as a key mechanism of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) death, emerging as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating aortic aneurysms. Here, a drug‐delivery nanoparticle system combining tea polyphenol‐based nanoparticles and a ferroptosis inhibitor is developed. This system, formed through the oxidative polymerization and self‐assembly of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), efficiently encapsulates Ferrostatin‐1 (Fer‐1) during self‐assembly and is subsequently functionalized with fibronectin (FN) for targeted treatment of angiotensin II‐induced AAA. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that TPN‐Fer‐1@FN effectively inhibits ferroptosis, suppresses the inflammatory response, and reduces matrix degradation, while preserving the normal contractile function of VSMCs and modulating the NOTCH3 signaling pathway. Moreover, the TPN‐Fer‐1@FN nanosystem exhibited low toxicity and good biocompatibility. These findings suggest that TPN‐Fer‐1@FN represents a promising therapeutic strategy for inhibiting ferroptosis and modulating the pathological processes underlying AAA.",

When photochemical investigations are conducted alone, the SiPc Φ ∆ value is measured as 0.68; however, when light and ultrasound are combined, the value increased by 25% to 0.85 in sono‐photochemical studies. The Q‐band of the calculated SiPc UV–vis spectrum is found to be in very good agreement with the experimental data, with the computed oscillator strengths (the absorption intensities) for Q‐band being higher than for B‐band. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of PDT and SPDT using SiPc are evaluated in MCF‐7 and MDA‐MB‐231 breast cancer cell lines. The results demonstrated that SPDT, combining light and ultrasound, significantly enhanced cytotoxicity compared to PDT alone. Additionally, SPDT triggered pyroptosis, characterized by upregulation of NLRP3, CASP1, IL1B, and IL18, revealing a distinct mechanism of cell death.

Various RNA medicines have received clinical approval, while others are still in the research phase or undergoing preclinical trials.

Furthermore, the commonly used chemistries in drug delivery systems and strategies for targeting specific cells, as well as the key nanocarriers used in RNA loading, are explored.

In this study, it is explored lyophilisation as a strategy to extend the shelf life of MSC‐sEV while maintaining their structural integrity and biological functionality. Lyophilised sEV are stored at four different temperatures—room temperature (RT), 4, −20°C, and −80 °C—for durations of 1, 3, and 6 months. This findings reveal that normal refrigeration temperature of 4 °C storage is suitable for maintaining sEV stability for up to 1 month, while −20°C and −80 °C are more effective for longer durations, preserving sEV integrity and functionality for 6 months and beyond. These results underscore the importance of optimizing storage protocols for lyophilised MSC‐sEV to ensure their viability for clinical and research applications.

Aptamers, highly specific affinity molecules, are extensively studied for targeted drug delivery using nanocarriers to enhance anti‐cancer efficacy. This study focused on HER2‐responsive co‐delivery of doxorubicin and hyaluronidase via aptamer‐gated mesoporous silica nanoparticles to improve therapeutic outcomes in solid tumors. SK‐BR‐3 spheroids are employed as a model for resistant tumor environments in solid tumors. Previous research is shown that conjugating cytotoxic drugs with nanoparticles or cells enhances drug penetration into tumor spheroids. In this work, doxorubicin is loaded into mesoporous silica nanoparticles and capped with HER2‐specific aptamers, while the particle surface is functionalized with hyaluronidase. This dual‐functionalized nanocarrier system achieves an ≈8.5‐fold increase in cytotoxicity compared to aptamer‐targeted delivery lacking hyaluronidase.

This study investigates its osteogenic and antioxidative effects on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro and its regenerative effect on rat femoral fractures in vivo. Cytotoxicity is assessed via MTT assay, and osteogenic differentiation via ALP and ARS staining. A rat femoral fracture model validates its therapeutic effects, with micro‐CT and histological assessments evaluating healing outcomes. Gene and protein expression in osteogenic and signaling pathways are analyzed through RT‐qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. ROS levels are measured using DCFH‐DA staining. Results show liquiritin enhances osteogenesis in BMSCs, evidenced by increased ALP activity and calcium deposition. In rats, it facilitates bone regeneration and upregulates phosphorylated ERK and JNK. Additionally, it reduces ROS generation post‐oxidative injury, boosting NRF2, HO1, and NQO1 expression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite renewed interest in IL‐12 as a cancer immunotherapy due to its ability to stimulate the adaptive immune system, its short half‐life and narrow therapeutic window continues to present challenges for effective delivery. Previous studies with IL‐12 have investigated the effects of route of delivery or sustained delivery of the cytokine on its efficacy but are unable to simultaneously investigate the effects of both within the same system. This work seeks to address this gap by utilizing an elastin‐like polypeptide (ELP) carrier, which can undergo a thermally triggered phase transition to a gel‐like depot, to probe the effects of both sustained release and spatial delivery of IL‐12. By conjugating IL‐12 with an ELP, this work creates an IL‐12‐ELP fusion that can be injected intratumorally or subcutaneously to form a sustained‐release depot. In a B16F10 murine model, intratumoral injection of a depot‐forming IL‐12‐ELP fusion significantly improved survival compared to free IL‐12. IL‐12‐ELP is retained within the tumor approximately fourfold longer than free IL‐12, resulting in higher CD8+ T cell recruitment at the tumor and local concentrations of inflammatory cytokines at Day 2. Taken together, this work provides insights into rational cytokine delivery, the importance of tumor localization, and the benefits of sustained release.",

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of combining Albumin‐Bound Paclitaxel (nab‐PTX) with an anti‐PD‐1 antibody and aims to identify potential biomarkers to optimize therapeutic outcomes. The murine model of PDAC is established by subcutaneously injecting the murine pancreatic cancer cell line Panc02 into C57BL/6J mice. The mice are treated with either an anti‐PD‐1 antibody, nab‐PTX, or nab‐PTX plus anti‐PD‐1 antibody, with untreated mice serving as the control. Tumor growth, immune cell infiltration, cytokine levels, overall survival, organ damage, and gene expression profiles are analyzed. The combination therapy shows superior efficacy compared to nab‐PTX and non‐inferior efficacy compared to the anti‐PD‐1 antibody. Moreover, this strategy significantly reduces the risk of irAEs and hyperprogression caused by the anti‐PD‐1 antibody.

This copolymer was further grafted with polyurethane (PU) through in‐situ polymerization using its diisocyanate chain ends to balance its hydrophobicity for controlled drug delivery. Characterization by various spectroscopic techniques confirmed the structure, shape, and size of the synthesized polymer; thermal analysis revealed higher glass transition temperatures, and enhanced thermal stability.

UV–Vis and FTIR demonstrated strong polymer–drug interactions, correlating with the sustained drug release observed, in contrast to pure PU and copolymer. Drug‐loaded graft copolymer was incorporated into 3D‐printed scaffolds, supporting in vitro cell growth for 7 days, confirming biocompatibility. An in vivo melanoma mouse model study showed considerable tumor reduction without any side effects, unlike traditional chemotherapy, owing to localized hydrogel injection beneath the tumor for sustained release.

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, cellular immunotherapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR‐T) therapy, have emerged as promising treatment options for cancer, demonstrating particularly strong efficacy against liquid tumors. By introducing tumor‐targeting CAR genes into patient immune cells ex vivo and reintroducing the modified cells into the patient, tumor cells expressing specific surface markers can be selectively killed. However, existing virus‐based methods for producing cellular products are plagued by high costs, which seriously limit their adoption. In this paper, the development of a mechanical transfection device is described, which passes cells through micron‐sized pores and is capable of delivering different molecules into cells. The effects of parameters such as pore size, flow rate, and payload concentration on transfection efficiency are studied and used to inform a standard transfection protocol. Finally, the delivery of CAR‐encoding mRNA into primary T‐cells is demonstrated to manufacture CAR‐T cells, which secrete IFN‐γ and TNF‐α in an antigen‐specific manner. As the method is developed from the outset to be easily deployable and scalable, it is envisioned that it will be able to impact cell manufacturing in the near future.",

This diversity poses challenges for the accurate detection and analysis of CTCs, which are essential for precise diagnosis and clinical decision‐making. Additionally, spatiotemporal changes in physiological systems and the presence of circulating tumor endothelial cells (CTECs) contribute to fluctuations in the numbers and properties of both individual and clustered CTCs, affecting molecular changes and metastatic potential. It is imperative to carefully consider these variations during blood sampling, CTC detection, result analysis, and treatment planning to ensure successful clinical outcomes. The review has explored various aspects of CTC heterogeneity, emphasizing additional factors that may impact the reliability of CTC analyses and their clinical relevance for patient care.

    "abstract": "Abstract Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved anticancer treatment based on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when a photosensitizing agent (PS) is irradiated with specific light. Typically, irradiation is performed to cover the entire tumor or treatment area. However, this approach presents some disadvantages, including irradiation of the surrounding normal tissue. Therefore, this study introduces a novel phototherapeutic approach using single‐point laser irradiation. With the plasma membrane as the primary organelle target, it is demonstrated that single‐point laser irradiation induces plasma membrane damage in cancer cells using two clinically approved fluorescent markers for Glioblastoma: Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), which localizes to the plasma membrane, and Sodium Fluorescein (NaF), which remains in the extracellular space, contacting the membrane. Single‐point laser irradiation in photodynamic therapy induces plasma membrane disruption in both cases, resulting in selective necrotic cancer cell death. Interestingly, this approach induces cell death from within the spheroids, and the cell death gradually extends to the rest of the spheroid, minimizing damage to the surrounding tissue. In conclusion, this study presents a novel approach using focused laser irradiation and clinically approved dyes to induce precise, targeted cell death within the tumor, suggesting potential for theranostic applications in tumor eradication.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Current treatments for cancer such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and chemodynamic therapy often exhibit poor efficacy and severe side effects; this, cancer remains a major global health challenge. In the ongoing exploration of therapeutic strategies with improved outcomes and reduced adverse effects, phototherapies (PTs), including photothermal (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), are gaining attention due to their non‐invasive and targeted nature, resulting in reduced side effects. However, further material optimizations are needed to enhance PT performance. Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising PTT/PDT nanoplatforms due to their tunable structures, high surface area, and ability to host photoactive agents. Their porous architecture facilitates efficient photosensitizer encapsulation and promotes light‐induced thermal effects, improving therapeutic stability and efficacy. The therapeutic potential of MOFs is further enhanced when combined with multiple treatment modalities. This review focuses on the roles of Fe/Cu‐based MOFs in PTs, their synthesis, underlying mechanisms in PTT/PDT, and recent design advancements. It also summarizes the progress in Cu/Fe‐MOF nanocomposite development over the past 5 years, from construction to synergistic applications. These insights can inform future efforts in the clinical translation of Cu/Fe‐MOFs in cancer theranostics.",

Emerging evidence indicates that Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) possess significant neuroprotective properties. However, the underlying mechanism by which LBP alleviates hyperglycemia‐aggravated cerebral I/R injury remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of LBP on hyperglycemia‐aggravated cerebral I/R injury using in vivo and in vitro models. Rats are randomly assigned to the following groups: normoglycemic (NG), hyperglycemic (HG), and LBP‐pretreated hyperglycemic (LBP) groups. Streptozotocin‑induced hyperglycemic rats undergo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 30 min, followed by reperfusion for 1, 3, and 7 days. Meanwhile, an in vitro model of hyperglycemia‐aggravated cerebral I/R injury is established using murine hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells subjected to high glucose (HG) conditions combined with oxygen deprivation and reoxygenation (OD). The results demonstrate that compared to the NG group, the HG group exhibits significantly increased neurological deficit and larger infarct area. Pre‐treatment with LBP significantly attenuates these hyperglycemia‐aggravated neurological deficits and reduces the infarct area. Furthermore, LBP treatment elevates the cell viability of HT22 cells in the HG and OD groups. Additionally, LBP significantly alleviates the hyperglycemia‐induced downregulation of β‐catenin and p‐GSK‐3β expression both in vivo and in vitro. These results demonstrate that LBP alleviates hyperglycemia‐aggravated cerebral I/R injury by upregulating the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Osteosarcoma is an aggressive pediatric, adolescent, and young adult bone cancer with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that limits immunotherapy efficacy. Tumor‐associated macrophages, key players in immunosuppression and metastasis, are abundant in the osteosarcoma TME. The cGAS/STING pathway has emerged as a target for enhancing anti‐tumor immunity. Here, this work investigates whether STING stimulation could reprogramme macrophages toward a tumoricidal M1‐like phenotype and enhance doxorubicin efficacy against osteosarcoma. These results show that while doxorubicin induces cell death of osteosarcoma cells, it fails to activate STING in macrophages. However, pre‐treatment of macrophages with a STING agonist enhances M1‐like polarization of macrophages when indirectly co‐cultured with chemotherapy‐treated osteosarcoma cells, regardless of the original macrophage phenotype. Importantly, this work observes a loss of STING protein when cells are excessively stimulated with a STING agonist and sequential dosing offered no advantage over a single treatment. Finally, this work demonstrates that the combined therapy of doxorubicin and a single dose of neoadjuvant STING agonist synergistically increases osteosarcoma cell death via M1‐macrophages compared to either therapy alone. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of STING agonists to reprogram macrophages within the TME, and improve chemotherapy efficacy, offering a promising new strategy to enhance osteosarcoma treatment options.",

Naturally derived ginsenosides including 20(S)‐protopanaxadiol (PPD), exhibit promising antidepressant properties although issues like poor aqueous solubility and low oral bioavailability exist. This study developed and evaluated PPD‐loaded PEG‐PCL nanomicelles (Nano‐PPD) in a murine model of corticosterone (CORT)‐induced depression. Nano‐PPD yields spherical nanoparticles with a uniform diameter of 165 nm. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that Nano‐PPD increased PPD bioavailability by ~3‐fold and prolonged circulation time by 1.5‐fold increase of Tmax compared with free PPD. In 21‐day intervention of CORT‐challenged C57BL/6J male mice, both PPD and Nano‐PPD effectively alleviated depressive‐like behaviors according to increased locomotor activity in the open field test and reduce immobility duration in forced swim and tail suspension tests. Nano‐PPD outperformed free PPD at equivalent doses (p &lt; 0.05). Mechanistically, Nano‐PPD activated the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and upregulated BDNF expression in the prefrontal cortex with implications in mood regulation. Safety assessments confirmed that Nano‐PPD did not alter the serum biomarker levels nor the histopathology in the liver and kidney. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Nano‐PPD possesses favorable pharmacokinetics and potent activity for modulating the neurotrophic pathways, representing a promising translational strategy for the prevention and treatment of depression.",

Conventional in vitro and in vivo models are limited in their ability to accurately recapitulate the inner ear microenvironment and drug pharmacokinetics. The emergence of organ‐on‐chip technology provides a promising alternative for studying inner ear drug delivery by enabling the reconstruction of key inner ear barriers, such as the round window membrane, blood‐labyrinth barrier, and perilymph‐endolymph barrier, in a microfluidic platform. This review discusses the current strategies for inner ear drug delivery, the challenges associated with each approach, and the potential of an inner ear barrier organ chip to overcome these limitations. Incorporating relevant cell types, extracellular matrix components, and biomechanical cues, the inner ear organ chips offer a valuable platform for drug screening, efficacy assessment, and disease modeling. The validation of these models and their successful application in otologic drug development will require a multidisciplinary approach involving tissue engineering, microfabrication, and cell and molecular biology. As inner ear organ chip technology advances, it is expected to accelerate the development of targeted and efficient drug delivery systems for the treatment of hearing disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nanoformulation is often used to improve the solubility and uptake of bioactives; however, it also protects sensitive bioactives from chemical decomposition. A class of biocompatible emulsifiers created by conjugating hemp protein with green tea polyphenols is reported. A simple pH‐assisted coupling protocol is employed to synthesize covalent and non‐covalent conjugates, which are then used to produce 5‐methoxy‐ N,N‐ dimethyltryptamine (5‐MeO‐DMT) enriched hemp oil nanoemulsions (NEs) in water with an average droplet size of ca. 200 nm and ζ potential values of ca. −40 mV. The de novo emulsifiers protect the sensitive drug under conditions of simulated oxidative stress, an indication that the antioxidant properties of polyphenols are retained within the emulsifier. These emulsions are resistant to a wide variety of emulsion‐breaking stressors and demonstrated remarkable colloidal stability over a period of 4 weeks with no evidence of phase separation. Fluorescence and confocal imaging confirmed cellular uptake of the formulation, while in vitro cytotoxicity assays showed acceptable cell viability with drug‐loaded nanoemulsions. The sensitivity of 5‐MeO‐DMT mandates some form of formulation for reasonable bioavailability and reproducible dosages; our novel nanodelivery platform provides an elegant solution to this problem.",

GP induced mycobacterial superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reduced catalase activity. GN neither reduces nor increases SOD and catalase activities in mycobacteria.

The hydrogel with HT presented a degradation rate of 99.8% at 24 h in vitro, a peak of HT release at 30 min, and higher scavenging activity at 24 h. In in vitro assays, the hydrogel with HT did not change the cell viability of fibroblasts and macrophages. The hydrogel with HT promoted cell migration and reduced lipid peroxidation in mouse fibroblasts under high glucose conditions. The hydrogel with HT also induced higher levels of interleukin‐10 and heme oxygenase‐1 under low and high glucose conditions in mouse macrophages. Topic application of hydrogel with HT augmented the collagen deposition and reduced the width of granulation tissue 7 days after wounding in diabetic mice. In conclusion, the hydrogel with HT is not cytotoxic, efficiently improves diabetic wound healing and it can be a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of diabetic wounds.",

These copolymers are used to elaborate asymmetric membranes by the phase inversion method. Incorporation of PAMPS significantly enhanced key membrane properties, including surface porosity, ion exchange capacity (IEC), and Young's modulus (up to 0.92 MPa), yielding biomaterials with mechanical properties similar to human skin. The membranes exhibited high swelling capacity in physiological fluids (up to 467%) and excellent enzymatic biodegradability (92% over 30 days). Increasing PAMPS content resulted in non‐hemolytic surfaces, and conferred strong antibacterial activity against E. coli , achieving inhibition rates of 106–153% compared to gentamicin (40 ppm). Notably, membranes containing 20–30 mol% PAMPS showed selective cytotoxicity toward cervical and colon cancer cells, significantly inhibiting their proliferation up to 48 h, while promoting the proliferation of fibroblasts, monocytes, and osteoblasts. Moreover, membranes with 20 mol% PAMPS modulated inflammatory response in human monocytes by reducing the secretion of pro‐inflammatory monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1 (MCP‐1) cytokines and enhancing anti‐inflammatory interleukin 10 (IL‐10) cytokine production. These findings highlight PVA‐co‐PAMPS membranes as multifunctional platforms with potential for anticancer therapy, including implantable scaffolds, topical patches, and advanced in vitro cancer models.",

Herein, Polyporus Amboinensis Lam (PAL)‐functionalized selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) (hereafter referred to as PAL‐SeNPs) are fabricated as a cancer‐targeted nanosystem to antagonize the BBB and thus enhance anti‐glioma ability. The robust synthesis of PAL‐SeNPs confers the nanosystem with high‐stability and the ideal size for efficient endocytosis in glioma cells. The structure similarity of PAL with α v β 3 integrin, which is overexpressed on glioma cells, increases the selectivity between glioma cells and normal gliocytes via the PAL/α v β 3 integrin‐mediated targeting effect, and displays a favorable anti‐glioma effect by hastening m‐TOR‐mediated cell apoptosis. Pharmacokinetics analysis demonstrates that PAL‐SeNPs improves the half‐life of SeNPs in blood and ensures their sufficient accumulation in the brain. PAL‐SeNPs facilitate effective transportability across the BBB and exhibit superior permeability into glioma tumor spheroid. Taken together, this study provides a robust strategy of using SeNPs to overcome the BBB for enhanced anti‐glioma treatment.",

Another phytoplankton subclass of interest is the coccolithophore, which produces unique calcium carbonate plates with distinct architectural features called coccoliths. The unique morphological characteristics of coccoliths resembling the shape of a wagon wheel allows a higher surface area, thus an increased amount of immobilized therapeutic agent on their surface compared to a synthetic calcium carbonate microparticle.

Most studies have relied on viral vectors, which are likely limited to single dosing due to their immunogenicity, thus reducing their therapeutic potential. Therefore, there is a need to develop nonviral approaches that allow for delivery and repeat dosing of CRISPR/Cas9 therapies to skeletal muscle. Here, biocompatible multi‐arm polyrotaxane (PRX) nanocarriers, are iteratively optimized for packaging large plasmid DNA for delivery to muscle cells. The PRXs are optimized by addition of a disulfide‐responsive linker that enhances plasmid release. Furthermore, conjugation of peptides leads to quicker uptake and improved transfection efficiency in humanized dystrophic muscle cells in vitro. Finally, in vitro delivery of PRXs complexed with a CRISPR/Cas9 platform demonstrates effective deletion of DMD exons 45–55, a therapeutic strategy with potential to restore the reading frame for half of DMD patients. This work represents the first PRX platform that is optimized and designed for delivery of large plasmid DNA, such as CRISPR/Cas9, to dystrophic muscle cells.",

However, owing to difficulties in their fabrication, nMOFs with both rod‐like shape and mesoporosity for tumor imaging or tumor‐targeted cargo delivery are largely unexplored. Herein, a nanoscale rod‐like [{Cu 2 (ndc) 2 (dabco)] n (Cu‐MOF), a copper(II) nMOF, is successfully endowed with mesoporosity via defect engineering. Owing to the mesopores, the as‐synthesized defective rod‐like Cu‐MOF is able to load an aggregation‐induced‐emission (AIE) photosensitizer (PS) with inhibited sensitization at high loading weight percentage. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the rod‐like Cu‐MOF can afford the AIE PS payload with enhanced tumor targeting specificity and penetration depth. After optimal tumor enrichment and cancer cell uptake, Cu(II) in the defective Cu‐MOF efficiently depletes intracellular glutathione and causes dissociation of the Cu‐MOF to release the PS payload and recover its efficient reactive oxygen species generation. Concomitantly, bright fluorescence is afforded by the AIE PS during delivery, contributing to image‐guided cancer‐cell‐activated photodynamic therapy with enhanced therapeutic effects.",

The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a predominant role and may be a promising molecular target for CRPC. However, the toxicity of the dual PI3K inhibitors in clinical trials limits their clinical efficacy for CRPC. To solve this problem, a highly integrated precision nanomedicine strategy is employed to molecularly and physically target CRPC through enhanced targeted drug delivery efficiency and reduced unwanted side‐effects. Gedatolisib (Ge), a potent inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR, is formulated into disulfide cross‐linked micelle platform (NanoGe), which exhibits excellent water solubility, small size, excellent stability with redox stimulus‐responsive disintegration, and preferential uptake at tumor sites. NanoGe improves the anti‐neoplastic effect of free Ge by 53 times in PC‐3M cells and 13 times in C4‐2B cells, through its enhanced uptake via caveolae‐ and clathrin‐mediated endocytic pathways and the subsequent inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, resulting in Bax/Bcl‐2‐dependent apoptosis. In vivo, NanoGe shows superior efficacy than free Ge, and synergizes with nanoformulated cabazitaxel (NanoCa) as a nanococktail format to achieve a cure rate of 83%. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate the potency of NanoGe in combination with NanoCa against CRPC.",

However, their application in cancer therapy is greatly limited due to the lack of tissue selectivity, as they are widely distributed in most tissues following in vivo administration. To introduce specificity and improve tumor targeting, a combination of a cell‐penetrating peptide (CADY) and a targeting ligand, the laminin receptor binding peptide (YIGSR) to target the 37/67 kDa laminin receptor, known to be upregulated in most cancer cells and to be correlated with the invasiveness and metastatic potential, is formulated. The targeting CPP named “Y‐CADY” does not induce any change in the physico‐chemical properties (secondary structure, small interference RNA (siRNA) complexation, size, and charge) of CADY. Interestingly, Y‐CADY is more efficient than CADY for gene silencing in cell lines, and more potent for targeting and for inducing apoptosis of tumor xenografts in zebrafish embryos. The present study demonstrates that the novel targeting CPP “Y‐CADY” is efficient for gene silencing and can serve as a vector to target cancer cells in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oral nucleic acid therapy for transgene expressions of insulin in vivo is an emerging strategy in treating type I diabetes (T1D) to address poor patient compliance for daily insulin injections. However, this strategy to achieve high delivery efficiency is impeded by biological barriers including gastrointestinal trafficking, enzymatic degradation, mucosal transport, etc. This article addresses the mucosal transport barrier by adopting a hydrophilic and neutral surface onto cationic lipid/DNA nanoparticles to reduce the obstacle of permeation through the mucus. A facile one‐pot method to coat the PEG layer on a (2,3‐dioleoyloxy‐propyl)‐trimethylammonium (DOTAP)/DNA nanocomplex for expressing insulin is presented. A kinetically controlled mixing technique, namely flash nanocomplexation (FNC), is used to rapidly mix 1,2‐dimyristoyl‐ rac ‐glycero‐3‐methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)‐2000 (DMG‐PEG) and DOTAP with plasmid DNA. The produced uniform nanoparticles (60 ± 2.1 nm) with a PEG surface demonstrates enhanced transportation in the mucus layer of the GI tract. A systemic transgene expression is confirmed, and the expressed insulin maintains the blood glucose level of streptozotocin (STZ)‐induced T1D mice within the normal range (5–10 mmol L −1 ) for 24 h following oral gavage and shows repetitive therapeutic effects by multiple doses. This shows the feasibility for fast translation of DMG‐PEG/DOTAP‐DNA nanoparticles in T1D treatment via oral delivery.",

Specifically, we demonstrate that nanoparticles designed to rapidly penetrate airway mucus (mucus-penetrating particle or MPP) enhance the delivery of inhaled model DNA vaccine (i.e. ovalbumin-expressing plasmids) to pulmonary dendritic cells (DC), leading to robust and durable local and trans-mucosal immunity. In contrast, mucus-impermeable particles were poorly taken up by pulmonary DC following inhalation, despite their superior ability to mediate DC uptake in vitro compared to MPP. In addition to the enhanced immunity achieved in mucosal surfaces, inhaled MPP unexpectedly provided significantly greater systemic immune responses compared to gold-standard approaches applied in the clinic for systemic vaccination, including intradermal injection and intramuscular electroporation. We also showed here that inhaled MPP significantly enhanced the survival of an orthotopic mouse model of aggressive lung cancer compared to the gold-standard approaches. Importantly, we discovered that MPP-mediated pulmonary DNA vaccination induced memory T-cell immunity, particularly the ready-to-act effector memory-biased phenotype, both locally and systemically. The findings here underscore the importance of breaching the airway mucus barrier to facilitate DNA vaccine uptake by pulmonary DC and thus to initiate full-blown immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tendon rupture/defects may impose a huge economic and mental burden on patients and society. At present, neither surgery nor conservative treatment regimens can provide long‐term therapeutic benefits, and the prognosis is often disappointing owing to the loss of tendon function and strength. There is an urgent need for innovative strategies to treat defective tendons. Here, a microneedle patch is developed for the efficient transdermal delivery of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The microneedle tip is made up of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and is water swellable, but insoluble, thereby ensuring the accurate and efficient release of PTH, while evacuating the skin without any tip material deposition. The PTH‐loaded microneedle patch is replaced daily in a rat tendon defect‐healing model. Results from histology, biomechanics, and gene expression analysis confirm that this newly developed microneedle patch accelerates tendon healing following the subcutaneous delivery of PTH and activates the transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β1/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade, which may be involved in the underlying mechanism. These results suggest that the PTH‐loaded microneedle patch developed herein may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of injured tendons.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Targeted cancer therapies have been extensively tested with the purpose to selectively suppress tumor growth and to avoid harming healthy tissue. However, failure to escape endosomes upon receptor‐mediated endocytosis is a major obstacle limiting the efficacy of targeted cancer therapeutics. Here, novel target‐switchable intracellular toxin delivery systems (TiTDS) are presented which use the catalytic and translocation domain of diphtheria toxin (dtA‐T) as an intracellular toxin delivery platform and affibody molecules targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 or epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2Afb or EGFRAfb) as target‐specific ligands. The intracellular toxin delivery platform and the affibody molecules are genetically fused with SpyCatcher (SC) protein and SpyTag (ST) peptide, respectively, to generate dtA‐T‐SC and ST‐HER2Afb or ST‐EGFRAfb modules. These modules can be individually purified and post‐translationally ligated to produce dtA‐T/HER2Afb or dtA‐T/EGFRAf. dtA‐T/HER2Afb and dtA‐T/EGFRAfb can selectively bind to their corresponding target cancer cells, efficiently enter the cells through receptor‐mediated endocytosis, successfully escape endosomes, and release toxins into the cytosol. They exhibit high target‐specific cytotoxicity in vitro and can significantly reduce tumor masses in vivo. TiTDS is a promising targeted cancer therapy platform because of its high target specificity, effective intracellular delivery of active toxins with improved therapeutic efficacy, and target switchability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract IR irradiation‐induced dysfunction of the salivary gland and hyposalivation are one of the main complications of radiotherapy treatment for malignant head and neck tumors, and its mechanisms are not fully understood. IR‐induced microcirculation disturbance and apoptosis is one of the most important mechanisms. Most recent studies have focused on the regenerative effects of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) through the process of increased angiogenesis. This study suggests that increasing endogenous EETs by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor TPPU can reverse dysfunctional salivary glands and hyposalivation by improving the associated microenvironment and tissue regeneration. The findings suggest that TPPU alleviates hyposalivation and histological lesions, increases angiogenesis and reduces apoptosis of acinar cells significantly in IR‐damaged mice. The results in vitro demonstrate that TPPU promotes the proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of human salivary gland (HSG) cells, and enhances the motility and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The results also suggest that TPPU‐induced synergy and crosstalk between acinar cells and vascular endothelial cells might contribute to angiogenesis. Together, this study proves the feasibility of targeting sEH using TPPU to promote angiogenesis and reduce apoptosis, and also indicates the potential of sEH inhibitors for functional reconstruction of IR‐induced salivary glands damage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Skin cancer is the most common class of malignancies in humans with increasing incidence worldwide. Although surgery remains the most common treatment approach, relapses after surgery necessitate other treatment options. There is an increasing clinical demand for topical treatments for skin cancer that can improve the drug's cutaneous localization while limiting systemic absorption. In this study, hyaluronic acid (HA) conjugates are successfully synthesized by attaching a third‐generation retinoid (bexarotene) and a histone deacetylase inhibitor (vorinostat) to HA via ester bonds. The conjugates are characterized to ensure identity and quantify total drug loading. HA‐BEX and HA‐VOR exhibit a synergistic anticancer effect against human squamous cell carcinoma (A431) and human cutaneous T cell lymphoma cell lines (HUT 78) at specific ratios with minimal adverse effect on primary human keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Confocal microscopy demonstrates localization of the conjugates inside the cancer cells. Ex vivo skin permeation studies on human skin explants confirm their ability to penetrate the stratum corneum and reach the deep dermis. Biodistribution studies in the skin reveal the presence of both drugs in the epidermis and dermis in amounts sufficient to exert inhibitory effect on cancer cells. HA‐bexarotene‐vorinostat conjugates offer an excellent therapeutic option to treat skin cancers.",

To further expand their advantageous physicochemical properties and counter intrinsic limitations challenging their progress toward clinical translation, strategies ranging from new fabrication methods to diverse forms of modifications have been proposed. Among them, direct incorporation of foreign species into the siliceous frameworks has emerged. The incorporation of inorganic or organic moieties into an otherwise purely siliceous framework enriches the structure with novel or improved properties. In this review, the progress of inorganic modification is mainly examined on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) due to their widely appreciated attributes that garnered them an important position within cancer nanomedicine, while organic modifications are studied through designs of mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (MONs). General synthesis methods and philosophies behind framework modifications are first discussed in brief. Subsequently, several interesting inorganically doped MSNs and formulations of MONs are studied for their advantages, including the role of catalysis after metal impregnation, improved biodegradability, novel stimuli‐responsiveness, role in bioimaging, and enhancing the outcomes of key treatment strategies. Finally, the advances are summarized, along with proposed prospects for these hybrid materials in their progress toward clinical use.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive disease with the lowest survival rate among all solid tumors. The lethality of PDAC arises from late detection and propensity of the tumor to metastasize and develop resistance against chemo and radiation therapy. A highly complex tumor microenvironment composed of dense stroma, immune cells, fibroblast, and disorganized blood vessels, is the main obstacle to current PDAC therapy. Despite the tremendous success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancers, PDAC remains one of the poorest responders of ICIs therapy. The immunologically \"cold\" phenotype of PDAC is attributed to the low mutational burden, high infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and T-regs, contributing to a significant immunotherapy resistance mechanism. Thus, the development of innovative strategies for turning immunologically \"cold\" tumor into \"hot\" ones is an unmet need to improve the outcome of PDAC ICIs therapies. Other smart strategies, such as nanomedicines, sonic Hedgehog inhibitor, or smoothened inhibitor, are discussed to enhance chemotherapeutic agents' efficiency by disrupting the PDAC stroma. This review highlights the current challenges and various preclinical and clinical strategies to overcome current PDAC therapy difficulties, thus significantly advancing PDAC research knowledge.",

In vivo gene delivery protocols can amplify immune responses and sensitize tumors to immunotherapies, yet non-viral transfection methods often sacrifice transduction efficiency for improved safety tolerance. To improve transduction efficiency, we optimized a strategy employing low ultrasound transmission frequency-induced bubble oscillation to introduce plasmids into tumor cells. Differential centrifugation isolated size-specific microbubbles. The diameter of the small microbubble population was 1.27 ± 0.89 μm and that of larger population was 4.23 ± 2.27 μm. Upon in vitro insonation with the larger microbubble population, 29.7% of cancer cells were transfected with DNA plasmids, higher than that with smaller microbubbles (18.9%, P <0.05) or positive control treatments with a commercial transfection reagent (12%, P < 0.01). After 48 h, gene expression increased more than two-fold in tumors treated with large, as compared with small, microbubbles. Furthermore, the immune response, including tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells and F4/80+ macrophages, was enhanced. We believe that this safe and efficacious method can improve preclinical procedures and outcomes for DNA vaccines in cancer immunotherapy in the future.",

The metabolic state of 2D‐cultured cells is typically similar, unlike the physiological condition in the body. Also, there is a growing ethical concern over the use of animal studies. Significant advances in microfluidics and tissue engineering have led to the development of three‐dimensional (3D) skin‐on‐a‐chip (SOC) technology, which offers a cost‐effective alternative to conventional preclinical models for the validation and testing of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. This review discusses the recent developments in the design of various SOCs, their fabrication strategies and methods for introducing skill cells to the chip, and their respective biomedical applications.

    "abstract": "Abstract The alarming situation in public healthcare caused by ever‐increasing catastrophe of antimicrobial resistance, recurrent infections, and associated inflammation has accelerated the hunt for novel therapeutics which can address these diverse problems concomitantly. This article introduces a new class of multi‐functional amino acid conjugated small antibacterial molecules (ASAMs) which tackle complicated infections and associated inflammation. These molecules exhibit broad‐spectrum bactericidal activity against multi‐drug‐resistant bacteria. The phenylalanine‐bearing lead molecule (ASAM‐ 10 ) tackles bacterial dormant subpopulations, impenetrable biofilms, and intracellular pathogens simultaneously. Importantly, this molecule addresses the problem of toxicity associated with cationic lipopeptides like colistin through the temporal charge switching (cationic to zwitterionic) owing to the degradation of labile ester linkages. However, this does not affect its desired antibacterial action window. The substantial reduction in the overexpression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (IL‐6, IL‐8, TNF‐α, and IL‐1β) upon treatment of infected macrophages with ASAM‐ 10 validates its anti‐inflammatory efficacy. Furthermore, bacteria exhibit diminished susceptibility toward resistance development against ASAM‐ 10 owing to its membrane‐active nature. ASAM‐ 10 displays significant reduction in bacterial burden (2 Log CFU/g) when administered intraperitoneally in mice for MRSA thigh infection. Overall, this new class of multi‐functional molecules is safe for anticipated advanced therapeutic applications to combat complex bacterial infections and inflammation.",

To address this issue, miniaturized probes are designed and built for controlled application of cryosurgery, thermal ablation, and IRE and their performance is evaluated using ex vivo porcine liver tissue and an in vivo MC‐38 tumor model. These experimental results are compared to simulated conditions in heat transfer (cryosurgery and thermal ablation) and electrical (IRE) models. Agreements of physical quantities between measurement and modeling are shown for all the focal therapy cases. The in vivo outcome is further correlated with tumor growth delay.

With the in‐depth understanding of the anatomical structure and pathological changes that occur during tendon repair, tissue engineering methods using cells and biomaterials are widely studied. However, simulation of the aligned tissue morphology present in natural tendons remains challenging. The design of a well‐aligned scaffold would be appealing to promote better tendon regeneration. Here, a dual‐aligned composite scaffold comprising an outer layer of polycaprolactone/silk fibroin (PCL/SF) copolymer electrospun membrane and an inner layer of tendon extracellular matrix (TECM) loaded with tendon‐derived stem cells (TDSCs) is developed to promote rabbit Achilles tendon repair. As resident, tissue‐specific cells, TDSCs possess stronger tenogenic differentiation abilities. The PCL/SF electrospun membrane with a dense structure provides mechanical support and TECM with a loose porous structure provides bioactive constituents and a microenvironment for tendon repair. As shown here, the engineered scaffold facilitates TDSC proliferation and migration, favors tenogenesis‐associated gene expression, promotes tendon repair with native‐like hierarchically organized collagen fibers, and enhances the mechanical properties, indicating its potential value in the tendon tissue engineering field.",

In addition to a defined standard of care, patients randomly (1:1) receive either IP 500 mg tablet (IP group) or a matching placebo (placebo group) at 50 mg kg −1 body weight/day rounded to the nearest 500 mg dose (maximum 4 g day −1 ) administered in 3–4 divided doses for 10 days. Compared to the placebo group, IP group shows significantly higher rates of clinical response (CR) and clinical cure (CC) on Day‐6 for both non‐hospitalized patients and the total population. IP group shows significantly earlier CR and CC with fewer adverse events and no mortality. Based on these findings and the fact that IP increases natural killer cell‐mediated cytotoxicity of virus‐infected cells as an early immune response to viral infection and enhances NKG2D ligand expression, it is concluded that IP should be started early to maximize the benefit in mild to moderate COVID‐19 patients.

    "abstract": "Injectable local anesthetics that can provide a continuous nerve block approximating the duration of a pain state would be a life-changing solution for patients experiencing post-operative pain or chronic pain. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a site 1 sodium channel blocker that is extremely potent compared to clinically used local anesthetics. Challengingly, TTX doses are limited by its associated systemic toxicity, thus shortening the achievable duration of nerve blocks. Here, we explore emulsion-induced polymersomes (EIP) as a drug delivery system to safely use TTX for local anesthesia. By emulsifying hyperbranched polyglycerol-poly (propylene glycol)-hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG-PPG-HPG) in TTX aqueous solution, HPG-PPG-HPG self-assembled into micrometer-sized polymersomes within seconds. The formed polymersomes have microscopically visible internal aqueous pockets that encapsulate TTX with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 94%. Moreover, the polymersomes are structurally stable, enabling sustained TTX release.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rosacea is a common chronic inflammatory facial disorder. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have a key role in the pathogenesis of rosacea. In this study, the antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory effects of bilirubin‐based nanoparticles (BRNPs) are investigated in the LL‐37‐induced rosacea‐like mouse model. Effects of BRNPs on rosacea‐like skin inflammation and ROS level of the skin are determined using histological analysis. The expression of genes encoding rosacea‐associated cytokines and chemokines is assessed and the molecular mechanisms of BRNPs against rosacea are investigated using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis. This study reveals that BRNPs significantly alleviate LL‐37‐induced inflammatory manifestation in the rosacea mouse model and reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]‐1β, IL‐6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]‐α) and chemokines (C‐X‐C motif chemokine ligand 8 [CXCL8] and CXCL10). Moreover, BRNPs preferentially localize at the inflammatory skin lesion, decrease the level of ROS in the skin, and ameliorate the vascular endothelial growth factor expression and vascular changes in the skin induced by LL‐37. Furthermore, these findings provide a mechanism for the efficacy of BRNPs in this experimental model and support BRNPs as a potential therapeutic option for rosacea and other related inflammatory skin disorders.",

Here, dimeric cholic acid peptide conjugates as effective adjuvants that allow penetration of erythromycin across Gram‐negative bacteria are presented, making it effective antimicrobial. Here, it is shown that synthesized dimers 2 and 3, having tetramethylene and pentamethylene spacers respectively between cholic acid‐triglycine conjugates, in combination with erythromycin cause synergistic antimicrobial effect against Gram‐negative bacteria. Biochemical studies reveal that dimer 3 causes outer and inner membrane permeabilization by interacting with lipopolysaccharide and displacing Mg 2+ ions, thereby allowing the erythromycin to cross bacterial membranes. Dimer 3 in combination with erythromycin can clear the preformed biofilms of E. coli and P. aeruginosa effectively. It is further demonstrated that combination of dimer 3 and erythromycin can clear wound infections of E. coli and P. aeruginosa .

Findings from in vivo breast, colon and gastric patient‐derived xenograft (PDX) mice experiments are consistent with the in vitro studies showing that the response to treatment with drug‐loaded NCs is similar to that elicited by free drugs, with reduced side effects.

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite a range of available pain therapies, most patients report so‐called “breakthrough pain.” Coupled with global issues like opioid abuse, there is a clear need for advanced therapies and technologies for safe and effective pain management. Here the authors demonstrate a candidate for such an advanced therapy: precise and fluid‐flow‐free electrophoretic delivery via organic electronic ion pumps (OEIPs) of the commonly used anesthetic drug bupivacaine. Bupivacaine is delivered to dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in vitro. DRG neurons are a good proxy for pain studies as they are responsible for relaying ascending sensory signals from nociceptors (pain receptors) in the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system. Capillary based OEIPs are used due to their probe‐like and free‐standing form factor, ideal for interfacing with cells. By delivering bupivacaine with the OEIP and recording dose versus response (Ca 2+ imaging), it is observed that only cells close to the OEIP outlet (≤75 µm) are affected (“anaesthetized”) and at concentrations up to 10s of thousands of times lower than with bulk/bolus delivery. These results demonstrate the first effective OEIP deliveryof a clinically approved and widely used analgesic pharmaceutical, and thus are a major translational milestone for this technology.",

The application of cyanine‐based photothermal agents remains limited, however, due to the invasive nature and spread of tumors as well as the potential for inflammatory responses during the treatment process. In this work, a naphtho[cd]indolium‐based heptamethine cyanine with NIR‐II emission is utilized to prepare PEGylated nanoparticles for studies of photothermal treatment. The results demonstrate that the nanoparticles have excellent NIR‐II imaging and tumor targeting capabilities. As a result of the light harvesting property of naphtho[cd]indolium‐based heptamethine cyanine, these nanoparticles demonstrate a photothermal conversion efficiency of 61%. The tumor‐targeting properties of these nanoparticles enable them to accumulate effectively at limbs containing tumors. Photothermal therapy shows almost complete disappearance of all tumors after eight days of treatment. In addition, hematoxylin‐eosin stains (H&amp;E stains) of major organs show no discernible lesions throughout the treatment process. Furthermore, simultaneous injection of natural vitamin C during the treatment significantly improves the therapeutic effect of photothermal therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Colorectal cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer‐related deaths worldwide. Ferroptosis is a non‐apoptotic form of regulated cell death that can be triggered by excessive lipid peroxidation and provides an alternative cancer treatment option. To design ferroptosis‐targeted nanomedicine, a new type of nanoparticle is synthesized. The antineoplastic agent simvastatin (SIM) and specifically designed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) are co‐loaded into zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 (ZIF‐8) nanoparticles coated with poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (PCBMA). The constructed shRNA/ZIF‐8@PCBMA‐SIM nanoparticles effectively eliminate human colorectal carcinoma cells in vivo, showing superior cytotoxicity against tumors owing to their improved targeting ability and the high retention of antineoplastic agents delivered at tumor sites. Furthermore, SIM and shRNA downregulate the expression of ferroptosis‐related enzymes 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl‐CoA reductase and glutathione peroxidase 4, thus, triggering ferroptosis in cancer cells. Given that SIM is already approved for clinical use, and shRNA offers high potency to downregulate the cystine/glutamate antiporter (x‐CT) system protein (subunit SLC7A11), shRNA/ZIF‐8@PCBMA‐SIM nanoparticles show great clinical potential to treat colorectal cancer via ferroptosis.

However, small molecule Δ Ψ m‐targeting NIR‐II probes are rarely reported, especially for highly efficient imaging and treatment of tumors. Herein, a small molecule probe named TQPTPP is designed and synthesized by conjugation of a novel D‐A type dye TQT1009 with Δ Ψ m‐targeting molecule alkyl triphenylphosphine (TPP) through a polyethylene glycol‐8 (PEG 8 ) linker. The conventional ICG dye is also coupled with TPP through PEG 8 to produce ICGTPP as a comparison. TQPTPP showed a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.041% and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (61.4%). It can be self‐assembled into nanoparticles and still preserve Δ Ψ m‐targeting capability. Tumor imaging is further performed, and results showed a long tumor retention time of TQPTPP (maximum tumor signal on day five and signal‐to‐noise ratio up to nine). As a comparison, ICGTPP remained a single molecule with Δ Ψ m‐targeting capability. But it has shorter tumor retention and lower photostability. These results suggested the novel D‐A small molecule ΔΨ m‐targeting NIR‐II probe TQPTPP provided a new tool for diagnosing and treating tumors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Following a traumatic brain injury (TBI), excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation products (LPOx) are generated and lead to secondary injury beyond the primary insult. A major limitation of current treatments is poor target engagement, which has prevented success in clinical trials. Thus, nanoparticle‐based treatments have received recent attention because of their ability to increase accumulation and retention in damaged brain. Theranostic neuroprotective copolymers (NPC3) containing thiol functional groups can neutralize ROS and LPOx. Immediate administration of NPC3 following injury in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) mouse model provides a therapeutic window in reducing ROS levels at 2.08–20.83 mg kg −1 in males and 5.52–27.62 mg kg −1 in females. This NPC3‐mediated reduction in oxidative stress improves spatial learning and memory in males, while females show minimal improvement. Notably, NPC3‐mediated reduction in oxidative stress prevents the bilateral spread of necrosis in male mice, which is not observed in female mice and likely accounts for the sex‐based spatial learning and memory differences. Overall, these findings suggest sex‐based differences to oxidative stress scavenger nanoparticle treatments, and a possible upper threshold of antioxidant activity that provides therapeutic benefit in injured brain since female mice benefit from NPC3 treatment to a lesser extent than male mice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The high reoperation rate in pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery is probably due to impaired wound healing, and therefore, novel strategies that promote tissue regeneration are urgently needed. Estrogen therapy shows beneficial effects for vaginal wound healing: it reduces the inflammatory response and improves vaginal tissue strength and quality. Earlier, scaffolds that release the most potent estrogen, β‐estradiol (E2) have been described. This work describes the results of conjugating E2 covalently to the synthetic, but highly mimetic, polyisocyanide hydrogel (PIC‐E2). As adipose‐derived stem cells (ASCs) possess regenerative capabilities, the combination of PIC‐E2 and ASCs may have a synergistic effect on pelvic floor tissue regeneration. The results show that the PIC‐E2 bioactivity is not hampered upon covalent E2 conjugation and upregulates various extracellular matrix (ECM) genes in ASCs. Moreover, PIC‐E2 exerts similar effects regarding ECM metabolism compared to other E2‐releasing biomaterials, but at much lower doses, which is economically and therapeutically favorable. Based on these in vitro findings, the combination of the PIC‐E2 hydrogel and ASCs may have the potential to stimulate tissue regeneration in vivo, and therefore, feasibly improve the surgical outcomes for POP in the future.",

For cancer treatment, immunotherapy is becoming the standard treatment for many types of cancer and is often combined with chemotherapy. Although chemotherapeutic agents are often reported to have adverse effects, including immunosuppression, they can also play a positive role in immunotherapy by directly stimulating the immune system. This has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies in the past decades. Chemotherapeutics can activate immune cells through different immune receptors and signaling pathways depending on their chemical structure and formulation. In this review, we summarize and discuss the direct immunoactivation effects of chemotherapeutics and possible mechanisms behind these effects.

SDT relies on ultrasound to stimulate the activity of sonosensitizers, induce the production of many reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mediate tumor cell death. The complex tumor microenvironment (TME) is the basis of tumorigenesis and tumor development. The characteristics of the TME, which are different from those of normal tissue, are essential factors in regulating the response to antitumor therapy. The therapeutic effect of SDT is affected by the TME. Therefore, the study of multifunctional sonosensitizers related to the TME is a future direction to enhance the efficacy of SDT in treating tumors. This review summarizes the characteristics of the TME, the factors that regulate it, and its role in regulating the response to sonosensitizers. It introduces strategies for enhancing the therapeutic effect of SDT by exploiting the TME and highlights the prospects of combination therapy for tumors based on the characteristics of the TME. With this paper, it is hoped to provide a research direction for improving the therapeutic effect of SDT and promoting its clinical translation in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract MicroRNAs (miRs) are potent regulators of biology and disease. The miR‐15 family is shown to regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation and antimiR‐based inhibition induces a cardioprotective effect after myocardial infarction in mice. However, systemic delivery of antimiRs leads to accumulation in kidneys and liver, with relatively poor cardiac exposure. Injectable hydrogels are proposed to serve as sustained‐release drug delivery depots and can potentially be used to improve cardiac efficacy of antimiR therapeutics. Here, the effect of a hydrogel‐formulated antimiR‐195 after myocardial infarction in mice is studied. For this, an injectable, pH‐switchable supramolecular hydrogel based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) functionalized with hydrogen bonding ureido‐pyrimidinone (UPy) units is used. Intracardiac injections under baseline conditions of this UPy–PEG hydrogelator induce a transient inflammatory response that is no longer present 7 days postinjection. In vitro experiments show that antimiR‐195 is released from the gel, and induces microRNA inhibition leading to downstream cardiomyocyte proliferation. In vivo, intramyocardial delivery of antimiR‐195 in UPy–PEG enhances cardiac target derepression compared to phosphate‐buffered‐saline‐dissolved antimiR‐195, despite a low cardiac retention. After ischemic injury, this translates into a greater therapeutic effect by increasing both target derepression and cardiomyocyte proliferation. Intramyocardial injection of UPy–PEG‐formulated antimiR‐195 is sufficient to improve cardiac efficacy of antimiR‐195.",

Here, this study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of porphyrin‐based nanozymes that are engineered with varying methods and materials. In addition, the latest researches are highlighted on their biomedical applications, including cancer treatment, biosensing, antibacterial, and antioxidant applications.

Existing predictive dose personalization models are not readily feasible for clinical implementation, as they require multiple measurements each day while the standard frequency is once daily. CURATE.AI, a small‐data artificial intelligence‐derived platform, is developed as a clinical decision support system to dynamically personalize doses using the patient's own data obtained once a day. Retrospective dose personalization with CURATE.AI on 16 patients’ data demonstrates potential to enable more patients to reach therapeutic range within the first week.

Addressing the pH changes during active and resting phases in IBD‐affected tissue, a disease‐adaptive nanocarrier system is designed for oral administration, enabling pH‐dependent local drug release. The hybrid carrier combines poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic acid) and an amphiphilic cyclodextrin derivative, with physicochemical properties and drug release kinetics controlled by adjusting polymer ratios. The systems exhibited baseline drug release at pH 5 with increased rates at pH 2, which is characteristic of actively inflamed IBD tissue. Assessing the impact of biomolecule adhesion, biocorona formation was studied using ex vivo human intestinal fluids. Corona composition highly depended on the patient's prandial state and the nanocarrier matrix, with proteins predominating in the fasted state and lipids in the fed state. Notably, differences in the attachment of proteins and free fatty acids are detected in the latter. Transport studies using human in vitro models of the inflamed intestine revealed mucosal accumulation, facilitating localized drug delivery and effectively reducing cytokine levels to basal concentrations. This hybrid system highlights the potential of disease‐adaptive drug release for inflammatory disease treatment and underscores the impact of biocorona formation on therapeutic performance in the gastrointestinal tract.",

Heating PC3 prostate carcinoma cells between 43 and 46°C using ultrasound in the presence of M‐CMD resulted in significant necrotic cell death. Furthermore, deposition of M‐CMD containing 3 µg of iron per mm 3 of tumor in subcutaneous xenografts of PC3‐Luc tumors of 150 mm 3 followed by 6 to 10 sessions of ultrasound application (1 W cm −2 , 1 MHz) of 10 min each led to a tumor temperature of 43–46°C per session and to total tumor disappearance without regrowth over 6 months following treatment start. Sequential histological analyses of the tumor tissues revealed partial tumor occupation by M‐CMD and an increase in cell death over time. Neither lesions, nor magnetosome accumulation were found in microscopic sections of various internal organs collected from treated mice euthanized 6 months after the beginning of the treatment, indicating that M‐CMD may not lead to long‐term side effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent advances in cancer treatments such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, have brought hope for curing a variety of cancers. However, there are ongoing challenges such as poor targeting, biocompatibility and biosafety. Engineered bacteria can cope with these problems, providing a unique therapeutic approach for the treatment of tumors. Nanotechnology offers the potential to modify the surface of bacteria, and the use of biofilm and coating technology to physically encapsulate bacteria can help bacteria escape the host immune system and improve the efficiency and safety of drug delivery. Synthetic biology and genetic engineering technologies can treat bacteria as “robotic factories” to produce and deliver anti‐cancer drugs, including anti‐tumor cytokines, immunomodulators, prodrug enzymes, and so on, according to clinical needs. Engineered bacteria therapies can be used either as monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer therapies to achieve better clinical outcomes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Pulmonary metastases present a significant clinical challenge in the treatment of osteosarcoma (OS). The current therapeutic landscape for metastatic OS is limited by the lack of effective targeted therapies. Here, the development and preclinical evaluation of a novel CD24 antibody‐drug conjugate (ADC) designed for the targeted ablation of primary OS tumors and pulmonary metastases are reported. An unbiased, quantitative screening of cancer‐related cell surface markers on human OS cells identifies CD24 as a novel target for ADC therapy in OS, owing to its disease‐specific overexpression and rapid antigen‐mediated internalization. Based on these findings, a proof‐of‐concept ADC, comprising a humanized CD24 antibody conjugated with mertansine (CD24‐DM1), was designed and constructed. CD24‐DM1 demonstrated potent cytotoxicity against a panel of human OS cell lines while sparing normal human osteoblasts. In an orthotopic OS model, CD24‐DM1 induced complete and durable tumor regression. Additionally, CD24‐DM1 significantly delayed tumor growth in a lung‐metastatic OS model, providing robust in vivo evidence of CD24 as a promising ADC target for OS therapy. In conclusion, CD24‐DM1 exhibits a favorable therapeutic index for the treatment of metastatic OS in preclinical models, highlighting its potential as an effective targeted therapeutic option.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hearing loss (HL) is a significant global health challenge, affecting billions of people and severely impacting quality of life. While traditional interventions such as hearing aids and cochlear implants mitigate symptoms, they fail to address the underlying causes of HL, especially in cases involving severe damage to hair cells or spiral ganglion neurons. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including biomaterials, nanocarrier drug delivery systems, gene therapy, and extracellular vesicle (EV)‐based approaches, have demonstrated significant potential in promoting inner ear regeneration and restoring auditory function. Biomaterials mimic the extracellular matrix to guide inner ear cell regeneration, while nanocarriers and EVs enhance the targeted and sustained delivery of therapeutic agents. Gene therapy offers opportunities to correct genetic mutations, addressing hereditary HL. However, challenges such as the anatomical complexity of the cochlea, the blood‐labyrinth barrier, and limited regenerative capacity persist. Future research must focus on scalable, biocompatible, and clinically safe delivery systems to advance the clinical translation of these innovative therapies. This review underscores the potential of integrating these strategies to develop effective and long‐lasting treatments for HL.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Selenium (Sel) is an important trace element that plays a role in a variety of biological processes and reactions across species. It is well known for its antiviral, antioxidant, cytokine‐modulating, immune‐boosting, and anticoagulant characteristics, which have the potential to help manage illnesses like cancer. With the evolution of nanotechnology, customized medicine has made great progress, notably in increasing medication targeting while reducing the toxicity of anticancer treatments. Targeted nano‐drug delivery systems are now being used to circumvent multidrug resistance and minimize side effects. By encapsulating medicines, these systems improve their solubility and tumor‐targeting efficacy via active and passive transport modes. Sel nanoparticles (NPs) (Sel‐NPs) have been identified as a potential anticancer platform because to their regulated size, excellent drug‐loading capacity, increased antitumor efficacy, and reduced cytotoxicity. Importantly, no significant health hazards or toxicities have been documented in people or animals after utilizing these biogenic synthetic materials, making them a cost‐effective and environmentally friendly solution. This review focuses on current breakthroughs in cancer therapy and preventive research using synthetic and biogenic Sel‐NPs alone and in combination with chemo‐, radiation‐, and immunotherapy, as well as the hurdles faced during their development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Immunocompromise is a hallmark of cancer, affecting both the peripheral immune system and local tumor microenvironment (TME). Current immunotherapies like checkpoint inhibitors, CAR‐T cells, and neo‐antigen vaccines show limited efficacy due to severe immunosuppression in most patients. Here, an immunologically engineered injectable immunehydrogel (iHG) is reported that can: i) recruit the desired set of immune cells away from the suppressed TME and peripheral organs, ii) activate them within a protective ambit of engineered immune‐stimulatory hydrogel niche, and iii) release them to target cancer even in distant locations. Biodegradable and injectable iHG compositions are tested and optimized for their ability to attract and activate dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and T cells via stimulator of interferon genes (STING), TLR, CD86, and Th1‐polarized cytokine pathway without requiring exogenously introduced neo‐antigens as vaccines. In a mouse melanoma model, optimized iHGs elicit a robust antitumor immune response through innate and adaptive arms. Most importantly, iHGs as a single agent immunomodulator exhibit better tumor control than when combined with anti‐PD1 immune checkpoint antibody. These findings highlight the potential of engineering immunologically functional and injectable hydrogel niches as a new type of immunotherapeutics to reprogram immune cells to overcome both local and systemic immunosuppression and combat cancer effectively.",

Biophysical forces influence cell phenotypes through mechanosensing of the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, catch and slip bonds, and mechanically gated ion channels. As a result, different mechanical environments impact the function and expression of immune cell receptors, which subsequently affects local and systemic immune responses. Mechanical coupling of immune cell receptors can be exploited in immunoengineering applications such as adoptive cell transfer and artificial antigen‐presenting cells through biomaterial systems with tunable mechanical properties that regulate receptor expression and cell activation.

The diagnosis and recovery of FK are complex compared to other ocular diseases. Owing to the anatomy and psychological properties of the cornea, it is difficult for ocular drugs to penetrate the cornea and achieve therapeutic concentrations. In the past 20 years, the clinic has used the traditional medications natamycin, voriconazole, and amphotericin B as first‐line treatments. However, the effectiveness of conventional topical antifungal drugs is limited by the cornea's barrier, tear drainage, and challenges in drug penetration and bioavailability. Therefore, novel therapies or drug delivery systems to improve the treatment of FK are urgently needed. In this review, we discuss and summarize the progress of some promising antifungal management methods.",

However, its photodynamic properties have to be improved for practical phototherapy applications. Therefore, in this study, FeS 2 /WS 2 p‐n junctions, comprising varying amounts of WS 2 , are synthesized using the simple hot injection method. Establishment of the heterostructure is verified using X‐ray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. p‐n junction formation is further validated via calculations based on ultraviolet‐visible (UV–vis.) spectrophotometer and XPS data. Photothermal and photodynamic properties of the samples are examined considering various aspects. The FeS 2 /WS 2 heterostructure provides a heating response above 50 °C with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 52.6%. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation ability is observed to depend on the material concentration and O 2 • ‾ is determined as the primary reactive oxygen species. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the samples is tested against Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) and Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) bacteria as a function of material concentration. At all concentrations, the FeS 2 /WS 2 heterostructure exhibits higher activity than that of FeS 2 nanoparticles. The efficiency of the sample against S. aureus and E. coli is calculated to be 100% and 99.4% respectively, at a low material concentration of 100 µg mL −1 .",

Despite growing interest in PBM, a key gap exists in understanding how specific wavelengths, such as 680 and 850 nm, affect endothelial cell function. While light's general effects on cell viability and mitochondrial function are known, the precise mechanisms underlying PBM's influence on endothelial cells remain unclear, limiting the optimization of PBM protocols for vascular dysfunction. In this study, the effects of PBM on endothelial cells are investigated using the light peaked at 680 and 850 nm with full width at half maximum (FWHM) about 17.5 and 25.1 nm, respectively, assessing cell viability, mitochondrial activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, calcium flux (Ca 2+ ), and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). These findings demonstrate that PBM exposure enhances mitochondrial function, reduces oxidative stress, and modulates calcium signaling, all of which contribute to changes in endothelial barrier integrity. These results highlight the potential of PBM as a novel therapeutic strategy for enhancing endothelial cell function and addressing endothelial dysfunction, opening new avenues for future research and clinical applications in vascular health.",

The in vivo biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy of the NPs are assessed in a dextran sulfate sodium‐induced UC mouse model. The synthesized HPG‐PLGA NPs demonstrated good stability and a controlled release of BN. In vivo studies showed significant accumulation of NPs in the inflamed colon, with a subsequent reduction in disease activity and inflammation markers. The treatment group exhibited lower levels of tumor necrosis factor‐alpha, interleukin‐1 beta, and interleukin‐6 compared to the model group, indicating effective alleviation of inflammation. Furthermore, the NPs showed no significant toxicity to major organs.

    "abstract": "Abstract The success of medical devices and biomaterials hinges on selecting biological models that truly reflect human physiology and disease. A well‐chosen model is not just a scientific necessity; it is a clinical imperative. Academic biomedical research often relies on readily accessible models that yield affordable, convenient, and predictable results. However, rodent models of sepsis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease frequently fail in clinical translation. Likewise, optimizing a device or material to fit a specific model (“overfitting”) can create false confidence, leading to expensive setbacks. While in vitro systems offer ethical advantages and mechanistic insights, they lack the complexity of living organisms. Animal models, though capable of capturing systemic effects, face species differences, ethical concerns, and poor clinical translation. Advances in 3D tissue engineering, organ‐on‐a‐chip, and humanized models overcome many of these shortcomings, improving predictive accuracy and complementing animal models. Clinician involvement is crucial to aligning preclinical models with real‐world medical needs. Moreover, unnecessary animal experiments should not be conducted or required without a clear translational route. Prioritizing clinically relevant models enhances patient safety, reduces research waste, and drives ethical, impactful medical innovation.",

In this study, the effects of high (H − ) and low molecular weight (L − ) SDP fractions on human corneal limbal‐epithelial cell viability, absorption, migration, attachment, and TGF‐β signaling are characterized. Interestingly, L‐SDP significantly increased cell migration and proliferation to accelerate wound closure rate, while the presence of TGFβRI inhibitor attenuated its activity. In contrast, H‐SDP significantly decreased migration while increasing substrate adhesion, also down‐regulating TGF‐β mRNA levels.

This process is translated into variations in the speed and turning angle of T cells. In this study, a generalized algorithm is proposed to analyze cell migration data with focus on CD8+ T cells, using clustering technique to identify the number of different migration states and Hidden Markov Model (HMM)to capture the dynamical switching between them. The algorithm only requires a set of position observations in a series of times, independent of other factors. While this study focuses on CD8+ T cell migration, this approach can potentially be used broadly to study the migration of other cell types as well. For the current analysis, low and high avidity T cells in melanoma tumors are tracked ex vivo using two‐photon microscopy. These findings suggest that CD8+ T cells follow a two‐state migration dynamic, with one state being faster, while the other slower and more localized. Moreover, a statistical methodology is established to analyze T cell migration to assess whether there is true variability in cell speeds as distinguished from stochastic fluctuations about a single speed, and it can be applied across different experimental platforms.",

Synthesized using a sub‐freezing gelation, the PNiPAAm+CII gel displayed a highly interconnected porous structure with micron‐sized pores (81–237 µm), allowing the smooth serum flow and cells passage. Mechanical testing showed good structural integrity, with a significantly higher elastic Young's modulus (Y = 2291.3 psi) than the control PNiPAAm gel (Y = 385.1 psi). Biocompatibility confirmed through the MTT assay, demonstrating good cytocompatibility. Hemocompatibility test showed negligible hemolysis for the PNiPAAm+CII gel (0.02%), significantly lower than the control PNiPAAm gel (84%). Additionally, the PNiPAAm+CII gel retained low binding of blood cells after incubation with whole blood. Anti‐inflammatory analysis showed no significant production of reactive oxygen species, upon cell contact. Notably, the PNiPAAm+CII gel demonstrated a strong biological affinity for CII‐specific autoantibodies, capturing 15.4 U mL −1 from CIA mouse serum. Remarkably, it selectively captured 24.5 U mL −1 of CII‐specific autoantibodies from whole blood without the need for pre‐processing.

    "abstract": "Abstract Pure drug nanoparticles have emerged as an alternate method for formulating extremely hydrophobic drugs. Herein, a simple and efficient process for synthesizing PEGylated and antibody‐conjugated, carrier‐free nanomedicine is reported as a promising strategy to deliver the drug, Camptothecin (CPT) for aggressive circulating tumors such as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Size, shape, and surface morphology of pure drug nanorods (NRs) are examined and characterized by a variety of techniques. Incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the particle changed its surface charge and topography while affecting its drug‐dissolution kinetics. Furthermore, the toxicity of PEGylated versus non‐PEGylated forms of humanized anti‐CD33 antibody (Hu195Ab)–coated CPT NRs are compared. Hu195Ab drug‐linked NRs increased cell killing in leukemic cells and surface PEGylation show reduced non‐specific uptake in cells. The results demonstrate that surface‐modified carrier‐free nanodrugs could have significant implications in cancer drug delivery for treating AML. This would be the first instance of studying the potential of surface‐functionalized carrier‐free drug NRs in the treatment of leukemia.",

However, there is limited understanding of the effects of this emerging therapy at a genetic level. A rose bengal PDT screen using a green laser ( λ = 532 nm) on the entire non‐essential gene library of the model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and a subsequent pilot patient study ( n = 6 patients) in the treatment of onychomycosis caused by Trichophyton rubrum is reported. Of the 4800 yeast strains screened, 482 sensitive and 175 resistant strains are identified. The key biochemical pathways found to be affected included ergosterol biosynthesis, vacuolar acidification, and purine/S‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine biosynthesis. The implications of these findings inform the clinical application of an optimized rose bengal PDT protocol involving nail treatment with a rose bengal solution (140 µ m ) and green light irradiation (fluence ≈763 J cm −2 ). All patients achieved complete cure within three to five treatment sessions in the absence of pain or other side effects. The outcome of the genetic screen may thus inform the development of more efficient clinical treatments using rose bengal PDT, as demonstrated in the successful treatment of onychomycosis.",

Inspired by stem cell trafficking under in vivo conditions, the facilitation of stem cell homing and the driving of endogenously mobilized mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for advanced therapeutics have shown indisputable success in several preclinical studies. In fact, stem cell homing is also relevant for cell transplantation. Ensuring that a sufficient number of transplanted cells arrive at the targeted region is a prerequisite for treatments to be successful, particularly when culture‐expanded cells are injected intravenously. In this progress report, the authors discuss the important role of cell homing following i) the delivery of ex vivo‐manipulated cellular materials, ii) the transplantation of bone marrow in a bone marrow transplant procedure, and iii) endogenous cell mobilization/recruitment in response to injury and disease. Considering a paradigm shift from in vitro tissue engineering to in situ tissue regeneration, current endeavors and future potential in the topics of chemokine‐guided cell homing and the design of cell‐comfortable scaffolds that combine both biochemical and biophysical cues for immunomodulation and in situ tissue regeneration are highlighted.",

Here the development of a series of drug‐eluting poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) coils that may find possible use as DESs is reported. PGS is a tough, biodegradable, and biocompatible elastomer that has adjustable mechanical properties thanks to careful control of the fabrication process. Specifically, 3D PGS coils featuring superior mechanical and fracture‐resistance properties are fabricated. The surface erosion profile of PGS is designed to further reduce the risk of fragmentation and non‐target embolization during the degradation process. A dual‐encapsulation mechanism is applied, first poly(ε‐caprolactone) microparticles loaded with an anticancer drug Doxorubicin followed by dispersion of these microparticles in the PGS coils, to prolong the release of drug molecules from the interior. Systematic evaluations of the mechanical properties of the PGS coils and their drug release behaviors are conducted. It is anticipated that, these PGS coils may enable minimally invasive delivery using standard endovascular catheters, for achieving localized and sustained release of chemotherapy to tumors, as well as conventional applications in treating vascular disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For intratracheal delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to lung cancer, a nano‐sized micellar assembly is fabricated from an ASO conjugate with thermoresponsive poly(2‐ n ‐propyl‐2‐oxazoline) (POX). POX‐ASO conjugate is prepared via a copper‐free click conjugation between azide‐terminal POX and dibenzocyclooctyne‐terminal ASO. Through the thermoresponsive transition of the POX segment from hydrophilic to hydrophobic at temperatures above a critical solution temperature, a 50‐nm‐sized micellar assembly with a narrow size distribution is successfully fabricated when the hydrophobicity of POX segment is strengthened by increasing the molecular weight to 30 kDa. The micellar assembly, termed “ASOball”, elicits more efficient cellular uptake of ASO and significantly higher gene knockdown, compared with non‐conjugated ASO, with negligible cytotoxicity in cultured human lung cancer cells. When the ASOballs are intratracheally administrated into an orthotopic lung cancer model mouse, they show enhanced retention in the tumor tissue 24 h post‐administration, compared with non‐conjugated ASO. Ultimately, the ASOballs significantly reduce the expression level of target long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) by ≈55% at a dose of 15 µg per mouse in a sequence‐specific manner 72 h post‐administration, whereas no significant knockdown effect is observed for non‐conjugated ASO. These results demonstrate the strong potential of ASOballs for intratracheal ASO delivery to lung cancers.",

In this study, a facile method is developed to synthesize injectable, anionic hydrogels based on poly(oligo ethylene glycol monoacrylate‐ co ‐acrylic acid) for protein controlled release. The synthesis of the copolymers is robust involving a single step of an aqueous free radical polymerization. These copolymers are then allowed to swell into the microporous injectable hydrogels. The covalent incorporation of the anionic group, acrylic acid, into the hydrogels increases the thermal stability and the viscosity of hydrogels due to the stronger intermolecular interactions in the copolymer network. These anionic groups also significantly enhance electrostatic interactions between the hydrogels and positively charged proteins, thus, rendering the hydrogels suitable for sustained release of the proteins under physiological conditions. An animal study shows these injectable hydrogels do not adversely affect wound healing. These findings warrant further investigation of these injectable hydrogels for their use in protein delivery for wound healing applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Insulin analogs are key to blood glucose management for millions of people with diabetes. Nonetheless, the risk of hypoglycemia still exists because this insulin remains bioactive at normal or low blood glucose conditions. Here, the aim is to incorporate phenylboronic acids on insulin glargine to create a glucose‐responsive designer insulin termed “PBA‐F‐glargine.” It is hypothesized that by inserting a glucose responsive moiety, this designer insulin increases the therapeutic window and reduces the risk of insulin‐induced hypoglycemia. Chemical methods are used to incorporate phenylboronic acids into insulin glargine. Biochemical and cell‐based assays are used to confirm that the designer insulin PBA‐F‐glargine preserves insulin bioactivity. In comparison to commercial glargine, in vitro experiments demonstrate that PBA‐F‐glargine has similar bioactivity and increased solubility that is glucose‐dependent. In vivo experiments demonstrate that PBA‐F‐glargine has 88% bioactivity as compared to glargine at hyperglycemic levels, yet has only 30% bioactivity at euglycemic levels. This threefold difference in bioactivity demonstrates that PBA‐F‐glargine is responsive to glucose concentrations. In comparison to commercial glargine, PBA‐F‐glargine reduces iatrogenic hypoglycemia by 15‐fold. In conclusion, PBA‐F‐glargine has a glucose‐dependent in vivo bioactivity that markedly reduces the risk of hypoglycemia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Liver cancer, which is ranked fourth in cancer‐related mortality worldwide, lacks effective therapeutic treatments. The development of new targeted therapies for liver cancer is urgently needed. The zebrafish is an excellent preclinical model organism for drug screening. Therefore, in a zebrafish model, hundreds of small molecules are screened, and two compounds (LIB1O0078 and LIB1O0144) are identified as the strongest inducers of antiangiogenic effects without side effects. LIB1O0078 exhibits better antiproliferation ability, and LIB1O0144 has better antimigration ability, as shown by xenotransplantation assays. Furthermore, LIB1O0078 and LIB1O0144 exhibit anti‐HCC effects after retro‐orbital injection into adult Tg(fabp10a:HBx,Src, p53‐) triple transgenic fish with obesity and liver cancer. Because of the embryonic toxicity induced by these compounds, they are conjugated with nanodiamonds (ND), which are highly biocompatible function‐based carriers. ND‐coated small molecules not only reduce the embryonic toxicity and hepatotoxicity of the compounds, also exhibit better anti‐HCC effects when administered by oral gavage in adult Tg(fabp10a:HBx,Src, p53‐) fish with obesity and liver cancer. This study integrates nanotechnology and biomedical technology, identifies new potential anticancer drugs, and demonstrates the effectiveness of coating them on nanodiamonds in vivo. Facilitated by such a rapid zebrafish screening system, new anticancer drugs can be identified in a personalized and timely manner.",

In high-density cell condensation systems, lack of appropriate cell-ECM interactions can result in limited and/or slow cell differentiation and tissue formation. To address these problems, a colloidosome microsphere system that is composed of a gelatin hydrogel core and a porous nanoparticle shell is developed. The colloidosome microsphere functions as an ECM and morphogen carrier for the induction of cartilage formation of high-density human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) in 3D cultures. With the protection of the nanoparticle shell, the colloidosome microspheres can be readily suspended in aqueous solution without clumping, thus incorporated homogeneously within high-density cell condensations. The gelatin-based colloidosome microspheres stimulate chondrogenesis of hMSCs and degrade rapidly to facilitate ECM remodeling for new tissue formation. When loaded with human transforming growth factor-β1, a potent chondrogenic morphogen, the colloidosomes serve as a bioactive factor delivery vehicle as well. The dual functionality of the colloidosomes as an ECM and a growth factor carrier effectively supports the chondrogenic differentiation of high-density hMSC condensations. These capabilities render the colloidosomes a promising platform system amenable to large-scale production of high-density 3D tissue culture constructs.",

Yet, the rapid elimination of the mucolytic from the lungs requires its daily administration and rhDNase contributes to the high therapy burden of patients. Here, a long‐acting version of rhDNase that is delivered once weekly instead of once daily is presented. Conjugation of rhDNase to a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain sustains its presence and mucolytic activity within murine lungs for more than 15 days. One single dose of PEGylated rhDNase is as effective as 1 daily dose of unconjugated rhDNase during five days to decrease the DNA content in the lungs of β‐ENaC mice, a model of the CF lung disease. Moreover, once weekly administration of PEGylated rhDNase over four weeks decreases both the DNA content and the neutrophil counts in the lungs of β‐ENaC mice. PEGylated rhDNase is stable to jet nebulization. Finally, multiple high‐dose administrations of PEGylated rhDNase for up to 3 months do not cause any significant pulmonary or systemic toxicity, nor accumulation of the rhDNase or PEG moieties in biological fluids. PEGylation of rhDNase may offer a convenient long‐acting mucolytic to patients with CF.",

A cationic polymer–lytic peptide conjugate (VIPER) that greatly improves endosomal escape and intracellular activity of nucleic acid cargoes is recently developed; furthermore, it is hypothesized that VIPER's unique mechanism of endosomal disruption can increase cytoplasmic delivery of other biomacromolecules (e.g., peptides). Herein, VIPER is formulated as a polyplex subunit vaccine composed of conjugated peptide antigens and electrostatically complexed poly(I:C) nucleic acid adjuvant and is evaluated to determine whether the presence of the lytic peptide melittin conjugated to the pH‐responsive micelle core improves vaccination outcomes. Although VIPER delivers peptide antigens intracellularly, disrupts endosomes in antigen‐presenting cells (APCs) in vitro, and generates strong antigen‐specific cytotoxic T cell responses in vivo, significantly enhanced cross‐presentation is only observed in conjunction with VIPER‐induced local cell death. While these results demonstrate that VIPER is a useful platform technology for the study of vaccine delivery, full elucidation of how endosomal disruption by VIPER improves vaccination outcomes will require decoupling of endosomolysis from cytotoxicity, as well as precise targeting of VIPER vaccine formulations to APC populations in vivo.",

In addition, the immunomodulating capability of MSCs and its influences on tumor progress and metastasis are highlighted. Finally, the advantages and potential risks of MSCs concerning their modulation of immune responses and the factors determining their immune properties are emphasized. It is hoped that the challenges surrounding the impacts on immune response induced by the administration of MSCs summarized in this review will provide a critical guidance for the rational design and proper application of MSCs‐based targeting delivery system for tumor therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lack of adequate blood supply to the limb extremities results in critical limb ischemia (CLI) and subsequent tissue death. Conventional approaches for CLI treatment include bypass surgery and angioplasty, which achieved limited clinical success due to their complex invasiveness. Of late, growth factor and cell‐based therapies emerged as alternative treatment strategies for CLI. However, these strategies could not achieve much success due to the associated drawbacks. Earlier, this study group develops europium hydroxide nanorods (EHN) which demonstrates potential proangiogenic (stimulating new blood vessel growth) properties. Recently it is shown that EHN could ameliorate the myocardial ischemia in Wistar rats by promoting therapeutic angiogenesis and mitigate cadmium‐induced vascular toxicity. Considering the importance of revascularization in managing CLI, it is hypothesized that the proangiogenic EHN might be useful for its effective treatment. Hence, in the present study, the therapeutic efficacy of EHN is comprehensively evaluated in the hind limb ischemia model of Wistar rats. The EHN‐administered ischemic rats exhibit improved motility, enhanced blood flow to the ischemic limb along with increased expression of angiogenic factors. Additionally, toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies of EHN in mice demonstrate their nontoxic nature, suggesting the feasibility of their practical clinical application for CLI treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Immunomodulatory drugs are of great relevance in the context of vaccine delivery and cancer immunotherapy. Due to the ubiquitous presence of immune cells throughout the body, gaining control over the biodistribution and activity of such drugs is crucial to limit off‐target inflammatory responses. Here, the authors report on lipid‐PEG (polyethylene glycol) amphiphiles as well‐defined amphiphilic carries for lymph node targeted delivery. Comparing cholesterol and dialkyl lipids with different alkyl chain length, the authors found that both the nature of the lipid, as well as, the alkyl chain length have a dramatic influence on cellular uptake and lymph node translocation. Whereas shorter dioctyl‐PEG amphiphiles show overall poor performance, larger dioctadecyl‐PEG amphiphiles are prone to solubility issues. Didodecyl‐PEG amphiphiles with intermediate alkyl chain length are on par with cholesteryl‐PEG amphiphiles in in vitro and in vivo cellular uptake and lymphoid tissue targeting. Immunization with a cholesteryl‐PEG‐imidazoquinoline (TLR7/8 agonist) amphiphile‐adjuvanted model antigen shows induction of immune responses that are qualitatively different from Montanide‐adjuvanted antigen, characterized by effector CD8 + T cells with immediate cytotoxic potential and robust IgG2 antibody responses. These findings provide a rational base for further adjuvant design based on the type of immunity needed for a specific vaccination or therapeutic setting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the most abundant immune cells in the solid tumor microenvironment, making them an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. However, there are two important challenges. First, tumors repolarize the TAMs predominantly to M2 tumor‐aiding phenotype by secreting various immunosuppressive cytokines. Second, CD47 on cancer cells interacts with signal‐regulating protein a (SIRPa) expressed on macrophages. This crosstalk provides a downregulatory signal in the form of activation of SHP1/2 that inhibits cancer cell phagocytosis. These challenges can be overcome by engineering a nanoparticle that can deliver a rationale combination of immunomodulatory agents to the TAMs that can repolarize the M2 macrophages to M1 phenotype efficiently and concurrently block CD47‐SIRPa interactions by inhibiting SHP2 signaling. A lipid nanoparticle (LNP) system loaded with amphiphilic R848‐cholesterol (TLR7/8 agonist) and SHP099 (SHP2 inhibitor) in a predefined ratio has been designed. In vitro studies show that the LNPs system repolarized to M2 macrophages to M1 phenotype and expressed co‐stimulatory molecules while enhancing phagocytic potential. In vivo efficacy studies in 4T1 tumor‐bearing mice show that LNPs exhibit superior anti‐tumor efficacy than other treatments. Thus, the lipid nanoparticle‐mediated co‐delivery of a rational combination of TLR7/8 agonist and SHP2 inhibitor in the TAMs can enhance macrophage immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Azobenzene photoswitches are promising drug candidates for bestowing light sensitivity onto retinal neurons after photoreceptors degenerate in blinding disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). A potent photoswitch, BENAQ, targets a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), interacting with voltage‐gated ion channels to enable light‐triggered action potential firing. In mouse models of RP, injection of BENAQ into the vitreous of the eye photosensitizes RGCs to non‐damaging wavelengths and intensities of light. While the concentration required to elicit light responses is non‐toxic, effective drug delivery to the retina in vivo has remained a serious challenge. BENAQ aggregates near the injection site, causing non‐uniform photosensitization with a half‐life of 7 days, too transient for therapeutic vision restoration. Here, cyclodextrins are used to encapsulate BENAQ via host–guest chemistry to increase solubility and improve retinal delivery. SBE‐CD, a sulfobutylether β‐cyclodextrin, envelops the aromatic moieties of BENAQ to form a stable complex that dramatically enhances photosensitization, prolonging light responses to a half‐life of 31 days. SBE‐CD also ensures dispersal of BENAQ, resulting in uniform photosensitization across the retina. Hence the host–guest interaction between SBE‐CD and BENAQ overcomes limitations of intraocular delivery, guiding how photoswitches may be formulated as a possible treatment for human blindness.",

MOFs show peculiar properties such as well‐defined crystalline structures, systematic structural variation, high porosity and the possibility to chemically functionalize the pores. These properties are especially promising for designing MOF nanoparticles (NPs) with special functions. The desired functions can be introduced and modified with a chemical approach, by the choice of the inorganic and organic building blocks. All these features and the highest surface area of any porous material make MOF NPs ideal for the use as nanocarrier in biomedicine. So far, a wide variety of biomedical applications of MOF NPs have been already envisioned being supported by promising first in vitro and in vivo results. The ongoing development of MOF NPs is at the edge of basic science to biomedical applications. A major focus of biomedical research is already in cancer therapy using MOF NPs as theranostic nanocarrier. In this article, NP designs and MRI‐labelling concepts are pointed out and discussed in the perspective of facilitating their translation to clinical use. Clinical application is envisioned with a major focus on theranostic MOF NPs and MRI as the most promising imaging method.",

Nanomedicine offers a minimally invasive approach to alleviate plaque burden by targeted therapeutic delivery. However, nanocarriers are limited without the ability to sense and respond to the diseased microenvironment. In this study, targeted self‐assembled peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofibers are developed that cleave in response to biochemical cues expressed in atherosclerotic lesions—reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular glutathione—to deliver a liver X receptor agonist (LXR) to enhance macrophage cholesterol efflux. The PAs release LXR in response to physiological levels of ROS and reducing agents and can be co‐assembled with plaque‐targeting PAs to form nanofibers. The resulting LXR PA nanofibers promoted cholesterol efflux from macrophages in vitro as well as LXR alone and with lower cytotoxicity. Further, the ApoA1‐LXR PA nanofibers target plaque within an atherosclerotic mouse model in vivo and activate ATP‐binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) expression as well as LXR alone with reduced liver toxicity. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of self‐assembled PA nanofibers for controlled therapeutic delivery to the atherosclerotic niche.",

Consequently, patient-directed delivery of anti-inflammatories is an essential component of future therapeutic strategies for the management of this disorder. We describe the design and application of a light responsive red blood cell (RBC) conveyed dexamethasone (Dex) construct that enables targeted drug delivery upon illumination of the inflamed site. The red wavelength (650 nm) responsive nature of the phototherapeutic was validated using tissue phantoms mimicking the light absorbing properties of various skin types. Furthermore, photoreleased Dex has the same impact on cellular responses as conventional Dex. Murine RBCs containing the photoactivatable therapeutic display comparable circulation properties as fluorescently labelled RBCs. In addition, a single dose of light-targeted Dex delivery is 5-fold more effective in suppressing inflammation than the parent drug, delivered serially over multiple days. These results are consistent with the notion that the circulatory system be used as an on-command drug depot, providing the means to therapeutically target diseased sites both efficiently and effectively.",

Robust drug loading capacities of up to 20% (mg drug mg −1 NP) are obtained, with release dominated by analog hydrophobicity.

Median survival improved by 13% and bone marrow LSCs are decreased 34‐fold following NP MCL treatments versus controls. Additionally, selective leukemic cell and LSC cytotoxicity of the treatment versus normal hematopoietic cells is observed.

    "abstract": "Abstract Here, a new paradigm is introduced to promote pulmonary DNA vaccination. Specifically, it is demonstrated that nanoparticles designed to rapidly penetrate airway mucus (mucus‐penetrating particle or MPP) enhance the delivery of an inhaled model DNA vaccine (i.e., ovalbumin‐expressing plasmids) to pulmonary dendritic cells (DC), leading to robust and durable local and trans‐mucosal immunity. In contrast, mucus‐impermeable particles are poorly taken up by pulmonary DC following inhalation, despite their superior ability to mediate DC uptake in vitro compared to MPP. In addition to the enhanced immunity achieved in mucosal surfaces, inhaled MPP unexpectedly provides significantly greater systemic immune responses compared to gold‐standard approaches applied in the clinic for systemic vaccination, including intradermal injection and intramuscular electroporation. It is also shown here that inhaled MPP significantly enhances the survival of an orthotopic mouse model of aggressive lung cancer compared to the gold‐standard approaches. Importantly, it is discovered that MPP‐mediated pulmonary DNA vaccination induces memory T‐cell immunity, particularly the ready‐to‐act effector memory‐biased phenotype, both locally and systemically. The findings here underscore the importance of breaching the airway mucus barrier to facilitate DNA vaccine uptake by pulmonary DC and thus to initiate full‐blown immune responses.",

Two previous in vitro studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the FDA-approved cardiovascular therapeutic, protamine (PRM), to overcome neuroinhibitory cues presented by chondroitin sulfates; however, the effect of a wide range of PRM concentrations on neuronal and glial cells has not been evaluated. In this study, we investigate the therapeutic efficacy of PRM with primary cortical neurons, hippocampal neurons, mixed glial cultures, and astrocyte cultures. We show the threshold for PRM toxicity to be at or above 10 μg/ml depending on the cell population, that 10 μg/ml PRM enables neurons to overcome the inhibitory cues presented by chondroitin sulfate type A, and that soluble PRM allows neurons to more effectively overcome inhibition compared to a PRM coating. We also assessed changes in gene expression of reactive astrocytes with soluble PRM and determined that PRM does not increase their neurotoxic phenotype and that PRM may reduce brevican production and serpin transcription in cortical and spinal cord astrocytes. This is the first study to thoroughly assess the toxicity threshold of PRM with neural cells and study astrocyte response after acute exposure to PRM in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and nutrient competition represent the main causes of therapy resistance in cancers, including malignant melanoma (MM). Photodynamic therapy (PDT), through a cascade of events including its ability to induce significant immune responses, causes tumor eradication. However, the high pigmentation level of melanoma, lack of adequate accumulation of photosensitizers (PSs) in the target tissue as well as their nonspecific toxicity represent three main obstacles to obtaining satisfactory responses in melanoma. To prevail over these challenges, this study employs a depigmentation strategy followed by a nano‐mediated topical application of PDT using a chlorophyllin derivative as PS, focusing on the evaluation of the immunomodulatory and metabolic regulatory axes of PDT in melanoma. Photo‐immunomodulation is assessed in a melanoma mouse model using a nanocarrier system of the PS. Markers of the immunosuppressive microenvironment and T cell exhaustion, as independent immune hallmarks, are quantified. The histopathology of the spleen and skin/tumor is evaluated. The amino acid profile is quantified from normal skin or tumor biopsies using UHPLC‐MS/MS. Around 80% of the 300 nm transethosomal ferrous chlorophyllin (fC‐TEs) are retained in the tumor over 24 h upon topical application. Arbutin 2% gel not only decreased the melanin content of tumors but also regulated the expression of interleukin 12 (IL‐12), IL‐10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF‐β), and tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α). Additionally, the nano‐mediated PDT strategy decreased the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1) and its ligand 1 (PD‐L1) and reduces the activity of arginase 1 (Arg1) through an upregulation of miRNA155. A mild recruitment of megakaryocytes (MKs) is observed in the spleen of the PDT group. This special localization of MKs depicts effector immune properties. Lastly, the combination of PDT and arbutin restores the normal tissue levels of arginine (Arg), and glutamine (Gln) and lavished those of tryptophan (Trp). Nano‐mediated PDT represents a novel immunotherapeutic approach in melanoma by a triple modulation of the immune suppressive TME, immune checkpoint signaling, and reprogrammed tumor metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Several studies suggest Valproate's (VPA) therapeutic use in treating seizures, epilepsy, and bipolar disorder. Valproate is a class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor and an attractive chemotherapeutic agent for targeting cancer. Few reports suggest that Valproate can suppress cell growth and cell differentiation and is linked with anti‐tumor activity. However, Valproate‐associated anti‐tumoral function and intracellular signaling cascade‐mediated anti‐cellular proliferation activities still need to be better understood. This current study suggests that Valproate can elevate proteasomal dysfunctions, resulting in misfolded protein accumulation and abnormal mitochondrial functions that successively induce apoptosis. Present findings indicate that treatment of Valproate inhibits Proteasome activities and also aggravates accumulation of expanded polyglutamine proteins and other proteasomal substrates. Overall, the aggregation of aberrant proteins and mitochondrial dysfunctions are observed, such as cytochrome c release, and disturbed mitochondrial membrane potential. Treatment of Valproate induces apoptotic morphological changes and cell death. These observations suggest that Valproate can cause mitochondrial abnormalities associated with apoptosis. These findings can provide new possible insights and suggest molecular approaches for developing better and specific Proteasome inhibitors that can be better useful with other anti‐tumor drugs for treatment of cancer and other complex diseases.",

The technique promises high efficiency for both antigen expression and immunogenicity as demonstrated in both animal studies and human clinical trials. To realize this promise, a parametric study and systematic evaluation of the efficacy of cutaneous suction as a transfection method is performed. Using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) plasmid expression as a transfection reporter in a rat model, the expression level as a function of both suction nozzle size and suction pressure is quantified. A numerical model is employed to compute skin deformation in terms of strain, which is used to correlate with GFP expression. Based on these results, two quantities, integrated total strain and tissue tension, are proposed as indicators of expression level that can be used to guide protocol development and optimization. These indicators are also discussed in relation to possible cellular uptake mechanisms.",

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), actively secreted by diverse cell types, assume a crucial role in facilitating intercellular communication. These EVs facilitate the transfer of functional molecules, encompassing RNA, proteins, and lipids, to recipient cells. While these molecules participate in normal physiological processes, they also play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Notably in the context of cancer, numerous investigations have substantiated the involvement of tumor‐derived EVs in the development of drug resistance. This review comprehensively explores the mechanisms underlying drug resistance in urologic cancers, elucidates the contributions of tumor‐derived EVs to drug resistance in urologic tumors, discusses advancements in targeting EVs to mitigate drug resistance in urologic tumors, and assesses the utility of EVs as biomarkers for drug resistance in urologic tumors.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction significantly impacts cell metabolism and initiates the development and progress of numerous age‐related bone diseases. Mitochondrial autophagy or mitophagy, a process that selectively removes damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria, is closely associated with maintaining mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis. Recent studies indicate a decisive regulatory role of mitophagy in age‐related bone diseases, thereby pointing toward the potential for manipulating mitophagy levels as a new treatment paradigm. Based on the importance and novelty of mitophagy, the present review offers an overview of the pathways involved in mitophagy and meticulously examines its function in age‐related bone diseases. Various treatment methods targeting mitophagy are also discussed, mainly including biomaterials with mitophagy‐modulatory capabilities, “old drugs in a new bottle” (e.g., Metformin, Rapamycin), natural compounds, endogenous factors, and stem cell‐based therapies. In conclusion, these innovative approaches uncover mitophagy‐related signals, pathways, and mechanisms, and may shed light on mitophagy‐targeting treatments for age‐related bone diseases in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Upon progression to the metastatic stage, prostate tumors commonly exhibit multi‐drug resistance. Combining multiple treatment protocols can be beneficial in overcoming this resistance, which is often attributed to tumor heterogeneity. Recently, nano‐photosensitizer‐mediated photothermal therapy is shown to inhibit tumor growth through multiple pathways, including thermal ablation and activation of the antitumor immune response. In this study, gold nanoparticles (Au) are selected as the core photosensitizer. Then, the photothermal conversion of Au is augmented through dopamine coating, and the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX) is grafted to the dopamine coating. The release of DOX from DOX‐loaded dopamine‐modified gold nanoparticles (Au@PDA@DOX) occurred in response to an acidic environment. The combination of chemotherapy and thermal ablation better inhibits the growth, migration, and invasion of tumor cells and induced tumor cell apoptosis and necrosis in vitro. More importantly, thermal ablation induces the immunogenic death of prostate tumor cells (RM‐1) cells. The transition of prostate tumors from a “cold” to a “hot” tumor with immunogenicity is observed. The combination effectively activates the antitumor immune response, inhibits tumor growth, and alleviated bone damage by tumors in vivo. It is indicated that Au@PDA@DOX nanoparticles will offer a novel treatment protocol for prostate tumor bone metastases.",

Major clinical treatment issues include the length of treatment which is associated with patient non-compliance; and poor cellular drug penetration leading to the generation of drug-resistant strains. This study underscores the potential of β-glucan-chitosan (CS) poly(lactic co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles as a promising immunostimulatory adjunct for TB treatment. To facilitate drug delivery to alveolar macrophage, a CS-PLGA nanoparticle is developed containing rifampin in the core with β-glucan as a surface ligand, to stimulate the immune system. Mice are administered a single dose of nanoparticles or free rifampin by oropharyngeal aspiration. Pharmacokinetic investigations reveal sustained release properties of rifampin in vivo, extending over a week. Furthermore, comprehensive analysis indicates stimulation of the innate immune system, as evidenced by cytokine profiling, while concurrently revealing no detrimental effects on the alveolar epithelium, as indicated by histological examination and albumin lung leak assessment. These findings collectively establish a strong foundation for the development of a novel adjuvant immunotherapy approach for TB.",

The primary causes for high HCC mortality is the delayed diagnosis of the diseaseas early stage HCC is typically asymptomatic and patients frequently overlook the warning signs. Currently, the most efficacious single‐drug therapy approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) for HCC is Sorafenib and Nivolumab as a second‐line therapy for late stage HCC. Nowadays nanotechnology is used to deliver either a diagnostic tool for biomolecular imaging ortherapeutic agent. Gene therapy based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)‐CRISPR associated protein 9 (CRISPR‐Cas9) are currently studied to find a potential curative option for HCC. Natural products from plants are being extensively extracted and isolated as they may offer a promising alternative in order to control and treat HCC. They exhibit anti‐HCC effects by stimulating the immune system and by hindering various growth pathways involved in cancer development and progression. In this review article, an overview is provided on the current global incidence, ongoing systemic treatment strategies, and recent advances in nanomedicine for the management of HCC and also ongoing efforts to overcome these challenges.",

When compared to monomeric indocyanine green (IcG), L‐JA is characterized by longer circulation, improved photostability, elevated absorption at longer wavelengths, and increased photoacoustic signal generation. However, the documented methods for the production of L‐JA vary widely. An approach to efficiently form IcG J‐aggregates (IcG‐JA) directly in liposomes at elevated temperatures is developed. Aggregating within fully formed liposomes ensures particle uniformity and allows for control of J‐aggregate size. L‐JA has unique properties compared to IcG. L‐JA provides significant contrast enhancement in photoacoustic images for up to 24 h after injection, while IcG and unencapsulated IcG‐JA are cleared within an hour. L‐JA allows for more accurate photoacoustic‐based blood oxygen saturation (sO 2 ) estimation and particle tracking compared to IcG. Furthermore, photothermal heating of L‐JA with an 852 nm laser is demonstrated to be more effective at lower laser powers than conventional 808 nm lasers for the first time. The presented technique offers an avenue for formulating a multi‐faceted contrast agent for photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy that offers significant advantages over other conventional agents.",

Since highly porous metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) are fragile and inefficient with non‐specific gene delivery techniques, developing strategies use them to encapsulate unmodified natural siRNA from enzymatic degradation. MOFs with high nucleic acid binding affinity are ideal for encapsulating siRNAs in cancer therapy, bypassing circulation time and non‐specificity. To knock down Plk1gene, tumor cell membranes can hide Plk1 siRNA‐containing (Zeolitic Imidazolate framework) ZIF‐8 nanoparticles. For tumor suppression MOF‐promoted lysosome siRNA release, cell membrane coating, and PLK1 silencing are employed. Lysosomes attack cancer by delivering miRNA to targeted cells. Single‐stranded miRNA, two‐stranded siRNA. Despite their different sources, structures, modes of action, and biological activities, miRNA and siRNA regulate gene expression. SIRNA blocks genes more accurately than miRNA, which regulates larger genes. SiRNA‐MOF integration in vitro results in a maximum of 27% consistent gene silencing during endocytic absorption. Cofactor‐encapsulated MOF‐internalized siRNA kills enzymes. A universal siRNA delivery for a specific genetic sequence with personalized therapeutic potential contrasts with multi‐route cancer drugs. SiRNAs cleave long‐stranded RNAs coding for specific genes, allowing biocompatible MOFs to encapsulate macromolecules and protect them from injury.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer‐related death worldwide. More than 30% of CRC patients will experience treatment failure and tumor recurrence after standard‐of‐care treatment. Therefore, it is important to discover new therapeutic regimens for treating CRC. Repurposing existing clinically used drugs into new anticancer agents represents a feasible way and has become increasingly popular. In this study, the aim is to investigate the anticancer effect of sertraline on CRC and to elucidate its underlying mechanism. The data showed that sertraline exhibited a potent anticancer effect against CRC in vitro and in vivo. Sertraline inhibited Akt‐ and STAT3‐mediated cell proliferation but do not affect several programmed cell deaths in CRC, such as apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and mitophagy. Meanwhile, sertraline induced autophagosome accumulation but blocked autophagic flux in CRC cells. Further investigations reveal that sertraline impeded late autophagic flux at the stage of autolysosomal degradation rather than autophagosome‐lysosomal fusion in CRC. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that sertraline synergistically sensitized chemotherapeutic agents against CRC. Overall, the study reveals the great potential of sertraline as a novel therapeutic candidate for CRC, which is worthy of further development in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Globally a significant burden of tuberculosis (TB) is faced, which is difficult to eradicate due to patients' non‐adherence, and drug‐resistant strains that are spreading at an alarming rate. Novel approaches are required to improve diagnosis and treatment. Metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) have demonstrated potential as sensor probes and in combination therapy, which combines MNPs with antimycobacterial drugs to develop new treatment and theranostic approaches. To strengthen the theoretical foundation toward the clinical application of TB nanomedicine, this review focuses on the properties and effectiveness of therapeutically relevant MNPs. It also elaborates on their antimycobacterial mechanisms. This review aims to analyze the body of literature on the topic, pinpoint important empirical findings, and identify knowledge gaps that can provide a basis for future research endeavors and translation of the technologies. Current data suggest that MNPs are potential systems for efficient diagnosis and treatment although additional pre‐clinical and clinical research is needed to bring these technologies to the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Injectable depots have received increasing notoriety as local drug delivery vehicles for tumor treatment. Here, an intratumoral formulation of doxorubicin (Dox) is proposed that relies on the electrostatic interaction between the carboxylic group of click‐type crosslinked hyaluronic acid (Cx‐HA) and cationic Dox to achieve effective tumor treatment. The Dox‐loaded click‐type crosslinked HA (Cx‐HA‐Dox) formulation exhibits adequate injectability for intratumoral injection and rapidly forms a depot at the tumor site, remaining inside the tumor for over 18 days. This enhances the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of Dox primarily within the tumor, minimizing off‐target side effects. Intratumoral injection of Cx‐HA‐Dox in animal models significantly suppresses tumor growth, as evidenced by a decrease in tumor volume over time. Histological analysis reveals limited angiogenesis in the treated tumors and an increase in the number of large apoptotic cells.

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite advancements in the treatment of glioblastoma, it faces challenges due to tumor heterogeneity, the blood‐brain barrier, recurrence, immune evasion, and conventional strategies, leading to low survival and a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is crucial to develop novel, useful treatment strategies for improving brain distribution to overcome blood‐brain barriers (BBB) and help the treatment of glioblastoma. Conventional immunotherapy like checkpoint inhibitors, CAR‐T cell therapy, monoclonal antibodies, cancer vaccines, and adoptive cell transfer often suffers from low therapeutic outcomes because the singular therapy generally has shortcomings, such as the cold immune microenvironment of brain tumors. In contrast, the emerging combinatory immunotherapy integrated with chemo‐immunotherapy, photothermal‐immunotherapy, and radio‐immunotherapy has shown great promise to modulate tumoral immune microenvironment and boost treatment outcomes. This review discusses the immune microenvironment of GBM, its impact on immunological effects, current immunotherapy methods, and advanced studies. It also introduces combinational GBM immunotherapy with traditional cancer therapies like chemo‐immunotherapy, surgery‐immunotherapy, photothermal‐immunotherapy, and radiotherapy‐immunotherapy. In the future, it is anticipated that this article will provide beneficial information and a path for the strategy of innovative, efficient combination immunotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chronic wounds are one of the health challenges threatening human life. In these wounds, overexpression of some types of cytoskeletal actin‐remodeling proteins including Flightless I (Flii) can often lead to severe skin scarring. Herein, arginine functionalized poly(β‐amino ester)s are synthesized to develop polyplexes with alginate for delivery of Flii siRNA. This approach results in forming polyplexes with distinct features, such as tunable zeta potential, particle size, polydispersity, and arginine conjugation level. It is demonstrated that the uptake of arginine functionalized poly(β‐amino ester)/alginate particles is composition‐dependent for various cell types including J774.1 macrophages and BJ fibroblasts. Such polyplexes trigger nitric oxide release by macrophages enhancing the expression of anti‐inflammatory genes while diminishing the expression of pro‐inflammatory markers and demonstrating its immunomodulatory properties. Flii siRNA loaded particles provide condensed siRNA into the core‐shell polyplex and exhibit controlled release of Flii siRNA over 24 h. The uptake rate of this polyplex by macrophages and fibroblasts is higher than that of a commercial gene carrier (Lipofectamine 2000), knocking down the in vitro Flii gene expression (1.3‐fold). The increased BJ fibroblast proliferation and higher expression of collagen I (COL I) show the suitability of these polyplexes for wound healing.",

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an effective antioxidant enzyme widely used as a food supplement and cosmetic additive to alleviate OS and retard skin aging. However, conventional SOD delivery routes commonly yield unsatisfactory results due to limited stability, compromised bioavailability, and low absorption efficiency in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These issues are addressed by developing SOD‐encapsulated polymeric microneedle (PMN) patches for efficient transdermal delivery. The use of a highly stable SOD isolated from a hot spring microbe ensures its reactivity throughout PMN fabrication and application. This SOD vehicle demonstrated excellent effectiveness through inhibiting skin‐aging and promoting hair growth as validated by extensive in vivo experiments using D‐galactose (D‐gal) induced aging‐mouse model. SOD‐PMNs promoted excellent regeneration of hair follicles, increased melanin synthesis, decreased lipid oxidation, and elevated antioxidative capacity of skin tissue. The success in effective transdermal delivery of SOD promises wide applicability in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Allergen‐specific immunotherapy (AIT) has demonstrated its ability to induce desensitization, resulting in reduced allergen‐specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) accompanied by increased clinical thresholds. However, ensuring safety during therapy, especially with oral immunotherapy, and achieving long‐term tolerance continue to be significant challenges. To address these issues, a concept of nanoencapsulation of allergens has emerged. This paper reviews biodegradable and non‐biodegradable nanoparticles as an allergen‐delivery system, as well as adjuvants for the improvement of the efficacy of AIT. Of all the nanoparticles reviewed, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and chitosan are the most popular nanoparticles for encapsulating macromolecular allergens for oral immunotherapy. Although poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic acid) (PLGA) demonstrates higher stability in the gastrointestinal environment and allergen‐loaded PLGA attenuates the sIgE antibody binding in a murine model, it has inconsistent loading capacity and is difficult to reproduce. Studies on biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of nanoparticles, however, should be highlighted to ensure the long‐term safety profile of utilizing nanoparticles in immunotherapy. In this regard, encapsulation efficiency and release behavior of allergens from nanoparticles are important components in predicting the safety and efficacy of treatments. The stability, reproducibility, and scalability of encapsulated allergens should also be considered for the translation to clinical applications.",

These nanoparticles bring new capabilities in bioimaging and targeted therapeutics. Protein‐based carbon dots contain a carbon core and surface groups from the protein that can retain molecular recognition properties. In this work, a systematic study of synthesis conditions to tune nanoparticle protein function is presented. Bovine serum albumin is used as the model protein to simulate what synthesis parameter alterations yield valuable changes to nanoparticles such as red‐shifted photoluminescence, specific size distribution, and surface chemistry functionalization. The dissociation constant, K D is also calculated, for model BSA‐derived NPs and simulated the 1:1 protein‐ligand binding at equilibrium. It is found that increased temperatures generally led to higher quantum yields and more red‐shifted CDs believed to be due to larger diameters, while nitrogen doping decreased. However, when using microwave radiation, generally NPs are larger and has a 2.5–4.4% increase in nitrogen, resulting in the most red‐shifted and highest quantum yield samples. Oven samples possessed 1.6–17.5x lower K D compared to microwave samples. Understanding the effects of these parameters on CD characteristics enables scientists to rationally design CDs properties for specific applications.",

Upon irradiation, CPs generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may either cause local phototoxicity or could be exploited for photodynamic therapy. The propensity of the PEG–PLGA matrix to scavenge ROS has never been investigated. Here the ability of two PEG–PLGA structures (PEG 2 kDa –PLGA 4.5 kDa vs PEG 5 kDa –PLGA 55 kDa ) to mitigate the release of ROS generated by four different CPs (PFO, F8BT, CN‐PPV, and PCPDTBT) following irradiation (5 J cm −2 ) at 385, 455, and 656 nm is studied. The molar content of the PEG–PLGA matrix, rather than the molecular weight or composition, appeared to be the most influential factor, i.e., lower molar concentrations of the matrix polymer are associated with significant increases in phototoxicity. Multivariate analysis reveals that the combination of CP photophysical properties and nanoparticle matrix properties are important for understanding CP nanoparticle‐induced phototoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Retinoblastoma is a cancerous disease that affects the retina, and primarily affects young children. To date, the primary treatment goal of retinoblastoma is to save the child's life, while the preservation of the eye and its functionality are the secondary goals. Reoccurrence of tumors is mainly attributed to the persistence of cancer stem cells. EpCAM+ Y79 retinoblastoma cells behave like cancer stem cells and are recognized as cells that are resistant to treatment. We demonstrate an effective technique to treat retinoblastoma cancer cells, using femtosecond laser pulses and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)‐targeting gold nanorods (Au‐NRs). Complete assessment of the optimal laser parameters required for the development of a translational retinoblastoma cancer treatment is provided. Both an MTS cellular metabolism assay and a fluorescence viability assay demonstrate an astonishing cellular viability drop, to ≈10%. Right after laser irradiation the cellular membrane ruptures. Calculations and field‐emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) imaging show that Au‐NRs reach melting temperature after laser pulse exposure. Delivering femtosecond laser pulses directly onto the retina to treat retinoblastoma through the medium of the eye is possible without interacting with its compartments—making this treatment ideal for this type of cancer. This treatment methodology would be an invaluable tool for treatment of chemotherapy‐resistant and radiation‐resistant cancers.",

Herein, a novel pathway to greatly enhance the efficiency of PDT is proposed through an intracellular reaction that occurs in composite nanogels with Fe 3 O 4 nanoclusters in their core and disulfide‐crosslinked phosphorylcholines in their shell. These redox‐active nanogels are able to downregulate the endogenous glutathione (GSH) levels via a thiol‐disulfide exchange reaction, which results in the preferential accumulation of cytotoxic ROS generated by the encapsulated photosensitizer (Chlorine 6) for cell apoptosis and tumor‐growth inhibition. In addition to disulfide‐assisted PDT, the composite nanogel exhibits improved cellular uptake, circulation time, targeted distribution, intracellular degradation, and selective toxicity, which provides great promise for the use of these nanogels as a simple, safe, and effective cancer treatment.",

However, heterogeneous distribution of heat by PTT in the tumor region often results in tumor regrowth and metastasis. Integrating PTT with chemotherapy in a precisely controlled tumor maneuvering and drug‐releasing nanoconstruct will be an ideal strategy for higher therapeutic index. Herein, nanoemulsions (NEMSn) based on a highly biocompatible extra virgin olive oil are developed to encapsulate IR‐780 for PTT and near infrared fluorescence imaging as well as doxorubicin (DOX) for chemotherapy. NEMSn are further stabilized with Tween‐20 and hyaluronic acid to form an ultrafine theranostic photo nanoemulsions (UTPNEMSn) for combinatorial photo‐chemotherapy. Once injected into the system, UTPNEMS homes to the tumor region owing to passive targeting. Tumor accumulated UTPNEMSn readily destabilizes upon laser irradiation to release the DOX, thereby synergizing the therapeutic effects of DOX and PTT. In vivo studies demonstrate a complete tumor eradication without tumor recurrence or systemic toxicity, owing to their biocompatible formulation. By virtue of the olive oil based NEMSNs and precise controlled drug releasing properties collaborating with the synergistic therapeutic modalities, UTPNEMSn are able to provide a promising method for controlled drug delivery systems.",

Many involve drug dissolution in organic solvents and liquid surfactants, or use of lyophilization and reconstitution approaches. “Surfactant‐stripping,” has been previously reported, in which hydrophobic drugs were first dispersed in Pluronic (Poloxamer) surfactant, then subjected to membrane processing below the critical micelle temperature, to remove free and loose surfactant while retaining the active cargo. In the present work, stabilized, surfactant‐stripped (sss) cabazitaxel (CTX) micelles with potential for long‐term aqueous storage are developed. Some 50 hydrophobic co‐loaders cargos are screened for capacity to prevent aggregation of CTX, of which approximately 10 are effective. Further screening identifies the antifungal clotrimazole and the abortificant mifepristone as the most effective stabilizers for sss‐CTX micelles, via interference with the CTX aggregation process. Micelles remain stable for hundreds of days in aqueous storage and suppress the growth of orthotopic 4T1 murine mammary tumors. Pharmacokinetics, tubulin stabilization, and neutropenia induction of sss‐CTX are generally comparable to a TWEEN‐80 CTX formulation. These data reveal sss‐CTX as a taxane delivery vehicle with a high drug‐to‐surfactant ratio and capacity for extended aqueous storage.",

    "abstract": "Nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery holds promise for treatment of cancers. However, most approaches fail to be translated into clinical success due to ineffective tumor targeting in vivo. Here, the delivery potential of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) functionalized with targeting ligands for EGFR and CCR2 is explored in lung tumors. The addition of active targeting ligands on MSNs enhances their uptake in vitro but fails to promote specific delivery to tumors in vivo, when administered systemically via the blood or locally to the lung into immunocompetent murine lung cancer models. Ineffective tumor targeting is due to efficient clearance of the MSNs by the phagocytic cells of the liver, spleen, and lung. These limitations, however, are successfully overcome using a novel organ-restricted vascular delivery (ORVD) approach. ORVD in isolated and perfused mouse lungs of Kras-mutant mice enables effective nanoparticle extravasation from the tumor vasculature into the core of solid lung tumors. In this study, ORVD promotes tumor cell-specific uptake of nanoparticles at cellular resolution independent of their functionalization with targeting ligands. Organ-restricted vascular delivery thus opens new avenues for optimized nanoparticles for lung cancer therapy and may have broad applications for other vascularized tumor types.",

Through structure‐guided molecular design, TSA‐presenting huHFs for targeting TSAs at dendritic cells (DCs) are constructed with preservation of huHF‐intrinsic affinity for transferrin receptors on DCs, and multi‐copies of an ICM are also presented on huHF for blocking a cognate regulatory IC. The adjuvant‐free co‐administration of TSA‐ and ICM‐presenting huHFs effectively elicits TSA‐specific CD8+ T cell activation, strikingly suppresses both tumor growth and interleukin 17+ CD4+ T cell responses, and generates long‐lasting protective immunity, indicating that this novel approach offers a promising breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The heating of diseased tissue as a therapeutic measure has gained increased clinical attention, mostly due to its target‐specificity that minimizes side effects. However, to ensure a successful therapy, heating has to be homogeneous and highly localized, as well as, within a certain temperature range. Therefore, precise control over thermal treatments is a clinical prerequisite to minimize treatment and safety margins. Although this requirement is mentioned frequently, past research has focused predominantly on improving thermometry resolution and heating efficiency through tedious material optimization. Here, current clinical applications of thermal therapy with their challenges are first highlighted, especially with respect to treatment control and margins. Thereafter, it is quantitatively shown that clinically available thermometry fulfills the requirements and future research should focus on achieving better temperature control instead. With nanotechnology, novel strategies based on self‐limiting nanoparticle systems and particle‐based thermometers with active feed‐back control have also become available and are discussed. All of these approaches are systematically compared and analyzed with respect to their clinical applicability. The extent to which control over thermal therapy is necessary is also discussed alongside a presentation of the existing methods which fulfill the set requirements for clinical success and what issues remain to be tackled by research in the near future.",

In a 2‐dimensional culture, NtMPCs undergo chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation more readily than BMSCs upon culture in appropriate media. However, the osteogenic differentiation ability of NtMPCs is lower than that of BMSCs. 3‐dimensional (3D) biologically active scaffolds (BAs) comprising poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres are constructed to improve osteogenic differentiation. To generate BAs, nanoparticles containing an l ‐Arginyl‐Glycyl‐ l ‐Aspartic acid (RGD) sequence (RGD‐NPs) and dexamethasone (DEX), a drug used to control differentiation and inflammation, are simultaneously encapsulated by PLGA to form particles measuring 150–250 µm. After that, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) is immobilized on the surface of polyethylenimine (PEI)‐coated microspheres via formation of ionic bonds between O‐sulfate and N‐sulfate in heparin with lysine/arginine residues of BMP2. Gene expression profiling is performed via QuantSeq 3′ mRNA‐sequencing in mice transplanted with BAs containing NtMPCs and BMSCs. Expression of the osteogenic differentiation‐related genes collagen Type I Alpha 2 (COL1A2), Homeobox protein MSX‐2 (MSX2), Runt‐related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) is 2–3‐fold higher in mice transplanted with BAs containing NtMPCs than in mice transplanted with BAs containing BMSCs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation, leading to the destruction of gastrointestinal tract tissue. Strategies specifically utilized to manage intestinal inflammation in patients afflicted with Crohn's disease (CD) are met with numerous obstacles. These include treatment‐specific physiological side effects and the development of resistance to biological and pharmacological therapies. As an alternative treatment approach, high aspect ratio supramolecular anti‐inflammatory peptide amphiphiles (AIF‐PAs) are engineered to mitigate small intestinal inflammation within the established, preclinical CD‐like ilieitis senescence accelerated mouse (SAMP1)/YitFcsJ murine model. Data derived from this study demonstrate ileitis that the direct injection of AIF‐PAs into inflammatory small intestinal skip lesions minimizes pathologic change in tissue architecture and intestinal physiology. When compared to untreated or saline injected control animals, AIF‐PAs substantially reduce lesion size and tissue‐specific inflammation, inciting cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interferon gamma (IFNγ), interleukin (IL)‐1β, and IL‐13 along with a concomitant decrease including in tissue proinflammatory innate and adaptive immune cells. Finally, this is accompanied by increased small bowel intestinal transit that aligns with improved gross intestinal pathology scoring. Taken together, this study provides evidence that AIF‐PAs may serve as a novel stand‐alone or combinatorial therapy to enhance efficacy in order to treat localized intestinal inflammation related to CD.",

Molecular dynamics simulations are separately implemented to investigate how/where the SGDs interacted with both pathogens. The simulations revealed that the SGDs: 1) develop multivalent binding with polybasic regions within and outside of the V3 loop on glycoprotein 120 (gp120) for HIV-1, and consecutively bind with multiple gp120 subunits, and 2) interact with basic amino acids in both the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and HSPG binding regions of the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2.

Amphotericin B, currently used to treat leishmaniasis and cryptococcosis, is very toxic and cannot eradicate intracellular Cryptococcus neoformans ( C. neoformans ). Glycosylated gold nanoparticles are water dispersible and biocompatible with very little toxicity. While amphotericin B is insoluble in water at neutral pH, conjugates of amphotericin B and ultra‐small gold nanoparticles (AuNP) are better dispersible in water. Amphotericin B conjugated glycosylated gold nanoparticles (AmpoB@AuNP) are more efficacious in treating both extracellular and intracellular forms of Leishmania mexicana ( L. mexicana ) than amphotericin B alone. In addition, AmpoB@AuNP are effective in reducing C. neoformans biofilms by 80% and intracellular C. neoformans burden by &gt;90%. Furthermore, AmpoB@AuNP are not haemolytic at 50 µg mL −1 and are significantly less toxic to murine macrophages than amphotericin B. Ultra‐small AuNPs are attractive delivery agents to treat intracellular infections and AmpoB@AuNP may be useful for treating C. neoformans infections in immunocompromised patients.",

Therefore, a novel multifunctional biopolymer‐anticancer drug combination nanomedicine is designed for the prevention of spontaneous metastasis while treating primary TNBC. Oligomeric hyaluronic acid (oHA) and doxorubicin (DOX) at a synergistic ratio against TNBC cells are co‐loaded in a polymer‐lipid hybrid nanoparticle (PLN) which is then functionalized with an internalizing cyclic peptide iRGD (iRGD‐DOX‐oHA‐PLN). iRGD conjugation enhances cellular uptake and cytotoxicity in vitro and nanoparticle (NP) accumulation in human TNBC tumors that overexpress integrins. NP‐delivered oHA inhibits cell migration and invasion in vitro via the intracellular release of oHA that interacts with the receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility and downregulates the phospho‐extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (p‐ERK) signaling pathway. Intravenously injected iRGD‐DOX‐oHA‐PLN significantly inhibits the growth of primary TNBC tumors in a mouse model and prevents spontaneous metastasis to the lungs and lymph nodes, superior to free solutions of DOX, oHA, or both and NP formulations loaded with DOX or oHA. These results suggest that iRGD‐DOX‐oHA‐PLN can be a promising bioactive polymer‐drug combination nanomedicine for the treatment of TNBC and prevention of its spontaneous metastasis.",

The current clinical treatment by dropping prednisolone acetate (PA) and levofloxacin (LF) suffers from drawbacks, such as low bioavailability and poor patient compliance. This study aims to develop a rationally designed thermoresponsive formulation combining PA and LF using nancomposites of mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) and thermo‐nanogel (thermogel) (PA@MSN‐LF@Thermogel). The in vitro release profiles of PA and LF from PA@MSN‐LF@Thermogel are tailor‐made to adapt to wound healing by a sustained release of 28 days. PA@MSN‐LF@Thermogel exhibits little cytotoxicity to human Tenon's fibroblasts and human corneal epithelial cells, while presents excellent in vitro antibacterial effectiveness to Staphylococcus bacteria. After implanted into the rabbit eye by a subconjunctival injection, PA@MSN‐LF@Thermogel displays overwhelming anti‐inflammatory and antibacterial effectiveness up to 21 days using only one‐eighth of the total dose, compared with PA and LF eye drops. The formulation does not cause any ocular hypertension and noticeable histopathological abnormality which indicate good biosafety. This thermoresponsive nanocomposite formulation is thus a promising drug delivery alternative for treatment of postoperative inflammation after intraocular surgeries.",

It remains to be explored whether the suppression of AR genes in activated T cells during anti‐PD‐1 therapy is able to overcome AR and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. Small‐interfering RNAs (siRNAs) acting via RNA interference mechanisms are able to shut down the expression of target genes. The authors report here a T‐cell targeting conjugate of antibody‐siRNA with response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) (TCAR ROS ) for the suppression of AR gene as well as to block the PD‐1/PD‐L1 interaction. TCAR ROS is able to bind with PD‐1 on T cells, then release functional siRNA to suppress AR genes in activated T cells with abundant ROS to cleave the linker in the conjugate. TCAR ROS comprising the siRNA targeting CD‐38 attached to PD‐1 blocking antibody (αPD‐1) via the ROS responsive linker is tested on activated T cells as well as mice bearing B16 tumor. Synergistic effect is observed on mice treated with TCAR ROS in anti‐PD‐1 immunotherapy, which suggests the potentials of this novel ROS responsive αPD‐1‐siRNA conjugate in anti‐PD‐1 immunotherapy to overcome AR.",

Noble metal nanoparticles have been developed with semiconductors to promote their photocatalytic activities; however, the incorporation of noble metal NPs brings the risk of toxicity from the heavy metal species, especially for the widely used Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs). Herein, an all‐organic chloridized g‐C 3 N 4 /perylene‐3,4,9,10‐tetracarboxylic diimide (Cl‐CNPD) heterostructure is chosen as a platform, in which the chloridized g‐C 3 N 4 provides bonding sites for uniform loading of AgNPs to prepare a plasmonic antibacterial nanocomposite. Benefiting from the in situ implanting approach, plasmon‐induced light manipulation from the homodispersed AgNPs enables the nanocomposites to produce more reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in an antibacterial efficacy up to 96.1 ± 1.4% and 91.5 ± 1.8% against Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) under simulated sunlight (20 mW cm −2 ) and indoor light (5 mW cm −2 ) irradiation within 20 min, respectively, much higher than that of the organic heterostructure. Moreover, the strong interaction between the AgNPs and Cl‐CNPD not only guarantees negligible toxicity by minimizing Ag leakage, but also shows high durability with unchanged efficacy after challenging bacteria up to five times repeatedly. Therefore, this confined plasmonic‐based antibacterial nanocomposite shows great potential as a safe therapeutic system for wound disinfection.",

However, cancer treatments with adoptive cell transfer or immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) have shown critical limitations against solid tumors, which comprise the majority of human cancers. Thus, novel cancer immunotherapy which harnesses innate immunity process may be required in these tumor types. Cyclic GMP‐AMP synthase (cGAS)‐stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, one of the innate immune sensors, has gained interest in the field of immuno‐oncology as activation of this pathway can drive both innate and adaptive immune responses among immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. Recently, various cGAS‐STING‐activating strategies have been intensively investigated to achieve durable and widespread therapeutic responses in in vivo models. These meaningful preclinical outcomes have enabled several clinical trials. This review discusses agents targeting various aspects of the cGAS‐STING pathway in cancer immunotherapy from benchtop to bedside. Moreover, various approaches to improve the clinical feasibility of cGAS‐STING‐activating strategies are delineated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Substantial preclinical data have validated cyclic hexapeptide complement C5a receptor 1 antagonists (C5aRAs) that target immune cells, as novel therapies for a range of inflammatory diseases that currently have limited effective treatment options. However, like most small‐molecule peptides, their poor oral bioavailability and short circulation half‐life are major hurdles that have limited their clinical translation. Here, a single emulsion technique is employed to produce poly(lactic‐ co ‐glycolic) acid nanoparticles (NPs) with exceptionally high peptide C5aRA (PMX205) loading efficiency (over 50%). Strikingly, the PMX205‐NPs not only facilitate prolonged release of the encapsulated PMX205 but also dramatically increase its oral bioavailability (from ≈25% to ≈50%), and therapeutic potential (≈95% inhibition of C5a induces neutrophilia in mice and maintenance of neuroprotective barrier integrity). The enhanced in vivo pharmacological activity of PMX205 in the form of NPs opens an exciting opportunity for the clinical application of peptide C5aRAs and possibly other therapeutic peptides.",

Here, the authors demonstrate a strategy for codelivering an immunostimulatory cytokine, the interleukin IL-21, with an engineered outer domain (eOD) human immunodeficiency virus gp120 Env immunogen eOD, bound together to alum to bolster the humoral immune response. In this approach, the immunogen and cytokine are co-anchored to alum particles via a short phosphoserine (pSer) peptide linker, promoting stable binding to alum and sustained bioavailability following injection. pSer-modified eOD and IL-21 promote enhanced lymphatic drainage and lead to accumulation of the vaccine in B cell follicles in the draining lymph nodes. This in turn promotes enhanced T follicular helper cell priming and robust germinal center responses as well as increased antigen-specific serum IgG titers. This is a general strategy for codelivery of immunostimulatory cytokine with immunogens providing a facile approach to modulate T cell priming and GC reactions toward enhanced protective immunity using the most common clinical vaccine adjuvant.",

Their tumor growth inhibition ratio (67.6%) is significantly higher than that of AuNRs@SiO 2 ‐ICG (28.5%) after one dose intratumor injection and NIR irradiation. Together with their good biosafety, the AuNRs@MnO 2 @SiO 2 ‐ICG is promisingly translational.

    "abstract": "Abstract An effective therapeutic strategy to treat vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) that is mainly caused by Candida albicans ( C. albicans ) infection is highly desirable. While Amphotericin B (AmB) has demonstrated promise, its precise localization to C. albicans burden at vaginal sites is oftentimes limited by the high fluidity microenvironment of the vagina, which can compromise treatment efficacy. To overcome this issue, a biomimetic AmB delivery system is developed, in which AmB preloaded polymeric cores are cloaked with vaginal epithelial cells membrane (VM‐ANP). With its cell membrane coating, VM‐ANP naturally targets and strongly binds with C. albicans , thus resisting the self‐cleaning of vaginal fluid. Besides its long retention property, VM‐ANP could penetrate deeply in vaginal tissue to achieve its full antifungal potential by attaching to hidden C. albicans . It is shown that both C. albicans suspension and biofilm biomass could be effectively inhibited by the VM‐ANP in vitro. In a C. albicans intravaginal infection model, treatment with VM‐ANP results in significantly decreased fungal challenges both in vaginal tissue and fluid. Overall, such biomimetic strategy adds the merit of natural cell membrane into the targeted delivery of drug in treating VVC, which also serves as a promising platform against vaginitis‐related pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The efficacy of therapies is often hampered by limited tumor drug accumulation achieved through their intravenous administration, and by the lack of selectivity in targeting and killing cancer cells. Amplification of tumor redox stress and ferroptotic cell death to achieve selective killing of cancer cells using iron‐containing agents has attracted considerable interest. However, these agents need high doses and multiple injection regimens and have limited success in the treatment of cancers such as melanoma. Melanoma often metastasizes via lymphatic vessels, where the metastasizing cells experience less redox stress and are protected from ferroptosis. Here it is shown that phospholipid‐modified Pt(IV) prodrug‐loaded iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP)‐filled micelles (mIONP‐PL‐Pt(IV)), which integrate redox reactivity and iron‐enabled catalytic therapeutic features with effective nanoparticle‐assisted lymphatic delivery, provide significantly enhanced suppression of melanoma tumor growth compared to cisplatin‐based chemotherapy and IONP treatments. Peroxidase‐like activity, redox‐triggered release of cisplatin, and reactivity with hydrogen peroxide and ascorbic acid are contributors toward the induction of a combined ferroptosis‐based and cisplatin anti‐melanoma treatment. Treatment with mIONP‐PL‐Pt(IV) provides significant tumor control using cumulative treatment doses 10–100‐fold lower than reported in intravenously administered treatments. This work demonstrates the potential of enhancing chemotherapeutic and iron‐based catalytic nanomedicine efficacy exploiting nanoparticle‐enabled lymphatic trafficking.",

To screen the effectiveness of new therapies, there is an urgent need for reliable in vitro models. Key is that diseased cells' characteristics are maintained, which is challenging in currently used setups. In this study, an in vitro 3D culture system is described using the biocompatible polyisocyanide (PIC‐RGD) hydrogel and SSc patient‐derived fibroblasts from affected (lesional cells) and from healthy‐skin (healthy cells). In contrast to the standard collagen‐coated 2D cultures, the cells in the 3D PIC‐RGD gels maintain the native phenotype and functionality of the primary cells. The functionality of the model is studied in the presence of the fibrosis stimulator transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and the suppressor tumor necrosis factor (TNFα). In this study, it is observed that lesional cells have a stronger fibrotic character with increased contraction, proliferation, and expression of collagen, and myofibroblast markers α‐smooth muscle actin and fibroblast activation protein. The high tunability of the hydrogel, which can maintain the native functionality of fibroblasts in in vitro cultures, delivers a crucial step in developing these materials into an effective tool for personalized medicine approaches of SSc patients.",

While nucleic acid therapy using unmodified DNA or RNA is the primary focus in disease treatment, there is growing need to develop nucleic acid‐based small molecules owing to their potential clinical benefits as drugs in terms of cost and scalability. While small molecules targeting protein–protein interactions are known to alter the transcriptional status of a cell, they can result in a transient effect and variation of bio‐efficacy among patients. Small molecules targeting DNA and/or RNA are in demand in the precision medicine approach as they have consistent bioactivity among patients. This review details the progress of sequence‐specific DNA‐binding pyrrole–imidazole polyamides (PIPs) in modulating the transcriptional status of target gene(s) without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Here, the different versions of PIPs are listed, and also, how conjugating them with DNA alkylating agents, epigenetic modulators, and other drugs can improve their clinical utility as targeted transcription therapeutics. Owing to their specificity, functional diversity, and limited toxicity, PIP technology holds enormous promise as frontrunner in small‐molecule‐based nucleic acid drugs to precisely regulate therapeutically important genes on demand and treat intractable diseases.",

However, efficient use of bromelain in clinics is restricted by bromelain instability at storage conditions and on oral use. Therefore, the goal of present investigation is to encapsulate bromelain in rationally tailored mucoadhesive polymeric nanocarriers for nasal delivery to refurbish its anti‐asthmatic activity and improve bioavailability. Bromelain laden Eudragid RL 100 nanocarriers (Br‐EuNCs) are engineered via double emulsion solvent evaporation method and optimized to amplify bromelain encapsulation within nanosize range (259.73 ± 16.51 nm). Dissolution study reveals prolonged bromelain release behavior (24 h) whereas higher mucin binding strength confirms mucoadhesive nature of Br‐EuNCs. Pharmacokinetic study in rats indicates 2.89‐fold increase in bromelain bioavailability after its encapsulation. Subsequently, pharmacodynamic studies reveal that optimized formulation significantly ( p &lt;0.05) reduces spasm, bronchial hyper‐responsiveness and inhibits convulsions in the ovalbumin induced asthma model. In addition, Br‐EuNCs significantly regulate hematological, biochemical, and immunological parameters disturbed during ovalbumin exposure. Histological studies of lung show significant protectionoffered by formulation against tissue damage during asthma. The results suggest that therapeutic performance of bromelain can be improved utilizing Br‐EuNCs as a platform via nasal route for asthma management.",

However, their effectiveness in severe spinal cord injury (SCI) models with a physical gap between the injured sites is unclear. This study highlights the important role of physical guidance in increasing the therapeutic efficacy of in vivo reprogramming technologies in SCI hemisection models. Reactive astrocytes are selected as host targets for conversion into neurons. An astrocyte‐tropic adeno‐associated viral (AAV) vector, AAVShH19, is used to deliver the neuronal transcription factor NeuroD1 to reactive astrocytes. The infusion of AAVShH19‐NeuroD1 induces astrocyte‐to‐neuron conversion, but improvement of locomotive function is not observed due to the physical distance between the rostral and caudal sides, which impedes axonal extension. To address this issue, electrospun fibrous matrices with adhesive and aligned structural features are implanted into the hemisection cavity and designed to release AAVShH19‐NeuroD1. The combination of the AAV‐mediated reprogramming approach and the matrices promoted astrocyte‐to‐neuron conversion and coordinated the elongation of neuronal axons along the fibers, leading to improved synaptic connections and motor function. This study demonstrates the potential of physical support to enhance the efficacy of direct neuronal reprogramming.",

As nonselective inhibition is associated with off‐target effects, strategies to achieve selectivity for the clinically preferred isoform COX‐2 are of high interest. The modification of NSAIDs using carborane clusters as phenyl mimetics is reported to alter the selectivity profile through size exclusion. Inspired by these findings, isonimesulide and its carborane derivatives are prepared. The biological screening shows that the carborane containing compounds exhibit a stronger antitumor potential compared to nimesulide and isonimesulide. Furthermore, the replacement of the phenyl ring of isonimesulide with a carborane moiety resulted in a shift of the COX activity from nonactive to COX‐active compounds.",

Scaffolds for tissue‐engineered cardiovascular prostheses can be obtained from allogenic cell sources, that can then produce human tissue‐engineered matrices (hTEMs) in vitro. Traditionally, fetal bovine serum (FBS) is used as a universal cell growth supplement. However, concerns regarding its biosafety remain a challenge for clinical translation. The aim of this study is to develop a novel xenogeneic serum‐free approach for the manufacturing of clinical grade hTEMs. To achieve this, decellularized hTEMs are generated under xenogeneic serum‐free conditions and have subsequently demonstrated hTEMs perform similarly to the FBS‐supplemented control group in terms of extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, hemocompatibility, thrombogenicity, and calcification potential. Finally, the xenogeneic serum‐free protocol is successfully adapted to the development of hTEM‐based tissue‐engineered heart valves for the systemic circulation, showing proof‐of‐concept functionality in vitro. Overall, the data suggest the effectiveness of xenogeneic serum‐free culture method as a valid alternative to FBS for the production of hTEM for cardiovascular applications.",

Among therapeutic proteins, enzymes are particularly attractive because of their specificity, efficient reaction rates, regeneration after substrate turnover, and proven track record in the treatment of diseases ranging from cancer to inherited metabolic and lysosomal storage disorders. Herein, previous work on electrohydrodynamic jetting is expanded upon by developing a novel class of protein nanoparticles that features therapeutic enzymes. In particular, nanoparticles incorporating the antioxidant enzyme, catalase, at weight fractions as high as 50% are reported. Catalase‐based synthetic protein nanoparticles (CAT‐SPNPs) demonstrate sustained antioxidative activity, retain significantly enhanced enzymatic activity compared to its solute form, and overall demonstrate good structural stability. Moreover, surface functionalization of CAT‐SPNPs with targeting antibodies results in ≈12.5‐fold increase in uptake over unmodified control particles. Importantly, CAT‐SPNPs exert protection from oxidative stress, as indicated by significant increase in viability and reduction in LDH release compared to equivalent amounts of free catalase. Taken together, the work establishes targeted enzyme‐based SPNPs as a platform for enhancing the drug‐like properties of therapeutic enzymes.",

Different types of photothermal conversion agents have been developed, particularly the second near‐infrared window (NIR‐II, 1000–1700 nm) organic small molecular dyes which have become an attractive research direction. Herein, a novel and simple donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type NIR‐II dye SeC is designed and synthesized with 2λ4δ2‐[1,2,5]selenadiazolo[3,4‐f]‐2,1,3‐benzothiadiazole structure. To improve capability of SeC for biomedical applications, SeC molecules are encapsulated into DSPE‐PEG 2000 to construct nanoparticles SeC‐NPs, which show high photostability and biocompatibility. More importantly, SeC‐NPs exhibited an excellent photothermal performance and display high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 62% under 808 nm excitation. Because of favorable fluorescence property in NIR‐II window and high PCE, SeC‐NPs are successfully used for NIR‐II imaging and PTT of 4T1 tumor‐bearing mice models. In vivo studies demonstrate SeC‐NPs’ ability to suppress tumor growth under NIR photoirradiation without visible damage to main organs. Overall, this study develops a strategy to design a simple small molecule dye containing selenium for NIR‐II imaging, and SeC‐NPs shows high performance for PTT toward tumor.",

This study aim to evaluate the therapeutic activity of eye‐drop instillation of a high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) variant bearing a cell‐penetrating peptide and neovasculature‐targeted peptide (AsnGlyArg [NGR] peptide) in a mouse model at a dose of 0.6–0.85 µg protein/eye drop. The results reveal that the activity of the abovementioned variant was &gt;10‐fold higher than that of the previous variant lacking an NGR peptide. In addition, the anti‐inflammatory activity, cholesterol‐efflux capacity, and antiangiogenic activity of reconstituted HDL are significantly augmented by the attachment of these two peptides. The mechanism underlying this dramatic improvement is likely the expression of CD13, an NGR peptide receptor, on the cornea and conjunctiva in mice. CD13 mRNA/protein expression is also detected in cultured human corneal and conjunctival cells. These results demonstrate that NGR peptide is an unprecedented class of an absorption enhancer on the eye surface. Thus, HDL engineering is a potential strategy for developing eye drops to treat neovascular AMD by enhancing the ocular surface absorption and HDL functionalities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alternatives are needed to remove the pain, injury, cross‐infection, and hazardous waste associated with needle and syringe (N+S)‐based vaccination. Reported here is the use of novel ultrasound‐responsive protein cavitation nuclei (pCaN), formed using the model antigen bovine serum albumin (BSA), to achieve effective transcutaneous delivery. Upon exposure to ultrasound (US), these pCaN instigate cavitation events which propel themselves and co‐located DNA vectors into the skin. US parameters as well as pCaN and DNA concentration are refined to achieve optimal expression of encoded luciferase transgene. Twenty‐four hours post‐treatment, luciferase expression in the skin, by IVIS imaging, was 1.67 × 10 6 ±941943, photons per sec for N+S intradermal injection and 1.49 × 10 6 ±261832 for cavitation‐mediated delivery ( p &gt;0.05). Hence, there is no significant difference in luciferase level achieved, but improved homogeneity and reproducibility of expression are evident in mice treated using US‐mediated cavitation. Despite this equivalence in luciferase levels, a &gt;5× higher level ( p &lt;0.02) of anti‐luciferase antibodies is achieved when cavitation is used versus N+S injection. Antibody levels against BSA, resulting from the use of BSA pCaN, are equivalent for the two groups. PCaN can be formed from a range of antigenic proteins and DNA can encode a range of antigenic proteins, so this approach has wide‐ranging implications for needle‐free vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hyaluronan (HA) is an extracellular matrix (ECM)‐based polymer with unique physicochemical properties including biocompatibility, biodegradability, viscoelasticity, and high‐water retention. However, its solubility in water drastically reduces its half‐life in vivo. Through judicious chemical modifications, its structure is easily crosslinked and can conjugate with numerous therapeutic molecules, extending their therapeutic function. Throughout this review, an overview of crosslinking methods to create HA hydrogels is provided, including covalent (permanent, transient/dynamic) and noncovalent chemistries, as well as the use of nonmodified HA in supramolecular hydrogels. HA‐based injectable hydrogels are very appealing as a three‐dimensional network for the delivery of therapeutic molecules (drugs and biomolecules) and stem cells. HA hydrogels are capable of mimicking important features of the native ECM and can provide spatiotemporal signals to regulate cell fate. The final part of the review also describes the application of HA hydrogels as vehicles for delivering stem cells and therapeutics, capable of modulating cell behavior.",

The cytotoxicity of the developed DOX loaded HAT NPs is tested against breast cancer cells (MDA‐MB‐231) showing higher cytotoxicity as compared to free DOX. In addition, the ability of HAT NPs to generate ROS activity upon irradiation by gamma radiations (0.5 &amp; 5 Gy) is also analyzed in cancer cells to demonstrate the ability of synthesized system as a potent candidate to present radio sensitization.

    "abstract": "Abstract Modulating the nanoparticle (NP)–cell interactions in protein‐rich environments is of increasing significance to nanomedicine. One major challenge is that the synthetic identity (such as targeting) of NPs endowed for this purpose can be adversely altered by opsonization processes. The formed protein corona on NPs can cause fast clearance of NPs by macrophages and reduced cancer cell uptake. The transformable NPs, which are grafted with a cleavable antifouling surface to achieve inactive‐active targeting form conversion, offer great promise to efficiently modulate NP–cell interactions. However, most of the transformable NPs lack a sustainable protection mechanism to avoid the influence of the protein corona during the post‐transformation period, leading to the re‐opsonization on NPs. Here, the authors design a smart transformable nanosystem with a photo‐triggered zwitterion‐induced sequential antifouling surface to efficiently reduce protein adsorption on NPs and modulate the NP–cell interactions in protein‐rich environments. The authors demonstrate that the primary PEGylated antifouling surface could protect the NPs against uptake by macrophages. Furthermore, the photo‐induced secondary zwitterionic antifouling surface is shown to preserve the targeting capacity of biotin‐modified NPs during the post‐transformation period in protein‐rich environments. In contrast, the biotin‐conjugated NPs without antifouling surfaces almost lost the targeting specificity in protein‐rich environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A key challenge in immunotherapy for glioblastomas, the most common form of primary adult brain cancer, involves the paucity of immune‐stimulatory cells in its “cold” immune‐microenvironment. Herein, mechanical acoustic ablation focused by perfluorocarbon (PFC) liquid filled silica microshells is applied to induce immunogenicity via in situ ultrasonic lysis. The inert PFC filled ultra‐thin walled silica microshells promote mechanical ablation while aiding in ultrasound guidance. In the presence of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1) blockade, tumor injury sites exhibit an increase in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ) by 1–2 orders of magnitude. At least 75% of mice grafted with the advanced murine glioblastoma tumors achieve remission when treated with a combination of microshell enhanced ablation and PD‐1 blockade, which indicates a synergistic effect. In contrast, none of the mice treated with single therapies achieve durable remission. Likelihood of remission correlated with the abundance of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( p &lt; 0.001) and IFN‐γ levels ( p = 0.001). This study demonstrates a PFC filled ultrathin walled microshell enhanced ablation strategy that induces a “hot” immune‐microenvironment and augments efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade against advanced tumors.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, the field of medicine has largely been practiced using population-based approaches.1 This is clearly illustrated in the context of drug development for many indications that span oncology to infectious diseases and pain management, among others. For example, patient therapy is conventionally given using one-size-fits-all protocols, which virtually precludes realizing optimal objective response rates and overall survival outcomes. Emerging strategies are seeking to harness novel analytics platforms to interrogate population-based big data sets to parse out improved treatments that will still largely be used2 to treat individuals. It is important to note, however, that while it is common knowledge that substantial inter-patient variability in treatment outcomes exists, the degree of intra-patient variability at the N-of-1/single patient level, can potentially be so substantial that truly personalized healthcare will require dynamic modulation of the intervention and/or the intensity of care in order to sustain the optimization of efficacy and safety. While population-driven strategies will ultimately enhance the ability to identify effective interventions, the ability to use a single patient's data to guide the patient's own care will also be needed to effectively implement these interventions with unprecedented precision. The ability to individualize care will broadly impact multiple facets of medicine, ranging from drug-based therapy to emerging digital therapeutics platforms that are harnessing software as treatment. By harnessing digital medicine to realize N-of-1 interventions, it is possible to render patient responses that are more uniformly efficacious compared to traditional approaches. Effectively integrating these platforms into healthcare delivery workflows is expected to improve healthcare outcomes and cost effectiveness over traditional approaches. Among the many areas that can benefit from AI/digital medicine, N-of-1 medicine and digital therapeutics have tremendous potential to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare cost inflation. These advances have been bridged with substantial growth in the private sector to scale AI and digital medicine deployment into practice. According to Galen Growth Asia and Rock Health, two digital health analytics platforms, US$5.0B was invested in Asia and US$7.4B was invested in the US in 2019 demonstrating clear investor enthusiasm for investing in the future of healthcare.3 This special issue discusses key areas where digital medicine and AI are poised to markedly individualize intervention and enhance treatment outcomes, citing examples from the field, and provide examples of recent advances that will serve as a gateway towards next-generation, AI-enhanced digital medicine. The promise of personalized medicine will ultimately reduce the inter-patient and intra-patient variability in treatment outcomes that are observed, which are the key drivers of sub-optimal efficacy and safety that is observed across the stages of early drug development, clinical trials, and the postapproval point of care.4 Unfortunately, implementing the entire workflow of personalizing care is often incomplete, as there are many considerations that must be considered in this domain, ranging from how interventional trials are designed, to the strategies employed to maximize the number of patients that initially and continue to respond positively to treatment. One major challenge in developing novel drug treatments is the ability to sufficiently interrogate the space created by the range of possible drugs for a given indication. This is a challenge that confronts all aspects of treatment design, regardless of indication. Therefore, it impacts everything from oncology to metabolic diseases and metabolic diseases and beyond. In a recent study, an orthogonal array composite design (OACD)-driven set of drug combinations was subsequently used to optimize the identification of multi-drug regimens. This study confirmed the minimum number of validation experiments needed to pinpoint the drugs that resulted in maximum efficacy and safety, which will play a key role in accelerating the selection of drug candidates for N-of-1 therapy (1900122). The impact of these and other approaches was discussed in detail in a recent report that described the use of AI to design powerful combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Importantly, non-obvious combinations were shown to outperform the standard-of-care combinations. Furthermore, AI was successfully used to re-optimize the drug dosing required to eliminate TB infection in preclinical models. Of note, these studies markedly reduced the number of preclinical experiments needed to realize these substantially improved outcomes (1900086). To demonstrate the role of AI in boosting outcomes at the point-of-care, AI-based analysis in rats with colorectal cancer showed that drug interactions in a 4-drug combination were dynamic, varying between synergy and antagonism over time. Even though the rats were genetically identical, their responses to drug treatment were highly varied from one another, and N-of-1 dosage guidance was needed in order to streamline the reduction of tumor burden across all subjects. Most importantly, Nof- 1 dosage guidance, which varied over time, was needed in order to mediate any apparent efficacy for most of the subjects. This means that efficacy can be achieved with drugs that do not appear to be efficacious when arbitrarily dosed. Furthermore, this study showed that the incidence of treatment response could be improved across all study subjects (1900127). Among the many disorders that will continue to increase in global incidence while presenting substantial challenges to the medical community, liver cancer, liver transplant, and fatty liver disease represent indications that can be addressed by AI (1900167). A recent report detailed the molecular alterations that can be used for regimen selection for disorders such as cholangiocarcinoma, the development of novel biomarkers for immunosuppression in transplantation, as well as AI-based approaches (e.g., neural networks, big/small data analytics) that can be used to prolong the optimal delivery of the selected therapies. On a global scale, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly increasing in incidence, and will be a major cause of liver cancer. Leveraging AI for drug selection and simultaneous consideration of the factors in the gut microbiota that can influence drug efficacy and safety will play a key role in realizing actionable and optimized treatment strategies for NAFLD. In addition to identifying the right drugs and doses that should be used for combination therapy, a prevalent challenge in clinical care includes the sequence of how these drugs are administered. In a recent study, an important step forward to address this barrier was demonstrated using an approach called Innovative Design and Active Learning (IDEAL). IDEAL is based on the use of permutation orthogonal arrays, which decreases the number of experiments needed to sufficiently assess 3-,4-, and 5-drug combinations (1900135). Of note, following the identification of the drug combinations that resulted in optimal cytotoxicity towards Raji lymphoma cells, it was shown that sequential drug treatment outperformed simultaneous drug treatment. However, simultaneous treatment resulted in prolonged efficacy compared to sequential delivery. This work represents an important advance to further improve the efficacy and clinical intervention guidelines of AI-identified drug regimens. With regards to the clinical/in-human validation of interventional AI, a recent study demonstrated the use of AI to markedly reduce the dosage of TDF, a drug that has been associated with substantial side effects including kidney failure in patients being treated for of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Specifically, patients were calibrated using a parabolic response surface (PRS)-based AI platform by being given varying doses of TDF while measuring corresponding viral load. Based on this approach, patient-specific PRS profiles successfully identified an average TDF dose reduction of ≈30%, which resulted in undetectable disease (1900114). Digital medicine can also be leveraged to bridge diagnostics and therapy to address gut health (1900125). In the domain of diagnostics, a recent report detailed how robotics in the gut could be harnessed for applications that include capsule-based endoscopy paired with neural network-based software for improved image recognition, capsule endoscopes for pH sensing to monitor reflux disease, and wireless capsules for gastrointestinal bleeding detection, among others. Emerging ingestible technologies are also being explored for sustained drug delivery, which can then be potentially further leveraged for improved adherence. In addition to therapy development, biomarker identification will play a key role in monitoring treatment outcomes. Recent work is exploring how deep learning-based AI platforms can be paired with approaches such as mass spectrometry and collectively leveraged to interrogate large parameter spaces to enhance the actionability of biomarker signatures. This and other studies will empower the entire spectrum of drug development and personalized medicine to ultimately improve outcomes for patients compared to traditional approaches (1900163). A key downstream milestone for these studies will include the demonstration that they can be validated towards eventual drug approvals with clear demonstrations in improved outcomes in the clinic, development pipeline, and healthcare systems compared to current models. Successfully bridging digital medicine with pharmaceutical innovation has been challenging and has faced limitations. The perception of the areas in which digital platforms can reduce the cost of drug innovation has thus far been limited. In addition to mediating improved therapeutic outcomes, these studies represent examples of how digital medicine should be leveraged to impact the economics of drug development and may eventually go on to impact the cost of everything from drug pricing through general healthcare, especially since these platforms can be implemented across the entire continuum of intervention. Modulating treatment using indices comprised of efficacy and safety, in some oncologic indications, already represents a practice-changing shift. Markedly accelerated drug combination validation, increased numbers of responders to treatment, reduced long-term complications, among other endpoints that have been observed through the aforementioned studies signal the potential for strong alignment between digital medicine and unprecedented capabilities in cost-effective optimized and personalized healthcare. Digital therapeutics (DTx) are evidence-based interventions delivered as software, aimed at preventing, managing or treating a condition, sometimes in combination with traditional drug-based approaches. This rapidly growing domain sits at the intersection of healthcare and technology. As an example, a recent study demonstrated the use of CURATE.AI, an indication-agnostic platform for digital therapeutics applications. In this study, dynamic modulation of training intensity on a multi-tasking software platform revealed major differences between study participants in areas such as performance improvement under high and low intensity training. These N-of-1 profiles may serve as a way to optimize the efficacy of digital therapy for a broad array of indications (Figure 1).5 The promise of digital therapy is already being explored in commercial settings and deployment in established healthcare systems. Evidation Health recently showed that data collected from commercially available wearable devices can be utilized to create indices of sleep quality, heart rate, and mobility that are significantly different in cohorts with chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis and type 2 diabetes,6 as compared to age/gender matched controls. In other studies, Evidation used data from wearable devices to quantify the burden on activities of daily living related to acute conditions that are often invisible to the healthcare system such as viral infections,7 and demonstrated significant associations between adherence to medications for chronic conditions and wearable device usage patterns.8 Evidation recently collaborated with Apple and Eli Lilly to assess the feasibility of using consumer-grade smart devices (e.g., tablets, smartphones, smartwatches and sleep monitors) to remotely and unobtrusively monitor cognitive impairment symptoms.9 Throughout the 12-week study period, Evidation collected a total of more than 16 TB of data. Machine learning models revealed that patterns of phone usage, keyboard interactions, and daily routinely behavior were most relevant in differentiating between elderly adults with (n = 31) and without (n = 82) a diagnosis of cognitive impairment, demonstrating the promise of using data collected from consumer-grade devices to unobtrusively measure cognitive impairment in everyday life. Digital platforms have also been deployed effectively in the field of mental health. According to the latest GBD study, depressive and anxiety disorders were the leading causes of disability amongst all mental disorders in the US. Both were amongst the top 10 causes of disability overall, with depression 5th and anxiety 7th in the GBD study. Despite these high numbers, less than half of the over 46 million adults with a mental health disorder were seen by a mental health service in 2017. Mental health conditions have been recently addressed using digital platforms for cognitive behavioral therapy, delivered via the internet (iCBT). A clinically-validated platform developed by SilverCloud Health is currently deployed across the UK National Health Service, Europe, USA and Canada and has successfully treated over 300000 patients.10 Unlike traditional modes of face-to-face therapy, these programs are digital and mobile-first, asynchronously delivered and have enabled 24/7 access beyond the allotted duration of face-to-face CBT therapy, which is usually only 8 weeks in duration. They also increase patient access by embedding seamlessly into existing health care system workflows and electronic medical record systems. A recent SilverCloud white paper reported a marked reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms across the range of acuity (Figure 2).11 This white paper also reported reduced patient visits to the emergency department for mental health issues by 5%.11 The enormous potential of this field has inspired a number of efforts and associated regulatory innovation to improve mental health and associated indications with software-driven solutions. Solutions developed by SilverCloud and others that deliver clinically validated outcomes at scale with technology (versus clinical labor), can potentially bring down the cost of care and impact healthcare economics in general. This will have “knock on” positive externalities on managing other conditions and comorbidities, thereby leading to better outcomes and lower overall costs of population health management. Other digital therapeutic applications include Pear Therapeutics (Substance Use Disorder), Akili Interactive (Pediatric Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, Adult Major Depressive Disorder,12 and Acceset (Digital Para-counseling for Mental Health). Digital delivery will effectively reduce the burden on health care systems and translate to changes at the individual, patient group, and societal level. That said, there are also current limitations to the universal deployment of DTx. For example, healthcare delivery systems are set up to receive reimbursement via traditional methods, even if costlier. If DTx is not well integrated into existing workflows and payment flows, the risk is that it sits out in the cold and may fail to get adoption. Digital medicine that is driven by big and small data AI platforms, many of which are highlighted in this editorial, is making the prospect of next generation N-of-1 medicine and truly personalized healthcare a reality for both drug and software-based intervention. These advances are forming a foundation for the potential prospect of digital-first and digital-only therapeutics complementing digitaldeveloped drugs as technology-optimized, first lines of treatment. The fruition of this vision will broadly impact patient compliance, treatment outcomes, and healthcare economics and policy to ultimately change way that technology is harnessed to develop, deliver, and pay for/cover optimized healthcare.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 60% of patients treated with low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐lowering drug treatments, with on‐target plasma cholesterol levels, are still suffering clinical acute ischemic events. Mechanisms, such as LDL aggregation, underlie extracellular and intracellular cholesterol accumulation in the vasculature. A peptide sequence (P3) of the low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐related protein 1 (LRP1) efficiently protects LDL from sphingomyelinase (SMase‐) and phospholipase A2 (PLA 2 )‐induced LDL aggregation. The aim is to design families of peptide derivatives from P3 with enhanced potency and proteolytic stability. New peptides are designed through in silico conformational sampling and ApoB‐100 molecular docking, and are tested in dual (biochemical‐cellular) screening assays. A total of 46 new peptides including linear, fragment, cyclic, and alanine scanning derivatives are generated through two consecutive optimization rounds. Structurally and functionally optimized peptides contain hotspot residues that are replaced by alanine. This strategy confers an increased capacity to form prone alpha‐helix conformations crucial for the electrostatic interaction with ApoB‐100. These new compounds are highly efficient at inhibiting LDL aggregation and human coronary vascular smooth muscle cell‐cholesteryl ester loading and should be studied in preclinical models of atherosclerosis.",

Current challenges with traditional cancer treatment strategies include but are not limited to lack of specific targeting, overt systemic toxicity and low efficacy. The use of nanomaterials show particular promise as candidates for cancer treatment due to their high surface to volume ratio and tuneable size, shape, and surface chemistry, which in combination, allow for improved tumor targeting and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. The scrutinization of the literature demonstrates the potential of nanosized carrier systems over traditional approaches (at the molecular level) for specific targeting of the tumors. Despite the great promise showing in preclinical studies, the number of nanomedicines reaching clinical testing is still very low. This review attempts to address this issue by using a weight of evidence approach to the different strategies for use of nanomedicines in combating cancer, as well as highlighting a number of areas that the field of nanomedicines is clearly lagging behind in, as compared to conventional drug discovery and development. It is hoped that the recommendations in this review will allow for better translation of nanomedicines reaching clinical trials.",

However, encapsulation leads to complex drug biodistribution and delivery making analysis of delivery efficacy challenging. As proxies, nanocarrier accumulation or total tumor drug uptake in the tumor are used to evaluate delivery. Yet, these measurements fail to assess delivery of active, released drug to the target, and thus it commonly remains unknown if drug-target occupancy has been achieved. Here, we develop an approach to evaluate the delivery of encapsulated drug to the target, where residual drug target vacancy is measured using a fluorescent drug analog. In vitro measurements reveal that burst release governs drug delivery independent of nanoparticle uptake, and highlight limitations of evaluating nanoencapsulated drug delivery in these models. In vivo, however, our approach captures successful nanoencapsulated delivery, finding that tumor stromal cells drive nanoparticle accumulation and mediate drug delivery to adjacent cancer cells. These results, and generalizable approach, provide a critical advance to evaluate delivery of encapsulated drug to the drug target - the central objective of nanotherapeutics.",

Quantitative in vivo imaging and ex vivo tissue analysis of 4T1 (TNBC) subcutaneous tumors in BALB/c mice reveal 19 ± 0.5% ( p &lt; 0.01) increase in delivery of miRNAs, and 48 ± 1.79% ( p &lt; 0.001) increase in delivery of TK‐p53‐NTR upon US treatment, which results to 48 ± 6.98% ( p &lt; 0.01) reduction in tumor growth as compared to contralateral tumors without US. This significantly increases the survival rate of animals as compared to pDNA control group. Similar treatment effects are observed in both TNBC and HCC tumor models. This novel combined therapeutic approach, entailing both miRNAs and suicide gene therapy has strong potential for future applications in cancer therapy.",

This strategy endows lymphoid tissues with the tolerogenic ability to induce an unresponsive state toward autoantigens. Lymphoid tissues, as the crossroads, play integral roles in initiating immune activation and immunoregulation. Enormous efforts have driven the exploration of targeting delivery of tolerogenic agents to lymphoid tissues to reverse autoimmune disorders. Herein, the development of various tolerogenic therapies for autoimmune diseases are reviewed, the mechanisms of action from various lymphoid tissues to appropriate cell types by different administration routes are highlighted, and examples of lymphoid tissue‐targeting strategies to improve tolerogenic therapy potency are discussed. First lymph nodes‐targeting strategies for tolerance induction after interstitial or intra‐lymph node (i.LN) injection are summarized, then liver and spleen‐mediated tolerance after intravenous administration are described, and finally oral tolerance‐based therapies are discussed. It is envisioned that tolerogenic therapy will emerge as a novel treatment for autoimmune diseases.",

It is aimed to investigate the anti‐glioma activity of the novel cell cycle‐stabilizing compound Argyrin F and its potential treatment‐induced vulnerabilities to exploit possibilities for novel rational combination therapies. Human and murine glioma cells are used, cytotoxicity and clonogenic survival assays, cell cycle analyses, and immunoblots are performed. Residual freshly resected tissue is used for a preclinical glioma model ex vivo, i.e., patient‐derived microtumors (PDMs) for co‐culture experiments with autologous tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Mass spectrometry‐based immunopeptidomics are performed and the orthotopic syngeneic SMA560/VM/Dk glioma mouse model is used. Argyrin F‐induced cell cycle arrest and reduced clonogenic survival is observed. Argyrin F‐treated experimental glioma in vivo displays 4.6‐fold more glioma‐infiltrating CD8 + T cells. A distinctive treatment‐induced immunopeptidome is discovered. The combination of Argyrin F plus PD‐1 antibody increases cellular toxicity in PDM/TILs co‐cultures ex vivo and prolonged overall survival compared with monotherapies in vivo. Thus, Argyrin F leads to anti‐glioma effects and increases the immunogenicity, paving the way for a novel combination therapy of Argyrin F plus PD‐1 blockade.",

However, the tumor hypoxia and premature release of drugs as well as off‐targeting of the established nanocarrier are still the major challenges. Herein, an ultrasound (US)‐triggered in situ hydrogel system is designed to overcome tumor hypoxia and combine PDT and CT (AIPH/PEGDA/DOX/CAT‐Ce6). After ultrasonic treatment, the 2,2′‐azobis[2‐(2‐imidazolin‐2‐yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPH) will decompose and release a large amount of alkyl radicals, which can activate the crosslink reaction of poly(ethylene glycol) double acrylate (PEGDA) through the amide bond to form the hydrogel structure. This system can achieve the long‐term immobilization of CAT‐Ce6 and doxorubicin (DOX) at tumor site. Owing to the long‐term retention of the hydrogel, the tumor hypoxia can be persistently relieved under the action of CAT and the effect of PDT can be greatly enhanced. Meanwhile, the sustained release of DOX from the hydrogel can achieve the long‐term chemotherapy. In vivo experiment demonstrates that the combination of repeatable PDT and sustained chemotherapy based on US‐triggered hydrogel system shows a synergistic effect in antitumor therapy without obvious side‐effect.",

However, the anticancer efficacy of ROS is generally suppressed by the reductive press in tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, lysozyme (LZM) modified black phosphorous (BP) /manganese dioxide nanosheets (LZM@BP/MnO 2 NSs, LBM) as an effective and biocompatible nanodrug platform for synergistic photodynamic‐/radio‐ therapy are prepared. The controllable preparation of negatively charged MnO 2 NSs is achieved through biomimetic mineralization strategy using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a template. To facilitate the loading of BP on MnO 2 , lysozyme is used to modify BP to obtain positively charged BP NSs. The as‐obtained LBM possess higher biostability and exhibit superior ROS generation efficiency to BP, owing to the alleviation of reductive species (i.e., GSH) in TME by the oxidation of MnO 2 . Moreover, LBM can be easily decomposed in the tumor sites, leading to the good biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo. The amplified intracellular ROS generation properties of LBM assisted combination of photodynamic therapy and radiotherapy ultimately boost the synergistic therapeutic efficacy against cancer.",

However, the diversity of the retinal output and the resolution obtained by optogenetic actuation of rBCs is unclear. Herein, the photostimulation of rBCs expressing channelrhodopsin‐2 is studied in a transgenic, photoreceptor‐degeneration mouse (rd10) while simultaneously recording the retinal output using a high‐density microelectrode array. After analyzing several hundred retinal output neurons, both optogenetic ON and OFF type responses are identified at similar ratio at stimulation thresholds well below photodamage intensity. The temporal latency of both response types is in the same range ( 50 ms) as reported for healthy mouse retinal ganglion cells. The spatial resolution ranges between 0.1 and 0.2 cycles deg ‐1 , which is close to that found in healthy mice. Photostimulation over an extended area (29 deg) but not localized stimuli induces strong bursting activity, which may originate from large‐scale activation of a coupled network of retinal cells. The distinct ON and OFF optogenetically induced activity patterns in retinal ganglion cells and the high temporal and spatial resolution demonstrate that near‐physiological vision restoration may be achieved under optimal conditions in late stage retinal degeneration.",

There is an urgent demand for novel drugs to treat IBD with better efficacy and fewer side effects. CXCR4/CXCL12 axis plays a constitutive and inflammatory role in the intestinal mucosa, resulting in the chemotaxis of plenty of inflammatory cells to the intestine. Modulating this chemotactic axis by CXCR4 modulators may lead to the discovery of more effective anti‐IBD candidates. Taking the secondary amine as the lead structure, a series of bisamide CXCR4 modulators with various substituents are designed, synthesized, and evaluated for the ameliorating effects on acute inflammation and IBD. Among them, compound Im effectively alleviates TNBS‐induced IBD and reduces the number of inflammatory cells and the secretion of inflammatory factors in the intestinal mucosa. The obtained results indicate that CXCR4 is a potential anti‐IBD target, and design of potent CXCR4 modulators is an optional strategy to discover novel anti‐IBD candidates with different mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Photothermal therapy (PTT) as an emerging antitumor approach has many advantages. However, when the PTT generates localized hyperthermia to induce cell apoptosis, excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokine release will threaten the peritumoral healthy tissues, thus it is challenging to develop efficient strategies to reduce the undesirable PTT‐mediated side effects. Herein, the authors report exploitation of hypoxia‐responsive degradation in designing a synergistic hydrogenothermal therapeutic nanosystem for ROS elimination and anti‐inflammatory action to enhance antitumor activity. The nanosystem (MA@NHC) is successfully constructed by encapsulating melanin‐nanoparticles (MNPs) and amine‐borane (AB) inside functionalized hyaluronic acid to obtain MA@NH, then capped with 4T1 cell‐membranes. Synergistic integration of the homotypic aggregation with EPR effect can improve the tumor‐targeting properties of MA@NHC. Upon specifically targeting tumor, sequentially time‐dependent MNPs and AB release can be triggered by hypoxia tumor‐microenvironment. Based on the superior NIR light‐absorption ability, widely permeated MNPs are activated for photoacoustic imaging‐guided PTT. Meanwhile, the high intra‐tumor acidity accelerates the production of H 2 via AB to scavenge excess ROS and reduce PTT‐induced inflammatory responses, which can be further sped up during PTT. Remarkably, as an antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory agent, the MNPs synergize with H 2 to protect peritumoral normal cells from damage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by progressive dopaminergic neuron loss, which affects millions of people worldwide, especially elderly individuals. Mitochondrial dysfunction is believed to be one crucial causative factor of PD. Therefore, restoring mitochondrial function is highly recommended for the treatment of PD. Herein, it is found that vitamin B 3 (VB 3 ) protects the dopaminergic cell line SH‐SY5Y against rotenone‐induced apoptosis by restoring mitochondrial dysfunction. To further improve the efficacy, a derivative of VB 3 , mitochondrial‐targeting VB 3 (Mito‐VB 3 ), is developed. It is demonstrated that Mito‐VB 3 rescues SH‐SY5Y cells from the neurotoxicity of oxidative stress. More importantly, Mito‐VB 3 ameliorates the phenotypes of the Drosophila PD model. Mechanistically, Mito‐VB 3 enhances nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) levels, reduces ROS generation, elevates ATP levels, and restores mitochondrial membrane potential. Meanwhile, Mito‐VB 3 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis by activating the NAD + /SIRT1/PGC1α pathway. In summary, the results demonstrate that Mito‐VB 3 displays remarkable neuroprotective effects in the cell and Drosophila PD models and that Mito‐VB 3 might serve as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of PD and other mitochondrial dysfunction‐related diseases.",

Conventional drug therapy and gene therapy may not optimally regulate the bone remodeling process due to the unitary pharmacological mechanism of drug and the safety and targeting of gene vectors. In the present study, multifunctional fluorescent alendronate‐polyethyleneimine carbon dots (Alen‐PEI CDs) are innovatively synthesized, which have excellent biocompatibility, selective bone targeting, gene carrying capacity, and anti‐bone absorption effect. As gene vectors, bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) gene‐loaded Alen‐PEI CDs greatly enhance osteoblast differentiation and bone regeneration. Notably, Alen‐PEI CDs are found to directly inhibit the formation and function of osteoclasts, effectively attenuating the LPS‐induced skull osteolysis in mice. Furthermore, their cumulative toxicity is lower than that of Alen, indicating their potential as an anti‐bone resorptive nanodrug. These results show that the bone‐targeting Alen‐PEI CDs significantly reverse the imbalance of bone homeostasis through a dual‐directional mechanism—directly suppressing bone resorption and indirectly inducing bone formation by transfection of osteogenic therapeutic genes. Overall, the study expands the application for carbon dots in biomedicine, providing new insights for the further development of novel selectively targeted multifunctional nanodrugs for the treatment of bone‐destructive diseases.",

This study aims to investigate the immunomodulatory effect (targeting‐triggering‐therapy) of 177 Lu‐DOTA‐EB‐cRGDfK ( 177 Lu‐DER) and to optimize the therapeutic efficacy by combining targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) and ICB. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence analysis, and RT‐qPCR are conducted to confirm the change of PD‐L1 expression. Tumor uptakes of 177 Lu‐DER in CT26 and MC38 colorectal tumor models are verified through single photon emission computed tomography imaging. Further, the radionuclide dose and the treatment schedule to optimize the therapeutic scheme are carefully titrated and the mechanism of the synergy between TRT and ICB is explored. The results demonstrate that PD‐L1 expression is upregulated after irradiation of 177 Lu. The combination of 9.25 MBq 177 Lu‐DER TRT with 200 µg αPD‐L1 immunotherapy significantly inhibits tumor growth and protects against tumor recurrence. It is also found that 4‐h interval is an effective time window between radioligand administration and ICB therapy. In conclusion, a promising scheme for tumor immunotherapy is realized based on the sequential administration of integrin α v β 3 ‐targeted radioligand and PD‐L1 immune checkpoint blocker, emphasizing the potential of combining radiotheranostics with ICB for precision cancer therapy.",

BiBian recognizes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on cancer cells and CD3 receptors on T cells; the two VHHs and dimerized scFv are structurally independent and positioned such that they are easily accessible to each target. BiBian adhered strongly to both cancer cells and T cells, promoted T cell activation (due to the bivalent CD3 modules), and induced dramatic cytotoxicity against tumor spheroids in vitro and in vivo.

The impact of superbugs on the older population, healthcare‐associated patients or patients with a compromised immune system is highly worrisome since no treatment options are available in some cases, especially for Gram‐negative pathogens. Efforts are currently devoted to develop novel chemical entities with new mechanisms of action that can inactivate unexplored or underexplored bacterial objectives and to better understand bacterial behavior. The present article highlights the therapeutic potential of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lipid A, which is the lipidic component of lipopolysaccharide—a lipid‐anchored complex carbohydrate and a well‐designed natural barrier to protect Gram‐negative bacteria from external agents, such as antibiotics. An overview of the state‐of‐the‐art inhibitors currently available along with the biochemical and structural knowledge of the enzyme/ligand complexes available is provided.

    "abstract": "Abstract Islet β cell failure is a critical metabolic disorder in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and the decreased viability and dysfunction of β cells accelerate diabetic pathogenesis in association with higher mortality. In this study, the therapeutic effects of chitooligosaccharide biguanide (COSG), which is similar in structure to metformin and has negligible side effects, on islet β‐cell dysfunction and the possible mechanism are explored. Streptozocin‐induced diabetic rats are administered COSG via daily intragastric gavage for 8 weeks. COSG significantly controlled body weight loss, attenuated glucose levels in blood and urine, and increased serum insulin. Histological examination of the pancreas reveals that COSG also alleviated pancreatic atrophy in T2DM rats. Furthermore, COSG stimulated insulin receptor substrate‐2 (IRS‐2) signaling in rat islet β cells, thereby mediating the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway. In addition, COSG promoted downstream forkhead transcription factor O1 (FoxO1) nuclear output to potentially activate pancreas duodenum homeobox‐1 (PDX‐1)/glucose transporter type‐2 (GLUT‐2)/glucose kinase (GCK) pathway‐regulated insulin secretion. COSG also inhibited the glycogen synthase kinase‐3β (GSK‐3β)/caspase‐3 pathway to prevent cell apoptosis. The intrinsic protective effects of COSG on the impaired insulin signaling system to delay β‐cell apoptosis, increase β‐cell growth and proliferation, improve β‐cell function and promote insulin secretion highlight the possibilities of COSG as a novel strategy for the prevention of T2DM.",

Recently, the development of long‐chain siRNA has been proposed as a strategy to improve in vivo stability, particularly for efficient physical integration of siRNA molecules into gene carriers. Herein, concatemeric siRNAs are enzymatically synthesized through a rolling circle transcription process, and form stable RNA interference (RNAi) nanocomplexes with a redox‐sensitive glycol chitosan derivative to systemically deliver the concatemeric siRNAs to tumor tissues. The enzymatically generated RNAi nanocomplexes (RNCs) have higher particle stability and less cytotoxicity than the conventional polyelectrolyte complexes. The therapeutic potential of the RNC formulation is verified in vivo as well as in vitro using VEGF as an antiangiogenic target for RNAi‐based anticancer therapy. After systemic administration, RNC is specifically accumulated in tumor tissues and shows a high inhibitory effect on tumor growth. According to the results, the RNC can be considered as a platform technology for efficient tumor‐targeted siRNA delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Systemic chemotherapy has not significantly reduced clinical demand for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatments. To address the need for more effective therapy, the use of nonviral nanoparticles is explored to deliver suicide gene therapy as valuable alternative to protect nucleic acids in the bloodstream and improve their tumor uptake. Biocompatible cationic lipid nanoparticles are developed as a novel delivery system of a suicide plasmid gene encoding saporin. Active targeting is accomplished by taking advantage of nanoparticle functionalization with U11 peptide, designed to be directed toward urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, limiting off‐target toxicity. The antitumor effect of U11‐lipid‐protamine‐DNA (U11‐LPD) nanoparticles are tested in TBNC cells, showing a strong prevalence of targeted versus nontargeted nanoparticles in terms of uptake kinetics and proliferation inhibition. Transfection of green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid in MDA‐MB‐231 cells is demonstrated. U11‐LPD nanoparticles administered by retro bulbar injection exhibit excellent tumor tropism in TNBC orthotopic xenograft mice and effectively transfect TNBC cells with saporin plasmid resulting in tumor mass reduction. No systemic toxicity or organ damage is discovered after repeated treatments with nanoparticles. The findings suggest that systemic administration of targeted LPD nanoparticles to deliver saporin safely allows for active inhibition of cancer progression even in the absence of specific promoter gene sequences.",

The selective autophagy pathway contributes to the target recognition and degradation of intracellular components or foreign pathogens for maintaining cellular homeostasis in multiple organisms. Notably, this process is mediated by autophagy receptors in the recognition of autophagy cargoes through binding to the ubiquitin‐binding domain and LC3‐interacting region to the formation of autophagosomes. Nanotechnology is an emerging field; related research has focused on the study and manipulation of nanoscale materials that can be applied for numerous applications, especially for the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Nanoparticle‐mediated autophagy activation holds promise for use in autophagy‐related disease applications. The selective autophagy of nanoparticles and nanodrugs occurs through binding to ubiquitinated proteins, autophagy receptors, and LC3, the formation of nanoparticulosomes, and their delivery to lysosomes; the process is termed nanoparticulophagy. This review focuses on the mechanisms of nanoparticulophagy, the role of selective autophagy receptors, and potential applications in autophagy‐related diseases achieved using these nanoparticles and nanodrugs. Nanoparticulophagy will provide an understanding of related intracellular trafficking mechanisms and degradation pathways for processing nanoparticles and nanodrugs in terms of drug delivery and pathophysiological effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for the majority of breast cancer‐related deaths and remains the hardest breast cancer to treat due to the lack of specific therapeutic targets. While chemotherapy is the mainstay of systemic treatment for TNBC, it is associated with chemotherapy‐induced cancer stem cells (CSCs) and tumor regeneration. Here, it is found that Wnt and YAP target genes that have been closely associated with CSCs are highly expressed in TNBC patient tumors and negatively correlated with patient survival. Therefore, a nanotherapeutic strategy is employed, using nanomaterials that are approved by the FDA, and two co‐delivery nanoparticle platforms (NPs) are developed to target TNBC. These NPs contain Wnt inhibitor PRI‐724 (in clinical trials) and YAP/mevalonate inhibitor simvastatin (FDA‐approved). Toward clinical translation, nanotherapeutic efficacy is assessed in clinically relevant patient‐derived xenograft (PDX) models. These NPs in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel effectively halt the growth of both paclitaxel‐resistant and paclitaxel‐sensitive PDX tumors, and diminish the paclitaxel‐induced CSC enrichment around two to fourfold. Importantly, NPs also decrease the paclitaxel‐enhanced PDX tumorigenesis after secondary transplantation. Together, this study demonstrates the efficacy of two NP platforms using clinically translatable TNBC PDX models, suggesting their application potential for the treatment of TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of fibrous hydrogel constructs is a promising strategy in tissue engineering because of their ability to closely mimic the anisotropic structure of biological tissues. In skeletal muscle tissue engineering, fiber alignment is considered a crucial factor for achieving muscle functions originating from the uniaxially aligned structure of myofibers; however, the fabrication process of hydrogel constructs with aligned fibers requires complex and laborious techniques. In this study, the effect of 3D‐printed constructs with randomly oriented fibers on myoblast differentiation is evaluated. To this end, 3D‐printable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel microfibers through the mechanical fragmentation of electrospun GelMA sheets is prepared. The bulk rheological and tensile properties of the hydrogels with microfibers are stronger than those of the hydrogels without microfibers. Interestingly, when myoblast‐embedded constructs are 3D‐printed with and without randomly oriented GelMA hydrogel microfibers and incubated for cell differentiation, the microfibers in the constructs effectively promote myotubule‐like cell formation. In addition, the uniaxial 3D printed design enables anisotropic myotubule formation. This shows that hydrogels with only fibers distributed randomly can be applied to achieve more effective artificial muscle constructs than those achieved using normal bulk hydrogels and are easier to use than aligned fibers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) represent a heterogenous disease with high patient mortality relative to other breast cancers. Doxorubicin (Dox), a DNA intercalating drug, is widely used as chemotherapy for TNBC. However, it often accompanies severe side effects that limit the effective therapeutic dose. It is hypothesized that the combination of Dox with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat (Pan), may improve therapeutic efficacy by attacking rapid cell proliferation and abnormal histone deacetylation. Herein, pH‐responsive, lipid targeting nanoemulsions (pLNEs) are designed to direct both Dox and Pan to TNBC cells that overexpress lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor 1 (LPAR 1 ) via the ratio of LPA to lysophosphatidylcholine and trigger Dox release via disassociation from docosahexanoic acid. Dox/Pan‐pLNEs result in higher intranuclear Dox compared to free Dox, free Dox/Pan, and Dox‐pLNEs. Tumors treated with Dox/Pan‐pLNEs exhibit 2.4‐fold reduction in tumor burden relative to free Dox alone. Molecular analysis reveals that MDA‐MB‐231 tumor growth inhibition is mediated by re‐expression of thioredoxin‐interacting protein and suppression of cytoplasmic p27 kip1 and c‐Jun activation domain‐binding protein‐1. This lipid targeting, Dox/Pan encapsulating pLNE represents a platform for treating TNBC with greater therapeutic efficacy.",

However, the low therapeutic efficacy presents a major obstacle to its mass adoption. The Authors proposed to increase the therapeutic efficacy of MTT through the manipulation of magnetothermal‐related gene expression. ID4, a member of inhibitors of differentiation (ID) protein family, is identified to be downregulated in intracellular MTT (in‐MTT)‐treated MCF‐7 breast cancer cells according to the whole transcriptome sequencing. Interestingly, this occurrence is not observed in the exogenous MTT‐treated cells. More importantly, ID4‐silenced tumor cells show significantly decreased cell viability after in‐MTT, whereas ID4‐overexpressed cells exhibit more resistance to the MTT. This effect is also observed in other malignant breast cells derived from the human mammary gland. Furthermore, ID4 siRNA‐loaded superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are developed and delivered them to breast cancer xenografted nude mice. It is found that the synergistic combination of ID4 gene silencing and in‐MTT greatly inhibited the tumor growth and the efficacy of tumor volume inhibition is &gt; 98%.

These small molecule inhibitors potentially allow for companion imaging probe development, thereby expanding the chemical biology toolkit to investigate mutant KRAS biology. Herein, we synthesized and tested a series of fluorescent companion imaging drugs (CID) for KRAS G12C, using two scaffolds, ARS-1323 and AMG-510. We created four fluorescent derivatives of each by attaching BODIPY dyes. We found that two fluorescent derivatives (BODIPY FL and BODIPY TMR) of ARS-1323 bind mutant KRAS and can be used for biochemical binding screens. Unfortunately, these drugs could not be used as direct imaging agents in cells, likely because of non-specific membrane labeling. To circumvent this challenge, we then used a two step procedure in cancer cells where an ARS-1323 alkyne is used for target binding followed by fluorescence imaging after in situ click chemsitry with picolyl azide Alexa Fluor 647. We show that this approach can be used to image mutant KRAS G12C directly in cells. Given the current lack of mutant KRAS G12C specific antibodies, these reagents could be useful for specific fluorescence imaging.",

However, these therapies face challenges associated with patient compliance and toxicology.

In the present work, engineered and monodisperse dual‐compartment microdevices are developed to achieve a physical separation of two drugs followed by a sequential release in the gastrointestinal tract. As proof‐of‐concept, the compartments are sealed with two pH‐sensitive polymers of different thicknesses to control the sequential release of propranolol and furosemide. In vitro release studies and in vivo absorption studies in rats confirm a sequential drug release from the two compartments. Unlike other proposed approaches, it is highly advantageous that the drugs can be loaded directly as powders, and that their release can be tuned via optimized coatings to achieve the desired release and absorption profiles. Conclusively, this study lays a strong foundation for the future use of microdevices to enable co‐delivery of drugs followed by a sequential release in close proximity in the gastrointestinal tract.",

Transplantation of stem cells is a promising therapeutic approach for SCI but faces with the difficulty of long‐term tracking of stem cells in vivo precisely.

The fluorescence signal of the UC‐MSCs can be monitored for up to 28 days, reflecting the viability, colonization, and function of the transplanted UC‐MSCs. The transplantation of UC‐MSCs can secrete nerve growth factors and maintain the viability of cells in the highly reactive oxygen species microenvironment, leading to effective recovery of injured spinal cord, which is further confirmed by the behavioral rehabilitation and histopathological results. These findings demonstrate that long‐term tracking of UC‐MSCs labeled with AIE‐Tat NPs is a promising method to monitor stem cell transplantation therapy for SCI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, have inherent homing ability in damage repair and drug delivery. However, they have poor targeting and low enrichment efficiency and are easily internalized/cleared by monocyte phagocyte system. If the targeting ability of exosomes can be improved through a series of means, better use can be made of the advantages of exosome therapy and drug delivery. It is necessary to ensure a certain retention rate to study signal pathways and potential mechanisms, especially in flowing blood. This article mainly reviews the research progress of specific targeting based on exosomes, including intrinsic targeting, enhanced targeting, and drug delivery. Inherent targeting is mainly analyzed from different cell sources, and enhanced targeting is mainly from ligand modification and the application of nano materials to improve the targeting ability. To be successfully applied in clinical practice, many problems and challenges still need to be faced in exosome therapy. Herein, the latest knowledge of using EVs as a natural delivery system for disease treatment is summarized.",

Such combined therapies only have merit provided that there is superior therapeutic outcome with fewer side effects, compared to single therapies. Here, this work explores the possibility to combine chemotherapy with radionuclide therapy using polymeric micelles as a delivery vehicle. For this purpose, this work prepares poly(ε‐caprolactone‐b‐ethylene oxide) (PCL‐PEO) micelles and load them simultaneously with paclitaxel (PTX) and 177 Lu(III). This work chooses a 3D tumor spheroid composed of glioblastoma cells (U87) to evaluate the combined treatment. The diffusion of the micelles in the spheroid is investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and light‐sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM). The results show that the micelles are able to penetrate deep into the spheroid within 24 h of incubation and mainly accumulated around or in the lysosomes once in the cell. Subsequently, this work evaluates the cell killing efficiency of the single treatments (PTX or 177 Lu(III)) versus combined treatment (PTX + 177 Lu(III)) by measuring the growth of the spheroids as well as by performing a cell‐viability assay. The results indicate that the combined therapy achieves a superior therapeutic outcome with better cell growth inhibition and cell killing efficiency compared to the single treatments.",

Finally, the perspectives for future clinical and translational theranostic research of ESCC are discussed and the obstacles that must be overcome in ESCC theranostics are described.",

To elucidate the molecular mechanism related to the mitochondrial metabolic dynamics and drug resistance in glioblastoma (GBM), a longitudinal GBM orthotopic mouse model with acquired resistance to bevacizumab is established. The longitudinal proteomic analysis results show that OXPHOS, TCA, and calcium signaling gene sets are enriched in the bevacizumab pre‐resistance phase for preparing resistance phase. Then, the APEX system to GBM to biotinylate and purify proteins of the mitochondria matrix is applied. The organelle specific proteomic analysis shows that the pore‐forming subunits of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter protein (MCU) are essential for acquiring bevacizumab resistance. Additionally, a combination effect of hypoxia and the MCU‐specific inhibitor DS16570511 in vitro shows that cell growth and proliferation are reduced via inhibition of NF‐κB and CEBP/β signaling pathways. In conclusion, the hypoxic tumor microenvironment induced by bevacizumab treatment affects mitochondrial metabolic dynamics, and targeting MCU is a promising therapeutic option in combination with bevacizumab in recurrent GBM.",

This review aims to highlight the advances in HIDS for allergic rhinitis treatment. The designs and therapeutic effect of the existing HIDS in the nasal microenvironment are described in detail. This review also provides a perspective on the future opportunities and developments of HIDS.

    "abstract": "Abstract The evolutionarily conserved YAP/TAZ mechanoresponsive transcription cofactors regulate development and tumorigenesis. Here, it is shown for the first time that human natural killer (NK) cells specifically express TAZ but not YAP, and TAZ serves to limit NK cytotoxicity. The synthetic double‐stranded RNA, hiltonol, is able to trigger cytoplasmic compartmentalization of TAZ, which increases NK cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, a low dose of hiltonol enhances the actin‐based intracellular contractility of NK cells accompanied by an increase in active RhoA and myosin light chain phosphorylation, conceivably through an increase in ERK1/2 activation‐dependent ROS production. Importantly, it is showed that the dissociation of LATS1 from actin upon activation of contractility is associated with TAZ cytoplasmic localization. Functionally, hiltonol also reduces the NK cell surface inhibitory receptors, e.g., KIR3DL1, through c‐Myc inhibition. Direct inhibition of c‐Myc promotes NK cytotoxicity against K562 lymphoblast. The findings are corroborated by coculturing hiltonol‐pretreated NK cells with breast and lung cancer cells, and increased NK‐mediated cancer killing is demonstrated, which conceivably occurs via compartmentalization of TAZ to the cytoplasm which facilitates NK cytotoxicity. The findings pave the way for ex vivo rejuvenation of NK cells for in vivo immunotherapies, which can involve a cocktail of low dose hiltonol and c‐Myc inhibitor.",

In order to reduce the risk of PD in young people, Rb 3 is selected as an active ingredient and assembled into Rb 3 nanoparticles (Rb 3 NPs)encapsulated microbubbles (MBs), shorted for Rb 3 NPs@MBs. This study uses focused ultrasound‐mediated Rb 3 NPs@MBs to cross the blood–brain barrier and reach the brain lesions to be intervened in in order to explore the prevention of 1‐methyl‐4‐phenyl‐4‐piperidinpropionate ester (MPTP)‐induced PD by Rb 3 NPs@MBs and its related mechanisms. In the present study, Rb 3 NPs@MBs prevent MPTP‐induced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐positive cell decreases, decrease TH expression, increase Park2 expression, and decrease expression of α‐synaptonucleoprotein in the pars compactus nigra (SNc). It is found, in vitro study, that Rb 3 NPs treatment significantly reverses MPTP‐induced apoptosis and death of PC12/SY5Y cells, which is commonly used mouse/ human neural cell lines. It is also found that Rb 3 NPs@MBs can prevent the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SNc. Finally, it is found that DJ‐1 expression decreases after Rb 3 NPs@MBs are introduced. Results suggest that the neuroprotective activity of Rb 3 NPs@MBs may be achieved by increasing the expression of DJ‐1 and decreasing the production of ROS. Taken together, these data reveal that Rb 3 NPs@MBs play an important role in preventing memory deficiency in PD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Protein drugs contained within pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) show immense potential for fundamental research and industrial applications, owing to their high bioavailability, convenient administration, and cost‐effectiveness. To deliver protein drugs efficiently, researchers have reached a consensus on the use of carrier particles. However, the main obstacle impeding the commercial availability of pMDI carrier particles is their low stability. This instability is primarily attributed to particle aggregation caused by the Ostwald ripening phenomenon and chemical degradation by water sensitivity of protein drugs. This study proposes the utilization of lecithin, a carrier material possessing an amphiphilic structure, to overcome this bottleneck. By constructing lecithin‐based reverse micelle systems with protein drugs encapsulated within the high‐polarity microdomain, this work anticipates an improvement in the stability of carrier particles within pMDIs. Specifically, the formation of crystalline phases in the reverse micelle systems can control carrier particle size through crystalline self‐limiting effect, preventing particle aggregation. Additionally, the low‐polarity microdomain of the carrier serves as a hydrophobic barrier, shielding protein drugs from water and preventing chemical degradation. Consequently, this work believes that the lecithin‐based reverse micelle system holds significant potential in providing new theoretical insights and experimental support for the advancement of pMDIs containing protein drugs.",

Tamoxifen (TMX), an estrogen receptor modulator that is clinically used for the treatment of breast cancer, is shown to reprogram the tumor microenvironment (TME) and to alleviate desmoplasia. It is investigated if TMX, administered in free and nano‐formulated form, can be repurposed as a TME remodeling agent to improve tumor accumulation of nano‐formulations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and triple‐negative breast cancer mouse models, evaluated using clinical‐stage Cy7‐labeled core‐crosslinked polymeric micelles (CCPM). Under control conditions, higher levels of Cy7‐CCPM are found in PANC‐1 tumors (16.7% ID g −1 at 48 h post i.v. injection) than in 4T1 tumors (11.0% ID g −1 ). In both models, free and nano‐formulated TMX failed to improve CCPM delivery. These findings are congruent with the results from histopathological immunofluorescence analysis of tumor tissue, which indicate that TMX treatment does not significantly change vascularization, perfusion, macrophage infiltration, collagen density, and collagen fiber thickness. Altogether, these results demonstrate that in PANC‐1 and 4T1 mouse models, TMX treatment does not contribute to beneficial TME priming and enhanced tumor‐targeted drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "Brain cancers, particularly malignant gliomas such as glioblastoma, are highly invasive and characterized by elevated complexity, heterogeneity, and high infiltration ability. Therefore, they pose a significant challenge to conventional treatments due to the limited drug permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), the involvement of numerous acquired and intrinsic drug resistance mechanisms in metastatic brain tumors, and the high sensitivity of surrounding healthy tissues. Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, their prognosis remains poor, with their median overall survival rarely exceeding 12 months. To overcome these limitations, different nanomedicine-based therapeutic approaches have recently been proposed, aiming to provide more effective and safer drug delivery for targeting brain cancers. However, most reported nanomedicines to date have failed to meet the high expectations in the clinic. This fact can be attributed to limited understanding of brain tumor biology and lack of knowledge about bio-nanoparticle interactions, among other factors. This review discusses recent progress in brain cancer nanomedicines, with a particular focus in understanding intracellular sorting mechanisms, perivascular tumor growth, and the design of advanced BBB models. It also highlights how an improved understanding of brain tumor biology can pave the way for designing safer and more effective nanomedicines for brain cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The growing societal concern regarding skin aging caused by ultraviolet (UV) exposure has spurred the quest for effective therapeutic solutions. Among these, secreted factors derived from adipose‐derived stem cells (ADSC) have emerged as promising candidates with anti‐photoaging properties. The secretome of ADSC stimulates resident fibroblasts, triggering antioxidant effects and promoting the synthesis of the extracellular matrix, thus counteracting the effects of photoaging. In this study, the potential of dried ADSC secretome (AD‐Sc), obtained through a compressed fluid antisolvent process, is assessed as an anti‐photoaging agent. In addition, liposome nanocarriers are used to encapsulate AD‐Sc (Sc_Lipo) to enhance its delivery efficiency. The findings demonstrate that both AD‐Sc and Sc_Lipo effectively reduce reactive oxygen species levels in UV‐damaged human fibroblasts, upregulate the expression of HAS1 and COL1, and inhibit MMP2. Moreover, it is discovered that reverse electrodialysis (RED)‐driven iontophoresis improves the intradermal delivery of Sc_Lipo, as validated in an ex vivo porcine skin. Finally, in an in vivo UV‐induced wrinkling mice model, the Lipo+RED group shows noticeable skin photoaging improvements. This study provides additional evidence that a combined intradermal delivery system for AD‐Sc may represent a viable therapeutic approach for mitigating and preventing photoaging in clinical settings.",

Although passive and active targeting strategies have been reported for effectively enhanced bioimaging or drug delivery performance, researchers are still looking for emerging methods for better targeting, accumulation, and penetration of solid tumors. The strategy for constructing supramolecular self‐assemblies in biologically relevant conditions may partially overcome these challenges. Regarding the biomedical applications, supramolecular entities with naturally dynamic and modular properties, are capable of constructing structurally and functionally diversified materials and meeting the requirements of biological complexity. Modules and integrated systems enable response to bio‐environment by the modification of their constitution through component exchange or reorganization.

The authors focus on chemical structures, stimuli‐responsive bonds, and self‐assembly property of nanomaterials, which may offer a guide for the optimal design of self‐assembled nanomaterials in clinical cancer treatment and imaging.",

This study examines whether the addition of mineral‐coated microparticles (MPs) to a solution of IL‐1Ra extends its ability to inhibit IL‐1β activity when administered as a subcutaneous injection. MPs efficiently bind proteins in solution and provide sustained protein delivery. In vitro assays demonstrate that IL‐1Ra released from MPs is biologically active and inhibits IL‐1β activity. When MPs are added to an IL‐1Ra solution and injected subcutaneously into a murine model, serum IL‐1Ra is elevated for a longer duration compared to the treatment with the IL‐1Ra solution alone. Further, the addition of MPs to the IL‐1Ra solution results in the inhibition of IL‐1β activity for 7 days. A novel MP formulation that layered IL‐1Ra throughout the coating extends inhibition of IL‐1β activity in vivo for at least 14 days, suggesting potential for long‐term IL‐1β inhibition. Overall addition of MPs to an IL‐1Ra solution injected subcutaneously prolongs the duration of elevated serum concentration of IL‐1Ra and extends its ability to inhibit IL‐1β activity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transcatheter intra‐arterial therapy (TIT) has become valuable in the battle against primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. However, the lack of a mechanism to visualize real‐time drug release and avoid fast metabolic clearance of chemotherapeutic agents is the primary barrier to TIT for hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, a specific near‐infrared (NIR) fluorescent prodrug platform, that is, DSPE‐mPEG/DCM‐S‐Pt micelles (DCM‐S‐Pt@PEG), to assist TIT in direct administration to large mammals like rabbits, is presented. DCM‐S‐Pt@PEG consists of a NIR fluorophore for tracing drug release, a nonspecific antitumor drug cisplatin for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment, a glutathione‐activatable disulfide linker, and a DSPE‐mPEG nano‐micelle carrier for controllable drug release. DCM‐S‐Pt@PEG can make the drug accumulation in tumor tissues enhance the therapeutic effect by: i) specific delivery of prodrug to hepatic tumor tissues through the femoral artery by TIT, ii) sustained drug‐release from the biodegradable lipid DSPE‐mPEG micelle to minimize metabolic clearance, and iii) cancer biomarker–activated drug release. It provides a promising strategy to assist TIT in treating unresectable devastating hepatocellular carcinoma administration in the rabbit model, rather than common mouse model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Gold quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a distinct approach for cancer theranostics by using labeled and functionalized chemotherapeutic‐drug to realize its detection and chemotherapeutic functions. However, the toxicity induced by chemical‐based synthesis, their nonspecific accumulation in healthy tissues and organs hamper its translation to clinical applications. QDs are functionalized/labeled to reduce their toxicity and helps the QDs' cellular‐uptake. In addition, labeling increases the overall hydrodynamic size of QDs, which limits the dispersion, impedes efficient renal clearance and causes the accumulation of QDs in organs. Therefore, the unique properties that arise from quantum‐size (less than 5nm) are lost. Reports on the effect of real quantum‐size on cell‐interaction are, to date, limited. In this work, the concept of a small‐sized self‐functionalized pristine bright quantum gold probe (BQGP) for cancer‐theranostics. To the best of authors' knowledge, it is the first time cell‐interaction of BQGPs has been investigated and the results suggest that it can be used for label‐free/drug‐free cancer quantum‐theranostics. The pristine BQGPs demonstrate cancer‐selective cell‐uptake, enabling dosage‐dependent fluorescent detection/differentiation of cancerous‐cells and cancer‐selective cytotoxicity. The fabricated BQGPs demonstrate fluorophore‐free illuminance at a broad‐range of excitation wavelengths and drug‐free cancer‐specific treatment. Moreover, the drug‐free BQGPs may find advantages in fighting drug‐resistant cancers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Arsenic sulfide (As 4 S 4 ) is a mineral drug that can be administrated orally and has been applied in several Chinese medicine formulations for the treatment on some kinds of myeloid leukemia. However, mechanisms of As 4 S 4 are not demonstrated adequately due to the poor water solubility of As 4 S 4 in its original crystal form. The authors previously fabricated water dissolvable arsenic sulfide nanoformulation (ee‐As 4 S 4 ), which downregulated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). As ROS is closely associated with the histone deacetylase (HDAC), in this study the effect of ee‐As 4 S 4 on the HDAC activity in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells and whether the effect can induce subsequent megakaryocytic differentiation and underlying mechanisms are investigated. Results show that ee‐As 4 S 4 inhibits HDAC activity in CML cells, resulting in the suppression of cellular respiration. The inhibition of HDAC activity also leads to the transcriptional activation of RUNX1 , which induces megakaryocytic differentiation in CML cell lines, evidenced by the significantly multiple nuclei and giant nuclear structure, upregulation of CD41a and the increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2. In conclusion, ee‐As 4 S 4 is able to inhibit HDAC activity, and therefore induce significant megakaryocytic differentiation in CML cells through RUNX1 ‐dependent pathways, which suggests its clinical potential as a complementary drug option for CML patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The plasma membrane barrier greatly restricts intracellular delivery of macromolecules. Currently available methods suffer from various limitations, including low delivery efficiency, high cytotoxicity, or incompatibility with a wider range of macromolecules or cell types. To overcome these issues, stimuli‐responsive polymers such as the bio‐inspired, pH‐responsive poly( l ‐lysine isophthalamide) grafted with l ‐phenylalanine at a stoichiometric ratio of 50% (PP50) can be used. In mildly acidic environments, the pseudopeptidic polymer can permeabilize the plasma membrane overcoming the problem of payload entrapment in the endosomes and allowing for efficient intracellular delivery. It is demonstrated that PP50 is capable of intracellular delivery by simple co‐incubation at pH 6.5 with various macromolecules, including different‐sized Dextrans, green fluorescent protein (GFP), and an apoptotic peptide. The delivery process is fast, nontoxic, and compatible with multiple cell types, including adherent and suspension cell lines, primary human mesenchymal stem cells, and cells grown as spheroids. In addition, apoptotic peptide delivery by co‐incubation with PP50 is over three times more effective than delivery using other common methods, including poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), and electroporation. The findings suggest that payload delivery by co‐incubation with PP50 is a flexible, controllable method allowing delivery of various payloads to many different cell types in vitro.",

However, many in vitro studies performed on 2D cultures lack the realistic dimension of in vivo systems. In this work, a photosensitizer, acridine orange (AO), used in photodynamic therapy of cancer, is nanoformulated by entrapment in thermophilic ferritin. The efficacy is tested on 2D and 3D in vitro models and complemented with studies on the cellular uptake routes. Ferritin from the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AfFtn) exhibits the unique property of divalent metal ion or ionic strength mediated assembly, making it an interesting nanocarrier for the entrapment of small molecules. The photosensitization and toxicity studies on 2D monolayers and 3D spheroid models of colorectal cancer cells show that AO loaded in AfFtn is functional. The killing efficiency in 2D monolayers reaches 50% while the growth of 3D spheroids is arrested after the first day with a subsequent 10% reduction of tumor diameter over the next 2 days. Results show that AO loaded AfFtn has better penetration ability than free AO alone in 3D spheroid models indicating that nanocage formulation provides for an efficient delivery vehicle into the tumor tissue.",

Herein, a disulfide bond on–off–on triplet regulation strategy is developed to endow transferrin nanoparticles with high up to 18.1% drug‐loading efficiency. Such transferrin nanoparticles of around 70 nm, specifically, DOX@Tf m NPs, are synthesized via self‐assembly of modified transferrin with hydrophobic doxorubicin (DOX), displaying glutathione (GSH)‐responsive DOX release behavior in the tumor microenvironment. These DOX@Tf m NPs maintain the naturally targeted activity of transferrin, which can effectively cross the BBB and target the transferrin receptor overexpressed on the surface of glioma cells for precise chemotherapy of orthotopic glioma. In vivo results confirm that DOX@Tf m NPs can effectively target orthotopic glioma in living mice, achieving enhanced efficiency in inhibiting tumor growth and increasing survival rate without obvious side effects being observed. This study presents a new avenue to develop natural protein materials as promising smart drug delivery systems for clinical transformation.",

Despite the current advantages provided by nanomedicine in PCa treatment, there exists the opportunity to improve the design of novel therapeutic approaches. Therefore, this review also highlights the importance of identifying novel functional biomarkers to stratify patients and guide nanomedicinal design.

Nanomedicine approaches represent a major focus for improving chemotherapy, but have met limited success. To overcome the limitations of chemotherapy drugs, a novel single protein encapsulation (SPE)‐based drug formulation and delivery platform is developed and its utility in improving doxorubicin (DOX) treatment is tested. Using this methodology, a series of SPEDOX complexes are generated by encapsulating various numbers of DOX molecules into a single human serum albumin (HSA) molecule. UV/fluorescence spectroscopy, membrane dialysis, and dynamic light scattering techniques show that SPEDOXs are stable and uniform as monomeric HSA and display unique properties distinct from those of DOX and DOX‐HSA mixture. Furthermore, detailed procedures to precisely monitor and control both DOX payload and binding strength to HSA are established. Breast cancer xenograft tumor studies reveal that SPEDOX‐6 treatment displays improved pharmacokinetic profiles, higher antitumor efficacy, and lower DOX accumulation in the heart tissue compared with unformulated DOX. This SPE technology, which does not involve nanoparticle assembly and modifications to either small‐molecule drugs or HSA, may open up a new avenue for developing new drug delivery systems to improve anticancer therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy is a consequence of incomplete tumor resection. Systemic chemotherapy after surgery is associated with significant toxicity. Improved delivery methods for toxic drugs capable of targeting positive resection margins can reduce tumor recurrence and avoid their known toxicity. This study evaluates the effectiveness and toxicity of docetaxel (DTX) release from highly porous biodegradable microparticles intended for delivery into the tissue cavity created during radical prostatectomy to target residual tumor cells. The microparticles, composed of poly( dl ‐lactide‐ co ‐glycolide) (PLGA), are processed using thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) and loaded with DTX via antisolvent precipitation. Sustained drug release and effective toxicity in vitro are observed against PC3 human prostate cells. Peritumoral injection in a PC3 xenograft tumor model results in tumor growth inhibition equivalent to that achieved with intravenous delivery of DTX. Unlike intravenous delivery of DTX, implantation of DTX‐TIPS microparticles is not accompanied by toxicity or elevated systemic levels of DTX in organ tissues or plasma. DTX‐TIPS microparticles provide localized and sustained release of nontoxic therapeutic amounts of DTX. This may offer novel therapeutic strategies for improving management of patients with clinically localized high‐risk disease requiring radical prostatectomy and other solid cancers at high risk of positive resection margins.",

    "abstract": "This special issue is dedicated, but not limited to, the “1st International Northern-Southern Europe Workshop in Nanomedicine” held in the city of Chieti (Abruzzi, Italy) between January 15–17, 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The workshop aimed to bring together a vast number of experts with extensive experience in the field of nanomedicine from the northern and southern parts of Europe, but also worldwide to discuss and network on how to foster basic science in translational and personalized nanomedicine for drug delivery applications, including anti-cancer research, regenerative medicine, cardiovascular diseases, polymer and supramolecular chemistry towards reliable pre-clinical and clinical assessment. The final goal of the workshop was to highlight the impact of nanomedicine in pharmaceutical companies and how to create bridges and connections between companies, academia, young and senior scientists. Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology in different fields of bio- and nano-technology, as well as drug delivery and involves areas related to applications, toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials.[1, 2] Nanomaterials have sizes and structure similar to that of bio- and macro-molecules and their functionalization provides specific properties for tailoring precision medicine and application for many diseases, thus providing different therapeutic options for patients.[3] In particular, nanomedicine integrates different research areas, such as biology, physics, chemistry, materials sciences, nanotechnology and drug delivery in order to develop clinical tools and devices for advanced therapies to patients.[4, 5] In this scenario, nanosystems, having different compositions, combined with nanomaterial properties may foster the translation of basic science in personalized nanomedicines for anti-cancer research, regenerative medicine, cardiovascular diseases, polymer and supramolecular chemistry towards a reliable pre-clinical and clinical assessment.[6-9] Although transparency and reproducibility in nanomedicines is still under discussion,[10] there has been an extensive increase in the benefits of nanomedicine available to patients.[11] This special issue on “Advanced Nanosystems for Clinical Translation” addresses a cutting-edge and multidisciplinary field and emphasises the clinical translation of recently developed advanced nanosystems for a range of readers working both in the academic and industry worlds. Researchers, clinical doctors, related scientific and technical specialists working in chemistry, biomedical sciences, materials science, biology and medicine provide suitable scientific contribution in these fields. There is no doubt that nanomedicine is a cross-, multi-, inter- and trans-disciplinary field of research and the examples below, demonstrate exactly how nanoparticles and nanomedicines are revolutionizing and reshaping the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields. This special issue collects 19 amazing contributions, including eight review papers, nine full papers and two progress reports, which broadly cover the various important topics within the field of nanomedicine. Worldwide contributions are part of this special issue and address the impact of nanosystems in basic science, translational and personalized medicine for the treatment of various diseases. In the field of ultrathin fibers, Prof. Cui and co-workers. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (article number 2000096) provided a novel analysis of the diverse roles of electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds and summarized recent advances in exploiting their binary attributes for applications in biomedicine. The authors firstly introduced the development of techniques for electrospinning, specifically the engineering of electrospun nanofibers, and then discussed the scaffold applications for cell migration, adhesion, proliferation, and accelerating regeneration in cardiac, nerve, skeletal muscle, bone tissue, and wound healing, as well as the scaffold inhibitory properties in cancer treatments, antibacterial applications, anti-adhesion, anti-scarring, and inhibition of thrombus formation. In the field of brain drug delivery, Prof. Merkel and co-workers from Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich (article number 2000092) discussed the impact and properties of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-functionalized polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) for the transport of drugs, such as dalargin, loperamide, doxorubicin, and nerve growth factor across the brain-blood-barrier (BBB) via low density lipoprotein receptor. The authors also described the direct and indirect coating processes of Apo-E to NPs, their impact in transcytosis mediated transport across the BBB and in vivo models simulating the central nervous system-relevant diseases, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases and cerebral cancer. In the field of anticancer therapy, Prof. Teesalu and co-workers from University of Tartu (article number 2000097) discussed the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) coated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a lysosomal protease cathepsin B sensitive linker, and functionalized with a prototypic CendR peptide (RPARPAR), that targets neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), for the treatment of pancreatic and melanoma cells. The authors demonstrated, for example, that RPARPAR-MMAE-AgNPs are internalized and induced apoptotic cell death in NRP-1-positive PPC-1 prostate cancer cells, while sparing NRP-1-negative M21 melanoma cells. In the same field, Prof. Cameron and co-workers from University of Nottingham (article number 2000103) investigated the synthesis of amphiphilic block co-polymers composed of doxorubicin-loaded poly(ethylene glycol)-copoly(lactide)-copoly(2-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)-3-propyl carbonate) and studied its anticancer property in 2D cell models and in 3D spheroids of triple negative breast cancer cells, as well as in an aggressive orthotopic triple negative breast cancer mouse model. In another study, Prof. Kostarelos and co-workers from University of Manchester (article number 2000109) investigated the interaction of graphene oxide (GO) sheets with in vitro (three-dimensional spheroids) and in vivo (orthotopic xenograft) models of glioblastoma (GB). In vitro experiments with spheroids, showed that GO flakes are passively translocated into the spheroids with little internalization in tumor cells, and did not cause cytotoxicity and only induced small changes in gene and protein expression. In vivo, the intracranially administered GO also showed extensive distribution throughout the tumor mass and had no impact on tumor growth and progression for the duration of the study. Furthermore, Prof. Fresta and co-workers from University of Catanzaro “Magna Graecia” (article number 2000121) studied the anticancer effect of multidrug liposomes in breast cancer cells. The co-delivery of anticancer drugs (gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel) increased the anticancer effect of both drugs in vitro, inhibiting the tumor growth in an in vivo model of metastatic murine breast cancer and improved the overall survival of murine breast cancer metastatic model. Prof. Satchi-Fainaro and co-workers from Tel Aviv University (article number 2000124) provided an overview of drug delivery and novel therapeutic approaches to target GB. The authors firstly discussed the conventional and gold-standard treatments in GB, including surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and then the limitations of conventional treatment to achieve complete resection of the tumor, in the majority of GB patients due to the invasiveness of GB and the limitations of drug penetration across the BBB. The authors also reported a detailed overview of novel nanomedicines that can cross the BBB and specifically target the cancer cells to achieve a targeted treatment of GB. Moreover, Prof. Vicent and co-workers from Centro de Investigación Príncipe Felipe (article number 202000136) provided a detailed revision of literature on the current options for prostate cancer (PCa) treatment. The authors reported discussions in hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy, the reformulation of existing therapeutics as nanomedicines, and described the nanomedicine approaches to advanced PCa treatment under evaluation in both preclinical and clinical studies. The opportunity to improve the design of novel therapeutic approaches, the identification of novel functional biomarkers to stratify patients, and finally the guidelines for nanomedicine design were also discussed. In the field of cancer nanomedicine, Prof. Florindo and co-workers from Universidade de Lisboa (article number 2000147) discussed the nanomedicines and their impact in melanoma therapy. The authors addressed the current knowledge on melanoma biology and immunology, focusing on the emerging role of nanotechnology in the development of combinatorial strategies targeting and regulating the function of major players in melanoma progression and immune evasion. The impact of nanotechnology was also approached in cancer immunotherapy and the emergent-targeted nanomedicines for immunotherapy were also discussed for their relevance to melanoma genomics, predictive biomarkers, clinical trial design, and clinical regulation of nanomedicines. Furthermore, Prof. Cabral and co-workers from University of Tokyo (article number 2000159) provided an overview of clinical translation of self-assembled nanomedicines for anti-cancer therapy. In particular, the authors reported the process for designing nanomedicines to have a selective delivery of probes and anticancer agents to tumors, and thus, achieving an improved diagnostic or therapeutic efficacy, as well as relieving potential side effects. They also presented the current status of clinically used self-assembled nanomedicines, reviewing recent advances of nanomedicines in clinical trials, discussing the challenges and future perspectives of nanomedicines in the clinic. Prof. Sosnik and co-workers from Technion-Israel Institute of Technology (article number 2000010) investigated the potential of glycosylation to have an active targeting of nano-drug delivery systems for the treatment of solid tumors in patients overexpressing glucose transporters. Curcumin-loaded targeted micelles in the presence of glucose molecules on the surface of micelles lead to enhanced internalization of micelles inside breast cancer cells and increased the anticancer activity both in vitro and in vivo, in mice bearing 4T1-induced tumors. In the field of gene delivery, Prof. Shen and co-workers (article number 2000099) from Houston Methodist Research Institute provided an overview of mRNA-based therapeutics as platform for treatment of human diseases. Multiple nanotechnology-based delivery platforms for mRNA delivery were discussed, such as polymer-based polyplex, lipid-based lipoplex, and lipid-coated polymer-based lipopolyplex, and their applications in biotechnology, including cell reprogramming and gene editing, as well as the potential clinical translational in protein replacement therapy, infectious disease and anti-cancer therapy. Prof. Mitchell and co-workers from University of Pennsylvania (article number 2000111) discussed the potential use of nucleic acids, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and antisense oligonucleotides, in gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. The authors described the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as an emerging delivery system that can protect nucleic acids from degradation, mediate their intracellular delivery and deliver intact siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides through the gastrointestinal barrier. Lipid compositions of LNPs enhance the delivery of nanosystems in the GI tract and improve the LNP-b-DNA delivery. Moreover, sequencing results and high-throughput in vivo screening indicated that LNPs accelerate the discovery of LNPs for GI tract nucleic acid delivery upon oral administration. In another work, Prof. Zhang and co-workers from Åbo Akademi University (article number 2000072) described the effective intracellular delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids for homology-directed repair by functionalization of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs). Functionalized MSNs, forming complexes with CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids, which can enhance the cellular internalization and endosomal escape, facilitating the nuclear transport of the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids. CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids-functionalized MSNs were shown to aid the overcoming of physiological barriers, allowing the delivery through the GI tract and regulating the intracellular signaling of CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids. In the field of osteoarthritis, Prof. Duvall and co-workers from Vanderbilt University (article number 2000072) described an overview of the recent advances in clinical translation of intra-articular osteoarthritis (OA) and potential nanosystems that are currently used for its treatment. In particular, the authors reported the recent development of clinically tested therapies for OA, and highlighting the recent nanosystems, such as hydrogels, liposomes, polymeric microparticles and nanoparticles, drug conjugates, and combination systems that are currently in clinical trials and have had a significant impact in nanomedicine. In the topical drug delivery field, Prof. Chiappini and co-workers from King's College London (article number 2000160) provided an overview of nanodelivery systems to overcome physiological barriers and to guarantee the passage through the skin, mucosae, eyes and ears for target diseases and accumulation of drugs in specific tissues. In the field of anti-bacterial drug delivery, Prof. Zhou and co-workers from Zhejiang University (article number 2000107) demonstrated that a hydrogel based on photosynthetic microorganisms can enhance wound healing by production and local delivery of oxygen that is carried out to alleviate acute and chronic tissue hypoxia. The authors demonstrated that chlorophyll was released from spirulina platensis coated with carboxymethyl after being irradiated with a 650-nm laser, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and leading to photodynamic destruction of bacteria in the infectious area. In another paper, Prof. de la Fuente and co-workers from Instituto de Nanociencia y Materiales de Aragón (article number 2000113) highlighted the importance and progress of pulmonary administration, via passive and active targeting strategies towards bacteria reservoirs to overcome the challenges in tuberculosis treatment. In the field of anti-inflammatory drug delivery, Prof. Santos and co-workers from University of Helsinki (article number 2000058) described a nanocomposite, polydopamine-based nanoparticle, for anti-inflammatory delivery of budesonide encapsulated in a pH-responsive endosomolytic polymer, in order to prevent ROS production and acting as scavenger for inflammation. The authors demonstrated such nanocomposite led to successfully macrophage phenotype and switch from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages.

    "abstract": "Abstract Formation of an occlusive thrombus is a critical pathophysiological feature of numerous cardiovascular diseases. Thrombosis is promoted by P‐selectin overexpressed on activated platelets and endothelium and tightly linked with the overproduction of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). The overexpression of P‐selectin and overproduction of H 2 O 2 become unique features of thrombosed vessels which provide a rationale for the development of targeted therapeutics for thrombosis. In this work, targeted self‐delivering and H 2 O 2 ‐activatable antithrombotic nanomedicine (Fu–sBR) composed of a self‐immolative dimeric prodrug (sBR) and a P‐selectin targeting fucoidan, are reported. In the presence of fucoidan, sBR is formulated into stable nanoassemblies that can serve as carrier‐free nanodrugs and exert antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and antiplatelet activities in a H 2 O 2 ‐triggered manner. In mouse models of carotid arterial thrombosis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), Fu–sBR nanoassemblies specifically target thrombosed vessels to effectively suppress thrombus development by inhibiting the expression of tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α), interleukine‐1 beta (IL‐1β), and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L). Given their self‐delivering capability, thrombus targeting ability, and stimulus‐activatable therapeutic actions, Fu–sBR nanoassemblies have great translational potential as therapeutic agents for various thrombotic disorders.",

In response to the pandemic, researchers have been rapidly studying different aspects of COVID-19, such as virus detection, vaccinations, and epidemiological aspects of the disease. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can induce uncontrolled inflammation and cause a lack of antiviral response, thereby aggravating the disease. Therefore, recovery of immune functions is key to COVID-19 treatment. Many clinical trials are exploring suitable therapies, and some progress has been made. Early administration of interferons may prevent COVID-19 exacerbation and/or promotes recovery from the diseases. Inhibitors of inflammation can prevent cytokine storms and multi-organ damage. Convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibodies has played an important role in therapeutic options at the beginning of the pandemic owing to the lack of other effective methods.

    "abstract": "Abstract Rare cancer cells, such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cancer stem cells (CSCs), are small cell population found in cancer patients. CTCs have been recognized as tumor avatars for real‐time cancer monitoring, while CSCs are the most malignant tumor cells that play a dominant role in drug resistance and metastasis. Interestingly, these two types of cells share the same surface markers, such as EpCAM, CD44, and CD133. While capturing these rare cells is available, the expansion of these cells is still challenging due to the limited cell number. These cells are susceptible to the microenvironment and lose the capability to grow in vitro, especially after an intense capturing process. A technology called patient‐derived tumor organoids (PDOs) or tumoroids is a rising start in cancer modeling but the applicability is still questionable. Recently, assembloids containing multiple tumor‐related cells have been developed which is one step closer to the real tumor. In this review, strategies for in vitro expansion of tumoroids are summarized implying that artificial tumor niche composed of optimized biophysical and biological cues is vital in the tumoroid generation. Tumoroids containing rare cancer cells is believed to be beneficial in the diagnosis, therapeutic regimen, and drug discovery for personalized therapy.",

    "abstract": "Our special issue entitled \"Next Generation Immunotherapies\" focuses on emerging strategies for immune activation, modulation, and tolerance in the context of immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, has revolutionized how we treat cancer patients. Cancer immunotherapy aims to establish anti-tumor immunity for eradication of cancer. Despite their wide success in the clinic, there are still many critical issues to address. \"Cold\" tumors that lack tumor-infiltrating T-cells do not respond well to ICBs. In addition, ICBs trigger immune-related adverse events in some patients with dose-limiting toxicities. While CAR T-cell therapy is potent against hematologic cancers, their efficacy is generally poor against solid tumors due to limited T-cell infiltration. In addition, production of CAR T-cells is not trivial, thus presenting additional challenges. Hence, new approaches are urgently needed to improve and expand our armamentarium against cancer. Moreover, since late 2019, a novel coronavirus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused unprecedented havoc throughout the world. This triggered worldwide efforts to develop therapies and vaccines against SARS-COV-2, and fortunately, we now have several vaccines that are approved for emergency use. However, there is still more room for improvement as new SARS-COV-2 variants are threatening our progress toward normalcy. In this regard, next generation immunotherapies and vaccines are urgently needed to fight against SARS-COV-2 as well as against other emerging pathogens. In this special issue of Next Generation Immunotherapy, we highlight emerging strategies and new opportunities to design and improve immunotherapies against various human pathologies. This special issue presents 21 outstanding contributions, which include 12 research articles and 9 review articles. Briefly, these articles report novel immunotherapies, vaccines, immunostimulatory agents, synthetic antigen-presenting cells, and engineered cytokines for improving the efficacy and safety of cancer immunotherapies. We also present how drug delivery platforms designed to either target lymphoid tissues or interact favorably with human blood proteins impact cellular and humoral immune responses. We also discuss new immunotherapies against SARS-COV-2, antibody engineering for neutralizing SARS-COV-2 variants, as well as innovative approaches for vaccination against high priority infectious pathogens. First, emerging strategies for cancer immunotherapy and cancer vaccination are presented in the following series of research and review articles. Prof. Yu-Kyoung Oh and co-workers from Seoul National University (article number 2000288) have developed a new nanoadjuvant based on imiquimod incorporated into amphiphilic peptide-based micelles. Using this system, they have demonstrated anti-tumor effects of external photosensitizer-free phototherapy combined with nanoadjuvant strategy against melanoma. Melanin-enriched B16F10 melanoma cells showed photothermal effects under irradiation of near-infrared wavelength light. The combination of photosensitizer-free phototherapy with a peptide micelle nanoadjuvant induced tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cell responses and prevented B16F10 lung metastasis, thus showing its potential as a melanoma vaccine. Prof. Suzie Pun and co-workers from the University of Washington (2100005) have developed a cationic polymer-lytic peptide conjugate (VIPER), which is a polyplex subunit vaccine composed of conjugated peptide antigens and electrostatically complexed poly(I:C) nucleic acid adjuvant. VIPER delivered peptide antigens intracellularly, disrupted endosomes in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in vitro, and generated strong antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell responses in melanoma-bearing mice. They have shown that VIPER's lytic bioactivity augments cellular immune responses by inducing local cell death. Prof. In-San Kim and co-workers from Korea Institute of Science and Technology (2100025) have reported a new combination therapy that sensitized anti-programed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody-resistant tumors to immune checkpoint blockade. They devised an oral delivery system to improve the bioavailability of simvastatin (SIMVA). A colloidal dispersion (CD) of SIMVA was prepared using N α -deoxycholyl-l-lysyl- methylester (DL) to enhance its solubility and permeation. The resulting SIMVA/DL-CD exhibited significantly increased oral absorption and oral bioavailability, compared to that of free SIMVA. SIMVA/DL-CD decreased CT26 tumor growth in mice, and the combination of oral SIMVA/DL-CD and oxaliplatin powder formulation exerted robust anti-tumor effect with strong CD8+ T cell immunity and sensitized tumors to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Prof. Yong Taik Lim and co-workers from Sungkyunkwan University (2100026) have presented a review article that presents recent advances in cytokine-based cancer immunotherapy. They discussed exogenous cytokine delivery, focusing on new technologies that reduce systemic leakage and increase the local concentration of recombinant proteins. They were categorized as recombinant proteins delivered via targeting moiety-fused cytokines, cytokine-producing or backpacked engineered cells, or cytokines encapsulated or anchored on delivery systems. They have also presented technologies that promote endogenous cytokine production via the delivery of cytokine genes or cytokine-inducing immunomodulators. Prof. Darrell Irvine, Prof. Paula Hammond, and co-workers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2100035) have presented a review article that covers the development and delivery of cytokines for cancer immunotherapy. A diverse array of cytokines has been studied in preclinical disease models since the 1950s, some of which became successful biopharmaceutical products with the advancement of recombinant protein technology in the 1980s. However, following these early approvals, clinical translation of these natural immune signaling molecules has been limited due to their pleiotropic action in many cell types, poor pharmacokinetics, and dose-limiting toxicities. They have focused on challenges that these immunomodulatory proteins present for clinical translation and engineering strategies designed to overcome these issues. The latter includes protein engineering, polymer conjugation, encapsulation of cytokines in polymeric matrices, and particle- mediated cytokine delivery. Further, they have discussed limitations of animal models such as the altered immune populations and receptor pharmacology that can lead to altered responses in humans. Prof. Jian-Qing Gao and co-workers from Zhejiang University (2100030) have presented a review article that discussed applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as the cellular carrier for tumor-targeting therapy. MSCs are one of the most studied stem cells in tissue repair and regeneration. Their tissue-homing capability and non-immunogenic properties make MSCs an attractive disease-targeted delivery platform. The authors have summarized the immunomodulating capability of MSCs and their influences on tumor progression and metastasis. They have also discussed the advantages and potential risks of MSCs focusing on their modulation of immune responses and factors determining their immune properties. This review provides a guidance for the rational design and proper application of MSCs-based targeting delivery system for cancer immunotherapy. Prof. Gabriel Kwong and co-workers from Georgia Institute of Technology (2100034) have reported a new engineered platform for activation of antigen-specific T cells for adoptive cell therapy. In contrast to traditional methods that rely on non-specific activation of T cells by αCD3/αCD28, they have developed an approach that uses liposomes decorated with pMHC molecules, called synthetic antigen-presenting cells (synAPCs), for activation of antigen-specific T cells. They have demonstrated that synAPCs selectively targeted and activated antigen-specific T cells to levels similar to conventional protocols using αCD3/αCD28 without the need for co-stimulation. T cells treated with synAPCs produced effector cytokines and exhibited cytotoxic activity when co-cultured with tumor cells presenting target antigen in vitro. Following adoptive transfer into tumor-bearing mice, activated cells controlled tumor growth and improved overall survival, compared to untreated mice, thus showing the potential of synAPCs. Prof. Betty Kim and co-workers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (2100046) have presented a review article that provides an overview on the current and emerging immunotherapies against glioblastoma (GBM). Developing an efficient immunotherapy for GBM requires understanding the glioblastoma immune microenvironment. The authors introduced the complex biology of GBM and outline challenges for developing effective therapeutics. They have summarized the current immunotherapy management for GBM and advanced studies, including checkpoint inhibitors, cell vaccines, and extracellular vesicle–based immunotherapy. They have also introduced GBM immunotherapy combined with other classical cancer therapies, especially chemo-immunotherapy, radiotherapy-immunotherapy, and the combination of gene therapy and immunotherapy and discussed the promise and challenges of developing effective immunotherapies against GBM. Prof. Li Tang and co-workers from Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (2100065) have reported the development of a new nanocluster for stimulation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. Mn2+ ions have been recently discovered to directly activate the cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) and augment cGAMP-STING binding affinity. The authors have developed a PEGylated manganese(II) phosphate (MnP-PEG) nanocluster that potently stimulated the cGAS-STING pathway. Intratumoral administration of MnP-PEG nanoclusters markedly enhanced tumor infiltration as well as maturation of DCs and macrophages and promoted activation and cytotoxicity of T cells and natural killer cells in the tumor. MnP-PEG nanocluster in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor led to significant tumor regression in the B16F10 murine melanoma model without any overt toxicities. Prof. Jiahe Li and co-workers from Northeastern University (2100066) have reported the development of a new protein-based platform for the intracellular delivery of cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), which are natural STING agonists. Compared with synthetic drug delivery vehicles, protein-based carriers represent an attractive delivery platform owing to their biocompatibility, amenability to genetic engineering, and intrinsic capacity to form well defined structures. Thus, the authors have focused on protein-based carriers and engineered a delivery system based on STING for intracellular delivery of CDNs. Formed by genetic fusion with a protein transduction domain, the recombinant STING platform penetrated cells and enhanced the delivery of CDNs in a mouse vaccination model and a syngeneic mouse melanoma model. Moreover, they have shown that the STING platform restored the STING signaling in a panel of lung and melanoma cell lines with impaired STING expression. This STING-based protein delivery platform may be useful for STING-silenced tumors and STING-based vaccine adjuvants. Prof. Ashish Kulkarni and co-workers from University of Massachusetts at Amherst (2100086) have developed novel lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for co-delivery of TLR7/8 agonists and SHP2 inhibitors to tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs in tumors predominantly exhibit M2 tumor-aiding phenotype, and cancer cells overexpress CD47 that interacts with signal-regulating protein α (SIRPα) expressed on macrophages and inhibit phagocytosis. To address these issues, they devised a LNP system co-loaded with amphiphilic R848-cholesterol (a TLR7/8 agonist) in its hydrophobic lipid bilayer and SHP099 (SHP2 inhibitor) in the hydrophilic core. In vitro studies showed that LNPs system repolarized M2 macrophages to M1 and enhanced their phagocytic potential. In vivo efficacy studies in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice showed that LNPs exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy, compared with other control groups. Thus, their work showed that LNP-mediated co-delivery of TLR7/8 agonist and SHP2 inhibitor to TAMs may serve as a macrophage-targeted immunotherapy. Prof. James Moon and co-workers from University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (2100093) have reported the development of a new nano-immunotherapy for personalized cancer immunotherapy. Photothermal therapy (PTT) and neoantigen cancer vaccine each offers minimally invasive and highly specific cancer therapy; however, they are not effective against large established tumors due to physical and biological barriers that attenuate thermal ablation and abolish anti-tumor immunity. The authors have shown that spiky gold nanoparticle-based PTT and synergistic dual adjuvant-based neoantigen cancer vaccine, each used as a single agent, efficiently regressed small tumors (≈50 mm3), but they were not effective against large tumors (>100 mm3) due to limited internal heating and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. When PTT and neoantigen vaccination were combined, PTT sensitized tumors to neoantigen cancer vaccination by destroying and compromising the TME via thermally induced cellular and molecular damage, while neoantigen cancer vaccine reverted local immune suppression induced by PTT and shaped residual TME in favor of anti-tumor immunity. The combination therapy efficiently eradicated large local tumors and exerted strong abscopal effect against pre-established distant tumors with robust systemic anti-tumor immunity, thus showing the promise of PTT combined with neoantigen cancer vaccination. The following series of research and review articles have focused on platform technologies that can target lymphoid tissues, interact with human blood proteins, or modulate the immune system for potential therapeutics against cancer, autoimmune diseases, and others. Prof. Nicole Steinmetz and co-workers from University of California at San Diego (2100014) have reported the development of a single-dose vaccination platform targeting cholesterol checkpoint proteins. They have developed a trivalent vaccine candidate targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-9 (PCSK9), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). Vaccine candidates were developed using bacteriophage Qβ-based virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying antigens of PCKS9, ApoB, and CETP, respectively. The delivery of the trivalent vaccine candidate via slow-release PLGA:VLP implants produced robust antibody response against the cholesterol checkpoint proteins, leading to the reduction in PCSK9 and ApoB levels in plasma, inhibition of CETP, and decrease in the total plasma cholesterol in mice. Prof. Zhiping Zhang and co-workers from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (2100032) have presented a review article on the topic of nitric oxide (NO) based immunotherapies. NO is closely involved in the cardiovascular, immune, and central nervous system. NO not only participates in the proliferation, differentiation and activation of immune cells but also regulates the secretion and function of immune-related factors in the immune system. NO has a wide range of chemical activities and biological functions, and the pleiotropy of NO is affected by its production, concentration and duration, target cell types and subtypes, species, and pathogenesis of the immune-related diseases. Their review summarized the regulatory functions exerted by NO in immune response, and the pathological mechanism of tumors, autoimmune diseases and pathogenic infections in which NO is involved. The authors also discussed the application and trend of therapeutic strategies based on the direct regulation of NO in immunotherapy against cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infection. Prof. Xun Sun and co-workers from Sichuan University (2100056) have presented a review article that provides an overview on lymphoid tissue-targeted immunotherapies for immune tolerance. Lymphoid tissues play integral roles in initiating immune activation and immunoregulation. Enormous efforts have driven the exploration of targeting delivery of tolerogenic agents to lymphoid tissues to reverse autoimmune disorders. The authors have introduced various tolerogenic therapies for autoimmune diseases, highlight the mechanisms of action from various lymphoid tissues to appropriate cell types by different administration routes, and discuss examples of lymphoid tissue-targeting strategies to improve tolerogenic therapy potency. They have summarized lymph nodes-targeting strategies for tolerance induction after interstitial or intra-lymph node injection and described liver and spleen-mediated tolerance after intravenous administration. They have also discussed oral tolerance-based therapies. Prof. Evan Scott and co-workers from Northwestern University (2100062) have investigated and reported how nanocarrier morphology and surface chemistry affected adsorption of proteins from human blood on the surfaces of nanocarriers. They have synthesized a library of nine soft PEGylated nanocarriers that differed in their combination of morphology (spheres, vesicles, and cylinders) and surface chemistry (methoxy, hydroxyl, and phosphate). Their quantitative analyses based on label-free proteomic techniques revealed that specific combinations of surface chemistry and morphology adsorbed unique protein signatures from human blood, resulting in differential activation of complement and elicitation of distinct pro- inflammatory cytokine responses. Furthermore, the nanocarrier morphology was shown to primarily influence uptake and clearance by human monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. This comprehensive article provides mechanistic insights into rational design choices that impact the immunological identity of nanocarriers in human blood, which can be leveraged to enhance drug delivery vehicles for precision medicine and immunotherapy. Prof. Bruno de Geest and co-workers from Ghent University (2100079) have developed lipid-PEG (PEG: poly(ethyleneglycol)) amphiphiles as well-defined amphiphilic carriers for small molecule TLR7/8 agonists and studied lymph node-targeted delivery and immune responses. They have reported that both the nature of the lipid as well as the alkyl chain length have a dramatic influence on cellular uptake and delivery to lymph nodes. Whereas shorter dioctyl lipids showed poor performance, larger dioctadecyl lipids were prone to solubility issues. Didodecyl lipids with intermediate length were on par with cholesteryl-PEG conjugates in vitro and in vivo, in terms of lymphatic delivery. Immunization with a model antigen combined cholesteryl-PEG-imidazoquinoline induced immune responses that were qualitatively different from Montanide-adjuvanted antigen, characterized by effector CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic potential and robust IgG2 antibody responses. These studies showed the crucial roles of adjuvants in vaccine applications. Prof. Willem Mulder and co-workers from Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (2100083) have presented a comprehensive review on natural apolipoprotein A1 (apo-A1)-based immunotherapies. Apo-A1 is a helical, amphipathic macromolecule and the main constituent of high-density lipoprotein. ApoA1 interacts specifically with innate immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, to collect and transport fatty molecules throughout the body. Thus, apoA1 is a compelling elementary constituent of biocompatible self-assembled nanotherapeutics. The authors have introduced apoA1's properties and discussed how these can be exploited to generate libraries of A1-nanotherapeutics using advanced manufacturing approaches, such as microfluidics or continuous flow methods. The authors have also focused on high-throughput in vitro screening methods and in vivo imaging for identifying promising formulations. Moreover, the authors presented three distinct immunotherapy strategies, including vaccination, co-stimulation/checkpoint inhibition, and trained immunity, for treating a variety of diseases. Lastly, the following series of research and review articles presented emerging immunotherapies and vaccines against infectious pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Prof. Fangfang Zhou and co-workers from Soochow University (2100044) have presented a review article that introduces immunotherapies against Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 can induce uncontrolled inflammation and cause a lack of antiviral response, thereby aggravating the disease. Therefore, recovery of immune functions is key to COVID-19 treatment. Early administration of interferons may prevent COVID-19 exacerbation and/or promote recovery from the diseases. Inhibitors of inflammation can prevent cytokine storms and multi-organ damage. Convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibodies played an important role in therapeutic options at the beginning of the pandemic owing to the lack of other effective methods. The authors have presented various immunotherapies against COVID-19, including treatment with interferons, inhibition of pro-inflammatory mechanisms, and the use of convalescent plasma. Prof. Liangfang Zhang and co-workers from University of California at San Diego (2100072) have presented a review article that discussed the evaluation of nanoparticle-based vaccines as well as the development of nanotoxoids as vaccines against infectious pathogens. Cell membrane-coated nanoparticles are an emerging class of nanocarrier that have been utilized for a wide range of biomedical applications. Prepared by the complexation of toxins with cell membrane-coated nanoparticles, nanotoxoids can safely deliver virulent proteins in their native conformation, thus generating strong and high avidity immune responses. The synthesis of nanotoxoids leverages the natural affinities of virulence factors with cell membranes, enabling for the rapid development of multi-antigenic formulations from unknown mixtures of toxins. The authors have provided an overview on the development and application of nanotoxoids as vaccines against infectious agents. Continued research on nanotoxoids may lead to new and more effective vaccine formulations against high priority infectious diseases. Prof. Pete Tessier and co-workers from University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (2100099) have presented a facile multivalent engineering approach that can achieve large synergistic improvements in the neutralizing activity of a SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive nanobody (VHH-72) initially generated against SARS-CoV. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a severe threat to human health, especially due to current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with potential to escape humoral immunity developed after vaccination or infection. The development of broadly neutralizing antibodies that engage evolutionarily conserved epitopes on coronavirus spike proteins represents a promising strategy to improve therapy and prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 and variants thereof. The authors have shown that VHH-72 nanobody, engineered as a hexavalent Fc-fusion construct, retained binding to spike proteins from multiple highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) and potently neutralized them. Multivalent VHH-72 nanobodies also displayed drug-like biophysical properties, including high stability, high solubility, and low levels of non-specific binding. These studies showed that VHH-72 multivalent nanobodies are attractive therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Overall, this special issue presents the latest advances in immunotherapies, vaccines, and immune-modulatory strategies and their potential applications for the treatment of various diseases. We hope the work presented in these manuscripts can help the readers appreciate the most recent advances in immunotherapies. We also hope this special themed issue would provide excellent opportunities to facilitate communication and foster collaborations in our science community.

Herein, a 3D molecular capture system named the “constructed aptamer (CA)” is reported, which is formulated by the self‐assembly of the human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF) aptamer block and Y‐shaped DNA blocks. The serum stability and target capturing efficiency exhibited by the CA are greater than that observed with the oligomeric aptamer and randomly amplified aptamer. In addition, successful intracellular uptake is observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using fluorescence labeled CA. Finally, an enhanced antitumor effect is demonstrated in vivo, owing to the efficient inhibition of angiogenesis. Overall, the designed CA has great potential as a therapeutic platform for capturing a specific disease‐related molecule such as VEGF.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and rupture of high‐risk or vulnerable plaques underlies most acute adverse cardiovascular events, that is, myocardial infarction and stroke. Methods to noninvasively detect and quantify the presence of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques at the molecular/cellular level are highly desirable for timely therapeutic intervention. Currently, intraplaque neovascularization has been considered as a hallmark of unstable, vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. Here, a high‐affinity positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer is developed targeting vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFR) based on a clinically used tyrosine kinase inhibitor vandetanib (ZD6474) and its potential for noninvasive detection of vulnerable plaques is tested. The in vivo PET imaging of ApoE −/− mice shows high specificity and sensitivity of the VEGFR‐PET radiotracer to vulnerable plaques. A further corroborating test of the imaging potential for clinical application is also conducted on human arterial atherosclerotic lesions. Specific VEGFR‐PET radiotracer uptake is observed by vulnerable plaques in the human arterial specimen with confirmed advanced coronary artery disease. This study suggests VEGFR as a valid biomarker for vulnerable plaque detection, and specific VEGFR‐PET is effective for noninvasive imaging of plaque vulnerability in at‐risk patients.",

The nanovesicle displays the trigger‐disassembly and turn‐on near infrared (NIR) fluorescence property activated by Gram‐positive bacteria. Mechanistic studies indicate that the interaction between nanovesicles and lipoteinchoic acid within the bacterial cell wall disrupts nanovesicles and the free cyanine molecules insert into the network of peptidoglycan, which brings recovered fluorescence. Meanwhile, owing to the burst release of the oritavancin antibiotic payload inside the nanovesicle, the minimum inhibitory concentration of oritavancin is significantly reduced by fourfold compared to that of the free one. Intriguingly, this smart nanoantibiotic effectively enhances the defense against methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus both in vitro and in vivo, meanwhile the NIR fluorescence signal enables quantitative bioimaging of the therapuetic outcome.",

This review focusses on two technologies which are contributing to this trend and, in their mutual overlap, may provide a novel and powerful contribution to future clinical care. Artificial intelligence (AI), in particular the technique of deep learning, is steadily making inroads to clinical care and has demonstrated the ability to extract clinically relevant features from complex datasets. Likewise, mass spectrometry (MS), in particular high‐resolution MS, is gaining the ability to provide highly multidimensional datasets from patient samples with the quality necessary for clinical decision making. The convergence of these trends has resulted in the nascent application of deep learning analytics to high resolution mass spectra. Due to the large volumes of content provided by high resolution mass spectra and the ability of multilayer neural networks to extract subtle features from complex datasets, future integration of their mutual application is identified as a research area of high priority for clinical care. Factors are identified that have contributed to historical progress for each technology and recommendations are provided to accelerate the mutual application of deep learning and mass spectrometry techniques to patient care.",

SEM analysis shows the formation of 300–500 nm nanorods, which are symmetrically arranged with an average size of 8–15 µm and 2–3 µm height clusters to form nanoflower‐like structures. 3D nanostructured TiO 2 grown on conducting substrates shows efficient in vitro transdifferentiation of human hepatic progenitor cells (hHPCs) into insulin producing cells (T‐iPCs). The physiological functions of transdifferentiated hHPCs confirm the activation of pancreatic transcription factors, which triggers insulin exocytosis during hyperglycemic challenge. The T‐iPCs on TiO 2 chips show upregulated expression of master regulator Pdx‐1, β‐cell specific marker Nkx‐6.1, and more importantly C‐peptide similar to human pancreatic β‐cells during hyperglycemic challenge. Intraperitoneally transplanted cellularized TiO 2 implants show prompt recovery in blood insulin level and glucose homeostasis in streptozotocin‐induced C57BL6 mice in a glucose regulated manner without immunosuppressant. These implants provide long‐term survival and function of T‐iPCs without eliciting significant immunological reactions and fibrotic tissue/extracellular matrix deposition in vivo, which could be a better technology for developing effective therapeutic options for the management of hyperglycemia.",

The clinical application of GLP1 is limited by its short half‐life, which necessitates frequent administration. To address this challenge, GLP1 is recombinantly synthesized as a fusion to an albumin binding domain (ABD). The native GLP1 sequence is engineered to inhibit an inactivating cleavage site and a rigid helical linker (HL) is utilized between the GLP1 and ABD to reduce interference of albumin binding by the ABD upon the ability of GLP1 to bind and activate its receptor. Upon subcutaneous administration ( SC ), the GLP1‐HL‐ABD fusion binds to endogenous albumin and exhibits an extended half‐life of ≈44 h in mice. In a diabetic (db/db) mouse model, a single SC injection of GLP1‐HL‐ABD affords up to 7 d of glycemic control, which is significantly longer than the ≈12 h duration of glucose control provided by liraglutide, an albumin binding fatty acid derivative of GLP1 currently on the market for treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

Patients presenting the most disseminated form of this disease have very low survival rates (≈15%) and highly restricted therapeutic alternatives. In recent years, the area of cancer immunotherapy has witnessed remarkable developments in the management of many cancers, including melanoma. In fact, immunotherapy unveiled as a feasible therapeutic alternative for late‐stage melanoma patients, specifically using immune checkpoint therapies. However, despite the exciting outcomes, only a small percentage of patients respond to these therapies, and severe immune‐related adverse reactions have been often reported. As such, most of preclinical and clinical studies currently explore melanoma tumor biology and immunology to guide the development of combinational immunotherapies aiming at relevant clinical efficacy and minimal toxicity. Herein, the current knowledge on melanoma biology and immunology is discussed, focusing on nanotechnology as a crucial strategy for the development of combinatorial approaches able to specifically modulate the function of key players responsible for melanoma evolution and evasion of host immune‐mediated attacks. Finally, the major challenges toward the clinical implementation of these emergent targeted nanomedicines for immunotherapy are further discussed, with particular focus on melanoma genomics, predictive biomarkers, clinical trial design, and clinical regulation of nanomedicines.",

The convergence of immunotherapy and nanomedicine is timely as nanoparticles can now be easily conjugated to various antibodies and peptides enabling outstanding abilities to target specific cell populations in vivo. Here, the state of the art of immunonanotherapy that activates the immune system in vivo, by acting either as vaccines or as tumor microenvironment (TME) activators is described. Then, the development of ex vivo immune‐cell surface labeling strategies is discussed to exploit immune cells as trojan horses and thereby improving the delivery of the therapeutics in the TME.

Herein, the use of metformin (Met) and its polymeric form (Polymet) to enhance the response rate of immune checkpoint blockade therapy is reported. Oral Met and Polymet significantly enhance the antitumor effect of ICI therapy in a murine orthotopic CRC model. Further analyses reveal that Met and Polymet reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment via activation of adenosine 5′‐monophosphate‐activated protein kinase and inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway, stimulating T cell infiltration into the tumor. Additionally, oral Met and Polymet change the abundance of key microbes in the intestinal environment, including increasing the Lactobacillus population, which should exert tumor‐suppressing activities in the CRC. These findings highlight the potential of combining Met or Polymet with cancer immunotherapy and provide a strategy for sensitizing CRC patients to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The agonistic potentials of therapeutic anti‐CD40 antibodies have been profiled in relation to antibody isotype and epitope specificity. Still, clinical impact relies on a well‐balanced clinical efficacy versus target‐mediated toxicity. As CD40‐mediated immune activation must rely on a combination of stimulation of antigen‐presenting cells (APCs) alongside antigen presentation, for efficient T cell priming, alternative approaches to improve the therapeutic outcome of CD40‐targeting strategies should focus on providing optimal antigen presentation together with CD40 stimulation. Herein, a bispecific antibody targeting CD40 as a means to deliver cargo (i.e., synthetic peptides) into APCs through a non‐covalent, high‐affinity interaction between the antibody and the cargo peptide, further referred to as the Adaptable Drug Affinity Conjugate (ADAC) technology, has been developed. The ADAC platform demonstrated a target‐specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell expansion in vitro and significantly improved peptide‐specific CD8 + T cell proliferation in vivo. In addition, the strategy dramatically improved the in vitro and in vivo half‐life of the synthetic peptides. Future applications of ADAC involve pandemic preparedness to viral genetic drift as well as neoepitope vaccination strategies where the bispecific antibody is an off‐the‐shelf product, and the peptide antigen is synthesized based on next‐generation sequencing data mining.",

The current standard of care is ultrasound‐guided thrombin injection to coagulate blood in the PSA sac and seal the ruptured vessel. There is, however, a risk of downstream thrombosis if thrombin escapes into the communicating vessel and this limits patient eligibility for thrombin injection. In this study, the feasibility of using magnetic targeting to reduce the risk of distal thrombosis is investigated. Thrombin‐loaded magnetic microbubbles are formulated and injected into tissue‐mimicking phantoms of PSAs with different geometries using either saline or whole (equine) blood. Ultrasound imaging is used to quantify the concentration of bubbles remaining in the sac with and without application of a custom‐built magnetic array. An absorbance‐based assay is also used to quantify the concentration of thrombin escaping from the sac. Magnetic targeting enables a significant increase in thrombin retention in all femoral artery PSA models except one, with up to 97% ± 2.5% of the injected thrombin being retained. It is also confirmed that the enzymatic activity of thrombin is maintained, and that clot formation can be successfully achieved in whole blood.",

In this research, the efficacy and alternative pyroptosis induction of F‐AgÅPs in the treatment of GC are investigated and compared with those of cisplatin in subcutaneous GC tumor‐bearing nude mice. F‐AgÅPs inhibit GC cell growth, promote lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and induce cell pyroptosis in vitro. The caspase‐1 selective inhibitor belnacasan (VX‐765) and the pyroptotic pore formation inhibitor necrosulfonamide (NSA) partially reverse F‐AgÅP‐induced pyroptosis in GC cells. In vivo, F‐AgÅPs significantly upregulate inflammasome formation, caspase‐1 expression, and gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, thus inducing pyroptosis. Furthermore, intravenous and oral administrations of F‐AgÅPs do not induce any obvious toxicities in healthy tissues. This study indicates that GSDMD‐dependent pyroptosis is a novel mechanism by which F‐AgÅPs protect against GC in vitro and in vivo, which may provide a new therapeutic strategy for anti‐GC treatment.",

The presence of water within ionic liquids has been demonstrated to play a critical role in their structural organization on the molecular level. However, the impact of water on IL transdermal transport efficacy has yet to be investigated. Herein, a water concentration gradient (0%–100% v/v) is tested to evaluate choline trans‐2‐octenoic (CA2OE)‐mediated transport of a hydrophilic model drug dextran (10000 Da) in an ex vivo porcine skin model.Compared to 2:1, 1:1, 1:4, and 1:5 ionic ratio formulations, 50% v/v CA2OE 1:2‐water evidences the greatest success at transporting dextran to the acceptor fluid. Physicochemical characterization (dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical density (O.D.), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), fluorescent microscopy, and rheology) is conducted to test both bulk and nanoscale‐level CA2OE 1:2–water interactions. It is hypothesized that the presence of microemulsions in the CA2OE 1:2 75% v/v formulation accounted for the severely decreased transport compared to the 50%. It is thus critical to comprehensively consider interactions between IL components, co‐solvents, anddrug molecules when formulating ILs for transdermal transport applications.",

The performance of 3D‐HTS is verified through heatmap analysis for distinguishing responses to targeted drugs according to the expression of HER2 in breast cancer cells. Under 2D culture, the expression of cell proliferation receptors is lost as cells adhere to the bottom of the plate. To address this issue, alginate is applied as an extracellular matrix to the 3D cell culture to maintain the expression of tumor‐associated proteins. In general, higher drug resistance is observed with 3D‐HTS. However, increased drug resistance does not necessarily mean decreased analytical sensitivity to drug responsiveness. In particular, with 3D‐HTS, EGFR‐targeted drug reactivity to HER2‐positive and ‐negative cell lines are distinguished by a higher positive/negative ( P/N ) score, and more combinations of strong correlations between EGFR‐targeted drugs are observed. After confirming the reactivity of 65 drugs using previous analysis results with heatmap analysis, two new non‐EGFR‐targeted drugs with excellent efficacy against breast cancer cells are identified. To verify this, high‐content imaging analysis is conducted to assess their ability to inhibit phospho‐EGFR activity. Therefore, the 3D‐HTS‐based heatmap analysis method is useful for analyzing the efficacy of targeted drugs against breast cancer cells.",

The constructed Au NPs‐PEG‐Fc (APF) nanodrug depletes GSH by competitive binding, catalyzes glucose to generate H 2 O 2 with its glucose oxidase‐mimicking activity, and further catalyzes H 2 O 2 to generate •OH through the Fc‐based Fenton reaction. Finally, it enhances redox dyshomeostasis through both the depletion of GSH and generation of •OH. Both in vitro and in vivo results show that the APF nanodrug can elevate oxidative stress to enhance the efficacy of CDT. Overall, this study provides a promising strategy for disrupting the redox balance to enhance the efficacy of CDT.",

This study investigates the impact of Anemoside B4 (B4), an anti‐inflammatory drug, on kidney cell populations in DKD mice using single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) and mass spectrometry‐based proteomics, focusing on its hypoglycemic, anti‐inflammatory, and anti‐fibrotic properties. Compared to the DKD group, B4 treatment reduces blood lipid metabolism levels, renal inflammation, and fibrosis in mice. Through scRNA‐seq, 14 distinct renal cell clusters are identified, primarily proximal tubular (PT) cells. In DKD mice, PT subtype cells exhibited elevated SPP1 expression, promoting macrophage M1 polarization, inflammatory cell infiltration, and renal fibrosis—all reversed by B4. Macrophage analysis revealed enrichment of the marker gene interlukin‐1β (IL‐1β) in renal macrophage polarization during diabetic nephropathy. B4 effectively mitigated macrophage polarization, alleviating inflammation and fibrosis, confirmed by Western blot. Fibroblast analysis demonstrated reduced fibrosis with B4 treatment, consistent with hematoxylin and eosin staining and Immunofluorescence findings. Notably, oxidative stress contributed to these changes. In conclusion, B4 alleviated kidney inflammation and fibrosis in DKD mice by mitigating macrophage polarization and addressing oxidative stress, providing valuable insights into its multifaceted therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The gold standard of auricular reconstruction involves manual graft assembly from autologous costal cartilage. The intervention may require multiple surgical procedures and lead to donor‐site morbidity, while the outcome is highly dependent on individual surgical skills. A tissue engineering approach provides the means to produce cartilage grafts of a defined shape from autologous chondrocytes. The use of autologous cells minimizes the risk of host immune response; however, factors such as biomaterial compatibility and in vitro maturation of the tissue‐engineered (TE) cartilage may influence the engraftment and shape‐stability of TE implants. Here, this work tests the biocompatibility of bioprinted autologous cartilage constructs in a rabbit model. The TE cartilage is produced by embedding autologous auricular chondrocytes into hyaluronan transglutaminase (HATG) based bioink, previously shown to support chondrogenesis in human auricular chondrocytes in vitro and in immunocompromised xenotransplantation models in vivo. A drastic softening and loss of cartilage markers, such as sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and collagen type II are observed. Furthermore, fibrous encapsulation and partial degradation of the transplanted constructs are indicative of a strong host immune response to the autologous TE cartilage. The current study thus illustrates the crucial importance of immunocompetent autologous animal models for the evaluation of TE cartilage function and compatibility.",

Previously a biodegradable IP system was prepared that exhibited a temperature‐responsive sol‐to‐gel transition and subsequent chemical cross‐linking. The IP system used triblock copolymers, poly(ε‐caprolactone‐ co ‐glycolide)‐ b ‐poly(ethylene glycol)‐ b ‐poly(ε‐caprolactone‐ co ‐glycolide) (tri‐PCG) and a polymer whose termini were converted to N ‐hydroxysuccinimide esters (tri‐PCG‐OSu). OVA and CpG‐DNA sustained release was achieved using tri‐PCG‐based IP systems in vitro. Moreover, the release of CpG‐DNA was delayed using an IP system containing tri‐PCG‐OSu mixed with poly(L‐lysine) (PLL). Subcutaneous administration of the tri‐PCG‐based IP gel vaccine induced stronger humoral and cellular immune responses in mice than in those without IP administration. The Tri‐PCG‐OSu IP gel maintained high OVA‐specific IgG titers for 22 weeks. In contrast, the tri‐PCG IP gel exhibits a relatively rapid release of CpG DNA in vitro, predominantly inducing cellular immune responses. Furthermore, the tri‐PCG IP gel shows a potent antitumor effect against OVA‐expressing T lymphoma (E.G7‐OVA) and extends the survival duration of mice. Therefore, tri‐PCG‐based IP systems are promising vaccine platforms for controlling the release of antigens and adjuvants to enhance the humoral and cellular immune responses.",

Oridonin (ORI), the main pharmacodynamic component of the Chinese herb Herba Rabdosiae with anticancer activity is reported to inhibit various types of cancer including NSCLC. However, its direct target proteins acting on NSCLC still require further investigation. Here, the direct protein profile is analyzed and the key targets of ORI are identified by combining activity‐based protein profiling (ABPP) and the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). As a result, ORI can significantly promote Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cell apoptosis, decrease mitochondrial membrane potential, and increase reactive oxygen species accumulation. In addition, both ABPP and CETSA indicate that ORI directly binds to key proteins of the glycolysis pathway, including Aldolase A (ALDOA), Enolase 1 (ENO1), pyruvate kinase M2, and lactate dehydrogenase. Based on the LLC mouse model, ORI markedly inhibits the growth of lung tumors, increases the serum levels of antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase, and reduces the production of malondialdehyde. To sum up, ORI can be regarded as a novel antitumor strategy of NSCLC by inhibiting ALDOA‐ and ENO1‐mediated glycolysis.",

Safer and more effective alternative is therefore in urgent need, and resveratrol (RES) emerges as a promising candidate. However, the effectiveness of RES against BC remains unexplored. In this study, BC‐derived organoids (BCOs) are established to evaluate the efficacy of RES in comparison to conventional anti‐BC drugs (epirubicin (EPI), cisplatin (CDDP), gemcitabine (GEM), and vinorelbine (VNR)). After a 96‐h treatment, RES demonstrates superior anti‐BCOs efficacy (64.00%; 16/25) compared to the other chemotherapeutics (15.38% to 53.85%). Eighteen BCOs are treated with RES, EPI, or a combination of RES and EPI (RES/EPI) in short‐term (3 h per day for four times) to mimic intravesical instillation. RES exhibits the stronger efficacy (44.44%; 8/18) than EPI against BCOs, and the RES/EPI enhances sensitivity of a single drug (50.00%; 9/18). RES inhibits the activation of β‐catenin/CD44 axis in RES‐sensitive BCOs. The organoid‐forming potential of mouse bladder is preserved after intravesical instillation of RES, and 200 × 10 −6 m RES demonstrates no adverse effects on patient‐derived bladder urothelial organoids. The findings highlight the potential of RES, particularly in combination with EPI, to improve intravesical instillation outcomes in BC management.",

Results indicated that ZIF‐90 and ZIF‐108 displayed good biological compatibility and efficiently accumulated in the mitochondria through competitive coordination between the metal nodes of the ZIFs and ATP, suggesting efficient intracellular delivery. With further interactions between these metal ions and ATP, the encapsulated drugs are released from the ZIF nanoparticles, thereby achieving optimal anti‐tumor activity. Through a systematic evaluation of the physicochemical properties of different ZIFs, it demonstrates that the surface charges of ZIFs have a significant impact on the cytotoxicity of cells, whereas the Lewis basicity of imidazole‐based ligands plays an essential role in the competitive coordination between the metal ions and ATP. These findings provide a potential method for screening ZIFs based nanocarriers with minimal toxicity and explain the different delivery efficiencies of these materials with similar topologies.",

The unique thermosensitivity of the fusion protein makes it possible to greatly improve the pharmacokinetics of interferon‐alpha, leading to increased tumor accumulation and thus enhanced antitumor efficiency in mice bearing cervical cancers. Moreover, the combination of the fusion protein and cisplatin can inhibit the development of cervical cancer much more effectively than the fusion protein alone, cisplatin alone, or interferon‐alpha plus cisplatin, demonstrating the enhanced synergistic effect of the fusion protein plus cisplatin in cervical cancer immunochemotherapy over interferon‐alpha plus cisplatin. These results show that the synergistic combination of thermosensitive polypeptide fused interferon‐alpha and cisplatin can provide an effective and promising strategy for cervical cancer.",

While there is evidences of pathways controlling radioresistance, the evolution of diverse cell phenotypes and transcriptional changes as mediators of radioresistance in breast cancer are restricted. Moreover, the effectiveness of the chemotherapy on radioresistant cells remains uncertain. In this work, an isogenic model of radioresistant breast cancer cells (RR cells) is used to study this phenotype. RR cells show high survival rates after radiation, moreover, RR cells of the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype show a significantly advanced invasiveness phenotype. Notably, RR cells are significantly sensitive to chemotherapy by inhibit cell survival and promote apoptosis. Transcriptomics and gene co‐expression network analysis identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and hub genes related to survival and apoptosis pathways in the RR cells of luminal subtype, while in TNBC subtype, cell migration, cell differentiation, and immune pathways are enriched. Hub genes predict the failure of radiotherapy in breast cancer patients, but they are also related to pathological complete response after chemotherapy. Transcriptome changes during acquired radioresistance uncover genes and pathways associated to radio and chemotherapy response. These results demonstrate that radioresistant pathways may converge to develop collateral chemo‐sensitivity.",

Sleep and Aquaporin‐4 (AQP‐4) expression positively regulate the glymphatic system. When sleep is disturbed and AQP‐4 polarization is inhibited, the glymphatic system is impaired, leading to the inability to effectively eliminate soluble wastes from the brain. This disruption can potentially contribute to, or accelerate, the progression of various CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, as well as non‐CNS diseases, like diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Therefore, the normal functioning of the glymphatic system is essential for the recovery from both CNS diseases and non‐CNS diseases. In this review, an overview of the constituents and functions of the glymphatic system in the brain, specifically highlighting the glymphatic system lesions in different diseases is provided. Additionally, currently unresolved questions pertaining to this topic are summarized. Ultimately, the cerebral glymphatic system is expected to be a novel and promising target for the diagnosis and treatment of multiple diseases.",

This variability can lead to either toxicity or insufficient therapeutic effect. It is known that alterations in drug transporters and metabolic enzymes influence drug bioavailability. Recent evidence suggests that the indirect metabolism by gut microbes could influence transporters and enzymes which can affect the bioavailability of oral drugs. In this study, the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and sulfasalazine are modeled under varying host colonic conditions induced by the bacteria E. coli Nissle 1917 and Bifidobacterium adolescentis . Insight is provided into the sensitivity of pharmacokinetics to the bacterial influence on expression of intestinal drug transporters and cytochrome p450 enzymes. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial modulation reduces tacrolimus peak blood concentration compared to healthy renal transplant patients. Conversely, bacterial presence leads to a two‐fold increase in sulfasalazine's peak plasma concentration compared to healthy subjects. These results suggest that incorporating the gut bacteria's influence on colonic transporters and enzymes can improve the explanation of pharmacokinetic variability. This approach has the potential to refine pharmacokinetic models and ultimately address the challenge of variable oral drug bioavailability.",

The affordability, improved tolerability, and dosing convenience of doxofylline make it a promising candidate for addressing the substantial burden of asthma and COPD in resource‐constrained settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract At present, there is no therapeutic approach available to reverse the progression of pathological fibrosis and ventricle chamber stiffening. This study is designed to explore the effects of latent transforming growth factor‐beta‐binding protein 2 (LTBP2) on cardiac fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the underlying mechanisms. The key differential gene LTBP2 is identified by mRNA sequencing. Ang II‐induced cells and mice are treated with LTBP2 si‐RNA or knockdown adenovirus, respectively, and the indicators of cardiac function, oxidative stress, cardiac fibrosis, apoptosis, and remodeling are examined. The underlying mechanism is elucidated in vitro by oxidative stress and an agonist of nuclear factor‐kappa B (NF‐κB). LTBP2 is upregulated in the cardiac tissue of mice with Ang II‐mediated HF. The knockdown of LTBP2 enhanced cardiac function, attenuated cardiac fibrosis, apoptosis, hypertrophy, and oxidative stress injury, and suppressed NF‐κB expression. These results are validated in vitro. The effects of LTBP2 gene silencing are reversed by either NF‐κB or oxidative stress agonists in vitro. Taken together, these findings suggest that LTBP2 knockdown alleviates HF by inhibiting cardiac fibrosis, apoptosis, and hypertrophy via attenuating NF‐κB signaling pathway and oxidative stress. Thus, targeting LTBP2 may be a novel approach to the treatment of HF.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ultrasound (US), is gaining considerable interest as therapy and diagnostic tool, being safe, deep‐tissue penetrating, and enabling variegate interventions. Although some US applications have already reached the clinical practice, innovative interventions combining them to microbubbles, nanoparticles, scaffolds and novel imaging techniques have to face complex clinical translation. Here US technologies are illustrated in 3D cell structures: as in‐vitro systems at different levels of complexity, 3D models can fairly recapitulate human tissue complexity, while reducing interventions on animals. First drug delivery is described as mediated by microbubbles or nanoparticles to 3D spheroids, organ‐on‐chip, microfluidic‐embedded 3D‐cell structures, and cell‐seeded scaffolds, showing the important US role in achieving barriers penetration and highly localized delivery. Then, the assembly of cells in 3D structures thanks to US is highlighted, showing prominent examples of how finely tuning acoustic standing waves can guide the organization and aggregation of cells in 3D. Finally, an outlook of conventional echographic techniques up to the most innovative quantitative US imaging is reviewed, focusing on new imaging options for 3D structures. These intriguing fields of research are discussed related to their actual challenges and opportunities, level of complexity of 3D models, and ability to propose a valid tool toward clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Suppression of the polarization of M1 macrophages is crucial for promoting diabetic wound healing. Hypahorine (HYP), a small molecule alkaloid compound with anti‐inflammatory properties, is encapsulated in liposome nanospheres (HYP‐INPS) using a one‐step ultrasound method and applied to treat open wounds in diabetic rats. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that HYP‐INPS nanoparticles are spherical and coated with a lipid layer. ZetaPALS analysis demonstrated that HYP‐INPS has a potential of ‐15.67 ± 2.58 mV and a size of 212.87 ± 13.34 nm. In vitro, confocal microscopy revealed the cellular uptake of HYP‐INPS in macrophages. Flow cytometry showed that HYP‐INPS inhibited the polarization of bone marrow‐derived macrophages (BMDMs) to the M1 phenotype. In vivo, HYP‐INPS promoted diabetic wound healing by improving the inflammatory microenvironment within wounds. Immunofluorescence revealed that HYP‐INPS up‐regulated the expression of M2 macrophages and down‐regulated the expression of M1 macrophages at the wound site. Transcriptome sequencing showed that HYP‐INPS treatment specifically up‐regulated ASB10 expression in LPS‐induced RAW264.7 cells. Loss‐of‐function or gain‐of‐function experiments confirmed the regulatory role of ASB10 in M1 macrophage polarization. Therefore, HYP‐INPS targeted ASB10 is concluded to accelerate wound healing in diabetes by inhibiting the polarization of M1 macrophages and improving the inflammatory microenvironment. This newly developed HYP‐INPS system holds promise as a potential treatment for diabetic wounds.",

However, the pattern of Aβ deposition and the effect of APOE (apolipoprotein E, APOE) ε4 on cognitive impairment in amnestic MCI (aMCI) and nonamnestic MCI (naMCI) patients has not been demonstrated. In this work, the amyloid‐β (Aβ) load by [ 18 F]florbetapir PET imaging and cognitive performance is compared by comprehensive neuropsychological scales in participants with different MCI types or different APOE ε4 carriage status. According to the Aβ positivity and results of voxel‐wise analysis, higher Aβ loads are observed in aMCI patients than naMCI patients, especially aMCI patients with APOE ε4. Additionally, it is observed that memory domain Z scores show a strong negative correlation with global florbetapir SUVR in the aMCI group ( r = – 0.352, p &lt; 0.001) but not in the naMCI group ( r = –0.016, p = 0.924). Moreover, this correlation is independent of APOE e4 carriage status. This study aims to identify high‐risk groups at an early stage of AD(Alzheimer's Disease, AD) through cognitive performance and APOE ε4 carrier status, which can be important for guiding clinical intervention trials.",

The e/mNSCLC derived organoids (e/mNSCLCOs)‐based efficacy evaluation of the proposed regimens may improve clinical benefits for e/mNSCLC patients. The e/mNSCLCOs are established from 33 IA‐IIIB resectable non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients without systemic antitumor therapy via optimized 3D culture, of which six with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. Immunohistochemical staining is employed to ascertain the maintenance of biomarker expression patterns of e/mNSCLCOs with that of their parental tumors. The e/mNSCLCOs are treated with six conventional anti‐NSCLC chemotherapeutic regimens, respectively. Calcein‐AM/PI cell viability/cytotoxicity assay and EdU cell proliferation test reveal that the platinum‐based chemotherapeutic or mono‐chemotherapeutic regimens are generally ineffective to e/mNSCLCOs because of their high IC 50 values. Non‐platinum gemcitabine combined with vinorelbine achieve better anti‐e/mNSCLCOs outcome in terms of suppressed cell proliferation and 51.6–65.8% of intra‐organoid cell death. The 6 e/mNSCLCOs with EGFR mutations are sensitive to EGFR‐tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR‐TKIs) in drug selective patterns. The low efficacy of conventional anti‐NSCLC drugs to e/mNSCLCOs suggests the necessity to explore alternative approaches for better adjuvant management of e/mNSCLC patients.",

It has a high potential as a biomaterial, but it has not been evaluated to facilitate joint motion with its lubricating properties until now. In this study, the hypothesis that boron nitride nanoparticles (BNPs) and nanosheets (BNNSs) can facilitate movement in the joint region is evaluated for the first time. Hyaluronic acid‐based hybrid hydrogels are designed to transport BN particles to the target area and pin‐on‐disc tests on cartilage pins paired with glass disks are conducted to determine the validity of the proposed hypothesis. The injectability, mechanical properties, and friction coefficients of hydrogels with the addition of increasing proportions of different hBN morphologies are monitored. As a result, hyaluronic acid has been found to be a suitable carrier for the injectability of boron nitride in biomedical applications. The amount and morphology of boron nitride are observed as two important parameters. A significant decrease in the friction coefficient (18.9%) is observed in the BNNS‐doped hybrid hydrogel compared to the virgin hydrogel. hBN can be considered as a new therapeutic agent with the potential to facilitate joint mobility.",

These hormone‐responsive systems facilitate oncometabolic programs to nourish cancer cell growth, a central node at the interface of cellular energy metabolism and cancer. Several independent studies have implicated ERR isoforms like ERRα, ERRβ, and ERRγ in the pathways of cancer development and progression. The construction of tissue‐specific ERR transgenic or knockout mice and the application of synthetic ligands have precisely indicated the critical and diverse role of ERRγ than other isoforms. ERRγ, plays a critical and diverse role, enabling switching metabolism to oncometabolism in favor of cancer cells, making it a “hot target” in cancer therapy. ERRγ expression is correlated with the clinical status of diverse cancer types and various cancer tissue treatments. The dual feature of ERRγ raises interest in understanding its biogenesis and function in different tissues. This review aims to describe the structural organization of ERRs, their central occupancy at the interface of cancer and metabolism, and their biogenesis and expression profile across different cancers. It concludes that ERRγ has potential as a clinical marker in cancer prognosis and a novel non‐conventional therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Research in cancer therapies is rapidly advancing and demands the exploration of innovative approaches to further improve the efficacy of treatment. Here a multimodal approach for cancer therapy is reported which combines bioactive targeting, magnetic hyperthermia, and controlled drug release. For this, a nanoformulation MNP‐Chi‐Dox‐Ab, is bioengineered by conjugating CA 15‐3 antibodies to doxorubicin‐loaded functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Solvothermally synthesized MNPs of uniform spherical shape and size are functionalized with thermo‐pH‐responsive chitosan. The nanoformulation showed higher drug release of ≈65% at pH 5 and 42 °C temperature compared to the release at physiological pH and temperature. Furthermore, in an alternating magnetic field drug release is enhanced to 74%. Cytotoxicity studies in MCF‐7 breast cancer cells confirm the active targeting potential of the nanoformulation. For the nanoformulation without bioactive molecule (anti‐CA 15‐3) only 18% cancer cell death is noted whereas with the conjugation of anti‐CA 15‐3, 43% cell death is recorded. Flow cytometry studies revealed an increased apoptotic population at hyperthermic temperature (42 °C) compared to the physiological temperature. These results suggest that MNP‐Chi‐Dox‐Ab nanoformulation represents a promising multimodal platform for synergistic breast cancer therapy by combining active targeting, controlled drug release, and hyperthermia.",

The VIPR2 antagonist KS‐133 changes the polarity of macrophages to the M1 type, and nanoparticles (NPs) releasing KS‐133 exhibit antitumor effects against mouse colon cancer cells (CT26) in vivo. To enhance the antitumor effect of KS‐133 NPs, KS‐133 NPs are combined with the peptide KS‐487 targeting LRP1, which is expressed on CT26 cells. Subcutaneous injection of NPs containing indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent dye and presenting KS‐487 in CT26 subcutaneous tumor‐bearing mice resulted in significant accumulation of ICG in the CT26 tumor compared to administration of NPs without KS‐487. NPs containing KS‐133 and presenting KS‐487 (KS‐133/KS‐487 NPs) exhibited dose‐dependent antitumor effects in CT26 subcutaneous tumor‐bearing mice; the antitumor effects are more potent than the effects of KS‐133 NPs without KS‐487. In addition, CD8‐positive T cells and macrophages significantly infiltrated into CT26 tumors after injection of KS‐133/KS‐487 NPs. Thus, KS‐133/KS‐487 NPs efficiently deliver KS‐133 to CT26 tumors via LRP1‐targeting and activate immune system cells such as CD8 positive T cells and macrophages via KS‐133 inhibition of VIPR2 signaling, resulting in antitumor effects. These results demonstrate the potential of KS‐133/KS‐487 NPs as a therapeutic candidate for treating solid tumors.",

As overcoming MDR still remains an unmet clinical need, this work aims at investigating an innovative strategy. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) selectively kills cancer cells by combining low‐intensity ultrasound (US) with a responsive chemical agent (sonosensitiser) that can be activated to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, the efficacy of SDT, using doxorubicin as sonosensitiser, is studied on human MDR ovarian (A2780/MDR) and colon (HT‐29/MDR) cancer cells. The ultrasound exposure of MDR cells pre‐incubated with non‐cytotoxic concentrations of doxorubicin for 1 h has induced a statistically significant decrease of cell proliferation after 72 h. Interestingly, US has selectively triggered the ROS‐mediated cytotoxicity of the doxorubicin entrapped into the cancer cell membrane leading to necrotic cancer cell death by lipid peroxidation. Moving from 2D to 3D HT‐29/MDR cell cultures, the ability of SDT to reduce the growth of MDR spheroids by inducing significant necrotic cancer cell death is also confirmed. In conclusion, SDT can have a role in treating MDR tumors by eliciting the ROS‐mediated cytotoxicity of doxorubicin.",

Due to highly heterogeneous of tumor cells and tumor antigens, including more diverse antigens could improve the efficacy of cancer vaccines.

Herein, poly (lactic‐co‐glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles and activated dendritic cell membrane were designed as mRNA delivery platforms, which possess merits such as prolonged protein expression, lyophilized formulation, and greater efficacy etc. Dendritic cells were activated with particles loading whole tumor antigens which can activate broad range antigen‐specific T cells. The sustained release of mRNA in PLGA nanoparticles can significantly prolong protein expression in APCs, and lyophilization improved the stability of mRNA formulation. Compared with LNPs, these nanovaccines significantly improved the therapeutic efficacy of mRNA. In addition, tumor antigen‐specific T cells in mice treated with nanovaccines was significantly greater than that treated with LNPs. Overall, a new platform for delivering mRNA was demonstrated, that can prolong protein expression and have better efficacy.",

With this aim, Rapamycin – loaded hybrid nanoparticles are produced by using as nanoparticle core a graft copolymer obtained from the functionalization of the α,β‐poly( N ‐2‐hydroxyethyl)‐DL‐aspartamide (PHEA) with Rhodamine B (RhB), Polylactic acid (PLA), the PHEA‐ g ‐RhB ‐g‐ PLA, and different phospholipids, that is, 1,2‐dipalmitoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphocholine (DPPC) coated, pegylated and Mannose/PEG, for the surface coating. The drug loading of these samples allows for controlled release, and improves drug stability at pH 5.5 and 7.4 compared to the free drug. Chemical‐physical characterization confirms the nanostructure size below 200 nm, ideal for systemic administration, and easy re‐dispersibility in aqueous media. Moreover, biological characterization to test the potential use as antitumor agent shows induction of cytotoxicity in human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) and macrophage (RAW) cell lines in a time‐ and concentration – dependent manner, and stimulated autophagy, comparable to the free drug. The uptake study following the fluorescence of the copolymer reveals that the hybrid nanoparticles are internalized by both tested cell lines, with a significantly higher amounts of internalized particles in the case of surface mannosylated and/or pegylated systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glucose‐derived carbon nanospheres (CSP), uniquely derived by hydrothermal condensation process, inherently cross blood–brain‐barrier (BBB) but distribute all over the brain. Albeit its potential to treat glioma as an effective drug delivery system, it is challenging to restrict drug‐associated CSP within the glioma region and reduce non‐specific side effects. Incidentally, gliomas moderately express sigma receptors (SR). Earlier, a cationic lipid‐conjugated neuropsychotic drug, haloperidol (H8) is developed with SR‐targetability and anticancer effect but with zero BBB‐crossing ability. In this study, the CSP surface is modified with H8 (CH8 nano‐conjugate) and dual targeting is achieved within glioma‐tumor microenvironment: 1) glioma cells and 2) pro‐proliferative M2 tumor‐associated macrophages (TAM), as both express SR. CH8‐treatment increases the survivability of orthotopic glioma‐tumor bearing mice and significantly reduces tumor burden in the glioma‐subcutaneous model. Further CH8‐surface is modified by combining the brain tumor drug, carmustine (CH8‐CRM). CH8‐CRM nano‐conjugate selectively enhances the survivability of orthotopic glioma‐carrying mice and reduces tumor aggressiveness significantly in comparison to other treatment groups. Lysates from CH8‐CRM‐treated tumor show upregulation of cleaved‐caspase 3, p53, but downregulation of pAkt. The combination treatment pronouncedly enhances the anti‐glioma effect of H8. Conclusively, CH8‐mediated dual‐targeting via SR within orthotopic glioma‐associated mice exemplifies the repurposing of neuropsychotic drugs for treating glioma.",

However, how this difference occurs at the transcriptome level remains unclear, and the mechanisms underlying these differences are understudied. This study aimed to describe the transcriptional patterns of males and females after DOX treatment and explore the possible mechanisms of sexual differences in DOX‐induced cardiotoxicity. Following DOX treatment, male mice exhibit more severe heart damage than female mice. Transcriptome analysis of mice with and without DOX treatment showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are significantly different between males and females. The majority of DEGs are sex‐specific, and more DEGs are identified in males than females. A number of genes, including the oxidation‐related genes Gdf15 and Rbm3, exhibited altered expression either in males or females. Some other genes, including the ferroptosis‐related gene Cd74, changed their expression levels in both sexes, but at different scales. Biochemical experiments suggested that cardiomyocyte oxidation and ferroptosis may contribute to the sexual dimorphism of DOX‐induced cardiotoxicity. In summary, this study shows that, after exposure to DOX, males and females respond differently regarding the expression of hundreds of genes, including Gdf15, Rbm3, and Cd74, possibly explaining the sexual differences in DOX‐induced cardiotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neogambogic acid (NGA) is a potent antitumor drug but faces significant obstacles to clinical application, including extremely poor water solubility and systemic toxicity. To overcome these obstacles, a newly developed nanoparticle, adiposome, that consists of a neutral lipid core wrapped with a phospholipid‐monolayer membrane, is utilized for the delivery of NGA. In this study, NGA‐loaded cationic adiposomes (NGA‐C‐ADs) are constructed in which NGA is encapsulated within the neutral lipid core and surrounded by phospholipids and a cationic lipid. The concentration of NGA in NGA‐C‐ADs achieved is as high as 1.0 mg mL −1 , which is 2 000‐fold higher than in aqueous buffer alone. Moreover, in vitro cell tests revealed that NGA‐C‐ADs exhibited higher cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines compared to free NGA. In addition, in vivo anti‐tumor animal studies demonstrate that NGA‐C‐ADs effectively inhibit tumor growth in subcutaneous CT26 tumor‐bearing mice and also suppress chemically‐induced hepatocellular carcinoma without obvious toxicity to major organs. These findings suggest that NGA‐C‐ADs hold promise as a potential treatment for multiple cancers.",

PCD is a sophisticated process that maintains in upholding tissue homeostasis and eliminating injured or neoplastic cells. Phytochemicals have shown the potential to induce PCD in malignant cells through various mechanisms, including modulation of cell signaling pathways, regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and interaction with critical targets in cells such as DNA. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that nanomaterials loaded with phytochemicals may enhance cell death in tumors, which can also stimulate antitumor immunity. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the anticancer effects of phytochemicals and their potential as a promising approach to cancer therapy, is provided. The impacts of phytochemicals such as resveratrol, curcumin, apigenin, quercetin, and some approved plant‐derived drugs, such as taxanes on the regulation of some types of PCD, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, anoikis, autophagic cell death, ferroptosis, and necroptosis, are discussed. The underlying mechanisms and the potential of nanomaterials loaded with phytochemicals to enhance PCD in tumors are also explained.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Currently, the efficacy of existing eye‐preserving local treatments for primary UM is unsatisfactory, expressing a need to explore a new therapy for UM treatment. α‐Hemolysin (Hla), a pathogenic toxin fom Staphylococcus aureus, can induce cell death by disrupting the cell membrane and has potential antitumor effects. However, the broad toxicity of Hla limits its application in tumor therapy. In this study, the Hla‐based gene therapy strategy that uses plasmids to encode the Hla gene and applies tumor‐targeting nanoparticles to load the plasmids to form a nanocomplex is proposed. This gene formulation can overcome the obstructions of ocular barriers with its favorable neutral surface charge and nano size, allowing for precise targeting of tumor cells after local administration. The nanocomplex can effectively transfect tumor cells, and the expression of Hla can significantly inhibit tumor growth and directly exert a killing effect. Moreover, the nanocomplex can enhance the antitumor effect by recruiting CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes and reducing angiogenesis after local administration. The study provides a novel gene therapy strategy for primary UM treatment and demonstrates a potential application for future gene therapy in intraocular tumors.",

In this study, Axitinib is used in combination with LY411575 (γ‐secretase inhibitor) and it is observed that the co‐treatment synergistically induced apoptosis (by 37.36% in MDAMB231 and 27.9% in MDAMB468), arrests cells at the G2/M phase, decreases the stemness properties of the triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. It also diminishes the spheroid forming ability, enhances the expression of epithelial markers, such as E‐cadherin (by 2.2 fold in MDAMB231 and 2.51 fold in MDAMB468), and downregulated the expression of mesenchymal markers. Additionally, the protein expression profile of the pro‐oncogenic and pro‐survival genes also reduces significantly after the administration of co‐therapy, which is highlighted by a reduction in the levels of pEGFR, pFAK, pMAPK, NF‐κB, etc. Moreover, the expression of pericyte markers (such as PDGFRs, α‐SMA, c‐kit, and NG2) reduces significantly in both TNBC cells upon co‐treatment, thereby hinting toward the inhibition of epithelial‐to‐pericyte transition (EPT). The current work endows with the effectiveness of the co‐therapy on the EMT and EPT dynamics of TNBC upon inhibition of the major crosstalk between the Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)t and Notch pathway.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Vulvovaginal candidiasis represents a public health challenge due to its reports of high incidence and recurrence. These are caused by host‐related factors like compromised immune system, or pathogen‐related factors, such as resistance to antifungal agents, making this medical problem desirable to develop new therapeutic options. In this context, natural origin substances like curcumin, are increasingly treatment alternatives. However, some curcumin properties limit its therapeutic application, such as insolubility in aqueous solvents, which leads to low bioavailability. Nevertheless, nanotechnology association with drugs of plant origin proves to be a promising alternative to overcome the reported drawbacks. Despite being caused by a fungus, patients suffer significantly from the inflammation resulting from this disease, thus this study aimed to develop a hybrid carrier nanoformulation by microfluidics loaded with two drugs, benzydamine hydrochloride (an anti‐inflammatory drug) and curcumin (an antifungal drug). Transmission electron cryomicroscopy combined with energy dispersive X‐ray analysis confirmed that the nanoparticle is properly developed. Through in vitro biological studies, it is possible to observe that, in addition to being safe, the encapsulation of both drugs in the nanocarrier drastically reduced their cytotoxicity. Finally, although the final nanoformulation does not show in vitro activity, the in vivo study indicated therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Osteosarcoma (OS) is a rare primary malignant bone cancer affecting mainly young individuals. Treatment typically consists of chemotherapy and surgical tumor resection, which has undergone few improvements since the 1970s. This therapeutic approach encounters several limitations attributed to the tumor's inherent chemoresistance, marked heterogeneity and metastatic potential. Therefore, the development of in vitro platforms that closely mimic the OS pathophysiology is crucial to understand tumor progression and discover effective anticancer therapeutics. Contrary to 2D monolayer cultures and animal models, 3D in vitro platforms show promise in replicating the 3D tumor macrostructure, cell‐cell and cell‐extracellular matrix interactions. This review provides an overview of the biomanufacturing strategies employed in developing 3D in vitro OS models, highlighting their role in replicating different aspects of OS and improving OS anticancer research and drug screening. A variety of 3D in vitro models are explored, including both scaffold‐free and scaffold‐based models, encompassing cell spheroids, hydrogels, and innovative approaches like electrospun nanofibers, microfluidic devices and bioprinted constructs. By examining the distinctive features of each model type, this review offers insights into their potential transformative impact on the landscape of OS research and therapeutic innovation, addressing the challenges and future directions of 3D in vitro OS modeling.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Overcoming severe side effects from anticancer agents without decreasing their effects on tumor growth is a major challenge. A prodrug technology is reported using agents that are spatiotemporally activated primarily in tumors while the extratumoral toxicity to healthy cells is minimized. A ROS‐activatable prodrug of a strong anticancer agent, doxazolidine (doxaz), is developed. Doxaz is a DNA alkylating agent with a half‐life of 3 min and significantly higher cytotoxicity than the clinically used parental compound doxorubicin (dox). Importantly, doxaz is not affected by p‐glycoprotein expression since it irreversibly alkylates DNA while dox inhibits the topoisomerase II DNA complex. As drug activators, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are already produced inside cancer cells in higher abundance than in normal cells but additionally generated by external stimuli such as radionuclides (via radiolysis of water) and/or ROS‐inducing drugs. We synthesized the prodrug, Doxaz‐BA, and evaluated its efficacy in vitro in cell cultures and then in vivo in xenograft mouse models. Doxaz‐BA is effective in a broad range of cancer cells since most cancer cells produce higher levels of ROS. Combining with clinically relevant radiotracers such as 18 F‐FDG or other tumor‐tropic agents / ROS inducing drugs results in a tumor‐specific and enhanced localized therapy paradigm.",

In this study, the study develops a novel tumor‐targeting ultrasound‐responsive lipid nanoparticle (TUSL) platform capable of responding to external stimulation, enabling precise drug delivery with controlled release at the tumor site while minimizing systemic exposure and side effects. The TUSL platform is designed to carry doxorubicin (DOX) and tetrandrine (TET), specifically for drug‐resistant NSCLC. The developed TUSL exhibits a nano sized spherical structure with a hydrodynamic size of 141.8 nm, accommodating anti‐cancer drugs with loading capacities of 3.8% and 6.2% for TET and DOX, respectively. TUSL is engineered to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while demonstrating an ultrasound‐triggered drug release profile. Through the generation of CO 2 bubbles upon ultrasound stimulation, the TUSL enhances DOX and TET internalization into tumor cells. In tumor‐bearing mice, TUSL administration demonstrates a superior tumor accumulation with minimal off‐target toxicity. The combined treatment with DOX and TET within TUSL exhibits synergistic effects, effectively inhibiting the growth of drug‐resistant NSCLC tumors. These findings highlight the efficacy of the EGFR‐targeted TUSL formulation in overcoming drug resistance and enhancing therapeutic outcomes in NSCLC.",

Amelioration of the plasmalogen levels, which decline with aging, is required for novel metabolic therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and dementia. This work designed, prepared, and in vitro characterized plasmalogen‐loaded lipid nanoparticles with neuroprotective potential for neuronanomedicine. Liquid crystalline nanoparticles formed by natural scallop‐derived plasmalogens are in vitro evaluated with respect to synthetic docosapentaenoyl (DPA) plasmenyl (vinyl ether) glycerophospholipids, formulated with the helper lipid monoolein (MO). The structural organization of the lipid nanoparticles is characterized by synchrotron small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS). The employed self‐assembly technique yielded plasmalogen‐based nanoassemblies of hexosome, cubosome, vesicular, or intermediate topology types. The internalization of fluorescently‐labeled nanoparticles in differentiated human neuroblastoma SH‐SY5Y cells is followed by flow cytometry. Under the investigated conditions, the scallop‐derived plasmalogen nanocarriers significantly influenced the measured mitochondrial membrane potential compared to those involving synthetic plasmalogens with DPA chains. Levels of protein biomarkers, such as brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), can be regulated depending on the nanocarrier type.

Melanin‐enriched B16F10 melanoma cells showed a strong and specific photothermal effect under irradiation of near‐infrared (NIR) wavelength light, and a corresponding killing effect of cancer cells is observed. The irradiated melanoma cells exhibited surface exposure of the eat‐me signal, calreticulin, which induced immunogenic cell death. The nanoadjuvant, which comprised imiquimod encapsulated in amphiphilic peptide‐based micelles, induced dendritic cell maturation. In B16F10 melanoma tumor‐bearing mice, irradiation of NIR light alone increased the temperature of the tumor site to 60 °C regardless of nanoadjuvant treatment. To mimic metastasis to sites near the primary tumor site, primary tumor‐cured mice are rechallenged with B16F10 cells. In a lung metastasis model induced by intravenous injection of B16F10 cells, only nanoadjuvant‐treated group showed significant prevention of B16F10 tumor nodule formation in the lung. The immunotherapeutic effects of this nanoadjuvant are supported by an observed increase of tumor‐infiltrating CD8 + T cell populations. The results suggest that the combination of photosensitizer‐free phototherapy with a peptide micelle nanoadjuvant has strong potential for clinical translation as a melanoma vaccine.",

However, its potential as an immunoadjuvant is limited by low immunogenicity at low radiation doses and immunosuppression at high radiation doses. It is hypothesized that radiosensitizers can enhance both the anticancer and immunogenic effects of low-dose radiation. Herein the authors report the antitumor immunity of combined RT and immunotherapy with dimethylaminomicheliolide (DMAMCL), a prodrug of the anti-inflammatory sesquiterpene lactone micheliolide (MCL). DMAMCL sensitized cancer cells to a single fraction of RT in vitro by inducing apoptosis and DNA double-strand breaks. DMAMCL with 5 fractions of 2 Gy focal X-ray irradiation led to significant anticancer efficacy in subcutaneous and spontaneous models of murine cancer. DMAMCL-sensitized RT upregulated programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in the tumors. Combination of DMAMCL-sensitized RT with anti-PD-L1 ICB significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy by increasing tumor-infiltrating CD4",

    "abstract": "Abstract Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment option for end‐stage liver disease. As the population ages worldwide, utilization of grafts from elderly donors has the potential to expand the donor pool. Unfortunately, these allografts are associated with increased rates of primary non‐function and early allograft dysfunction. Ex vivo machine perfusion (MP) may be a promising technique to overcome these challenges. A systematic review of PubMed, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov is presented for trials comparing MP to static cold storage for elderly human allografts (≥70 years) (PROSPERO ID352930). Six clinical trials ( n = 1189 patients) are included. Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) is used in five trials and normothermic MP (NMP) in one trial. There is limited evidence that machine perfusion has the potential to mitigate the risks associated with older livers and shorten the length of hospital stay after transplantation. There is no evidence to support superiority of one perfusion type or differences in patient and graft survival. Risk of bias is high, and level of evidence is limited regarding MP of allografts form elderly donors. Nevertheless, MP is associated with length of hospital stay. Further research is warranted to analyze MP for allografts of older age.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Erythropoietin (EPO) is an excellent neuroprotective molecule that decreases the extent of injury caused by various pathologies of the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. However, due to the low permeability of the blood‒brain barrier (BBB), a high dose or even an overdose of EPO injections is often administered to achieve a sufficient EPO concentration in the brain. This often leads to many serious adverse reactions. Several studies have presented promising strategies for overcoming the BBB to deliver EPO. These methods include the formation of EPO modified by receptor‐mediated transcytosis targeting fusion proteins, cell‐penetrating peptides, and nanomaterials. In this review, the clinical progress of modified brain‐targeting drug delivery systems of EPO is summarized to provide a scientific basis and new information on the application of EPO in treating diseases of the central nervous system. Here, the production, pharmacological effects, and mechanism of action of the modified EPO, as well as the limiting factors and countermeasures are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is currently the third most common cancer in the world. Due to the development of treatment resistance, the efficacy of current chemotherapeutic agents against CRC has reached a plateau. Drug activity depends on the entire physiological response; therefore, drug‐dose parameters cannot be designed efficiently by using conventional prediction‐based methodologies. In this work, the AI‐PRS (artificial intelligence‐based phenotypic response surface) platform is successfully applied to find optimal drug‐dose combinations in vitro from a pool of ten approved drugs. The AI‐PRS platform optimizes effective drug‐dose combinations without reference to molecular pathways or drug interaction data. With the aid of AI‐PRS platform, efficient one, two, three, and four drug‐dose combinations from in vitro studies are found. Of hundreds of combinations, regorafenib (R)/gemcitabine (G)/cetuximab (C)/5‐fluorouracil (U) drug‐dose combination exhibits the best activity on four CRC cell lines, two circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and one patient derived xenografts (PDX) cell lines. The three‐drug combination of R/G/U shows the highest toxicity (70%) in the PDX cell line. Four‐drug combination of R/G/C/U displays the best toxicity (80%) in in vitro cultured CTCs. The findings from the present derived cells reveal the prospective validation of the AI‐PRS platform, which may help identify customized and highly efficient drug‐dose combinations for future CRC treatment.",

The abuse of antibiotics is a severe public health problem worldwide, contributing to the emergence of multidrug‐resistant bacteria and vestibular/cochlear damage, leading to sensorineural hearing loss. In this study, PLGA‐PEG‐PLGA thermosensitive hydrogel (PPPTH) is employed as a drug delivery carrier to deliver metastable cystine‐denoted iron sulfides compounds (Cys‐nFeS) to treat Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) ‐induced OM by topical injection through the eardrum. The combination of Cys‐nFeS and PPPTH (Cys‐nFeS/PPPTH) prevents Cys‐nFeS from rapidly oxidizing and constantly releasing Cys‐nFeS, fulfilling the goal of continuous therapy. The destructive effect of Cys‐nFeS/PPPTH on bacteria and bacterial biofilms in vitro and in vivo is evaluated. The results show that Cys‐nFeS/PPPTH has good antibacterial and biofilm destruction effects, low cytotoxicity, and excellent anti‐inflammatory effects. Moreover, it is found that Cys‐nFeS/PPPTH can repair S. aureus ‐induced hearing loss in OM. This study demonstrates the promising potential of Cys‐nFeS/PPPTH for middle ear delivery and antibacterial treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A promising approach enhancing osteosarcoma (OS) prognosis involves the combination of various techniques, such as chemo‐ and photodynamic therapy, delivered through nanocarriers for synergistic cell death. Among the potential candidates for improving drug accumulation at the tumor site, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exhibit a significant advantage due to their tumor‐homing ability and intracellular drug retention. This study evaluates the efficacy of chemo‐releasing and photoactive bimodal nanoparticles, kPCe6 NPs, delivered via MSCs. In vitro analyses show that cells internalize and retain kPCe6 NPs in a dose‐dependent manner and that kPCe6‐loaded cells induce massive tumor cell death in a tridimensional tumor model. Results from an in vivo orthotopic OS murine model show negligible tumor cell death upon peritumoral administration of two doses containing 10 6 loaded cells. To gain insight into this observation, this work investigates the role of cell dose in treatment efficacy. The results indicate that achieving a tumor reduction higher than 90% requires a substantial number of loaded cells, approximately 35% of the entire tumor mass, highlighting the criticality of the cell dose for the success of this therapeutic approach and its potential impact on clinical translation in OS patients, particularly when the number of tumor cells is limited.",

Low molecular weight heparin sodium (LMWH) reduced the incidence of pre‐eclampsia, may be an effective treatment of pre‐eclampsia. But the underlying mechanism of LMWH is unknown. To improve the molecular utilization rate, chitosan‐LMWH nanoparticles (CHsN) are purchased for the study. The prague of pregnancy Sprague‐Dawley rats are injected with nitroso l ‐arginine methyl ester to construct a pre‐eclampsia model. Trichotrophoblast cells HTR‐8/SVneo are cultured under Hypoxia/reoxygenation injury (H/R) simulation conditions to construct the cell model. CHsN ameliorates the integrity of fetal membrane tissue. Administration of CHsN results in decreased urine protein and HB‐EGF levels, accompanied by increased numbers of pups and placenta. Treatment with CHsN increases the proportion of Treg cells and decreases the proportion of Th17 cells. After treatment with CHsN, the levels of LPS, TNF‐α, rank1, slp1, Foxo, NF‐κB, and HIF‐1α are down‐regulated, while the levels of IL‐2, Foxp3, and TGFβ1 are up‐regulated. CRM197 reverses the effect of CHsN. The CHsN improves H/R‐induced HTR‐8/SVneo cells apoptosis through HB‐EGF and affected CD4+T cell differentiation. CHsN ameliorates pre‐eclampsia by regulating Treg/Th17 immune balance and inflammation at the maternal‐fetal interface through HB‐EGF.

All the synthesized Zn(II)Pcs exhibit an AABB functionalization pattern, having a binaphthyloxy‐linked bisisoindole (AA) functionalized at the chiral binaphthol core with branched ( PS1 ) or linear ( PS2 and PS3 ) poly‐ammonium chains, and two non‐functionalized isoindole rings (BB). The aggregation behavior and the stability of the nanoparticles formed by the three PS in water is studied by UV–vis, fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies, and their shape and size is determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The PS nanoparticles prove efficient in the photoinactivation of S. aureus and E. coli . Although PS2 and PS3 present better photophysical features in their monomeric form (i.e., improved singlet oxygen quantum yield), PS1 is more effective in killing both types of strains, especially the gram‐negative E. coli . This observation may derive from the low stability found for PS1 nanoparticles, which easily disassemble after binding to the bacteria surface, recovering the photophysical properties of the non‐aggregated species.",

However, only a few MSC‐based cell therapy products have been clinically approved. Accumulating evidence suggests that the beneficial effects of MSCs are mainly attributed to the release of paracrine factors or extracellular vesicles (EVs) rather than their mesodermal differentiation potential. Therefore, MSC‐derived EVs (MSC‐EVs), such as exosomes and microvesicles, have merged as promising alternatives to traditional cell‐based therapeutics in clinical practice. They offer several advantages such as better safety, lower immunogenicity, protection of cargoes from degradation, and the ability to overcome biological barriers. Moreover, there have been multiple clinical studies exploring the potential of MSC‐EVs for treating various diseases, including orthopedic disorders. However, there is no definitive “cure” for conditions such as osteoporosis and other bone disorders, but MSC‐EVs have displayed significant therapeutic potential for these orthopedic ailments. Therefore, the objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of current knowledge related to MSC‐EVs and emphasize their potential application in treating orthopedic diseases, such as bone defects, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, intervertebral disc degeneration, osteosarcoma, and osteoradionecrosis.",

Unfortunately, the development of these reported antibacterial nanoagents is always hampered by insufficient enzymatic activity and low photothermal conversion efficiency. To address these issues, herein, novel ultra‐small osmium clusters‐loaded F127‐organosilica micelles (Os@FOMs) are developed as antibacterial nanoagents for efficient infected‐wound healing. The preparation of nanoagents mainly involves the confined sol‐gel transition of thiol‐containing silane coupling agent in the hydrophobic region of F127 micelles and subsequent self‐reduction process of osmium salt in the thiols/disulfides‐doped organosilica framework. As a promising candidate for bacterial‐infected wound healing, Os@FOMs exhibit not only high photothermal conversion efficiency of 70% under 808 nm near infrared (NIR) irradiation, but also display peroxidase (POD)‐like activity in acidic conditions, which together contribute excellent antibacterial ability in acidic bacterial infectious microenvironment. On the other hand, Os@FOMs possess good catalase‐like effect in neutral or weak alkaline conditions, thus protecting normal tissues from the POD‐like protocol with exogenous H 2 O 2 damage for efficient wound healing. It is highly expected that the new noble metal@organosilica‐based nanoagents present a promising paradigm to fight antibiotic‐resistant pathogens.",

Antimicrobial dressing materials offer notable advantages over conventional therapeutic drugs, including ease of application, extended contact time, and targeted antimicrobial action, resulting in enhanced efficacy in breaking the vicious cycle. In line with these advantages, this study aims to develop a plug‐and‐playable recombinant adhesive protein (RAP) inspired by the adhesive properties of marine mussels, serving as a durable and effective surface functionalization strategy. By genetically recombining mussel foot protein with antimicrobial peptides, RAP effectively incorporates antimicrobial properties into biomaterials for treating chronic inflammatory skin diseases. The durable adhesion of RAP ensures long‐lasting antimicrobial functionality on target surfaces, MFP making it a promising approach to inhibit chronic inflammation. In addition, when dip‐coated onto cotton gauze, RAP can be utilized as an antimicrobial patch, effectively suppressing chronic inflammation through the inhibition of bacteria‐induced toll‐like receptor signaling. These findings underscore the potential of nature‐inspired protein‐based surface functionalization of biomaterials as a compelling approach to advance the treatment of chronic inflammatory skin diseases.",

Therefore, inhibition of the Hh signaling pathway combined with chemotherapy has been explored in anti‐PDAC chemotherapy. In this study, the paclitaxel (PTX) and itraconazole (ITA) co‐encapsulated poly (ethylene glycol)‐ b ‐poly ( d , l ‐lactide) (PEG‐PLA) micelle (PIM) shows superior therapeutic outcome in PDAC. Pharmaceutically, PIM demonstrates optimized systemic pharmacokinetics and increases tumor drug accumulation due to its serum stability. Pharmacologically, through Hh inhibition and blood vessel normalization contributed by ITA and cytotoxicity contributed by PTX, PIM not only significantly inhibits the tumor growth of the human MIA PaCa‐2 cell‐derived orthotopic pancreatic cancer model but also significantly prolongs the survival of LSL‐Kras G12D/+ ; LSL‐Trp53 R172H/+ ; Pdx‐1‐Cre (KPC) genetic engineered, spontaneous PDAC mice, a clinically relevant PDAC model with high similarity as human PDAC in terms of cancer histology and biology.",

Currently, treatment options still heavily rely upon disease‐modifying treatments that do not treat the underlying cause, rather attempt to suppress and ameliorate the symptoms experienced. However, with the advances in drug delivery methods and therapeutic regimen, newer treatment options have emerged, capable of tackling the demyelinating process of MS. Nanotechnology, cell‐based therapies, or novel drug molecules show promising results regarding remyelination of the CNS. It is foreseen that these advances can eventually lead to vast improvements in the quality of life of patients, as well as improving the microenvironment of the CNS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health problem that causes more deaths worldwide than any other single infectious disease. Current multidrug therapy for tuberculosis is exceedingly lengthy, leading to poor drug adherence, and consequently the emergence of drug resistance. Hence, much more rapid treatments are needed. Experimentally identifying the most synergistic drug combinations among available drugs is complicated by the astronomical number of possible drug‐dose combinations. This problem is dealt with by the use of an artificial‐intelligence‐enabled parabolic response surface platform in conjunction with an in vitro Mycobacterium tuberculosis –infected macrophage cell culture assay amenable to high‐throughput screening. This strategy allows rapid identification of the most effective drug‐dose combinations by testing only a small fraction of the total drug‐dose efficacy response surface. The same platform is then used to optimize the in vivo doses of each drug in the most potent regimens. Thus, regimens are identified that are dramatically more effective than the Standard Regimen in treating TB in a mouse model—a model broadly predictive of drug efficacy in humans. The most effective regimens reported herein shorten the duration of treatment required to achieve relapse‐free cure by 80% and are suitable for treating both drug‐sensitive and most drug‐resistant cases of tuberculosis.",

Subsequent studies have addressed the roles of lymphocytes in induction, education, and memory of host immunity targeting foreign antigens. However, antigens alone stimulate poor immunogenicity, requiring an immunological adjuvant. Common adjuvants include inactivated toxins from bacteria or aluminium hydroxide/phosphate. Although several new adjuvants are being developed, polarized immunity and safety are still of concern. To address these limitations, in the present study, two biodegradable polymers are utilized, chitosan and γ‐polyglutamic acid (γ‐PGA), to encapsulate inactivated Zika virus (iZV) as a nanocomplex (iZV‐NC) vaccine by the electro‐kinetic approach. iZV‐NC vaccine elicited both anti‐ZV IgG1/2a antibodies, correcting to T helper (T H ) 2/1 responses in BALB/c mice. Further, these antibodies have the ability to neutralize ZV infection. Additionally, CD4/8 T cells are shown to be activated by ex vivo treatment of iZV, showing established immunity against ZV. Taken together, these results suggest that iZV‐NC can produce balanced T H 1/2 responses compared to the aluminum adjuvant, thereby providing novel insights into the immune mechanism through which NC acts against infectious diseases in humans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bioactive peptides are promising agents for therapeutic applications; however, their small size leads to poor stability, low bioavailability, and rapid renal clearance, so the widespread use is limited. To address these issues, fusing or conjugating peptides to suitable molecular scaffolds is required. Here, human serum albumin (HSA) is used as a delivery carrier for human β‐defensin‐2 peptide (HBD2) in production of HSA‐delivered defensin complex (ADDC) to facilitate its cellular uptake and transport to intracellular targets. Fusion or conjugation can improve the stability of HBD2, as well as extend its circulation time and promote its accumulation in tumors, thereby enhancing the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, ADDC functions as a protective structure against the harsh external environment and serves as a passive tumor‐targeting agent. The data show that the combination of ADDC with clinically relevant drugs, such as Doxorubicin, Gemcitabine, Cisplatin, and Cetuximab, significantly increases the cytotoxicity of ADDC toward human pancreatic cancer cells. Bioinformatics analysis also reveals that ADDC may affect the metabolic processes, gene transcription, and apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. Collectively, ADDC exhibits tumor‐specific targeting capability, low systemic toxicity, and enhanced antitumor efficacy in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer.",

Biophysical and structural studies reveal that both scaffolds stabilize the protease in an inactive conformation. While one ligand binds to the allosteric site at the interface between the caspase and the Ig3 domain, the other ligand binds to the active site using a so far undescribed mechanism. Iterative structure‐based drug discovery on one scaffold results in the identification of a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable MALT1 inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Since the development of the first protein kinase inhibitor in the early 1980s, followed by the FDA approval of imatinib in 2001, kinases are one of the most intensively pursued targets in current medicinal chemistry research. These proteins are overrepresented in various diseases such as cancer, inflammation or autoimmune pathologies and play important roles in their physiopathogenic processes. Despite the development and approval of numerous potent kinase inhibitors, drug resistance and off‐target side effects are commonly encountered with kinase inhibitors. Thus, development of novel strategies to overcome these problems is necessary. Since 2013, many research groups have proposed the conversion of potent kinase inhibitors into PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) compounds and shared relevant and encouraging results using this new technology, which degrades proteins by employing the cellular machinery. Generally, this strategy brings enhancements in biological effects compared to the use of only the parent inhibitor. In this review article, recent findings related to the PROTAC technology applied to kinases are discussed, with a special focus on publications since 2018.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Live biotherapeutic products (LBPs) are an emerging therapeutic modality that have been clinically investigated for treating pathogenic infections and inflammatory diseases. A major class of LBPs are feces‐derived microbial consortiums which require numerous process development steps (e.g., separation, purification, blending) to facilitate LBP formulation into oral dosage forms. A subset of these LBPs circumvents the need for continuous fecal processing by batch culture for individual strains of microbes that are rationally defined and combined in the final LBP formulation. Separately, delivery formulations (e.g., polymer encapsulation) are being developed for LBPs to improve storage and intestinal engraftment; however, formulation requires additional manufacturing processes distinct from fecal processing or batch culture. Here, a streamlined approach termed batch culture formulation (BCF) is developed to combine the individual batch culture and formulation processes into a single‐step process. Based on a previously described polymeric film formulation that encapsulates LBPs, BCF is shown to reduce the number of required processes to formulate LBP‐films without altering LBP phenotype, function, or storage profiles compared to the standard LBP‐film formulation approach. Additionally, it is demonstrated that BCF facilitates scaled‐fabrication from the milligram to gram scale with predictable loading, highlighting the potential that BCF has for clinical translation.",

This can be attributed to a lack of quantitative characterization of the sonoporation process. Additionally, the impact of sonoporation on modulating the tumor microenvironment is not well understood. Using a cyclic dinucleotide‐based STING (stimulator of interferon genes) agonist, MSA‐1, that is analogous to MK‐1454, and approved microbubbles and diagnostic ultrasound, the authors report a 5 min sonoporation procedure enhanced the tumor local concentration of systemically administered MSA‐1 by 6.58‐fold 15 min post sonoporation. The improved pharmacokinetic profile translates into greater STING‐mediated cytokine production, including TNF‐α, IFN‐α, and IFN‐β. Furthermore, through immunophenotyping, the authors report sonoporation could sustain STING‐mediated immune activation while reversing its impact on immune suppression. In both unilaterally and bilaterally inoculated syngeneic tumor models, the authors demonstrate that the sonoporation treated group significantly outperformed other controls at equivalent dosing conditions. These findings may further the understanding of the sonoporation process and its impact on immune modulation, which will accelerate the translational momentum of sonoporation.",

It is essential to prevent overheating of normal tissues and underheating of target tissues, which strongly depends on thermal transport processes. In this work, for the first time, the thermal properties of mammary glands in pubertal and mature mice is accurately measured. Thermal conductivity of mammary gland in pubertal mice is measured as W m −1 K −1 , slightly higher than that of fat (0.17 W m −1 K −1 ), which is the main component of connective tissue in mammary glands. However, with the growth and pregnancy of mature mice, thermal conductivity of mammary gland increases to W m −1 K −1 , 66.84% higher than that of pubertal mice. Numerical simulations are conducted to understand the role of thermal conductivity in photothermal therapy. The maximum temperatures in mammary glands of pubertal and mature mice are 49.6 and 44.6 °C, respectively, under the same laser irradiation conditions. This implies that higher thermal conductivity in mature mice mammary glands might lead to ineffectiveness in reaching to the desired temperature. This work suggests that age and pregnancy affect the thermal properties of mammary glands which are not negligible in breast cancer photothermal therapy.",

However, limited control over antigen presentation at a desired maturation status in these plastic materials remains a fundamental challenge in efficiently orchestrating a controlled immune response. DC‐derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) can overcome some of these issues, but have significant production challenges. Herein, this work employs a unique chemicallyinduced method for production of DC‐derived extracellular blebs (DC‐EBs) that overcome the barriers of DC and DC‐derived EV vaccines. DC‐EBs are molecular snapshots of DCs in time, cell‐like particles with fixed stimulatory profiles for controlled immune signaling. DC‐EBs are produced in an order of magnitude more quickly and efficiently than conventional EVs and display stable structural integrity and antigen presentation compared to live DCs. Multi‐omic analysis confirmed DC‐EBs are majorly pure plasma membrane vesicles that are homogeneous at the single‐vesicle level, critical for safe and effective vaccination. Immature versus mature molecular profiles on DC‐EBs exhibit molecularly modulated immune responses compared to live DCs, improving remission and survival of tumor‐challenged mice via generation of antigen‐specific T cells. For the first time, DC‐EBs make their case for use in vaccines and for their potential in modulating other immune responses, potentially in combination with other immunotherapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As one of the leading causes of acute kidney injury (AKI), ischemia‐reperfusion injury (IRI) results in tubular necrosis and renal inflammation. Here, from gene screening, it is found that Polo‐like kinase 3 (PLK3), but not other PLKs, is highly up‐regulated during mouse IRI. In vivo administration of PLK3 inhibitor alleviates IRI‐induced AKI, but induces myelosuppression. Thus, a novel liposome‐mediated biomimetic delivery system with 1080 nm near infrared (NIR)‐triggered release to specifically and efficiently delivering the inhibitor to the kidney is developed. NIR light irradiation to kidney results in an excellent effect for reduced immune cell infiltration and renal inflammation. Mechanistically, PLK3 inhibition suppresses the degradation of hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)‐mediated oxidative stress, thus protecting the renal tubular epithelial cells from cell death and preventing macrophage activation and renal inflammation. Thus, the NIR light‐triggered liposome system provides an efficient candidate treatment for AKI without systemic side effect.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Viruses are a leading cause of infectious diseases and represent one of the world's biggest global health problems. The continual appearance of new and reemerging viruses exceeds our capacity to provide effective medical solutions, as highlighted by the recent Zika epidemic. Herein, the authors discuss how unconventional approaches might lead to innovations in antiviral drug development that would address this outstanding need. In particular, the case of Zika virus is analyzed and the authors suggest that a materials science and engineering perspective might revolutionize antiviral drug development. Zika virus and related viruses possess a lipid membrane envelope that is an Achilles heel because it is necessary for viral function and there is a high barrier for mutations to evolve there. The development of antiviral drugs, such as certain membrane‐active peptides, to selectively target the lipid membrane envelope would represent an entirely new therapeutic approach. Such efforts could be aided by engineering approaches to design and characterize promising drug candidates that work against multiple viruses. Looking forward, there is excellent potential to develop new therapeutic strategies that target the Achilles heel of Zika virus and other emerging viral pathogens.",

The cooperation of the two motifs fulfills the penetration of APPA‐based nanosystem deep into tumor tissue and accumulates there. The APPA can be easily synthesized and self‐assembled into spherical nanoparticles in the presence of doxorubicin (DOX) (PAD), or can be used for construction of fluorescent nanoprobe in the presence of DiR (PA‐DiR). In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that the self‐assembled PAD and PA‐DiR nanosystems show a surprisingly high affinity for and penetration into αvβ3 and NRP‐1 positive tumors. The PA‐DiR nanoprobe can be specifically recruited to 4T1 xenograft tumors. The signal of PA‐DiR enriched in the tumor was more than 10 times higher than that of the negative control PC‐DiR. The high affinity and specificity of the PA‐DiR nanoprobe in in vivo fluorescence imaging, the profound therapeutic efficacy of PAD nanosystem in solid tumor models, and the low toxicity of APPA‐based nanosystem demonstrate the great potential of this well‐designed and simple nanosystem for application in the diagnosis and therapy of αvβ3 and NRP‐1 positive tumors, with minimal side effects.",

Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is overexpressed in the majority of cancer cells. hTERT has been demonstrated to translocate to mitochondria and promote cell survival under cell stress, leading to significant resistance to chemotherapeutics in various cancer cells. Thus, inhibition of hTERT translocation from nuclei to mitochondria may be developed as an effective and general way to improve drug sensitivity. Herein, leptomycin B (LMB, a nuclear export inhibitor of hTERT) and doxorubicin are delivered into cancer cells by a mesoporous silica nanocarrier. This straightforward design can inhibit hTERT translocation and improve drug chemosensitivity in different types of cancer cells. Mechanism studies reveal that hTERT movement inhibition perturbs the protection of hTERT to mitochondria, exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction and nuclear DNA damage. This work provides an effective method for increasing drug sensitivity based on telomerase location in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The evolution of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs to targeted drugs has led to major changes in cancer treatment. However, it remains difficult to develop effective targeted drugs that can act against “undruggable” proteins, including some well‐known oncoproteins such as KRas. Moreover, mutations of target genes limit the use of targeted drugs. Although some strategies such as RNA interference and DNA editing have been adopted to solve these problems, their clinical use remains challenging. Therefore, new strategies are urgently needed to meet the dilemmas encountered in the use of targeted drugs. As protein degradation is a rapid and well‐regulated biological process in cells, targeting protein degradation by inducing cellular protein degradation machinery, regardless of the status of the target, is an attractive idea for developing novel targeted drugs. This review summarizes recent advances in targeted protein degradation, with a focus on the current reagents and strategies used for inducing selective degradation of target proteins to provide clues for the development of novel anticancer drugs and cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy with a global five‐year survival rate of 30–50%. First‐line treatment involves cytoreductive surgery and administration of platinum‐based small molecules and paclitaxel. These therapies are traditionally administered via intravenous infusion, although intraperitoneal delivery has also been investigated. Initial clinical trials of intraperitoneal administration for ovarian cancer indicate significant improvements in overall survival compared to intravenous delivery, but this result is not consistent across all studies performed. Recently, cell‐based immunotherapy has been of interest for ovarian cancer. Direct intraperitoneal delivery of cell‐based immunotherapies may prompt local immunoregulatory mechanisms to act synergistically with the delivered immunotherapy. Based on this theory, preclinical in vivo studies have delivered these cell‐based immunotherapies via the intraperitoneal route, with promising results. However, successful intraperitoneal delivery of cell‐based immunotherapy and clinical adoption of this technique depend on overcoming challenges of intraperitoneal delivery and finding the optimal combinations of dose, therapeutic, and delivery route. The potential advantages and disadvantages of intraperitoneal delivery of cell‐based immunotherapy for ovarian cancer and the preclinical and clinical work performed so far are reviewed. Potential advanced delivery strategies, which may improve the efficacy and adoption of intraperitoneal delivery of therapy for ovarian cancer, are also outlined.",

Therefore, identifying potential cellular targets is critical for the development of novel and effective treatments for CRPC. Based on the investigation of the molecular mechanism of ATN‐224, an anticancer drug in clinical trials, in CRPC DU145 cells, the antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT) has been recognized as an actionable CRPC therapeutic target, and the modulation of intracellular redox state through CAT inhibition has great potential for CRPC treatment. After systematic design and synthesis, the benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivative BT‐1 is shown to be effective CAT inhibitor in DU145 cells. This inhibition induces the significant increase of both superoxides (O 2 •− ) and H 2 O 2 levels in DU145 cells. Finally, the dual pro‐oxidant effect of BT‐1 is demonstrated to lead to apoptosis as well as cell‐cycle arrest in DU145 cells, effectively reducing CRPC tumors.",

Conventional developments of phytochemical therapies are often based on the action mechanism of single compounds. However, compounds within a plant or across different plants are numerous, and their interactions potentially mold its therapeutic effect, which is hard to explore with conventional approaches. To address such challenges, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform featuring Monte Carlo method‐based modeling (MCM 2 ) for rapid identification of the optimal dose combinations is devised. MCM 2 utilizes both the mean and variances within multiple replicates, and thus maximizes the optimization efficiency. MCM 2 is applied to optimize the therapeutic effect on alcoholic hepatic injury of a quaternary dose combination of products from Gynostemma pentaphyllum and Lotus leaf, which are identified through in vitro screening of 50 products extracted from 24 herbal medicine candidates. The optimal combination identified by MCM 2 is then tested on murine model. Both in vitro and in vivo results confirmed the AI‐optimized phytochemical combination significantly reduced acute alcoholic liver injury. The AI platform introduced in this study could serve to promptly identify optimal combinatorial regimens with potential synergy, which enhances the efficiency during the development of compound medicine.",

It is found that, compared to the wild‐type mice, SPARC deficient mice demonstrated 48.3% reduction in cerebral infarction after ischemia insult. Mechanistically, it is shown that SPARC deficiency significantly reduces ischemia induced cellular apoptosis, diminishes inflammatory response in the ischemic area as well as in the circulatory system, and enhances the integrity of the blood–brain barrier. It is further assessed if SPARC could be targeted for stroke treatment through intraventricular or intravenous administration of SPARC neutralizing antibody. It is found that delivery of SPARC antibody through either route effectively reduces ischemia‐induced infarction. Taken together, the study suggests that SPARC plays an important role in the pathological response to ischemic insults, and represents a promising therapeutic target for clinical management of stroke.",

The present study, shows that there is an existing bias in temporal cytokine sensing that originates from random “unpredicted” positions of loaded cells within the rectangular microwells. To eliminate this bias, the isolated cells need to be well‐aligned with each other and relative to the sensing elements. Hence, an approach that utilizes the in situ formation and release of airplugs to localize cells toward the center of the rectangular microwells is reported. The chip includes 2250 microwells (each 500 × 50 × 20 µm 3 ) arranged in nine rows. Results show 20% efficiency in trapping single T cells per microwells, where cells are localized within ± 3% of the center of microwells. The developed platform could provide real‐time dynamic and unbiased multiplex cytokine detection from single T cells for phenotyping and biotherapeutics studies.",

The interplay of selectins and their ligands with leukocytes and endothelial cells, which mediate endothelial attachment and transmigration of immune cells, can be modulated by selectin‐binding structures. Here, a library of selectin‐targeting ligands coupled to either gold, silver, iron oxide nanospheres, or quantum dots of 5–10 nm in size is used to systematically study their impact on immune cell motility. The multivalent presentation of the carbohydrate mimetics results in very low sub‐nanomolar binding to L ‐selectin. Using human primary monocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages, it is shown that the ligands exhibit only minor effects on uptake, whereas the motility of leukocytes is critically affected as observed in migration assays evaluated by flow cytometry. The carbohydrate mimetic ring structure, sulfation, in particular, and the degree of ligand presentation, are constituents which cohere in this process. Specific carbohydrate ligands can thus selectively regulate leukocyte subsets. These data form the basis for advanced immunotherapy which inhibits the amplification of inflammation by restricting leukocyte influx to injured tissue sites. Furthermore, the targeting ligands may complement existing treatment options for inflammatory diseases.",

Significant progress has been made in the development of such devices (e.g., the ameroid ring constrictor and cellophane banding) as a standard treatment for this disorder. However, incomplete occlusion is a common problem. In this study, a new vascular occlusion device is developed, enabling two major functions. First, user‐friendly deployment onto the external vascular wall is achieved by programming a recovery in the shape of the tube from open to closed in response to treatment with a warm saline solution (37 °C). Second, proinflammatory palmitic acid is released over time from the tube surface through the adventitial wall to induce gradual occlusive vascular remodeling. These unprecedented functions are demonstrated in a series of experiments on cells and rabbit veins, addressing this major issue through gradual but complete vascular occlusion over time. The external self‐closing tube represents a breakthrough proof‐of‐concept for treatment of this rare but critical developmental disorder.",

The advent of DNA sequencing, and further refinement with Next‐Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques, has made possible the enormous accumulation of data, which are useful for understanding the molecular mechanisms associated to various complex and rare diseases. Thanks to these advances, today it is known that several mechanisms regulate gene expression without the occurrence of mutations in the genome, a phenomenom known as Epigenetics and Epigenomics. The main mechanisms involved are DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non‐coding RNA transcription. The knowledge of these mechanisms applied to biomedicine has enabled the emergence of several fields, especially precision medicine, which is based on the genetic and epigenetic profiles of patients applied to personalized diagnostics and treatments. In this review, the history of the scientific advances that have enabled the development of precision medicine will be discussed, with a focus in epigenetics. Moreover, several molecules that have been approved for use or have the potential in epigenetic therapies (epidrugs) will also be discussed here, those of which act on targets responsible for maintaining the correct epigenetic pattern or correcting wrong patterns in diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacterium‐based immunotherapy holds promise for tumor eradication, yet its application is hindered by significant safety concerns. Inspired bacteria, an immunity‐switch nanotherapeutic termed FMaP, for precise immunity control is developed. This nanotherapeutic remains immunologically inert (immunity‐off) during its circulation period but elicits immune‐associated activity (immunity‐on) upon reaching tumors. The FMaP nanoconstruction is composed of 1) a magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) nanocore, 2) a bacteria‐derived chemotactic peptide conjugated onto MNP, and 3) a bacterial capsule‐like polyethylene glycol (PEG) corona coupled via a tumor‐labile linkage. The PEG corona acts as the off–on switch to enable FMaP immune‐off under normal conditions. Upon magnetotactic entry into acid tumors, the PEG corona can escape to expose the chemotactic peptide, functioning as the on‐switch to initiate immunoregulation of intratumoral immune cells and site‐specific recruitment of circulating immune cells. Compared with the performance of bacteria, FMaP shares most of their immune features but avoids their toxicity. FMaP demonstrates high immunotherapeutic potency either alone or in combination with chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy toward colon carcinoma and melanoma tumor models, showing versatile adaptability for treating multiple tumor types. This study offers a paradigm of how to rationally design materials by seeking advantages from micro‐organisms.",

Nevertheless, advance exploration is warranted to elaborate the therapeutic implications and detailed mechanisms of lncRNAs in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Knockout of PP7080 diminishes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, but accelerates cell apoptosis in vitro, and impeded tumor growth in vivo. While elevated PP7080 facilitates cell proliferation, migration and invasion, repressed cell apoptosis in vitro, and accelerated xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, downregulated DNMT1 is found contributing the higher PP7080 expression via regulation of DNA methylation at PP7080 promoter‐regions in NSCLC. Furthermore, PP7080 directly bound with TFAP2C and facilitated TFAP2C phosphorylation at Ser434 site, and then upregulated PDCD6 expression through binding with its promoters. Furthermore, highly expressed PP7080/PDCD6 correlated with immune‐suppressing tumor microenvironment (TME) in NSCLC. Collectively, the results identified PP7080 mainly localized in the nucleus and functioned its oncogenic role via regulating NSCLC initiation, advancement, and contributing to an immune‐resistant TME through TFAP2C/PP7080/PDCD6 axis, implying PP7080 as a novel therapeutic target for NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Metastatic melanoma is a lethal disease with poor prognosis. Here, a patient is being studied with metastatic uveal melanoma whose liver metastases have heterogeneous response to PD‐1 inhibitor. The progressive disease (PD) lesion is found to have more than two times the abundance of inducible regulatory T cell (iTreg) compared with the complete response (CR) lesion. Based on public datasets, high abundance of pretreatment iTreg is found able to predict poor response to PD‐1 inhibitor and is correlated with unfavorable prognosis of patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma receiving PD‐1 blockade therapy. Further, based on single‐cell RNA sequencing data, the ratio of iTregs to CD8 + T cells is found significantly increased from pretreatment to post‐treatment status in nonresponders, while no such changes are found among responders. In nonresponders, iTreg cells have increased expression of IL‐10 and maintained high expression of PRDM1. The top enriched pathway in iTregs includes Il6‐Jak‐Stat3 Signaling, Il2‐Stat5 Signaling, and Glycolysis. A series of targeted or small molecule drugs predicted by iTreg specific genes are introduced. This study provides an insight into the immune suppressive role of iTreg in immunotherapy for melanoma.",

Y6 in OSN adopts closed packing comparing to that in single crystal. The surface charge in OSN causes super‐quenching of the photon excitons, which enhances the nonradiative transition to improve photothermal effect. Lower energy level electronic states are created, which breaks up the bandgap limit and leads to long wavelength emission over 1100 nm.

Effective therapies targeting neuroinflammation remain an unmet need, and modulation of the injury microenvironment to induce a comprehensive pro‐regenerative response is an attractive therapeutic approach. Given its crucial role in cell stress and inflammation after SCI, the potential of pharmacologically targeting MAPK‐activated protein kinase‐2 (MK2) to modulate the response of microglia/macrophages after injury is focused. Nanoparticles (NPs) containing an MK2 inhibitor for specific targeting of microglia/macrophages is developed. NPs selectively target and modulate activated microglia/macrophages in vitro and in a rat model of SCI. NPs in the acute injury setting reduce the pro‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐6 and increase the anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10. Importantly, NPs have a significant effect on microglia/macrophage distribution and accumulation, leading to ≈65% reduction of immune cells around the injury. Last, microglia/macrophage populations with activated morphology are significantly reduced compared to resting or ramified cells around the lesion site. This strategy exhibits potential therapeutic efficiency and specificity for local, pharmacologic manipulation of activated microglia/macrophages, and is a versatile tool to manage acute inflammation and glia plasticity after central nervous system trauma.",

Moreover, RION miR‐143 inhibit the expression of proteins in KRAS networks and cell growth in a dose‐dependent manner in KRAS‐mutated DLD‐1 cells. The anti‐tumor activity of RION miR‐143 is demonstrated in a DLD‐1 cell‐bearing mouse model, with a fourfold decrease in tumor volume compared with Naked miR‐143 .

Stem cells of rat Achilles tendon are isolated and treated with DMOG or Lificiguat (YC‐1). The treated TDSCs are transplanted into rats with Achilles tendon injury. A batch of animals is sacrificed every week for biomechanical and historical analyses. The recovery of Achilles tendon is tested by biomechanics and histology. DMOG could activate TDSCs in vitro and improve their differentiation ability by regulating the expression levels of hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) and early growth response 1 (EGR1). As an inhibitor of HIF‐1α, YC‐1 could weaken the effect of DMOG. TDSCs pre‐treated with either DMOG or YC‐1 are transplanted into rats with Achilles tendon injury, and DMOG pre‐treatment could effectively improve the regeneration of Achilles tendon. In summary, DMOG improves TDSC differentiation ability, and transplanting TDSCs pre‐treated with DMOG into rats with Achilles tendon injury can effectively improve tendon regeneration, which may serve as a novel approach for the treatment of Achilles tendon injury.",

Increasing evidence shows that lactate is also involved in various tumor‐related events, presenting indispensable roles for supporting tumor growth, progression, and invasion. Typically, lactate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can not only be exploited as an energy source for sustaining cancer cell survival but also function as a messenger modulator for signal transduction via receptor or non‐receptor pathways for cell communications therein. In addition, the presence of lactate substantially suppresses anti‐tumor immunity and mediates the epigenetic upregulation of key oncogenes via lysine lactylation of histone. In this review, a concise yet comprehensive summary on recent studies regarding the myriad roles and functions of lactate on tumor cells and TME is provided, based on which there is further discussion of the emerging antitumor strategies targeting the lactate metabolism including its biosynthesis and transporting.

    "abstract": "Abstract With the advantages of ferroptosis therapy (FT) in solving the apoptotic resistance of tumors, a smart strategy based on the combination of glucose oxidase (GOx) and ferroptosis‐inducing nanoagents is proposed to boost the FT. However, most of the nanoagents remain limited in complex synthesis, poor targeting specificity, and unclarified biological mechanisms. Herein, a multifunctional nanoplatform based on fluorescent apoferritin‐gold nanoclusters combined with GOx (AFt‐AuNCs@GOx) is designed for tumor‐targeted imaging and FT. The results show that AFt‐AuNCs@GOx catalyze the generation of toxic ·OH from H 2 O 2 supplied by GOx. Consequently, AFt‐AuNCs@GOx induce the enhanced ferroptosis effect in 4T1 cells. Additionally, the transcriptome assay of 4T1 cells identifies the differential expression genes related to ferroptosis process after AFt‐AuNCs@GOx treatment. Moreover, with the merit of intrinsic fluorescence, the biodistribution both in vitro and in vivo of AFt‐AuNCs@GOx can be effectively visualized. In vivo evidences reveal that AFt‐AuNCs@GOx have the desired efficacy of FT and excellent biosafety. Overall, the AFt‐AuNCs@GOx nanoplatform offer remarkable advantages in simple architecture, fluorescent imaging, precise targeting, and tumor inhibition. The exploration of the ferroptosis effect and biological mechanisms of AFt‐AuNCs@GOx, as well as its application in tumor therapy, can introduce a new insight into the field of ferroptotic nanomedicine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oxygen‐dependent photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds unique advantages on tumor treatment by inducing cell apoptosis, but it is often limited owing to the unfavorable tumor microenvironments. In this study, a self‐delivery O 2 ‐ecomonizer (designated as CeTam) is prepared to relieve hypoxia and reverse antiapoptotic pathway for enhanced photodynamic tumor therapy. Based on Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and Tamoxifen (Tam), CeTam is assembled through intermolecular hydrophobic interaction without any vehicles. Nanosized CeTam has an enhanced stability and improved drug delivery efficiency, which prefers to accumulate at tumor tissue for effective cellular uptake. More importantly, CeTam can effectively inhibit mitochondrial respiration to relieve hypoxia and reduce Bcl‐2 expression to reverse antiapoptotic pathway. As a result, this self‐delivery O 2 ‐ecomonizer successfully regulates the unfavorable tumor microenvironments to enhance the PDT efficacy on tumor elimination. Taken together, this work reports a multifunctional nanoplatform by a simple self‐assembly strategy to remedy the deficiencies of PDT on hypoxic tumor treatment, which can advance the development of individualized biomedicine for precise tumor therapy.",

To effectively protect neuronal systems from damage caused by elevated intraocular pressure, a novel dual‐drug nanohybrid has been developed by incorporating brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)‐loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (BDNF@MSN) into the thermogel matrix with nimodipine (NMD) (BDNF@MSN‐NMD@Thermogel). The carrier materials (i.e., silica and thermogel) in this nanohybrid do not show any cytotoxicity to human lens epithelial cells and rat retinal precursor cells. This nanohybrid regulates the in vitro release of BDNF and NMD in a sustainable way for weeks. In optic nerve crush rodent models, a single intravitreal injection of BDNF@MSN‐NMD@Thermogel inhibits retinal neuroinflammation, significantly promotes retinal ganglion cells survival and restores visual function for nearly three months. This nanohybrid is thus a promising alternative for effective neuroprotection treatment for neuroinflammation‐related neurodegenerative diseases.",

However, its therapeutic outcomes are largely affected by the photophysical properties of photothermal agents and the responses of cancer cells. To reveal the full potential of PTT, in this work, a photothermal‐derived multimodal synergistic therapy is proposed based on mini‐size AuNR@Cu 2‐ x S (mARC) plasmonic heterostructures. Due to the unique optical properties of mARC nanoparticles, a remarkably high heat conversion efficiency of 62% is achieved under a 1064 nm laser. Quercetin, as a heat shock protein inhibitor, is loaded into the cavity of mARC. Interleukin‐8 (IL‐8) siRNA, which regulates the cell proliferation rate, is attached to mARC via electrostatic interactions. Upon exposure to second near‐infrared light, photothermal heat is generated by mARC to induce cytotoxicity to the cancer cell. Meanwhile, quercetin is released to undermine the thermos‐resistance of cancer cells, and IL‐8 siRNA on the mARC surface escapes from endosomes for IL‐8 gene silencing, resulting in highly enhanced PTT. A small animal model is used to study and evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of mARC in vivo. The proposed therapeutic strategy sheds new light on cancer therapy and provides valuable references for future clinical translation.",

The xenograft animal model is established by using those stable cell lines. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion are evaluated. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting are used to determine the expression levels of target biomarkers.

An elevation of TBX2 is observed in colorectal cancer specimens and TBX2 expression is positively correlated to cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Besides, TBX2 regulates the expressions of biomarkers relevant to epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) and WNT3A signaling pathways. Interestingly, WNT3A also promotes the HCT116 cell proliferation, migration, invasion by the regulation of EMT‐related biomarkers.

    "abstract": "Abstract Uncontrolled proliferation and apoptosis evasion are two hallmarks of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, it is demonstrated that the double over‐expresser of oncoprotein c‐Myc and anti‐apoptotic protein Bcl‐2 is a critical “genetic overdrive” of proliferation and apoptosis evasion in AML and is associated with poor genetic alterations. Double‐knockdown of c‐Myc/ Bcl‐2 synergistically kills AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, a novel oral small molecule combination co‐targeting c‐Myc and Bcl‐2 with WBC100 and Venetoclax (VEN) at low doses are developed. Importantly, the study shows that this combination results in deep and durable remissions of AML, and its efficacy is superior to the frontline combination of Venetoclax and hypomethylation azacitidine (AZA) in AML mouse models and PDX models from relapsed or refractory AML patients. Mechanically, Bcl‐2 knockdown induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and c‐Myc‐knockdown impairs mitochondria biogenesis. Co‐targeting c‐Myc/Bcl‐2 reciprocally abrogates over‐proliferation and apoptosis resistance via forming a double hit to mitochondrial biogenesis and apoptosis machinery. The findings for the first time demonstrate that co‐targeting c‐Myc/Bcl‐2 by the novel oral small molecule combination of WBC100/Venetoclax is a promising and convenient therapy for AML and support its clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Immunotherapeutics, such as bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), have shown promise in cancer therapies, however their efficacy against solid tumors is hindered by transport barriers. Local therapies are being investigated to improve solid tumor immunotherapies and minimize systemic toxicity. Because local therapies bypass the circulatory system, drug properties can be optimized to further enhance local efficacy. Herein, the use of a larger BiTE‐like antibody‐oligomer conjugate is investigated, modular T cell engagers (MoTEs), to extend the duration of activity within local tissue mimics. Specifically, an anti‐CD3 antibody is modified with heterobifunctional ethylene oxide ((EO) 4‐12 ) linkers, which are subsequently modified with cancer targeting ligands (CTLs). The (EO) x molecular weight and CTL grafting densities are optimized to achieve targeted cytotoxicity within in vitro co‐cultures against prostate‐specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive cancer cells. In local tissue models comprised of embedded PSMA positive spheroids in collagen‐hyaluronic acid hydrogels with T cells, it is demonstrated that MoTEs resulted in ≈2.5‐fold greater cytotoxicity toward cancer spheroids than a PSMA targeting BiTE at longer 12‐day timepoints. MoTEsmay therefore prove beneficial for local therapies by extending the duration of action after single‐dose administration and establishing simple synthetic protocols to target various cancer antigens.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Photothermal therapy (PTT) is gaining wide attention in oncological applications. Nevertheless, its efficacy is still being questioned due to the potential deleterious thermal impact on healthy tissues. The comprehension of tissue thermal properties and their role in photothermal heat transfer is critical. In this study, the thermal conductivity of murine mammary gland (MG) tissues (both tumorous and normal) is initially characterized as a function of time post‐tumor cell inoculation. Notably, the tumorous MGs exhibit a mean thermal conductivity of 0.41 ± 0.013 W m −1 K −1 , a 28% increase compared to the normal tissue (0.32 ± 0.003 W m −1 K −1 ). A self‐developed ultra‐fast hot‐wire technique is employed to assess the marginal temperature elevation in thin MG samples. These experimental findings suggest that the thermal conductivity escalates as the tumor advances. Employing a constant‐power laser, variations in therapeutic outcomes are attributed to the synergistic effect of augmented thermal conductivity and tumoral volume. Importantly, these data substantiate that the early commencement of photothermal irradiation effectively stymies tumor advancement. These insights can foster improved early‐stage PTT by calibrating irradiation schedules contingent on meticulous thermal property assessments, thus optimizing therapeutic results.",

The implant is fabricated by blending and lyophilization technique and eventually cross‐linked using glutaraldehyde. The implant is characterized by attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and compressive strength. A sustained release of diosgenin occurs over a period of 28 days. The osteogenic activity is analyzed by alkaline phosphatase activity and alizarin red S staining; that aid in determining the extent of biomineralization. The results also demonstrate that LGD 100 implant stimulates the expression of genes associated with osteoblastic activities in MG‐63 cells, namely type I collagen, osteocalcin, and osteopontin. The bone regeneration capacity of diosgenin‐loaded gelatin‐based LDH implant is then tested by creating critical bone defects in the tibia of rabbits by using empty bone defects as controls. Periodic radiographs are taken which show promising results. Histological and immunohistochemical staining confirm that after treatment with LGD 100 , new bone is formed at the defect site. This study suggests that LGD 100 implant aids in faster bone formation as it mimics the natural properties of bone.",

Here, 3D centrifugation‐enabled priming of T cell immune‐synapse junctions is performed to generate tight T cell–Dynabead aggregates at a rate 200‐fold faster than that of conventional 24‐h bulk shaking. Furthermore, by forming T cell–Dynabead aggregates in the starting culture, two‐ to sixfold greater T cell expansion is achieved over conventional T cell expansion for cancer patient‐derived primary T cells while limiting over‐activation. Creating 3D T cell–Dynabead aggregates as the “booster” material enables highly efficient polyclonal T cell expansion without the need for complex surface modification of artificial antigen‐presenting cells (APCs).

    "abstract": "Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common joint disorders in western populations, affecting millions of people worldwide and with a rising incidence as life expectancy continues to increase. Current therapies for OA management fail to halt the progressive degradation of articular cartilage, urging the need for more effective therapies to improve cartilage function and enhance patient's quality of life. Through phage display technology, biopanning on a population of heterogenous chondrocyte cells isolated from six different OA donors, and using a random 12‐amino acid peptide phage library, a peptide selective for human OA chondrocytes (GFQMISNNVYMR) is identified. A twofold increase in fluorescence intensity is observed for OA chondrocytes, compared to normal chondrocytes, when cells are incubated with the identified peptide conjugated to a fluorescent label, being selectively internalized by OA cells. The identified peptide can be further modified and exploited for developing early diagnostic of OA and/or improve drug delivery to target cells through peptide‐drug conjugates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The utilization of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has received authorization for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) and various other tumor types. However, a large proportion of HNSC patients exhibit unresponsiveness to ICIs. Dickkopf‐1, a secreted protein with pivotal functions in Wnt signaling pathways, is increasingly recognized for its role in modulating anti‐tumor immunity. In this study, the authors employed TCGA and GEO datasets to investigate the correlation between tumoral DKK1 expression and survival outcomes, as well as the suppressive nature of the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME) in HNSC patients. The findings reveal a strong association between elevated DKK1 expression in HNSC tumors and poorer survival rates, along with an immunosuppressive TIME. In vivo studies utilizing subcutaneous tumor graft mouse models demonstrate that knockdown of DKK1 inhibit the growth of HNSC tumor cells in a CD8 + T cell‐dependent manner. Additionally, an inverse relationship between DKK1 expression and CD8 + T cell infiltration and activation is observed, while a positive correlation is observed with infiltration of myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and CD8 + T cell exhaustion. Moreover, combining DKK1 knockdown with neutralizing antibodies against PD‐1 significantly suppress the growth of HNSC cells. Consequently, The study proposes DKK1 as a promising target for immunotherapy to enhance PD‐1 blockade therapy in HNSC. These findings show that DKK1 can thus be regarded as a potential target for immunotherapy and need further study.",

To address these issues, a novel IL‐2 nano‐assembly formulation (nano‐IL‐2) is developed using distearoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphoethanolamine‐ n ‐[methoxy (polyethylene glycol)‐2000] (PEG2000‐DSPE), which is durably stable due to the high binding affinity (10–8 m level) of two components and hardly induces vascular leak or inflamed injury at the injection site. Besides, nano‐IL‐2 exerts excellent solubility, lymph‐targeting property, prolonged and stable serum IL‐2 concentration ranges, and much lower toxicities compared to commercial formulation. Monotherapy of nano‐IL‐2 shows optimal capability to control the growth of murine melanoma and colon cancer. Collectively, the present study provides a novel design strategy for lymph‐targeting IL‐2 formulation which is more suitable for subcutaneous administration with higher safety concern.",

In this study, the role of Family of Sequence Similarity 20, Member C (Fam20C) as a central player in bevacizumab resistant GBM mouse model is investigated. In vivo analyses confirm that Fam20C upregulation accelerates drug resistance and correlates with tumor progression. Proteomic analyses of conditioned media and cell lysates subsequent to Fam20C knockout (KO) in GBM cells reveal the regulatory role of Fam20C in both intracellular and extracellular aspects of epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) and genes associated with AKT signaling. Moreover, In vitro experiments demonstrate that Fam20C activates the AKT signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation. Elevated levels of Fam20C are observed in human GBM, particularly in the mesenchymal subtype, which correlates with diminished survival rates and increased resistance to various drugs, including temozolomide (TMZ), bevacizumab, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, and other antibody‐based drugs. Notably, even in cases of resistance to gefitinib and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) antibodies, Fam20C expression is elevated. These findings highlight the pivotal role of Fam20C in driving drug resistance in GBM, suggesting it as a promising target for combination therapies aimed at surmounting this formidable resistance barrier.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bladder cancer is one of the most common clinical malignant tumors with a high recurrence rate after surgery. To improve the therapeutic effect, intravesical instillation of chemotherapeutic drugs is usually applied after surgery. However, due to the unique microenvironment in the bladder, the drug concentration is usually rapidly reduced with urinary excretion, leading to low accumulation in bladder cancer and poor therapeutic effect. Cellular microvesicles (MVs) have parental cell‐specific characteristics and hold homologous targeting and adhesion abilities to their parent cells, achieving efficient cell uptake in their parent cells. In this study, pirarubicin (THP), a clinically approved intravesical chemotherapeutic drug, is encapsulated into bladder cancer cell‐derived MVs to form THP MVs, which have high targeting and adhesion abilities to bladder cancer and facilitate intravesical therapy of bladder cancer. The results show THP MVs compared with free THP exhibited higher cellular uptake in MB49 bladder cancer cells and cause more significant apoptotic cells. After intravesical instillation into a bladder cancer mouse model, THP MVs can significantly accumulate in bladder cancer tissues, and cause an obvious reduction in bladder weights and volumes, exhibiting promising therapeutic effects. Homologous targeting and adhesion abilities of THP MVs greatly contribute to the intravesical therapy of bladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The extensive use and misuse of antibiotics have resulted in bacterial resistance becoming increasing commonplace. Essential oils (EOs) are known to possess antimicrobial properties and therefore have many potential practical applications. However, the default of hydrophobicity, chemical instability, and volatility limit scope of application. Encapsulation of EOs in colloidal delivery systems can mitigate these challenges and allow for greater efficacy. A homogenous nanoemulsion (HS15‐CE) containing a combination of eucalyptol (Euc) and cefradine (Cef) is developed to explore its synergistic effect on antibacterial activity and potentially reduce the amount of antibiotic required to treat bacterial infections. The HS15‐CE nanoemulsion displays a synergistic effect on the inhibition of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) growth in vitro, significantly decreasing the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by eight times. The ex vivo imaging reveals high accumulation concentrations and long retention in bladders. Moreover, the nanoemulsion alleviates the E. coli induced cystitis infection, as evidenced by decreased bacterial colonies in urine, reduced inflammatory cytokines, and increased expression of tight junctional protein ZO‐1. These findings suggest the potential of the HS15‐CE nanoemulsion in providing a synergistic effect for the treatment of bacterial urocystitis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer‐related death worldwide. Development of novel therapies has focused on new oncogenes and few tumor‐targeted theranostic agents. Recent studies show that the increased oxidative stress that results from abnormal metabolism makes cancer cells more dependent on antioxidant systems, indicating a proper therapeutic target. As a major antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is overexpressed in cancer cells and closely related to carcinogenesis and therapeutic effects. However, there is still a lack of tumor‐targeted agents to effectively inhibit the expression of SOD1. Here, a novel near‐infrared heptamethine cyanine dye, IR‐37, is designed, synthesized, and screened that preferentially accumulates in tumor cells with an intrinsic structure‐inherent targeting property, significantly inhibits the expression of SOD1 and induces excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS)‐mediated apoptosis. IR‐37 also has excellent optical properties, implying its potential application in tumor‐targeted imaging. Moreover, a novel CRC‐related oncogene, positive cofactor 4 (PC4), is identified that is involved in the killing effects of IR‐37 through the SOD1‐ROS‐c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Together, these findings suggest that IR‐37 may be a promising theranostic agent for personalized tumor‐targeted therapy and imaging, and that PC4 is a novel oncogene for the diagnosis and therapy of CRC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study explores biocompatible amino‐functionalized gold nanoparticles (Au‐NH 2 ) as nanotherapeutics for the selective eradication of leukemia cells, elucidates the mechanism of cytotoxicity, and it confirms in vivo efficacy of the engineered nanomaterial. Au‐NH 2 trigger apoptotic cell death of myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells by i) inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, ii) ATP depletion, iii) loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and iv) mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. Au‐NH 2 act selectively on leukemia cells inasmuch as the viability of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages as well as the colony formation of hematopoietic stem cells remain basically unaffected. The selectivity of Au‐NH 2 for AML cells can be attributed to both the preferential accumulation of AuNH 2 in AML cells and the strong dependence of those cells on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production. Importantly, Au‐NH 2 applied either as monotherapy or as a cytarabine combination regimen possess antileukemic efficacy in the absence of adverse events in mice xenografted with primary human AML in vivo. The engineered material may pave the way for a novel nanotherapeutic treatment of AML.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Baculoviruses offer a multitude of advantages over other gene carriers due to their non‐pathogenicity and inability to replicate in mammalian cells, ease of production, and high transduction efficiencies. To expand their functionality in vivo, baculoviruses containing mammalian transcription promoters (BacMam) can be physically entrapped within biocompatible hydrogels to modulate their release and transduction efficiency. The present work demonstrates several techniques in which BacMam viruses can be encapsulated and delivered in fibrin gel, an FDA‐approved sealant and adhesive with numerous clinical applications, to provide spatiotemporal control over the delivery of BacMam viruses to mammalian cells. Fibrin is shown to be an effective biomaterial carrier for the delivery of BacMam viruses to mammalian cells growing in 2D culture, 3D culture, and in the co‐delivery of stem cells and baculoviruses in the aerosolized delivery of fibrin films. Overall, the results of this work provide a valuable insight on the therapeutic potential of fibrin gels for in vivo BacMam‐mediated gene delivery in regenerative medicine.",

Given the intricate mechanisms of action (MOA) and heterogenous distribution in target tissues inherent to cell therapy, it is necessary to develop more sophisticated, unbiased approaches to evaluate the distribution of administered cells and the molecular changes at a microscopic level. This study introduces a label‐free approach for assessing the tissue distribution of administered human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and their MOA, leveraging spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) analysis. The hMSCs are introduced into a mouse model with lung fibrosis, followed by the manipulation of ST to visualize the spatial distribution of hMSCs within the tissue. This is achieved by capitalizing on interspecies transcript differences between humans and mice. Furthermore, the method allowed for the examination of molecular changes associated with the spatial distribution of hMSCs. Therefore, this method has the potential to serve as an effective tool for various cell‐based therapeutic agents.",

However, significant problems remain, such as systemic toxicity from chemotherapy and fibrosis that causes capsular contracture. Here, the development of a silicone implant coated with an alginate gel containing antisolvent‐crystallized paclitaxel (acPTX) is reported. By antisolvent crystallization, the compact formulation of acPTX ensures slow release for long‐term breast cancer recurrence prevention. The mixture of acPTX and the biodegradable alginate gel, which reduces fibrosis, is uniformly coated onto the silicone implant using 3D printed implant‐specific molds based on the shape obtained from 3D scanning. In a breast cancer recurrence mouse model, silicone implants coated with acPTX gel show a long‐term preventive effect compared to gel‐coated implants with commercially available PTX. Furthermore, animal studies using C57BL/6 mice show that alginate‐gel‐coated implants significantly reduce capsule thickness, collagen density, and the number of fibrosis‐related cells around the implant compared to silicone implants. The developed acPTX‐gel‐coated implant presents a promising approach for breast reconstruction in mastectomized breast cancer patients. It provides a novel platform for developing implants with long‐term drug release properties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has achieved great progress in cancer treatment because it generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a noninvasive manner. Nonetheless, the majority of light‐sensitive photosensitizers (PSs) are only sensitive to UV or visible light, suffering limitations such as phototoxicity (UV) and low tissue penetration capabilities (UV–visible). What is more, another impact factor, namely the hypoxic environment within a tumor always inhibits the production of ROS for treatment efficacy. To overcome these problems, herein, one new type‐I PS containing selenium (Se6) is designed. Benefiting from the dual heavy atom effects of selenium and bromine, Se6 can produce short‐lived hydroxyl ( • OH) and long‐lived superoxide anion (O 2 •− ) under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, which is superior to commonly used oxygen‐dependent type‐II PSs, such as chlorine e6, zinc phthalocyanine. Combining Se6 and upconversion nanoparticles with the ability to upconvert near‐infrared (NIR) light to UV–visible light can greatly overcome the tissue penetration depth, phototoxicity, and oxygen‐dependent limitation of the PDT process, which demonstrates a significant performance in vivo to achieve better therapy efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A disposable daughter plate is developed for robotic organoid‐based high‐throughput screening (HTS). Previously, daughter drug plates are prepared using mother drug plates in conventional HTS. During each screening, the mother drug plate is thawed, a certain amount of the drug is transferred to the daughter plate, and frozen again. Drug manufacturing involves drug transfer processes that may result in drug damage owing to redissolution. Thus, disposable daughter plates are created by dispensing small drug spots into the well plates and freezing them. The cells at the Matrigel dorms of the pillar plate are easily exposed to the drugs by immersing the pillars. Unlike previously reported similar methods, it is verified that HTS‐based drug response analysis is possible by applying the proposed disposable daughter plate to breast cancer patient‐derived organoids (PDOs). And it is also verified the long‐term stability of disposable daughter plates (up to 3 months) in 3D cell culture system using patient‐derived cells (PDO). The drug response results are quantified using normalized area under curve values, while the experimental reproducibility of the disposable daughter plates is evaluated using the coefficient of variation and a simple linear regression test. Thus, the proposed disposable daughter plate allows reproducible drug efficacy analysis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As an essential mineral element for the human body, copper (Cu) is necessary for various physiological functions. Excess or deficiency of copper causes cytotoxicity and damages the body. Thus, strict regulatory mechanisms are required to maintain copper homeostasis. Copper correlates closely with many forms of cell death. A recent study found that copper‐dependent cell death, known as cuproptosis, is different from all other known forms of cell death. This discovery helps us further understand the role of copper in cytotoxicity. Copper dysregulation occurs in a variety of malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which is the eighth most common malignancy worldwide. This may increase the risk of HNSCC from a population perspective. Further exploring molecular mechanisms of copper in HNSCC will contribute to provide new therapeutic opportunities. Here, the physiological metabolism and functions of copper, as well as copper‐related cell death, are reviewed. The study focuses on the research advances of copper in HNSCC, including the epidemiology and molecular mechanisms, as well as therapeutic strategies targeting copper homeostasis.",

An oxygen‐glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model is used to treat SH‐SY5Y cells in vitro, and an I/R injury model is constructed by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice. Human plasma‐derived EVs are extracted by size exclusion chromatography. Western blot, Immunofluorescence Staining, and 2,3,5‐Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride (TTC) Staining are employed to observe the effects of EVs on the neuroinflammatory response and infarct volumes in tMCAO mice, while TUNEL Staining, Flow Cytometry, and Western Blot are employed to assess cell apoptosis. Human plasma‐derived EVs alleviated apoptosis in SH‐SY5Y cells under OGD/R stress and exerted a protective effect against brain I/R injury in tMCAO mice. Mechanistically, EVs protected against cerebral I/R injury via HSP27 phosphorylation, and the HSP27 phosphorylation inhibitor KRIBB3 attenuated the anti‐apoptotic effects of EVs. Human plasma‐derived EVs activated the phosphorylation of HSP27, thereby inhibiting cell apoptosis and protecting against cerebral I/R injury.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are crucial mediators of cell‐to‐cell communication and contain biological components such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. EVs are studied for their crucial immunomodulatory roles, particularly in natural killer (NK) cells. NK vesicles, which share surface markers and biological components with the parental NK cells, are developed as anti‐cancer agents. However, their clinical application is hindered by their low productivity and an incomplete understanding of their functional mechanisms. In this study, EV‐mimicking vesicles are artificially induced from NK cells by cytochalasin B treatment. These cytochalasin B‐induced membrane vesicles (CIMVs) are 1.21‐fold more concentrated than isolated natural EVs from NK cells (NK‐EVs) and contain 1.66‐fold more proteins, including those with immunological activity against tumors. The induced ARF6‐positive microvesicles possess an immunological phenotype similar to that of the parental cells, while perforin, granzyme, and FasL proteins are more abundant compared to NK‐EVs. Administrating NK‐EVs and CIMVs to K562 and MCF‐7 tumor cells induces caspase‐dependent apoptosis, which leads to tumor cell cytotoxicity. These results significantly contribute to the understanding of the role of NK vesicles in cellular communication and immunity, and highlight the therapeutic potential of engineered NK‐EVs via their specific action on tumor cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bladder cancer (BC) is a prevalent urological tumor with high recurrence rates, requiring long‐term monitoring. Although cystoscopy is the primary diagnostic method, its invasiveness and cost hinder routine screening and follow‐up. This study aimed to develop a novel diagnostic tool utilizing newly developed on‐chip heating dPCR platform, which features integrated and rapid temperature control capabilities, for non‐invasive BC detection. The dPCR platform is improved by integrating a multi‐color detection system, enabling precise quantification of mutant allelic fraction (MAF) of TERT promoter mutations with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.29%. Diagnostic performance is enhanced by integrating the NRN1 methylation biomarker and employing machine learning to optimize biomarker weighting. Testing the model on urine samples from controls ( n = 35) and BC patients ( n = 41) yielded a sensitivity of 0.92, specificity of 0.94, and an AUC of 0.98, surpassing conventional cytology in sensitivity while maintaining comparable specificity. Furthermore, the model effectively differentiated between normal controls and different stages, achieving accuracies of 0.92, 0.71, and 0.79 for NC, stage I, and stage II+ respectively. These findings suggest the proposed dPCR assays could serve as a sensitive and non‐invasive approach for BC detection in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Traditional approaches for treating wound infections often involve the use of chitosan or hyaluronic acid as carriers for antibacterial agents. In contrast, an innovative method is devised for wound infection management that synergizes photodynamic therapy (PDT) with novel functional matrix materials. This new strategy offers multiple benefits, such as reduced secondary damage to the wound area, a multifaceted antibacterial mechanism, and enhanced moisturization and biocompatibility. The method employs a novel organic semiconductor nanoparticle (OSN) capable of mediating PDT, which is integrated with silk fibroin (SF), perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA), and agar. Silk fibroin is demonstrated to effectively induce macrophage aggregation, while PDT can further activate these immune cells. The inclusion of PFSA bestows the hydrogel with moisturizing and porous characteristics. Both in vivo and in vitro antibacterial assays confirm the efficacy of PDT in eliminating bacteria, and mouse wound infection model studies show that the hydrogels significantly enhance wound healing and hair follicle regeneration. This novel hydrogel dressing holds promise as an advanced wound care solution, with substantial potential for promoting hair follicle regeneration and providing effective sterilization.",

However, the understanding of RNF217 in ovarian cancer progression remains limited. The relative expression of RNF217 is screened in ovarian cancer using the GEPIA database and calculated its correlation with MKI67, CCNB1, and CDK4. OVCAR‐3 and SK‐OV‐3 cells are transfected with RNF217 ‐overexpression plasmids. Cell‐counting kit‐8 assay is utilized to assess proliferation. Immunoprecipitation is performed to reveal the interaction between RNF217 and HAX‐1, and a cycloheximide chase assay is performed to analyze HAX‐1 degradation. The GEPIA database indicated down‐regulated expression of RNF217 in ovarian cancer, negatively correlated with MKI67 (R = ‐0.26, P = 1.8e‐09), CCNB1 (R = ‐0.37, P = 3.2e‐18), and CDK4 expression (R = ‐0.24, P = 3.4e‐08). RNF217 overexpression down‐regulated the relative expression of MKI67 , CCNB1 , and CDK4 in OVCAR‐3 and SK‐OV‐3 cells, resulting in diminished proliferation. In vivo studies using OVCAR‐3 and SK‐OV‐3 cell line‐derived xenograft models also showed that RNF217 overexpression reduced ovarian cancer volume and weight. Furthermore, RNF217 overexpression in SK‐OV‐3 cells inhibited the protein expression of HAX1 by reducing its stability. In conclusion, RNF217 inhibits ovarian cancer progression by down‐regulating HS‐1‐associated protein X‐1 expression.",

This study aims to develop a targeted delivery system for the controlled release of anti‐scarring drugs during the scar formation stage. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) coated with Clathrin, a cage‐like protein, to prevent premature drug release is developed. Insulin‐like growth factor (IGF) is conjugated to the SLNs for targeted delivery via its affinity for connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a protein overexpressed during scar formation. The IGF‐Clathrin‐SLNs exhibited a size of 300 ± 20 nm and a zeta potential of 9.23 ± 0.4 mV. In vitro studies demonstrated sustained release of the encapsulated drug‐ kynurenic acid; less than 10% of kynurenic acid is released within three days, while over 50% is released within 10 h upon Clathrin removal using a surfactant at pH 8. Cellular uptake studies confirmed targeting efficacy. Fibroblasts with low CTGF expression displayed low uptake (&lt;10%), whereas MCF7 cells with high CTGF expression showed significantly higher uptake (80%).

Recently, therapies targeting the gut microbiome have garnered attention for metabolic health regulation. This study evaluates the potential of inulin‐coated medium‐chain triglyceride (InuMCT) microcapsules in rats with diet‐induced obesity (DIO). Inulin prebiotic fibers have been shown to promote the gut microbiome, while the digestion products of medium chain triglycerides (MCTs), free fatty acids, and mono‐/diglycerides, can attenuate pro‐inflammatory outcomes. It is hypothesized that encapsulating MCTs within inulin via spray drying creates a solid dosage form that can exert multifunctional effects in ameliorating inflammation in DIO. Inulin and InuMCT treatments not only reduce DIO weight gain but also improve metabolic markers in high‐fat diet (HFD) fed rats. Specifically, inulin attenuates the reduction of high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) by 55% and lowers glucose levels by 21%. Meanwhile, InuMCT increases HDL by 23% and reduces glucose levels by 15%. Furthermore, inulin decreases serum proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) by 35%, while InuMCT further reduces TNF‐α to normal diet levels within 21 days. These results highlight InuMCT's superior efficacy, offering a promising strategy for combating obesity and related metabolic diseases.",

Over the years, there's been a significant increase in developing potential cytotoxic drugs. However, little progress has been made in enhancing patients' quality of life. The therapeutic index is limited due to the drug's poor solubility and lack of selectivity. Various carriers have been explored for drug delivery to enhance efficacy. Yet, there's a gap for a versatile delivery system that can adjust to specific drug and application requirements. Here, a multifaceted drug delivery platform based on a genetically engineered nature‐inspired polymer, elastin‐like polypeptide (ELP) is introduced. This technology enables the customization of the polymeric vehicle's physicochemical characteristics to suit the needs of a specific drug and application. The review highlights ELP's advantages in cancer targeting, such as site‐specificity, controlled release, biocompatibility, and extended plasma circulation. For the first time, ELP‐based drug delivery into passive and active targeting for better comprehension of its adaptability is classified. Moreover, numerous opportunities for loading different types of drugs onto the polymer are outlined. Finally, the polymer's efficacy in delivery across multiple cancer types, underscoring the wide spectrum of ELP‐based cancer drug delivery is precisely described.",

    "abstract": "Abstract MicroRNAs (miRs) play a critical role in modulating gene expression across biological processes, including cardiac aging and disease. As such, miRs have demonstrated therapeutic potential in several cardiac conditions. Efficient delivery of miR therapies to cardiac tissue is crucial for effective gene therapy and DNA‐based nanocarriers (DNCs), based on Watson‐Crick‐Franklin highly specific base‐pair recognition, have emerged as a promising, biocompatible alternative to viral‐based methods. Here, DNCs designed to modulate miR levels as a potential treatment for cardiac dysfunction are presented. Specifically, the DNCs target miR‐24‐2, which inhibits SERCA2 gene. In humans, the reduction of SERCA2 activity is a hallmark of heart failure and is altered in cardiac aging. The assembled DNCs bearing anti‐miR‐24‐2‐5p sequences effectively restore intracellular levels of SERCA2 in a HEK293 cell model. The DNCs proper assembly is thoroughly verified, while their stability and miR‐capture ability are demonstrated in vitro. The DNCs exhibit successful internalization into HEK293 and modest uptake into human cardiomyocytes. SERCA2 restoration by DNCs is significantly influenced by the miR‐capture sequence layout, underscoring the importance of precise design for optimal biological outcomes. This study highlights the potential of DNCs in cardiac therapies, a previously unexplored avenue for addressing cardiac dysfunction.",

Compared to conventional cancer treatments, SDT has no adverse side effects, has been shown to radically reduce tumor volume, and has the potential to raise antitumor immune response. Ever‐increasing studies have demonstrated that nanotechnology can significantly enhance the efficacy of SDT against certain cancers and improve its therapeutic effects. Nanosystems are developed that can improve the intratumoral delivery and cellular uptake of sensitizers, can reduce intrinsic cancer defenses against ROS, can act synergistically for the production of ROS and can tackle cancer immune tolerance. In this review, the various strategies to enhance SDT performance with the assistance of nanotechnology, and the outstanding research outcomes, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Gaucher Disease (GD) is a well‐known lysosomal storage disease resulting from mutations in the GBA1 gene. GD exhibits a range of clinical manifestations, each with unique symptoms and severity levels. This review explores the genetic foundations of GD, highlighting the significance of Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) deficiency, resulting in the skeletal complications associated with GD, such as osteonecrosis, fractures, and bone pain, all of which significantly negatively influence the quality of life for patients. Over 700 mutations in the GBA1 gene are found to cause variations in gene expression in GD, indicating the disease's complexity and the need for continued research. Early diagnosis and prognosis evaluation depend heavily on diagnostic approaches integrating laboratory assessments, genetic testing, and clinical symptoms. Treatment strategies like enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT) have advanced, but issues like high costs and invasiveness still exist. This review focuses on novel therapeutic approaches that show promise in treating GD, including gene and cell‐based therapies, pharmacological chaperone therapy (PCT), and drug delivery via nanoparticles. Finally, discussions on current clinical trials, limitations of the advanced therapies, and future scope are summarized.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The bacterial pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), remains a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. Due to the complexity of the infection, the limited efficacy of antibiotics, and the increasing incidence of multi‐drug resistant strains, novel therapeutics are urgently needed. An interesting new approach is to combine antibiotics with treatments that boost the natural ability of host cells to kill the bacteria, so‐called host‐directed therapeutics (HDT). Until now, this approach has not been explored in the context of nanoparticle drug delivery, which may offer several advantages. Here, the HDT drug everolimus and the antibiotic (( S )‐2‐nitro‐6‐((5‐((4‐(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)ethynyl)pyridin‐2‐yl)methoxy)‐6,7‐dihydro‐5 H ‐imidazo[2,1‐ b ][1,3]oxazine, drug D) are focused on. Both of these agents, drug D and everolimus, are encapsulated into one single micelle (PeptoMicelles), resulting in formulation C, and compared with micelles containing only drug D (formulation A) or everolimus (formulation B). They are tested in Mtb‐ infected primary macrophages and THP‐1 cells, and in the zebrafish model for TB ( Mm infection) using embryo survival analysis. The results show that formulation C, containing drug D and everolimus in one micelle, is significantly more efficient in protecting cells and zebrafish embryos against infection than all other formulations, indicating an improved therapeutic efficacy of HDTs and antibiotics in a single polymeric micelle.",

We optimized primary metastatic colorectal tumor processing and 3D (3‐dimensional) bioprinted tumors to prove efficacy as long‐term screening systems. Normally, this time period would use animals, but we show it is possible to gain useful data in vitro before preclinical stages, to reduce animal modeling and give better clinical trial predictions. Liver tumors were collected from 12 colorectal cancer patients, evaluated for expansion, 3D bioprinted, and tested for ability to create long‐term organoid models with screening of oncolytic viral‐loaded FCU1 enzyme conversion of 5‐fluorocytosine (5‐FC) into the highly toxic 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU). Donated tumor size was the limiting factor. 75% of patients could be used for screening of viral delivery. Response between patients was overall positive, with good secondary tumor development, outer active cellular content and inner necrotic core. Oncolytic challenge shows good screening potential and cellular targeting, demonstrating an added bystander effect, optimizing the low‐dose. Stable long‐term metastatic organoid models were made, lasting many months, with potential for retesting rather than one‐off analysis. Oncolytic virus‐delivered chemotherapy is promising and warrants further investigation for metastatic colorectal cancers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Impaired bladder compliance secondary to congenital or acquired bladder dysfunction can lead to irreversible kidney damage. This is managed with surgical augmentation utilizing intestinal tissue, which can cause stone formation, infections, and malignant transformation. Co‐seeded bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)/CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell (HSPC) scaffolds (PRS) have been successful in regenerating bladder tissue. However, the acquisition of viable cells is challenging in the clinical setting. Here, the regenerative capacity of human MSC/CD34+ co‐cultured total condition media (TCM) is compared to media alone in immune‐competent rats augmented with PRS following partial cystectomy. Augmented bladders are instilled with media (control, n = 4) or TCM ( n = 5) twice a week for 4 weeks. Regenerated tissue is analyzed for smooth muscle, urothelium, vascular, and peripheral nerve regrowth. Urodynamic (UDS) measures are performed pre‐ and 4 weeks post‐augmentation. The results demonstrate that TCM‐instilled grafts have greater muscle content, larger average urothelial widths, higher percent vascularization, and more robust neural infiltration post‐augmentation. UDS demonstrates greater percent bladder recovery in the TCM group, indicating functional improvement in bladder storage capacity. This study is the first to propose the use of cell‐free TCM as an alternative to traditional cell‐seeded scaffolds to promote bladder tissue regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lung cancer (LC) is a leading cause of cancer‐related deathworldwide, and altered cholesterol metabolism is a hallmark of cancer cells. Acyl‐CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1(ACAT1), or Sterol O‐acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1), isa key cholesterol esterification enzyme. Its overexpression promotes tumorprogression by accumulating cholesterol esters. Inhibition of ACAT1 also potentiatesCD8+ T cells medicated anti‐tumor immunity by increasing plasma membranecholesterol level. This study, as the first of its kind, shows the ACAT1/SOAT1 overexpressioncorrelates with poor prognosis in early‐stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients.Long‐term treatment with ACAT1 inhibitor avasimibe suppresses tumorigenesis inboth Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and epidermal growthfactor receptor (EGFR) mutation‐induced LC mouse models without overttoxicity. ACAT1 inhibition reduces tumor cell proliferation, migration, andinvasion and causes G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, while boosting CD8+ T cells'effector function and memory phenotype. Single‐cell RNA sequencing reveals thatACAT1 inhibition downregulates cholesterol biosynthesis and central carbon andnitrogen metabolism pathways in tumor cells, while upregulating genes relatedto oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation in CD8+ T cells. Finally, avasimibe improves the efficacy of a human EGFR vaccine in preventing LCprogression. These novel findings suggest potential strategies for cancer preventionand therapy.",

    "abstract": "As we are entering our third year of publication, it is time to review what has happened in year 2 of Advanced Therapeutics and what next steps are planned. In our second volume, we've continued our successful series of monthly issues since the launch of the journal in May 2018, thus resulting in 12 more issues with loads of top-level original research articles, high-quality Reviews and Progress Reports, including interesting and often colorful designs on the front cover, as can be seen in Figure 1. We are very pleased to let you know that we have now received confirmation that Advanced Therapeutics has been accepted into the Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI, Clarivate Analytics), such that you will be able to discover all of this content easily through the Web of Science soon. In the first quarter of 2019 we created an online collection with our best articles published to date. The Advanced Therapeutics Editors’ Choice collection shows the full diversity of the different topics that we cover in the journal: from microrobots for drug delivery to an artificial intelligence-driven drug delivery platform (CURATE.AI) and drug nanorods for leukemia treatment. The collection can be accessed here and articles are free to read for a limited time. The high quality of these articles is highlighted by close to 100 accumulated citations in Crossref. We hope you enjoy reading these papers and we encourage you to come back as we plan to update this online collection on a regular basis. Many of these papers can also be found in the top-10 most read papers in the journal in 2019 (see Table 1). Adv. Therap. 2019, 2, 1800064 DOI: 10.1002/adtp.201800064 Adv.

In this regard, we would like to congratulate the authors listed in Table 2, whose articles appearing in Advanced Therapeutics in 2019 have gained a lot of traction in many news outlets as well as on social media. Adv. Therap. 2019, 2, 1900133 DOI: 10.1002/adtp.201900133 Adv. Therap. 2019, 2, 1900023 DOI: 10.1002/adtp.201900023 Adv. Therap. 2019, 2, 1900066 DOI: 10.1002/adtp.201900066 An international, interdisciplinary journal can only flourish if its authorship is as diverse as possible. Therefore, we strive to have a globally balanced distribution of authors. Figure 2 shows a geographic visualization of where the corresponding authors of all published articles are based. Top countries are the United States, China, Germany, Australia, and South Korea, followed by Canada and the United Kingdom. From the editorial perspective, the journal has seen a change at the reigns in 2019 – Lorna Stimson has moved to a new role at Wiley-VCH as Publishing Director, Germany. As a result, Christine Mayer has agreed to take over the role of Editor-in-Chief of Advanced Therapeutics. Chris received her PhD in microbiology and biochemistry from the University Innsbruck – Faculty of Medical Chemistry & Biochemistry. In 1997–2001, she worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the area of protein engineering, followed by a second postdoctoral position at the DKFZ in Heidelberg (Germany), where she focused on the analysis of translational cancer drugs and epigenetics. After leaving academia, Chris joined Wiley in 2009. Looking forward to the new year, early 2020 we will be publishing two special issues on “Nanomedicine: Therapeutic Applications”, guest-edited by Xue Xue (Nankai University, Tianjin, China) and Xing-Jie Liang (National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing, China), and on “Artificial Intelligence for Precision Medicine and Digital Health”, guest-edited by one of our Editorial Advisory Board members, Dean Ho (National University of Singapore). Watch this space! Open Access publication is becoming ever more important. A landmark agreement was signed in January 2019 between Wiley and Projekt DEAL which provides Open Access publication in and read access to most of Wiley's journals to a vast majority of German academic institutions. Advanced Therapeutics, together with the other journals in the Advanced family, is covered by this agreement. It allows corresponding authors based at these German institutions to publish their articles in our journal under an Open Access license, while costs are covered by their institutions under this agreement. Learn more about the agreement with Projekt DEAL here and find out if your institution is a participant in this or other national Open Access programs at Wiley here. In the academic community there is also an increased interest for researchers to share and archive their data, with many funders now mandating data publication. The sharing of data enables others to re-use experimental results and supports the creation of new work built on previous findings, improving the efficiencies of the research process and supporting the critical goals of transparency and reproducibility. In Advanced Therapeutics, we encourage supporting the growing movement to make research more open, because this leads to a fairer, more efficient, and accountable research landscape, which will ultimately drive a more effective and faster pace of discovery. We are committed to improving openness, transparency, and reproducibility of research. Peer review is at the core of the academic publication culture. It is fitting to acknowledge reviewers who give their expertise and time freely to support our journals in this process. The top reviewers for Advanced Therapeutics in 2019 are (in alphabetical order): Eric Andrew Appel, James Henderson, Ulrich Lächelt, Daniel Siegwart, Qiangbin Wang, Xuehai Yan, Alexander N. Zelikin, and Liangfang Zhang. In this context, we are happy to announce that Advanced Therapeutics now offers the option to have your activities as a reviewer recorded on your ORCID profile. To receive credit for your review, please opt in to this feature when you submit your reviewer report to the editorial office. In order to not disclose the identity of the reviewers, ORCID will not reveal any details on individual manuscripts. In addition, posting of recognition to ORCID will be delayed in order to mask the exact date on which the review was completed. Of course, we would also like to express our gratitude for your interest in Advanced Therapeutics, as our authors, our Editorial Advisory Board members, and – last but not least – our readers. We wish you a peaceful, joyful, successful, and healthy new year 2020! The editorial team of Advanced Therapeutics",

Here it is reported that a variety of 3D ECM microenvironments strongly induce expression of Id1 and Id3 in melanoma cells. Genetic ablation of Id1/Id3 impairs melanoma cell outgrowth in 3D Matrigel culture and inhibits melanoma initiation in vivo. Mechanistically, 3D ECM microenvironments hinder diffusion of endogenously produced bone morphogenetic proteins, thereby fostering autocrine signaling and Id1/Id3 expression. A compound screen identifies new coumarin derivatives that potently inhibit both Id1/Id3 expression and melanoma initiation in vivo. Together, the findings reveal a novel mechanism through which the ECM increases tumorigenicity, identify Id1/Id3 as melanoma‐relevant therapeutic targets, and characterize inhibitors of Id1/Id3 expression with therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can interfere with synergistic host defenses, thus escaping from immune surveillance. Herein, a new immunotherapy strategy‐simulating complement therapy is proposed. Two artificial effectors, Tat cell penetrating peptide and wheat germ agglutinin, are utilized to develop a multifunctional complement‐mimic liposome (CML) simultaneously delivering antibiotics and orchestrating the complement system with macrophages. The CML successfully simulates the functions of the complement system, including formation of a membrane attack complex, mediation of opsonophagocytosis, and activation of phagocytes. At infection sites, CMLs are able to recognize MRSA and disrupt bacterial permeation barriers (cell walls and cell membranes). Meanwhile, CMLs attached to the surface of MRSA are able to activate the phagocytosis and immune responses of macrophages. As a result, CMLs significantly increased the bacterial activity of clarithromycin both in vitro and in macrophages. Moreover, CMLs effectively reduced the MRSA burden in three infection models, including skin abscesses, pneumonia, and bacteremia mouse models. Therefore, the CML provides a novel strategy for overcoming bacterial immune evasion and sheds light on the development of immunotherapies for infectious diseases.",

Radio‐opaque Perfluorooctyl bromide‐loaded PEGylated cholesteryl‐functionalized polycaprolactone (PEG‐ b ‐PCL(Ch)) nanocapsules (PFOB NC) are assessed as imaging probes via X‐ray Computed Tomography (CT) as means to estimate nanoparticle disposition in solid tumors. This imaging platform can enable precision medicine by screening tumors for likelihood of nanoparticle accumulation prior to treatment. Single‐ and double‐lateral xenograft models are employed for imaging‐based nanoparticle accumulation assessment using a preclinical multimodal imaging system. Differences in tumor accumulation and spatial distribution are verified as a function of xenograft type via X‐ray CT and further corroborated by optical imaging. Slow growing OVCAR‐8 xenografts display granular distribution pattern and higher levels of PFOB NC disposition on a volume‐normalized basis. A549 xenografts, displaying faster growth, are less susceptible to PFOB NC accumulation and show only a diffuse‐like spatial distribution of the nanocapsule contrast. A direct correlation between tumor dispositions of PFOB NC and a commercial PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin formulation is found. This study highlights the potential of using nanoparticle‐based radio‐opaque contrasts to better understand nanoparticle disposition and foster improved therapeutic outcomes in cancer nanomedicine.",

The aim of this study is to identify CC antigens that may potentially be used for the development of anti‐CC mRNA vaccines and to select suitable patients for vaccination. Immune subtypes are identified by consensus clustering analysis, and the visualization of the CC immune landscape is performed by graph‐learning‐based dimensionality reduction. Plot cell trajectory and the WGCNA are applied to resolve the heterogeneity of the population suitable for vaccination. Four tumor antigens, COQ2, BGN, CASP6, and FAP, which are related to prognosis and infiltration of antigen‐presenting cells, are identified in CC. CC patients are divided into four immune subtypes characterized by differential molecular, cellular, pathological, and clinical features. Group B has the characteristics of immunologically “cold” tumors, and the immunosuppressive phenotype has worse survival than other groups. Moreover, different immune subtype tumors differed in the expression of immune checkpoints and immunogenic cell death modulators. Last, immune cell components in individual patients are revealed by the immune landscape. COQ2, BGN, CASP6, and FAP are potential antigens for use in a CC‐mRNA vaccine and suitable for patients in Group B.",

Three studies focused on in vitro host‐scaffold interaction with synthesized, recellularized grafts (2) and decellularized extracellular matrix scaffolds (1). Another three studies investigated evaluation tools for decellularization efficacy. Among all studies, recellularization is performed in both decellularization‐based (4) and de novo generated scaffolds (4). De novo constructed biocomposites as well as decellularized and recellularized scaffolds induced pro‐regenerative remodeling and recovery of diaphragmatic function in all examined animal models. Potential therapeutic applications comprise substance defects requiring patch repair, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and functional diseases demanding an entire organ transplant, like muscular dystrophies or dysfunction after prolonged artificial respiration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), a gaseous signaling molecule, is excessively produced in disease lesions like lung tumors and colorectal tumors. H 2 S is used as a trigger for stimuli‐responsive drug delivery in cancer therapies, which enables controlled release of chemotherapeutics and improves their biocompatibility and efficacy. Herein, a H 2 S‐responsive small‐molecule nanocarrier is developed based on the self‐assembly of a trigonal molecule, tris (azido benzyl)‐tri(2‐aminoethyl) amine (ATAEA). ATAEA with three H 2 S‐responsive azido benzyl groups can self‐assemble into nanocarriers (ATNPs) and encapsulate hydrophobic doxorubicin (DOX) to form drug‐loaded nanoparticles (DOX/ATNPs). H 2 S induces the reduction of azido benzyl group and 1,6‐elimination, which results in the dissociation of the ATAEA molecules and the nanoparticles. In HCT116 colon cancer cells, efficient H 2 S‐responsive DOX release from DOX/ATNPs is observed. In vivo administration of DOX/ATNPs in colon tumor‐bearing mice leads to higher drug accumulation in tumors and evident tumor growth inhibition, in comparison with non‐responsive nanoparticles. This work provides a new strategy to develop H 2 S‐responsive drug delivery systems for precise drug delivery to H 2 S‐enriched disease lesions.",

In this study, a new M13 phage‐based oncolytic virus is constructed that carried the RGD peptides to target tumor cells and the 3C gene of Seneca Valley virus (SVV) preceded by a eukaryotic initial transcriptional region (ITR) to transcribe an oncolytic protein to kill tumor cells. Recombinant virus particles of 1200 nm in length are obtained in large quantities by transfecting the recombinant M13 phage plasmid into the host BL2738 and are investigated in vitro in tumor cells and in vivo in tumor‐bearing mice to evaluate their antitumor effect. The experiments using Hela cells confirm that the engineered M13 phage can target and enter Hela cells, and express the SVV 3C protein, resulting in apoptosis of target cells by upregulating the expression of caspase 3. Furthermore, the results of experiments in vivo also show that the recombinant phage significantly inhibits the enhanced tumor volume in nude mice compared to the control groups. The M13 phage may be engineered to fuse with a variety of oncolytic proteins to inhibit the growth of tumor cells in the future, providing a promising phage‐based targeted oncolytic reagent.",

In this study, NGLY1-deficient, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were differentiated into motoneurons (MNs) to identify disease phenotypes analogous to clinical disease pathology with significant deficits apparent in the NGLY1-deficient lines compared to the control. A neuromuscular junction (NMJ) model was developed using patient and wild type (WT) MNs to study functional differences between healthy and diseased NMJs. Reduced axon length, increased and shortened axon branches, MN action potential (AP) bursting and decreased AP firing rate and amplitude were observed in the NGLY1-deficient MNs in monoculture. When transitioned to the NMJ-coculture system, deficits in NMJ number, stability, failure rate, and synchronicity with indirect skeletal muscle (SkM) stimulation were observed. This project establishes a phenotypic NGLY1 model for investigation of possible therapeutics and investigations into mechanistic deficits in the system.",

Here thermoresponsive polymer elastin‐like polypeptides (ELPs) are utilized to crosslink with AAV serotypes 2, 8, and 9 and polyplex AAV vectors are formed by creating a shield of nonviral polymer around them in nanoscale. Neutralizing antibody (NAb) assays are performed which reveal that ELP‐AAV nanoparticles significantly improve expression at high NAb titers for AAV 2 and 9. The ELP‐AAV nanoparticles are stable for an extended period in neutralizing serum and ELP appears to follow the AAV capsid during uncoating and degradation. No toxicity is found after subretinal, intramuscular, and retro‐orbital injections of ELP‐AAV. After passive transfer of human NAbs in vivo, ELP‐AAV significantly increases transduction at a low systemic AAV dose (10 12 vg kg −1 ) in mice compared to free AAV. In an in vivo readministration paradigm, ELP‐AAV significantly improves the reporter gene expression compared to free AAV and does not change the AAV tropism.

However, how they exit from one cell and re-enter into neighboring ones (termed intercellular exchange) remains poorly understood. We previously developed cellular assays that exclusively quantify the intercellular exchange of NPs",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pancreatic islet transplantation is an effective strategy for restoring glucose regulation for highly selected patients with type 1 diabetes. However, an undesirable level of islet cell death is caused by oxidative stress that occurs during islet isolation, culture, and transplantation. The loss of islets throughout the transplantation procedure often necessitates multiple human donors per recipient to achieve insulin independence. Administration of exogenous antioxidants has shown promise in both preserving islet cell viability and functionality post‐transplantation. Herein, thioketal (TK) antioxidant is evaluated using neonatal porcine islets and Beta‐TC‐6 cells exposed to H 2 O 2 for changes in membrane integrity, oxygen consumption rates, and lipid peroxidation. Diabetic BALB/c mice are transplanted with a marginal dose of syngeneic islets, ±48‐h TK pre‐treatment, under the kidney capsule. Graft function is measured by nonfasting blood glucose and glucose tolerance testing. It is found that 200 µM of TK was not cytotoxic, reduced reactive oxygen species‐mediated oxidative islet damage, preserved in vitro islet cell functionality, and facilitated superior murine syngeneic marginal islet mass engraftment. These results demonstrate that the antioxidant attributes of TK reduce the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species experienced in vitro and enhance marginal islet mass transplant outcomes.",

Thermal pain is accessed by tail‐flick. Inflammatory pain is induced bycompound Freund adjuvant (CFA) into the right hind paw. Mechanical allodynia is assessed with von‐Frey filaments. Motoreffects are evaluated by rotarod apparatus.The profile of interaction is assessed by Isobolographic analysis. Ketamine and lidocaine, alone or in combination, dose‐dependently ameliorate acute thermal pain and mechanical allodynia triggered by CFA. The dose of combinationthat reach 20% or 50% of the maximum possible effect is lower than the expected for an additive interaction suggesting, thus,synergism. The interaction indexes are 0.001 and 0.029 for thermal and inflammatory pain, respectively. Ketamine alone but not in combination reduces the motor performance in the rotarod at 50% antinociceptive dose. Combined ketamine and lidocaine synergistically attenuates thermal and inflammatory pain. Therefore, smaller doses of both drugs retain their analgesic efficacy and are associated with lower alterations in motor activity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) stands out as one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal cancers. Current treatment strategies for CRC are significantly hindered by systemic toxicity and suboptimal therapeutic efficacy. This study aims to overcome these limitations by developing a robust tumor‐targeting chemo‐photothermal strategy, combining Bortezomib (BTZ) as a proteasome inhibitor, IR780 iodide as a near‐infrared dye, and Photothermal Therapy (PTT) agent, with hyaluronic acid (HA) serving as the shell for tumor targeting, denoted as HA/PB@IR780. The investigations reveal the impressive tumor‐targeting affinity of HA/PB@IR780, leading to a synergistic chemo‐photothermal therapeutic effect both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, this material demonstrates the capability for drug release triggered by low pH conditions. Moreover, HA/PB@IR780 induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggered cells apoptosis via the PERK‐CHOP‐Bcl‐2 pathway, and induced Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD) in CT26 cells. Importantly, HA/PB@IR780 selectively targets tumor sites, mitigating systemic toxic side effects and significantly extending the survival of CT26 tumor‐bearing mice. In conclusion, this designed tumor‐targeting nanocarrier represents a promising and potentially effective platform for the precise treatment of CRC.",

Here the identification of ICAM1 is reported as a TSCC target candidate for the development of antibody‐drug conjugate (ADC), an emerging class of targeted therapeutics. An unbiased and quantitative screening of a panel of 69 TSCC cell surface antigens is first performed that identifies ICAM1 as the most abundant hit. The overexpression level of ICAM1 is validated in 26 TSCC clinical specimens and four cell lines along with genomic information of 127 TSCC patients from the TCGA database. Based on this new target, the anti‐TSCC efficacy of ICAM1‐targeted ADCs featuring two payloads is evaluated of different mechanisms of action: MMAE and DXd. Both ADCs selectively and potently ablate TSCC tumors in the established SAS cell line and patient‐derived xenograft (PDX) models. The findings strongly support ICAM1 as a promising ADC target candidate for TSCC therapy.",

However, the serious adverse effects following intravenous glucocorticoids and the risks posed by the cumulative doses cannot be overlooked. Moreover, it is found to be ineffective in the treatment of many patients with severe thyroid‐associated ophthalmopathy. Consequently, the development of superior alternative therapies is imminent. Recent advancements in the identification of multiple autoimmune‐related targets have led to the utilization of novel antibodies such as rituximab, teprotumumab, tocilizumab, and batocliumab in clinical settings. They have shown great potential in enhancing the therapeutic effect of thyroid‐associated ophthalmopathy, minimizing adverse effects, and shortening treatment duration. Additionally, small molecule targeted drugs, such as single or double aptamers are rapidly developed to target the inflammatory microenvironment. In this review, the advancements in second‐line targeted therapeutic options for thyroid‐associated ophthalmopathy, providing a clinical rationale for immune mechanism‐based treatment of thyroid‐associated ophthalmopathy in the era of precision medicine are reported.",

Despite the current attempts to use dimethyl fumarate for treating various inflammatory diseases, its effects on endometriosis have not been previously reported. Endometriosis is a genital disease that causes various health problems in women, and treatment methods targeting the inflammatory environment are being attempted. Therefore, it is hypothesized that dimethyl fumarate has therapeutic effects on endometriosis through its anti‐inflammatory effects. Dimethyl fumarate exerted remarkable effects on cellular mechanisms, including reactive oxygen species production, activation of mitogen‑activated protein kinase signals, loss of mitochondrial function, and disruption of calcium ion homeostasis in the immortalized human ovarian endometrial stromal cells. In an endometriosis mouse model, dimethyl fumarate downregulated cell cycle‐related genes and induced inhibitory effects on endometriosis lesion growth. In particular, the immune cell population and expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL‐1β, IL‐6, and IL‐10 are regulated by dimethyl fumarate. These results support its potential as a therapeutic agent to control the excessive inflammatory environment in patients with endometriosis. This study identifies for the first time that dimethyl fumarate, which is already in clinical use, can be used to treat endometriosis.",

DC2.4 that is co‐cultured with LTP‐treated B16F10 (LTP‐B16) or with these supernatants exhibited decreased phagocytic activity, increased production of cytokines (IL‐12, IL‐6, TNF‐α, and IL‐1β), and increased expression of cell surface activation markers (CD80, CD86, and MHC II). The expression of CD80 + /CD86 + is decreased after pre‐treatment with TLR4 and NF‐κB (p65) inhibitors, respectively. In vivo, trials indicated that the LTP‐induced DC vaccine‐induced anti‐tumor immunity and, when combined with cisplatin, synergistically reduced tumor growth.",

Featuring a unique structural design, this FMD consists of 8 µm in length, with edges of ≈3 and 20 µm gaps between FMD microstructure. When subjected to IR laser exposure at 1050 nm, the FMD triggers the generation of photothermal cavitation bubbles, exerting jet fluid flow on the cell's plasma membrane surface, and facilitating biomolecule delivery into cells. The platform achieves efficient intracellular delivery spanning various biomolecules — from low‐molecular‐weight propidium iodide dye to higher molecular weight siRNA, plasmid, and enzymes — across human cervical (SiHa), mouse fibroblast (L929), and neural crest‐derived (N2a) cancer cells, ensuring consistently high efficiency without compromising cell viability. 95% delivery efficacy and 96% cell viability are achieved for smaller molecules like PI dye in L929 cells. For larger biomolecules such as enzymes, transfection efficiency reached 82%, and cell viability is nearly 90% in SiHa cells. This is confirmed via confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, the FMD‐based delivery system holds broad potential for cellular diagnostics and therapeutics, promising significant advancements in cellular research and biomedical treatments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Myelofibrosis (MF) is a life‐threatening blood cancer, with current drugs providing only symptomatic relief without altering the course of the disease. Thrombopoietin, an important cytokine for platelet production, signals via its receptor c‐Mpl that is upregulated in MF patients. Therefore, inhibition of this pathway may be a useful strategy to slow or stop progression of MF. Computational modeling and rational residue substitutions of a family of linear and cyclic peptides allow the identification of RQW as the essential motif for activity at the c‐Mpl receptor. The lead cyclic peptide 48 inhibits factor dependent Mpl cells with an IC 50 of 49 × 10 −9 m . In primary hematopoietic stem cells, 48 is able to stop the progression of CD34 + cells into megakaryocytes and another lead peptide has previously been shown to selectively ablate MF stem cells. These peptides represent important tools for further in vivo analysis and are an important step toward much needed disease‐modifying therapies for MF.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Statins exhibit anticancer pleiotropic effects, such as the induction tumor‐specific apoptosis and the promotion antitumor immunity. However, due to low bioavailability, high doses are required to trigger such antitumor effects. In this study, an oral delivery system to improve bioavailability of simvastatin (SIMVA) is prepared and its application in combination with an oral anticancer formulation is investigated. A colloidal dispersion (CD) of SIMVA is prepared using N α ‐deoxycholyl‐ l ‐lysyl‐methylester (DL) to enhance a solubility and permeation (SIMVA/DL‐CD). Preparation of SIMVA/DL‐CD markedly increases the solubility and in vitro artificial membrane permeability of SIMVA by 291‐ and 4.68‐fold, respectively, compared to SIMVA in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The oral absorption of SIMVA/DL‐CD (20 mg kg −1 SIMVA) is significantly enhanced and its oral bioavailability is tenfold higher compared to that of free SIMVA. An in vivo study in CT26 tumor‐bearing mice receiving SIMVA/DL‐CD reveals substantial tumor growth suppression through upregulated anticancer immunity. In particular, the combination of oral SIMVA/DL‐CD and oxaliplatin powder formulation elicits considerable tumor‐suppressive effects and CD8 + T cell immunity. Furthermore, this combination therapy sensitizes antiprogramed cell death protein‐1 monoclonal antibody‐resistant tumors to checkpoint blockade. The current findings highlight the therapeutic potential of oral SIMVA/DL‐CD as an effective anticancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become an important diagnostic tool. Various pre‐targeting systems have been reported to address limitations associated with traditional immuno‐PET. However, the application of these mono‐receptor based pre‐targeting (MRPT) strategies is limited to non‐internalizable antibodies, and the tumor uptake is usually much lower than that in the corresponding immuno‐PET. To circumvent these limitations, the first dual‐receptor enhanced pre‐targeting (DRPT) system is developed through entrapping the tumor‐receptor‐specific radioligand by the pre‐administered antibody. Besides the similar ligation pathway happens in MRPT, incorporation of a tumor‐receptor‐specific peptide into the radioligand in DRPT enhances both concentration and retention of the radioligand on tumor, promoting its ligation with pre‐administered antibody on cell‐surface and/or internalized into tumor‐cells. In this study, 64 Cu‐based DRPT shows superior performance over corresponding MRPT and immuno‐PET using internalizable antibodies. Besides, the compatibility of DRPT with short‐lived and generator‐produced 68 Ga is demonstrated, leveraging its advantage in reducing radio‐dose exposure. Furthermore, the feasibility of reducing the amount of the pre‐administered antibody is confirmed, indicating the cost saving potential of DRPT. In summary, synergizing advantages of dual‐receptor targeting and pre‐targeting, it is expect that this DRPT strategy can become a breakthrough technology in the field of antibody‐based molecular imaging.",

    "abstract": "It's the time of year where journal editors address the community and their readers to update them on news – hot topics, updates in workflow or highlight specific papers and collections. It is also time to say thank you to people for their support. But more on that later. So, what happened in 2022 with and around Advanced Therapeutics since our last Editorial? To enhance transparency of our editorial decision-making process, we have introduced a workflow where reviewers of manuscripts at our journals are notified of the editorial decision for manuscripts they have reviewed immediately after the decision is made. The other, anonymized, reviewer reports are also shared with them. This gives our reviewers valuable insight into their peers’ evaluation of the manuscript and additional guidance as to the journal's standards. The feedback we have received from our reviewers indicates they are appreciative not just of the information provided in the notification but also how it acknowledges the important contribution they make to upholding our stringent requirements. As announced and foreshadowed last year, Advanced Therapeutics has received its first full official 2 year-Impact Factor (JCR, Clarivate Analytics, 2022) of 5.003. We are excited about this announcement, but we all know that the impact factor is only one of many journal metrics and to get a better picture of the journal performance looking at multiple indicators is helpful. Some of these metrics for Advanced Therapeutics include: 5-yr IF 5.445, SNIP 0.839, JCI 1.21 and CiteScore 7.5. Our commitment to improve the ways in which the outputs of scholarly research are evaluated is also reflected in the fact that all Wiley journalshave become a DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment) signatory. In the first quarter of 2019 we had created the Advanced Therapeutics Editors’ Choice article collection with our best articles published to date. We have updated this initial selection in 2022 with a new set of hand-picked articles that show the breadth of our published content. You will find a very diverse list of topics, including nanofibers against intestinal inflammatory Crohn's disease, innovative cancer therapies, cardiovascular disease treatment via cholesterol proteins, antidepressant drug discovery, bioelectronics, micro/nanorobots, AI-driven HIV dosing, biostable insulin variants for diabetes medication, and more. Publishing high-quality content does not suffice. It needs to reach the community and needs to be read and built upon to come to life. Figure 1 highlights the international nature of our readership. To keep up to date with our most accessed content please have a look here. Finally, in 2022 we have also expanded our Editorial Advisory Boards to include new experts in various fields relevant to the journal. Prof. Maria Jose Alonso (Universidade de Santiago de Compostela), Prof. Chunying Chen (The National Center for Nanoscience and Technology), Prof. Ronit Satchi-Fainaro (Tel Aviv University), Prof. Xun Sun (Sichuan University), Prof. Eric Appel (Stanford University), Prof. Sidi A. Bencherif (Northeastern University), Prof. Chunhai Fan (Shanghai Jiao Tong University), Prof. Yanglong Hou (Beijing University), Prof. Jonathan Lovell (University of Buffalo), Prof. James Moon (University of Michigan), Prof. Nicole Steinmetz (UCSD), Prof. Andy Tay (NUS), Prof. Maria Vincent (Centro de Investigación Príncipe Felipe), Prof. Xin Zhang (Chinese Academy of Sciences) have joined the two Editorial boards of Advanced Therapeutics and support the journal through their expertise. A full current list of our Board members is available on the journal homepage here. A big thank you to the newcomers as well as everyone who has supported the journal from the beginning. We would also like to express our gratitude to our editorial board members, authors, and last but not least, our readers for your interest in Advanced Therapeutics. To wrap up, it's safe to say that a lot has happened for the journal, the community and global health. Last year, we had hoped that by now COVID-19 would have been more contained than it is – with most countries facing the fourth/fifth wave of impact. We hope that you, your family and friends stay safe and healthy during these challenging times.

    "abstract": "Abstract Osteoclasts are cells primarily involved in bone remodeling. Hyperactive osteoclastogenesis leads to pathological bone loss and microarchitectural deterioration. However, given the limitations of current osteoclast inhibitors, there is an urgent need for a novel antiresorptive agent with higher efficiency and fewer side effects. Cell‐free fat extract (CEFFE) is the liquid fraction obtained from adipose tissues, which are enriched with a variety of adipokines. This study aims to explore its pharmacologic effect on hyperactive osteoclastogenesis. CEFFE exhibits excellent potentials to attenuate osteoclast‐associated bone loss in ovariectomy mice and to inhibit osteoclastogenesis in primary monocytes. Furthermore, the cationic protein fraction of CEFFE (CEFFE‐Cation) is identified as the main inhibitory component in osteoclast formation assay. According to liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis, the CEFFE‐Cation fraction mainly consists of various antioxidant enzymes and cytokines, which endow it with a superior antioxidant capacity. Meanwhile, CEFFE‐Cation is also capable of mitigating Ca 2+ oscillation and subsequent nuclear factor of activated T‐cells 1 nuclear translocation during osteoclastogenesis. Overall, this study elucidates the promising translational potential of CEFFE as a next‐generation personalized antiresorptive agent for osteolytic bone disease treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) is considered to be closely related to tumor prognosis and immune response. Therefore, it has predictable clinical significance for survival prognosis and cancer drug treatment to build TLS signature of pan‐cancer. The transcriptome sequencing data of The Cancer Genome Atlas pan‐cancer analysis are obtained from UCSC Xena, including 33 cancer types ( N = 10 066). A 15 TLS genes‐based TLSscore is constructed using the Random Forest and Cox regression analyses. Then, according to TLS signature, patients are classified into low‐ and high‐risk groups. Then, the differences between the two groups in terms of survival prognosis, functional enrichment, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity are further explored. On the basis of machine learning algorithm, TLS signature has satisfactory prediction performance for the prognosis of pan‐cancer patients. A nomogram with high predictive performance is formulated by incorporating TLS signature and clinical features. The function enrichment analysis suggests that TLS signature may be related to the key pathways of immunotherapy for pan‐cancer, and shows significant differences among groups at the immune checkpoint genes. In general, a novel TLSscore‐based model is established through comprehensive analysis of TLS genes, which can accurately predict the clinical prognosis and drug sensitivity of pan‐cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The clinical application of statins as anti‐hypercholesterolemia medications, while very beneficial, remains limited by intolerance and side effects. Statins increase the production of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which degrades low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and limits circulating LDL cholesterol (LDLC) uptake. PCSK9 also promotes cardiomyocyte and vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis and vascular injury. Several PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab, and inclisiran) are highly effective at reducing plasma LDLC levels and moderately effective at protecting against cardiovascular disease. However, their long‐term use needs to take the following issues into account: i) PCSK9 deficiency leads to various pathologies like heart failure and liver steatosis, ii) PCSK9 regulates lipid homeostasis, iii) depletion of circulating PCSK9 may itself upregulate PCSK9 expression, and iv) the cost of available inhibitors is beyond the reach of most people. Therefore, the long‐term safety and affordability of PCSK9 inhibitors needs to be revisited and additional therapeutic options need to be explored.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transmural skip lesions are pathognomonic for Crohn's disease (CD). Despite advances toward CD treatment, disease recurrence remains a problem. CD requires novel therapies to modulate localized intestinal inflammation and promote intestinal epithelium healing. Human neonatal cardiac‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (nMSCs) demonstrate immune cell modulation accompanied by improved cardiac function recovery in myocardial infarction models. In the established CD‐like ileitis SAMP mouse model, direct skip lesion injection of nMSCs prevents ileal skip lesion growth and significantly down‐regulates the pro‐inflammatory milieu. Significant reduction in the percentage of skip lesion CD68 + macrophages (M1 Mφ, pro‐inflammatory) accompanied by an increase of CD206 + macrophages (M2 Mφ, anti‐inflammatory/pro‐regenerative) is observed in skip lesions following nMSCs injection compared to non‐injected and placebo controls ( p &lt; 0.05). Skip lesion size is significantly reduced along with pro‐inflammatory cytokines IFN‐y and TNF‐α, with an increase in intestinal tissue anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10 production. nMSCs are also retained within skip lesions 5 weeks post‐treatment. nMSC administration promotes wound remodeling by modulating inflammatory immune cells and by increasing small bowel gastrointestinal transit with concomitant decreased segment gross pathology score compared to placebo control. Data from this study demonstrate that direct injection of nMSCs into ileal skip lesions attenuates inflammation and improves intestinal physiology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor with a poor prognosis that easily recurs. The antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab is used to treat recurrent GBM. However, GBM treated with bevacizumab easily rebounds due to evasive mechanisms that induce resistance to treatment, such as hypoxia‐inducible factor (HIF) associated pathways. The transcription factor HIFs are oxygen‐dependent and are degraded via the ubiquitin‐dependent proteasomal pathway. Therefore, it is necessary to study bevacizumab resistance with HIF‐associated pathways through translational mRNA profiling. This work applies a hypoxia response element (HRE) promoter to the ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) system for hypoxia‐specific translational mRNA profiling analysis. Here, this work analyzes the translatome of pseudopalisading cells in the brain samples of orthotopic mouse models using hypoxia‐responsive 5× HRE‐TRAP system to investigate the molecular mechanism of drug resistance on pseudopalisading cells around the necrotic area induced by bevacizumab resistance. The translatomic analysis result shows that pseudopalisading cells exhibit notable enrichment of gene sets associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. The outcomes of this study enhance clinical relevance, meaning that the translatomic analysis result of pseudopalisading cells during bevacizumab treatment‐induced resistance provides new insight into a promising approach for developing targeted therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Anti‐cancer vaccination emerged as a promising and cost‐effective immunotherapy, but the lack of immunogenicity has hindered the success of therapeutic vaccine development. To address this issue and improve therapeutic efficacy, this study presents the examination of recombinant overlapping peptides (ROP) based on the tumor‐associated antigen, survivin, on in vivo immunogenicity and anti‐tumor efficacy using a melanoma C57/BL mouse model. Results show that ROPs induce a remarkable 46.5% cytotoxic activity mediated by activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes, compared to only 3% in wild‐type (WT) survivin protein. Additionally, ROPs significantly reduce tumor size by over 500 mm 3 and prolong survival rates in mice with zero deaths in the first 17 days and 30% survival at the end of day 23, while no mice immunized with WT survivin protein survive beyond day 20. ROPs combined with anti‐4‐1BB agonists lead to additional tumor size reduction by 500 mm 3 and 70% survival on day 23. These findings underscore the importance of survivin as a trigger for tumor‐restricting immunity and provide therapeutic evidence of ROPs' anti‐tumor potential, especially when combined with other immunostimulants, such as anti‐4‐1BB agonists. ROPs and adjuvant immunostimulants represent a potent vaccine strategy for therapeutic purposes, increasing vaccine immunogenicity and improving survival against cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract P. aeruginosa , a leading nosocomial pathogen, commonly causes chronic biofilm infections in tissues and biomedical devices, including wound infections, osteomyelitis, and infective endocarditis, heavily threatening life. The dynamic lifecycle of these biofilms leads to persistent generation, making it challenging to prevent and disperse these biofilms effectively. Herein, a topological eight‐arm zwitterion‐conjugated glycomimetics (PCBAA‐ b ‐PLAMA) 8 to address this challenge by exerting a dual‐blocking effect on P. aeruginosa biofilms is introduced. Initially, carboxybetaine acrylate (CBAA) and 2‐lactobionamidoethyl methacrylate (LAMA) are introduced to the topological bromine‐based initiator to prepare (PCBAA‐ b ‐PLAMA) 8 . This copolymer demonstrats remarkable efficiency in dispersing P. aeruginosa biofilms, approximately up to 99%. This high efficacy can be attributed to the multivalent and triaxial interactions between LAMA and CBAA groups, which enable the capture of P. aeruginosa cells and the biofilm matrix. Furthermore, (PCBAA‐ b ‐PLAMA) 8 efficiently inhibit the expression of resistance genes related to biofilm formation and antibiotic efflux, including cdrA, lasB, mexE, and mexH, regaining bacterial cell sensitivity to antibiotics and further facilitating the natural dispersal of biofilms. This study provides a generic dual‐blocking strategy for the efficient eliminating of biofilms from biomedical devices.",

This technology is based on the use of standard biomaterials loaded with photosynthetic cells for the controlled release of oxygen at the target site. However, as well as for other cell‐based approaches, a main drawback for their clinical translation is the low shelf‐life of living materials. Here, the potential of inducing a dormant hibernation‐inspired state to preserve photosynthetic biomaterials for clinical applications is explored. First, a protocol to preserve microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is optimized and then applied to photosynthetic scaffolds, showing that the viability and functionality of the biomaterial is preserved for up to 6 weeks. To evaluate the clinical viability of this approach, both fresh and preserved photosynthetic scaffolds are implanted in a full‐skin defect mouse model. The safety of this approach is evaluated and confirmed by several means, including clinical parameters, histological assays, and local and systemic molecular analysis. Altogether, for the first time the successful preservation of photosynthetic biomaterials through a hibernation‐inspired strategy is described here, which could have a tremendous impact for the clinical translation of these materials as well as other photosynthetic therapies.",

This research explores the potential protective effects of sodium butyrate (NaB) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through the Gasdermin B (GSDMB) non‐pyroptotic pathway. Fecal SCFA levels and GSDMB‐related proteins of IBD patients are analyzed. NCM460 and HUM cells are treated with methotrexate (MTX) for 24 hours. NaB is applied at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 m m mL −1 to cells. It is found that a decrease in SCFAs content, zonula occludens‐1 (ZO‐1), and Occludin expression, along with an increase in GSDMB, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and extracellular singal‐regulated kinase (ERK) in IBD patients is observed. NaB, at medium and high concentrations, promotes cell viability and migration and increased GSDMB expression. The low concentration of NaB has a significant protective effect on IBD‐affected cells, activating the GSDMB non‐pyroptotic pathway. This protection diminishes after the GSDMB knockdown. The study reveals that NaB may play a crucial role in protecting intestinal epithelial integrity in IBD through the GSDMB non‐pyroptotic pathway. These findings underline the potential of targeting this pathway for therapeutic strategies, highlighting the importance of SCFAs in understanding and treating IBD.",

Mifepristone incubation could induce up‐regulated CD83 and major histocompatibility complex cell surface receptor staining on monocyte‐derived DCs. Functionally, mifepristone incubation could enhance the allostimulatory capacity of DCs to promote the proliferation of allogeneic T cells with up‐regulated Th1 cell proportion and down‐regulated Th2 cell proportion. On the other side, increased Th1 cytokines release (interferon‐γ, tumor necrosis factor α), inhibited Th2 cytokines release (IL‐10, IL‐4), promoted T‐Box transcription factor 21 transcription, and inhibited GATA binding protein 3 transcription are also identified. Mifepristone‐stimulated DCs could alter the Th1/Th2 transcription balance to favor Th1 skewing inflammatory environment.",

Consequently, immunotherapeutic strategies that selectively induce MM‐specific T cell responses by targeting MM‐associated antigens have emerged. This study aims to identify HLA‐restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes derived from B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) as potential peptide vaccine candidates to advance preventive and therapeutic interventions for MM. BCMA expression in bone marrow tissue samples from 96.8% of MM patients is observed, and the positive membrane BCMA expression is associated with inferior overall survival outcomes. Through an in silico model, four BCMA epitope peptides that exhibit in vitro concentration‐dependent binding to the HLA*A11:01 molecule are identified. Comparative analyses reveal that BCMA‐specific CTLs stimulated by BCMA‐2, BCMA‐3, and BCMA‐4 peptides exhibit significantly greater cytolysis of cancer cells, including BCMA‐overexpressing KMS‐20 and KKU‐055 cells, in comparison to an unpulsed condition or an irrelevant control peptide derived from human immunodeficiency virus‐1 (HIV‐1). Moreover, the observed cytolytic activities of these CTLs are significantly distinct when compared to corresponding BCMA‐negative cells, thereby indicating antigen‐specificity. This study highlights the promising potential of utilizing immunogenic HLA‐A*11:01‐restricted BCMA peptides as a viable approach for cancer vaccination and T cell‐based therapy in the context of MM.",

    "abstract": "We are pleased to present a joint special issue spanning Advanced Therapeutics and Macromolecular Bioscience to highlight progress in the use of hydrogel biomaterials for therapeutic applications. Hydrogels have been broadly explored as functional biomaterials; their three-dimensional highly hydrated porous architecture captures features of native extracellular matrix, offering surrogate substrates for the growth of cells and networks for the controlled release of therapeutic agents.[1-11] In hydrogels used for biomedical application, relevant properties may include tunable control of matrix stiffness or its dynamics,[12, 13] shear-thinning and self-healing transformations in conjunction with injection from a syringe or to interface with additive manufacturing and 3D printing,[14-16] or mechanisms to respond to physiologically relevant features like temperature, pH, or enzymatic activity.[17-19] The applications for this versatile class of materials are therefore broad, and many new directions are actively being explored. This special issue spans the journals of Advanced Therapeutics and Macromolecular Biosciences, with more application-focused pieces appearing in the former and those focused more on fundamental design and evaluation of hydrogels appearing in the latter. The pieces enclosed within this joint special issue include informative reviews alongside original research from some World leaders using hydrogels for biomedical applications. The polymers used to construct these hydrogels are broad, ranging from one-dimensional assembly of small supramolecular gelators to covalently crosslinked (bio)polymer networks. The application of these materials is just as broad, with their uses explored for three-dimensional support of cells, controlled release of encapsulated therapeutic agents, bioadhesive constructs for tissue regeneration, and 3D printing of hierarchically organized scaffolds. The breadth encompassed in these articles is indicative of the many possible therapeutic uses of hydrogels to uncover new knowledge about biology, derive new functional technologies, or contribute to improving the practice of medicine. The issue of Advanced Therapeutics begins with a number of informative reviews on the application and use of a broad array of hydrogels for biomedical applications. Azevedo and colleagues describe the use of engineered hydrogels prepared from hyaluronan, a natural component of the extracellular matrix that has been frequently explored for its use in engineered biomaterials (2300182). A review by Cho and colleagues next discusses the use of bioadhesive hydrogels for skin-related applications, describing uses ranging from cosmetics and UV protection to intervention in an assortment of skin diseases (2300125). A perspective by Huang, Li, and colleagues describes the use of bioadhesives for tissue repair and regeneration, with specific focus on engineering the mechanical properties of these materials to serve in load-bearing applications in the body (2300139). Kim and colleagues review the use of hydrogels for immunoengineering, specifically as it relates to enhancing the function of both endogenous and engineered T-cells for the treatment of solid tumors (2300094). The use of hydrogels for the delivery and therapeutics to control diabetes is discussed by Webber and colleagues, describing routes for controlled and glucose-responsive delivery to better meet the temporal therapeutic need presented by blood glucose control (2300127). Finally, the reviews featured in this special issue close with a piece by Ye and colleagues describing the use of hydrogels for integration with the practice of dental medicine, describing features of this class of materials that offer benefits to improving oral health and oral tissue regeneration (2300128). The research articles in the issue of Advanced Therapeutics begin with work by Appel and colleagues describing the use of injectable hydrogels for the controlled release of vaccines, with utility in reducing the number of administrations for expanded vaccine access in the context of global health (2300108). Dankers and colleagues next describe the use of a hydrogel-based formulation for the controlled delivery of an antibody to inhibit specific microRNAs and promote cardiac regeneration after ischemic injury, taking advantage of a supramolecular hydrogel design to facilitate facile local administration (2300241). The work of De Laporte and colleagues describes the use of hydrogels for temporal and sequential control of growth factor release to promote network vascularization, noting the importance of staged presentation of active signaling molecules for optimal vascularization (2300091). Kim and colleagues then show the use of an adhesive composite hydrogel patch prepared from dynamic network bonds, and explore the use of this material for the localized delivery of an anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical agent to treat atopic dermatitis (2300096). Work by Kouwer and colleagues next explores the use of hydrogels with labile covalent attachment of a potent estrogen analogue, using these materials in conjunction with adipose-derived stem cells for tissue regeneration in conjunction with surgery to repair the pelvic floor (2300199). Finally, Shin and colleagues show the use of a fibrous covalently crosslinked gelatin scaffold applied to prepared 3D-printed tissue engineered skeletal muscle constructs (2300170). The issue of Macromolecular Bioscience begins with a review by Matson and colleagues on hydrogels for the controlled and localized release of gasotransmitters, biologically active gas molecules with diverse roles in tissue regeneration (2300138). From here, research papers in this issue begin with work by Baker and colleagues to apply alginate-based hydrogels with dynamic properties including stress-relaxation in preparing models of cornea tissue that better match the dynamic mechanical properties of the native tissue (2300109). Work from Bouvy and colleagues describes the use of supramolecular hydrogels for intraperitoneal injections, finding that the hydrogels coat the tissue of the peritoneal cavity and are well-tolerated and biocompatible when applied using this mode of delivery (2300005). Caliari and colleagues next describe the importance of passage number on the in vitro mechanosensitivity of mesenchymal stem cells to hydrogels, showing that cell function is altered with successive in vitro passages and pointing to a key experimental variable in the use of hydrogels for preparation of tissue culture models (2300110). A report from Mano and colleagues describes the use of a chitosan-based supramolecular hydrogel with dual light-directed covalent crosslinking for use as injectable biomaterials and in 3D printing applications, showing that tunable viscoelasticity affords integration with a range of fabrication techniques (2300058). Mooney and colleagues engineer a conductive hydrogel scaffold prepared from alginate, graphene nanoflakes, and carbon nanotubes for the 3D culture and alignment of fibroblasts, with an eye toward developing platforms to recreate dermal tissue or screen therapeutics (2300044). The article from Tayalia and colleagues describes the use of gelatin-based cryogels for the suspension of therapeutic cells, showing these materials are able to support cells during the process of injection-based delivery and can biodegrade in situ (2200562). Webber and colleagues then report on dynamic-covalent crosslinking of a small molecule supramolecular gelator using a multiarm polymer, targeting dynamic and glucose-responsive networks for the encapsulation and controlled release of therapeutics in response to changes in blood glucose level (2300001). This special issue closes with work from Wu and colleagues describing a composite hydrogel prepared from a mixture of dextran, chitosan, and silica nanoparticles for the delivery of therapeutic agents into sites of surgical resection, targeting application to limit post-surgical infection or to localize drug delivery to the site of tumor resection (2200565). These exemplary works presented across this joint special issue of Advanced Therapeutics and Macromolecular Biosciences illustrate the breadth and possible uses of hydrogels for therapeutic applications. From the design of material building blocks, to the control of their mechanical properties, to integration of active therapeutic agents, to facilitating cell-material interactions, there are many possibilities for hydrogels to interface and intervene in the context of biomedicine. In the coming decades, it is envisioned that continued development and advancement of these various technologies will lead to better in vitro tissue models to aid in understanding and recreating biology alongside functional technologies that support health and intervene in disease states.

    "abstract": "Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid‐membrane‐enclosed particles released from cells, playing a pivotal role in cellular communication, particularly within the immune system. The fundamental molecular mechanisms through which EVs offer unique functionality for immunotherapeutic benefits are identified and reviewed. The focus is on three essential features, all rooted in the EV lipid membrane: immune receptor–ligand interactions at the EV membrane interface, the shielding of immunogenic cargo within the EVs, and the fusion of EVs with target cell membranes for direct cargo delivery. From this, how these distinct EV attributes, from their initial description and analysis in immune communication, have led to the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies is traced. This review delves into how these strategies are applied in various immunotherapies, such as cancer immunotherapy, autoimmune diseases, infections, vaccinations, and graft‐versus‐host diseases, to modulate communication among different cell types for immune regulation. It is concluded by reviewing clinical trials involving EVs in immunotherapy that have effectively harnessed EVs' unique molecular mechanisms in clinical settings. Research and standardization efforts to maximize the potential impact of EVs on immunotherapy are further suggested.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Optimal first‐line treatment approaches for non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastases (BMs) without driver gene alterations remain unclear. Recently, some studies preliminarily have suggested that immunotherapy plus chemotherapy (ICI+Chemo) may be superior to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (Beva+Chemo). However, no study directly compares the effectiveness of two treatment approaches for NSCLC patients with BMs without driver gene alterations. NSCLC patients are retrospectively identified with BMs lacking sensitizing mutations, and patients are divided into ICI+Chemo and Beva+Chemo groups based on the front‐line treatment approach. It is aimed to compare the efficacy for two treatments. All 155 eligible patients between March 2017 and May 2022 have been enrolled. Median intracranial progression‐free survival (iPFS) and systemic PFS (sPFS) in ICI+Chemo group are 14.4 and 12.1 months compared with those in Beva+Chemo group (10.0 and 8.4 months) (hazard ratio (HR), 0.626; P = 0.035; and HR, 0.634; P = 0.022). The PFS benefit of ICI+Chemo over Beva+Chemo is significant in those with programmed cell death‐ligand 1(PD‐L1)‐positive expression. Median overall survival (OS) is similar between the ICI+Chemo and Beva+Chemo groups (26.9 versus 23.1 months, HR, 0.790; P = 0.335). The objective response rates (ORR) are similar in both groups, and both of the regimens are well tolerated without newly reported adverse events (AEs). Sixty‐three patients (40%) received locoregional therapy for BMs including radiotherapy or surgery throughout the course of treatment. The subsequent treatment is analyzed after progression and it is found that patients who receive immunotherapy throughout the course of treatment have significantly improved OS compared with those who are naïve to immunotherapy ( P &lt; 0.001). OS is comparable in patients who receive immunotherapy compared with those who receive both immunotherapy and bevacizumab ( P = 0.394). The ICI+Chemo significantly improves iPFS and sPFS for PD‐L1‐positive NSCLC patients with BMs lacking driver gene alterations. Immunotherapy provides the vital contribution to improving OS of NSCLC patients with BMs.",

    "abstract": "Health is an issue that concerns everyone, regardless of economic status, geography, or background. As a result of pioneering research in the biomedical sciences, the quality of human health has increased markedly over recent centuries. In order to continue this progress, supporting researchers in the biomedical sciences is crucial. With this first issue of Advanced Therapeutics, we are opening a new pathway for biomedical researchers to communicate their work. Advanced Therapeutics will cover a broad range of healthcare topics. Articles from the vast interdisciplinary fields of drug discovery and delivery systems will be complemented by research on therapeutic targets, targeted delivery, and design of dosage forms and formulations, as well as sustained-release systems. Focusing on the next generation of pharmaceuticals, targeting, and delivery, the journal publishes cutting-edge developments in the emerging areas of precision, predictive and personalized medicine, and pharmacogenomics. Beyond original research and review-style content on advances in drug design, drug dispensing, and drug metabolism, Advanced Therapeutics publishes essays and editorials to inform readers of the political, societal, ethical, and industrial issues associated with research within the journal's scope. This issue marks the expansion of the Advanced family of journals further into health research, following the successful launches of Advanced Healthcare Materials in 2012 and Advanced Biosystems last year. In contrast to Advanced Healthcare Materials and Advanced Biosystems, the main focus of work published in Advanced Therapeutics will be the application of materials in pharmacology and medicine—not on the materials themselves. These three Advanced journals are published in close collaboration with the editorial teams of other established Wiley journals in the life sciences, such as Macromolecular Bioscience, Biotechnology Journal, Proteomics, BioEssays, and Molecular Nutrition & Food Research. Advanced Therapeutics is supported by an executive advisory board that is made up of internationally renowned leaders from a wide range of backgrounds: The journal is also highly indebted to the International Advisory Board members for lending their support and expertise: Cameron Alexander (University of Nottingham), Karen Christman (University of California, San Diego), Mingyuan Gao (Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences), Concepción González-Bello (Universidade de Santiago de Compostela), Zhen Gu (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), Dean Ho (University of California, Los Angeles), Doo Sung Lee (Sungkyunkwan University), Xinjie Liang (National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, China), Samir Mitragotri (University of California, Santa Barbara), Dan Peer (Tel Aviv University), Hélder Santos (University of Helsinki), Weihong Tan (Hunan University; Florida University), Arto Urtti (University of Helsinki), Ralph Weissleder (Harvard University), Alexander Zelikin (Aarhus University), and Liangfang Zhang (University of California, San Diego). The content of this issue is intended to give an impression of the broad range of topics that will be covered by Advanced Therapeutics. Firstly, Michael Decker and co-workers have a close look at receptor agonists of the human cannabinoid receptor 2 and develop affinity switches based on a benzimidazole core through azologization and computational studies (adtp.201700032). An effective technique to treat retinoblastoma cancer cells using femtosecond laser pulses and EpCAM retinoblastoma cell targeting gold nanorods is demonstrated by Nir Katchensky and co-workers in their article (adtp.201800009). Next, Mingyuan Cao and his group propose a novel histochemical staining approach for identifying rare earth–based nanoprobes in tissues through unique chromogenic reactions (adtp.201800005). Patrick S. Doyle and his group present a bottom-up and scalable method that formulates nanoparticles of hydrophobic drugs directly embedded in composite hydrogel beads (adtp.201700020). Finally, Hélder Santos and co-workers design a smart transformable nanosystem with a photo-triggered antifouling surface to efficiently reduce protein adsorption on nanoparticles and modulate their cell interaction in protein-rich environment (adtp.201800013). These articles offer a window into the critical subject matter that Advanced Therapeutics will be devoted to highlighting. This represents our first steps toward providing an exciting new platform for researchers designing materials for therapeutic applications to showcase their work. The editorial team is looking forward to the journey. The Editorial Team of Advanced Therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "In its first year of publication, Advanced Therapeutics has received already more than 130 submissions, and out of these papers we have selected the very best to create 8 strong issues for our first volume, one published each month since May 2018. These issues have provided a platform for some arresting visual interpretations of the work within. The eight front covers from our first volume are shown in Figure 1. We would like to thank the more than 220 individuals who have helped us with their expertise to review for Advanced Therapeutics. In particular, we would like to mention in alphabetical order Wenbo Bu (SIC, CAS/ECNU), Yu Chen (SIC), Akhilesh Gaharwar (Texas A&M), Nathaniel Hwang (SNU), Niveen Khashab (KAUST), Yaping Li (SIMM, CAS), Zhuang Liu (Soochow), Kanyi Pu (NTU), Hélder Santos (Helsinki), and Xian-Zheng Zhang (Wuhan) for devoting much of their time and energy to writing meticulous reports for our new flagship journal. Table 1 lists the 10 Advanced Therapeutics papers that were read and downloaded most on Wiley Online Library so far, and we would like to congratulate all these authors on the immediate success of their research output.

Therap. 2018, 1, 1800028 DOI: 10.1002/adtp.201800028 Advanced Therapeutics has a focus on seven domains of therapeutic research. Over the course of 2018 we have published a range of high-quality articles in each of these subject areas. The editorial team would like to highlight the following representative examples. International Advisory Board member Dean Ho and his team reported on a powerful artificial intelligence (CURATE.AI) platform to successfully treat a patient with advanced cancer (10.1002/adtp.201800104). The research team successfully utilized CURATE.AI to continuously identify the optimal doses of each drug to result in a durable response, allowing the patient to resume a completely normal and active lifestyle. This contribution to the field of personalized medicine is currently our most-accessed article and reached an Altmetric Attention Score of not less than 274, demonstrating its great popularity in news outlets and on social media. In the field of cellular mechanisms, Michael Decker and co-workers developed the first photochromic affinity switch for the human cannabinoid receptor 2 (hCB2R) which plays an important role in the immune system and holds great therapeutic potential in neuroinflammation (10.1002/adtp.201700032). To allow deeper insight into pathophysiological processes mediated by hCB2R the group synthesized a variety of hCB2R agonists with high selectivity and photo-switchable affinity. In their contribution to medical chemistry, Amanda Pearce, Nishant Singh and coworkers reviewed stimuli-responsive prodrug chemistries for drug delivery (10.1002/adtp.201800030). The goal of this strategy is to widen the therapeutic window by achieving spatiotemporal control over the release of the active drug in response to physical, chemical, or biological stimuli present at the specific diseased area. By reducing access to non-diseased tissues and cells, adverse off-target effects can be minimized. A therapeutic targeting strategy developed by Marygorret Obonyo, Liangfang Zhang and co-workers effectively delivered antibiotics to Helicobacter pylori bacteria by mimicking and leveraging natural pathogen–host binding interactions (10.1002/adtp.201800016). This was done by coating antibiotic loaded polymeric nanoparticles with plasma membranes of gastric epithelial cells. The resulting nanoparticles demonstrated higher therapeutic efficacy than uncoated controls. In the area of immunotherapy, Carl G. Figdor, Jurjen Tel, and their colleagues at the Radboud University Medical Center and Eindhoven University of Technology (The Netherlands) have published their study on “Cytokine-Functionalized Synthetic Dendritic Cells for T Cell Targeted Immunotherapies” (10.1002/adtp.201700031). Their results demonstrate that synthetic mimics of immune cells based on polyisocyanopeptides, so-called synthetic dendritic cells, form unique nano-sized scaffolds that can efficiently present immobilized cytokines to T cells when targeted by anti-CD3 antibodies. Their work may become a powerful tool to improve cytokine-based immunotherapies without concomitant off-target toxicity, a severe limitation in many current anti-cancer immunotherapies. In the field of combination therapy, Alexander Zelikin and co-workers from the University of Aarhus described the development of embolization beads with built-in enzyme-prodrug therapy toolkits that can be used for on-demand synthesis of drugs by immobilized enzymes in their paper “Bi-enzymatic embolization beads for two-armed enzyme-prodrug therapy” (10.1002/adtp.201700023). The embolic bodies delivered nitric oxide, to aid vasorelaxation, whilst synthesizing the anticancer drug SN-38 for the destruction of cancer cells. Turning to nanomedicine, a team from Harvard University led by Samir Mitragotri showed the delivery of an hydrophilic drug, camptothecin, to non-solid tumors through the surface-modification and antibody conjugation of nanocrystals. Their paper “Surface-Functionalized Carrier-Free Drug Nanorods for Leukemia” (10.1002/adtp.201800010) represents the first demonstration of the use of chemically modified nanoparticles as carrier-free delivery systems for improved drug bioavailability, biostability, and tumor targeting. The world of scientific publishing evolves rapidly. As a result of declining publication in print, we stopped asking authors to contribute to the costs of color figure reproduction in all Advanced journals at the beginning of last year. In the digital age, online identity security is an important issue and we have decided to make use of an ORCID identifier compulsory for submissions to Advanced Therapeutics as well as all other Advanced journals. We therefore recommend that you register for your ORCID now if you have not already done so. Additionally, with pre-print servers playing an increasingly important role in the early dissemination of unpublished results, all Advanced journals, including Advanced Therapeutics, now welcome submissions previously posted on pre-print servers for consideration for publication. Open access is a subject that continues to dominate discussions about publishing. While our OnlineOpen services continue to enable our authors to publish their article Open Access in journals such as Advanced Therapeutics, our premium Open Access journal Advanced Science offers a route for those authors wishing to publish in a purely Open Access journal. Advanced Science is quickly gaining ground in terms of submissions and impact (Impact Factor 12.441, +38% from last year), publishing cutting-edge interdisciplinary research covering fundamental and applied research across all scientific disciplines.

Here, a facile fabrication of coating‐sheddable CD44‐targeted PLGA nanoparticles using photoclick‐crosslinkable hyaluronic acid‐ graft ‐tetrazole (HA‐ g ‐Tet) as a surfactant followed by photoclick reaction with l ‐cystine dimethacrylamide (MA‐Cys‐MA) (X‐PHS@NPs) for targeted delivery of docetaxel (DTX) to breast tumors in vivo is reported. X‐PHS@NPs exhibit strong blue fluorescence and a size of 109 nm. DTX‐loaded X‐PHS@NPs (DTX‐X‐PHS@NPs), while stable at physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 °C), release about 76.6% DTX under 10 m glutathione conditions. DTX‐X‐PHS@NPs are potent toward CD44‐overexpressing MCF‐7 human breast cancer cells with a low IC 50 of 0.27 µg mL −1 . Interestingly, X‐PHS@NPs reveal excellent tumor penetration ability and DTX‐X‐PHS@NPs induce significantly more effective inhibition of MCF‐7 human breast tumors in nude mice than free DTX. These coating‐sheddable CD44‐targeted PLGA nanoparticles provide an interesting platform for cancer chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fibrosis is a result of the pathological wound‐healing response initiated by immune cells and leads to permanent scarring, such as corneal scarring, which impairs the vision of millions of people worldwide. However, there is currently no available treatment strategy that specifically targets the pathogenesis of fibrosis and can be translated in a safe and versatile way. Herein, it is illustrated that systemic transplantation of easily accessible human eyelid adipose‐derived stem cells (heADSCs) can successfully and safely exert antifibrotic effects in both corneal and skin scarring cases. Intravenous injection of heADSCs alleviates scar formation after rat corneal lamellar injury with accelerated epithelization, increases tumor necrosis factor‐stimulated gene‐6 (TSG‐6) in the epithelium, and decreases inflammatory factors. Cell tracing shows the presence of detectable signals until the 7th day, while no pulmonary embolism or other discomfort occurs. heADSCs effectively reduce corneal scarring by ameliorating stromal inflammation by increasing endogenous tissue‐protective TSG‐6 in the epithelium and macrophage phenotype switching, which is more effective with systemic transplantation than subconjunctival transplantation. Systemic transplantation of heADSCs shows safe antifibrotic effects in both corneal and skin scarring cases and this result identifies systemic transplantation with autologous adipose‐derived stem cells as a generally versatile and safe therapy for antifibrotic treatment.",

    "abstract": "Nanomedicine is considered to be one of the most promising technologies of the 21st century and has broadly developed as the application of nanotechnology to medicine. The therapeutic applications of nanomedicine have increased exponentially to offer impressive options for various health and medicinal issues in recent years. Many different systems and strategies of considerable potential for enabling more effective and less toxic therapeutic interventions have been investigated in the nanomedicine field with significant efforts and progress. In this issue of Advanced Therapeutics, we are proud to present these distinguish articles, which integrate the strengths of scientists from life science, chemistry, medicine, and pharmacy fields, to comprehensively introduce the development of compositions, syntheses, and biomedical applications of nanomaterials for disease therapy. We are deeply appreciative of the opportunity afforded by Advanced Therapeutics to organize this special issue. The special issue, featuring 5 reviews, 2 full papers, 1 communication, and 1 progress report, convers a broad spectrum of the therapeutic nanomaterials including biological materials, catalytical materials, photonic/optical materials, as well as the advanced applications of modern organic/inorganic hybrid materials. The guest editors of this special issue are honored by the support given by the contributors, with particular acknowledgement to Prof. Alfonso E. Garcia-Bennett from Macquarie University, Prof. Yaping Li and Zhiwen Zhang from Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences the, Prof. Xiaogang Qu from Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Prof. Zhifei Dai from Peking University and Prof. Jie Meng and Haiyan Xu from the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Prof. Wei Wei and Guanghui Ma from the Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Prof. Zhipeng Gu and Jun Wu from Sun Yat-sen University and Prof. Zongqiang Cui from Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Science. A number of contributors are presented regarding the applications of novel nanomaterials in immunotherapy. Prof. Yaping Li and Prof. Zhiwen Zhang overview the recent advances of nanomedicine-mediated reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages for cancer immunotherapy. For photonic/optical materials and structures, Prof. Zhifei Dai and his co-workers focus on nanomaterials for simultaneous delivery of photosensitizers and immunomodulators, which synergize phototherapies with immunotherapy. Regarding the efficient stimulation of humoral or cellular immune responses, Prof. Wei Wei and Prof. Guanghui Ma summarize the recent advances in the study of materials as particulate adjuvants in various antitumor applications. For considerable efforts to advance drug delivery, Prof. Xiaogang Qu's team designs an effective enzyme-responsive nanocarrier that can inhibit the overexpression of telomerase reverse transcriptase and improve drug chemo-sensitivity by evaluating mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells. Prof. Zhiping Gu and Prof. Jun Wu overview recent innovations in nanocarriers based on cysteine for drug delivery to achieve a better therapeutic effect without increasing toxicity. Prof. Alfonso E. Garcia-Bennett provides a strategy to slow down drug release by loading drugs onto mesoporous silica for future biomedical applications. Prof. Xue Xue and co-workers showcase the recent progress of nanomedicine from drug delivery, imaging and therapy in the central nervous system, which mainly includes neurodegenerative disease and psychiatric diseases. In addition, Prof. Jie Meng and Prof. Haiyan Xu explore arsenic sulfide induced megakaryocytic differentiation in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, which may have possible applications as a drug. We are grateful for the referees who sincerely provided feedback on the articles. We also would like to express our appreciation to the Advanced Therapeutics editorial team for their enthusiastic dedication and professional editing, especially Dr. Emily Hu and Dr. Aaron Brown.

    "abstract": "Abstract Although cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has changed the paradigm for treating patients with certain cancers, its therapeutic benefits are limited to approximately one‐fourth of patients, highlighting the potential for combining immunotherapy with another therapeutic modality. Here, a treatment regimen that combines a cancer‐targeting antiangiogenic agent that inhibits angiogenesis within the tumor and ICB to improve therapeutic outcome is reported. The cancer‐targeting antiangiogenic modality is constructed as a hybrid complex, designated HyPEP EDB‐VEGF , comprising a cotinine‐labeled bispecific peptide targeting both extra domain B of fibronectin (EDB) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and an anticotinine antibody (Ab cot ). The resulting HyPEP EDB‐VEGF specifically bound to EDB‐overexpressing CT26 murine colorectal cancer cells and inhibited VEGF‐induced proliferation of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells. Upon intraperitoneal injection, HyPEP EDB‐VEGF preferentially accumulates in CT26 syngeneic tumors and inhibits tumor growth in a dose‐dependent manner. Furthermore, the combination of HyPEP EDB‐VEGF with an anti‐PD‐1 antibody (αPD‐1) in conjunction with dose optimization of the two modalities leads to substantial inhibition of tumor growth without loss of body weight due to vascular normalization within the tumor. These findings suggest that the combination of cancer‐specific antiangiogenic therapy using HyPEP EDB‐VEGF together with ICB may be a feasible approach for effective cancer therapy.",

Here, this work presents an antiviral method that utilizes unnatural amino acid‐engineered drug‐resistant (UAA‐DR) virus generated through genetic code expansion to combat emerging drug‐resistant viruses through genomic segment reassortment to produce sterilized progenies due to artificial amber codons in the viral genome. This work validates in vitro that UAA‐DR can provide a broad‐spectrum antiviral strategy for several H1N1 strains, different DR‐IAV strains, multidrug‐resistant (MDR) strains, and even antigenically distant influenza strains (e.g., H3N2). Moreover, a minimum dose of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors for influenza virus can further enhance the sterilizing effect when combating inhibitor‐resistant strains, partly due to the promoted superinfection of unnatural amino acid‐modified virus in cellular and animal models. The fact that the antiviral effect of UAA‐DR virus cannot be attributed to interferon stimulation and interferon stimulating genes is also investigated. It is anticipated that UAA‐engineered virus‐like particle can be extended to combat emerging drug‐resistant influenza virus and other segmented RNA viruses.",

Although the promise of these nanocarriers is very high, in the clinic the effectivity is rather limited. Determining the in vivo fate of the micelles can greatly help to improve this treatment. Here, a simple and fast chelator‐free method for radiolabeling of polymer micelles composed of different block copolymers is presented, which can allow evaluating the behavior of the nanocarriers in vivo using noninvasive nuclear imaging techniques (e.g., single photon computed tomography, SPECT). The radiolabeling method consists of adding the radioisotope ions, i.e., 111 In(III), resulting in a high radiolabeling efficiencies up to 90%. The results suggest that the radiolabeling efficiency depends on two important factors: the properties of the hydrophobic block in the block copolymer composing the micelle core, and the speciation of the radiometal salts. The formation of metal hydroxides and their precipitation in the core of the micelles appears to be a key factor for high stability. Moreover, the method can be applied to radiolabel the micelles in the presence of chemotherapeutic drugs. Finally, a SPECT study shows that the radiolabeled samples are stable in vivo without any evident loss of 111 In(III).",

Hypothesis put forward herein is that the unique HIV protease cut site (Phe-Pro) can be reconstructed using a potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization, monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), which features Phe at its C-terminus. This presents opportunities to design prodrugs that are specifically activated by the HIV protease. To this end, a series of MMAF derivatives is synthesized and evaluated in cell culture using latently HIV-infected cells. The cytotoxicity of compounds is indeed enhanced upon latency reversal by up to 11-fold. As a result, in a mixed cell population, nanomolar concentrations of the lead compounds depletes predominantly the HIV-infected cells and in doing so markedly enriches the pool of the uninfected cells. Affinity of the lead compounds to the viral protease is validated computationally and experimentally but despite expectations, the mechanism of action of the synthesized toxins is shown to be independent from the enzymatic activity of the HIV protease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) leads to cardiac remodeling and heart failure ultimately. However, the present therapeutic approaches show limited effects on restoring the blood supply quickly and controlling cardiac remodeling effectively. Here, a novel strategy for the repair of the injured heart by using tannic acid (TA) to deliver the therapeutic Neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is bio‐responsively released by the incorporation of matrix metalloproteinase cleavable peptide Pro‐Leu‐Gly‐Leu‐Ala‐Gly (TIMP), is developed. The NPY‐loaded nanostructure, designated as TNT (TA/NPY/TIMP), is evaluated for its therapeutic effects on cardiac remodeling after AMI in mice. TNT specifically targets to infarcted tissues and releases NPY in the AMI environment with abundant matrix metalloproteinase 2. Interestingly, it is found that TNT attenuates early post‐MI cardiac remodeling via increasing angiogenesis and the transition of M1 macrophages to M2 phenotype. This work contributes to developing a novel strategy for the recovery of cardiac functions after AMI.",

The selection of ideal axial ligands is essential for the success of Pt(IV) drugs. Previously, that berberine exhibits great superiority in tumor selectivity is found with uncovered mechanisms. In this study, that berberine is specifically internalized and accumulated in tumors but not normal cells through endocytosis pathways is first disclosed. Therefore a new Pt(IV) prodrug of cisplatin bearing berberine as an axial ligand, named berplatin, is designed and synthesized. Different from cisplatin, berplatin can be effectively and selectively internalized into cancer cells, through macropinocytosis and caveolin‐1 (CAV‐1)‐dependent active endocytosis, and cleaved in intracellular reductive environments to generate cisplatin and berberine, which synergistically induces substantial DNA breaking, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in both cisplatin‐sensitive and ‐resistant cancer cells. In vivo, berplatin manifests much higher antitumor activity and undetectable side effects compared to cisplatin. This study demonstrates that berplatin can serve as a potent Pt(IV) prodrug for the treatment of cisplatin‐sensitive and ‐resistant cancers with active uptake, excellent specificity, and minimal side effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Anticoagulant therapy is an important therapeutic tool for septic microcirculatory dysfunction. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is a potent anticoagulant with antithrombotic properties, which is a crucial factor for sepsis treatment. However, it has a short plasma half‐life and achieves low local concentrations; nanocomposite formulations may help overcome these limitations. Herein, it is aimed to determine if a functional layered double hydroxide (LDH)–LMWH nanocomposite improves microcirculation and organ function, while maximizing the antithrombotic effects and reducing bleeding risks in septic rats. This nanocomposite (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–fibrin antibody (Ab)–bovine serum albumin (BSA)–20LMWH–LDH) is constructed by intercalating LMWH and FITC into the LDH interlayer, and application of a BSA and an Ab coating onto the LDH nanoparticle surface. The nanocomposite released LMWH in a gradual and biphasic pattern, in an acidity‐triggered manner. Capillary tubule studies and intestinal microcirculation investigations show that green fluorescent nanocomposites accumulated around microthrombi, validating their targeting ability. Animal experiments reveal that the nanocomposites significantly improve microcirculation in septic rats with minimal pathological damage to the heart, lung, liver, and kidney tissues. Thus, this study provides a novel strategy for the treatment of septic microcirculatory dysfunction in clinical situations.",
