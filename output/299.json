    "abstract": "Omega-3 [(n-3)] fatty acids have been linked to healthy aging throughout life. Recently, fish-derived omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA have been associated with fetal development, cardiovascular function, and Alzheimer's disease. However, because our bodies do not efficiently produce some omega-3 fatty acids from marine sources, it is necessary to obtain adequate amounts through fish and fish-oil products. Studies have shown that EPA and DHA are important for proper fetal development, including neuronal, retinal, and immune function. EPA and DHA may affect many aspects of cardiovascular function including inflammation, peripheral artery disease, major coronary events, and anticoagulation. EPA and DHA have been linked to promising results in prevention, weight management, and cognitive function in those with very mild Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Genesis of Report The last 3 decades have ushered in considerable international humanitarian focus on reducing hunger for all people, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, age, income, and geographic location. Highlighting this global initiative have been 2 major commitments put forth by the UN member states, one in 1996 and the other in 2000. The former was launched in Rome by 182 governments participating in the World Food Summit when they committed “...to eradicate hunger in all countries, with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015.” To put this into perspective, in 1990, ;991 million people around the world were considered to be undernourished, generally defined as being underweight for one’s age, too short for one’s age (stunted), dangerously thin for one’s height (wasted), and/or deficient in vitamins and minerals (micronutrient malnutrition). In 2000, as part of the UN’s Millennium Development Goal, the following was put forth as an international aim: “cutting by half the proportion of people who suffer from hunger by 2015.” Approximately 23% of the world’s population was considered to be hungry or (synonymously) undernourished in 1990. In a nutshell, the World Food Summit goal was to halve the number of malnourished people, whereas that of the Millennium Development Goals was to halve the proportion of people who are hungry. With the end date of 2015 upon us, the UN’s most recent annual State of Food Insecurity in the World report takes stock of the progress made toward achieving these slightly different yet equally ambitious and fundamental goals related to greatly reducing world hunger. Key findings and messages from this report jointly prepared by the FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the World Food Program are summarized here.",

    "abstract": "NHANES is the cornerstone for national nutrition monitoring to inform nutrition and health policy. Nutritional assessment in NHANES is described with a focus on dietary data collection, analysis, and uses in nutrition monitoring. NHANES has been collecting thorough data on diet, nutritional status, and chronic disease in cross-sectional surveys with nationally representative samples since the early 1970s. Continuous data collection began in 1999 with public data release in 2-y cycles on ∼10,000 participants. In 2002, the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals and the NHANES dietary component were merged, forming a consolidated dietary data collection known as What We Eat in America; since then, 24-h recalls have been collected on 2 d using the USDA's Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Detailed and targeted food-frequency questionnaires have been collected in some NHANES cycles. Dietary supplement use data have been collected (in detail since 2007) so that total nutrient intakes can be described for the population. The continuous NHANES can adapt its content to address emerging public health needs and reflect federal priorities. Changes in data collection methods are made after expert input and validation/crossover studies. NHANES dietary data are used to describe intake of foods, nutrients, food groups, and dietary patterns by the US population and large sociodemographic groups to plan and evaluate nutrition programs and policies. Usual dietary intake distributions can be estimated after adjusting for day-to-day variation. NHANES remains open and flexible to incorporate improvements while maintaining data quality and providing timely data to track the nation's nutrition and health status. In summary, NHANES collects dietary data in the context of its broad, multipurpose goals; the strengths and limitations of these data are also discussed in this review.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this review is to provide a concise, descriptive global review of current food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG), and to assess similarities and differences in key elements of a healthy diet articulated across countries. Information was sourced from the FBDG repository of the FAO, which catalogs FBDG for all countries where they are available, including a description of the food guide (the graphic representation of the dietary guidelines), a set of key messages, and downloadable documents provided by the countries. FBDG are currently available for 90 countries globally: 7 in Africa, 17 in Asia and the Pacific, 33 in Europe, 27 in Latin America and the Caribbean, 4 in the Near East, and 2 in North America. The year of publication of current versions ranges from 1986 to 2017 (mean 2009). This review provides summaries of the key messages and food guides that are used to communicate national dietary guidance, organized by food group, and evaluates the extent to which each set of FBDG includes existing recommendations articulated by the WHO. Some guidance appears nearly universally across countries: to consume a variety of foods; to consume some foods in higher proportion than others; to consume fruits and vegetables, legumes, and animal-source foods; and to limit sugar, fat, and salt. Guidelines on dairy, red meat, fats and oils, and nuts are more variable. Although WHO global guidance encourages consumption of nuts, whole grains, and healthy fats, these messages are not universally echoed across countries. Future frontiers in FBDG development include the incorporation of environmental sustainability and increased attention to sociocultural factors including rapidly changing dietary trends. Steps toward regional and global dietary recommendations could be helpful for refinement of country-level FBDG, and for clear communication and measurement of diet quality both nationally and globally.",

    "abstract": "Oxylipins formed from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the main mediators of PUFA effects in the body. They are formed via cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P450 pathways, resulting in the formation of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, mono-, di-, and tri-hydroxy fatty acids (FAs), epoxy FAs, lipoxins, eoxins, hepoxilins, resolvins, protectins (also called neuroprotectins in the brain), and maresins. In addition to the well-known eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid, recent developments in lipidomic methodologies have raised awareness of and interest in the large number of oxylipins formed from other PUFAs, including those from the essential FAs and the longer-chain n–3 (ω-3) PUFAs. Oxylipins have essential roles in normal physiology and function, but can also have detrimental effects. Compared with the oxylipins derived from n–3 PUFAs, oxylipins from n–6 PUFAs generally have greater activity and more inflammatory, vasoconstrictory, and proliferative effects, although there are notable exceptions. Because PUFA composition does not necessarily reflect oxylipin composition, comprehensive analysis of the oxylipin profile is necessary to understand the overall physiologic effects of PUFAs mediated through their oxylipins. These analyses should include oxylipins derived from linoleic and α-linolenic acids, because these largely unexplored bioactive oxylipins constitute more than one-half of oxylipins present in tissues. Because collated information on oxylipins formed from different PUFAs is currently unavailable, this review provides a detailed compilation of the main oxylipins formed from PUFAs and describes their functions. Much remains to be elucidated in this emerging field, including the discovery of more oxylipins, and the understanding of the differing biological potencies, kinetics, and isomer-specific activities of these novel PUFA metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with metabolic disturbances that cause tissue stress and dysfunction. Obese individuals are at a greater risk for chronic disease and often present with clinical parameters of metabolic syndrome (MetS), insulin resistance, and systemic markers of chronic low-grade inflammation. It has been well established that cells of the immune system play an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity- and MetS-related chronic diseases, as evidenced by leukocyte activation and dysfunction in metabolic tissues such as adipose tissue, liver, pancreas, and the vasculature. However, recent findings have highlighted the substantial impact that obesity and MetS parameters have on immunity and pathogen defense, including the disruption of lymphoid tissue integrity; alterations in leukocyte development, phenotypes, and activity; and the coordination of innate and adaptive immune responses. These changes are associated with an overall negative impact on chronic disease progression, immunity from infection, and vaccine efficacy. This review presents an overview of the impact that obesity and MetS parameters have on immune system function.",

    "abstract": "Awareness of the human health benefits of blueberries is underpinned by a growing body of positive scientific evidence from human observational and clinical research, plus mechanistic research using animal and in vitro models. Blueberries contain a large number of phytochemicals, including abundant anthocyanin pigments. Of their various phytochemicals, anthocyanins probably make the greatest impact on blueberry health functionality. Epidemiological studies associate regular, moderate intake of blueberries and/or anthocyanins with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, death, and type 2 diabetes, and with improved weight maintenance and neuroprotection. These findings are supported by biomarker-based evidence from human clinical studies. Among the more important healthful aspects of blueberries are their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions and their beneficial effects on vascular and glucoregulatory function. Blueberry phytochemicals may affect gastrointestinal microflora and contribute to host health. These aspects have implications in degenerative diseases and conditions as well as the aging process. More evidence, and particularly human clinical evidence, is needed to better understand the potential for anthocyanin-rich blueberries to benefit public health. However, it is widely agreed that the regular consumption of tasty, ripe blueberries can be unconditionally recommended.",

The current review provides an overview of the existing evidence examining the associations of the Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets and their dietary components with cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A systematic search was conducted within Ovid Medline for studies published up to 27 March 2019 and reference lists from existing reviews and select articles were examined to supplement the electronic search results. In total, 56 articles were included. Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with better cognitive scores in 9 of 12 cross-sectional studies, 17 of 25 longitudinal studies, and 1 of 3 trials. Higher adherence to the DASH diet was associated with better cognitive function in 1 cross-sectional study, 2 of 5 longitudinal studies, and 1 trial. Higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with better cognitive scores in 1 cross-sectional study and 2 of 3 longitudinal studies. Evidence on the association of these dietary patterns with dementia in general was limited. However, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of AD in 1 case-control study and 6 of 8 longitudinal studies. Moreover, higher adherence to the DASH or MIND diets was associated with a lower AD risk in 1 longitudinal study. With respect to the components of these dietary patterns, olive oil may be associated with less cognitive decline. In conclusion, current scientific evidence suggests that higher adherence to the Mediterranean, DASH, or MIND diets is associated with less cognitive decline and a lower risk of AD, where the strongest associations are observed for the MIND diet.",

    "abstract": "Links between short sleep duration and obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease may be mediated through changes in dietary intake. This review provides an overview of recent epidemiologic studies on the relations between habitual short sleep duration and dietary intake in adults from 16 cross-sectional studies. The studies have observed consistent associations between short sleep duration and higher total energy intake and higher total fat intake, and limited evidence for lower fruit intake, and lower quality diets. Evidence also suggests that short sleepers may have irregular eating behavior deviating from the traditional 3 meals/d to fewer main meals and more frequent, smaller, energy-dense, and highly palatable snacks at night. Although the impact of short sleep duration on dietary intake tends to be small, if chronic, it may contribute to an increased risk of obesity and related chronic disease. Mechanisms mediating the associations between sleep duration and dietary intake are likely to be multifactorial and include differences in the appetite-related hormones leptin and ghrelin, hedonic pathways, extended hours for intake, and altered time of intake. Taking into account these epidemiologic relations and the evidence for causal relations between sleep loss and metabolism and cardiovascular function, health promotion strategies should emphasize improved sleep as an additional factor in health and weight management. Moreover, future sleep interventions in controlled studies and sleep extension trials in chronic short sleepers are imperative for establishing whether there is a causal relation between short sleep duration and changes in dietary intake.",

    "abstract": "The confluence of population, economic development, and environmental pressures resulting from increased globalization and industrialization reveal an increasingly resource-constrained world in which predictions point to the need to do more with less and in a \"better\" way. The concept of sustainable diets presents an opportunity to successfully advance commitments to sustainable development and the elimination of poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, and poor health outcomes. This study examines the determinants of sustainable diets, offers a descriptive analysis of these areas, and presents a causal model and framework from which to build. The major determinants of sustainable diets fall into 5 categories: 1) agriculture, 2) health, 3) sociocultural, 4) environmental, and 5) socioeconomic. When factors or processes are changed in 1 determinant category, such changes affect other determinant categories and, in turn, the level of \"sustainability\" of a diet. The complex web of determinants of sustainable diets makes it challenging for policymakers to understand the benefits and considerations for promoting, processing, and consuming such diets. To advance this work, better measurements and indicators must be developed to assess the impact of the various determinants on the sustainability of a diet and the tradeoffs associated with any recommendations aimed at increasing the sustainability of our food system.",

    "abstract": "A projected doubling in the global population of people aged ≥60 y by the year 2050 has major health and economic implications, especially in developing regions. Burdens of unhealthy aging associated with chronic noncommunicable and other age-related diseases may be largely preventable with lifestyle modification, including diet. However, as adults age they become at risk of \"nutritional frailty,\" which can compromise their ability to meet nutritional requirements at a time when specific nutrient needs may be high. This review highlights the role of nutrition science in promoting healthy aging and in improving the prognosis in cases of age-related diseases. It serves to identify key knowledge gaps and implementation challenges to support adequate nutrition for healthy aging, including applicability of metrics used in body-composition and diet adequacy for older adults and mechanisms to reduce nutritional frailty and to promote diet resilience. This review also discusses management recommendations for several leading chronic conditions common in aging populations, including cognitive decline and dementia, sarcopenia, and compromised immunity to infectious disease. The role of health systems in incorporating nutrition care routinely for those aged ≥60 y and living independently and current actions to address nutritional status before hospitalization and the development of disease are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Iron is required for many biological processes but is also toxic in excess; thus, body iron balance is maintained through sophisticated regulatory mechanisms. The lack of a regulated iron excretory mechanism means that body iron balance is controlled at the level of absorption from the diet. Iron absorption is regulated by the hepatic peptide hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin also controls iron release from cells that recycle or store iron, thus regulating plasma iron concentrations. Hepcidin exerts its effects through its receptor, the cellular iron exporter ferroportin. Important regulators of hepcidin, and therefore of systemic iron homeostasis, include plasma iron concentrations, body iron stores, infection and inflammation, and erythropoiesis. Disturbances in the regulation of hepcidin contribute to the pathogenesis of many iron disorders: hepcidin deficiency causes iron overload in hereditary hemochromatosis and nontransfused β-thalassemia, whereas overproduction of hepcidin is associated with iron-restricted anemias seen in patients with chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammatory diseases, some cancers, and inherited iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia. This review summarizes our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in the control of hepcidin synthesis in the liver, a principal determinant of plasma hepcidin concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is believed to play a central role in many of the chronic diseases that characterize modern society. In the past decade, our understanding of how dietary fats affect our immune system and subsequently our inflammatory status has grown considerably. There are compelling data showing that high-fat meals promote endotoxin [e.g., lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] translocation into the bloodstream, stimulating innate immune cells and leading to a transient postprandial inflammatory response. The nature of this effect is influenced by the amount and type of fat consumed. The role of various dietary constituents, including fats, on gut microflora and subsequent health outcomes in the host is another exciting and novel area of inquiry. The impact of specific fatty acids on inflammation may be central to how dietary fats affect health. Three key fatty acid–inflammation interactions are briefly described. First, the evidence suggests that saturated fatty acids induce inflammation in part by mimicking the actions of LPS. Second, the often-repeated claim that dietary linoleic acid promotes inflammation was not supported in a recent systematic review of the evidence. Third, an explanation is offered for why omega-3 (n–3) polyunsaturated fatty acids are so much less anti-inflammatory in humans than in mice. The article closes with a cautionary tale from the genomic literature that illustrates why extrapolating the results from inflammation studies in mice to humans is problematic.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney disease. To lower blood pressure (BP), several lifestyle changes are recommended such as weight loss, exercise, and following a healthy diet. Investigating the effect of single nutrients may have positive results, but food is consumed as part of a whole diet, resulting in nutrient interactions. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effect of dietary patterns on BP in adults. Studies that were published between January 1999 and June 2014 were retrieved using Scopus, Web of Science, and the MEDLINE database. Seventeen randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggest that healthy dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, Nordic diet, and Mediterranean diet significantly lowered systolic BP and diastolic BP by 4.26 mm Hg and 2.38 mm Hg, respectively. These diets are rich in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds, nuts, fish, and dairy and low in meat, sweets, and alcohol. Lifestyle factors such as exercise and weight loss in combination with dietary changes may also reduce BP. Further research is needed to establish the effect of dietary patterns on BP in different cultures other than those identified in this review. The review was registered on PROSPERO (International prospective register of systematic reviews) as CRD42015016272.",

    "abstract": "The consumption of sugar-free foods is growing because of their low-calorie content and the health concerns about products with high sugar content. Sweeteners that are frequently several hundred thousand times sweeter than sucrose are being consumed as sugar substitutes. Although nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are considered safe and well tolerated, their effects on glucose intolerance, the activation of sweet taste receptors, and alterations to the composition of the intestinal microbiota are controversial. This review critically discusses the evidence supporting the effects of NNSs, both synthetic sweeteners (acesulfame K, aspartame, cyclamate, saccharin, neotame, advantame, and sucralose) and natural sweeteners (NSs; thaumatin, steviol glucosides, monellin, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, and glycyrrhizin) and nutritive sweeteners (polyols or sugar alcohols) on the composition of microbiota in the human gut. So far, only saccharin and sucralose (NNSs) and stevia (NS) change the composition of the gut microbiota. By definition, a prebiotic is a nondigestible food ingredient, but some polyols can be absorbed, at least partially, in the small intestine by passive diffusion: however, a number of them, such as isomaltose, maltitol, lactitol, and xylitol, can reach the large bowel and increase the numbers of bifidobacteria in humans. Further research on the effects of sweeteners on the composition of the human gut microbiome is necessary.",

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen an unprecedented increase in attention to undernutrition, and drastically reducing child stunting has become a global development objective. The strong focus on linear growth retardation and stunting has enabled successful advocacy for nutrition, but with this focus has come some confusion and misunderstanding about the meaning of linear growth retardation and stunting among researchers, donors, and agencies active in nutrition. Motivated by the belief that a sharp focus will further accelerate progress in reducing undernutrition, we critically reviewed the evidence. The global attention to stunting is based on the premise that any intervention aimed at improving linear growth will subsequently lead to improvements in the correlates of linear growth retardation and stunting. Current evidence and understanding of mechanisms does not support this causal thinking, with 2 exceptions: linear growth retardation is a cause of difficult births and poor birth outcomes. Linear growth retardation is associated with (but does not cause) delayed child development, reduced earnings in adulthood, and chronic diseases. We thus propose distinguishing 2 distinctly different meanings of linear growth retardation and stunting. First, the association between linear growth retardation (or stunting) and other outcomes makes it a useful marker. Second, the causal links with difficult births and poor birth outcomes make linear growth retardation and stunting outcomes of intrinsic value. In many cases a focus on linear growth retardation and stunting is not necessary to improve the well-being of children; in many other cases, it is not sufficient to reach that goal; and for some outcomes, promoting linear growth is not the most cost-efficient strategy. We appeal to donors, program planners, and researchers to be specific in selecting nutrition outcomes and to target those outcomes directly.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 2 decades there has been increasing evidence supporting an important contribution from food-derived advanced glycation end products (AGEs) to the body pool of AGEs and therefore increased oxidative stress and inflammation, processes that play a major role in the causation of chronic diseases. A 3-d symposium (1st Latin American Symposium of AGEs) to discuss this subject took place in Guanajuato, Mexico, on 1–3 October 2014 with the participation of researchers from several countries. This review is a summary of the different presentations and subjects discussed, and it is divided into 4 sections. The first section deals with current general knowledge about AGEs. The second section dwells on mechanisms of action of AGEs, with special emphasis on the receptor for advanced glycation end products and the potential role of AGEs in neurodegenerative diseases. The third section discusses different approaches to decrease the AGE burden. The last section discusses current methodologic problems with measurement of AGEs in different samples. The subject under discussion is complex and extensive and cannot be completely covered in a short review. Therefore, some areas of interest have been left out because of space. However, we hope this review illustrates currently known facts about dietary AGEs as well as pointing out areas that require further research.",

PubMed and Web of Science were searched for prospective observational studies until August 2018. Summary RRs and 95% CIs were estimated from 43 reports for the highest compared with the lowest intake categories, as well as for linear and nonlinear relations focusing on each outcome separately: overweight/obesity, abdominal obesity, and weight gain. The quality of evidence was evaluated with use of the NutriGrade tool. In the dose-response meta-analysis, inverse associations were found for whole-grain (RRoverweight/obesity: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.96), fruit (RRoverweight/obesity: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.00; RRweight gain: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.97), nut (RRabdominal obesity: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.57), legume (RRoverweight/obesity: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.93), and fish (RRabdominal obesity: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.97) consumption and positive associations were found for refined grains (RRoverweight/obesity: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.10), red meat (RRabdominal obesity: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.16; RRweight gain: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.26), and SSBs (RRoverweight/obesity: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.11; RRabdominal obesity: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.20). The dose-response meta-analytical findings provided very low to low quality of evidence that certain food groups have an impact on different measurements of adiposity risk. To improve the quality of evidence, better-designed observational studies, inclusion of intervention trials, and use of novel statistical methods (e.g., substitution analyses or network meta-analyses) are needed.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to develop a scoring system (NutriGrade) to evaluate the quality of evidence of randomized controlled trial (RCT) and cohort study meta-analyses in nutrition research, building upon previous tools and expert recommendations. NutriGrade aims to assess the meta-evidence of an association or effect between different nutrition factors and outcomes, taking into account nutrition research–specific requirements not considered by other tools. In a pretest study, 6 randomly selected meta-analyses investigating diet–disease relations were evaluated with NutriGrade by 5 independent raters. After revision, NutriGrade was applied by the same raters to 30 randomly selected meta-analyses in the same thematic area. The reliability of ratings of NutriGrade items was calculated with the use of a multirater κ, and reliability of the total (summed scores) was calculated with the use of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The following categories for meta-evidence evaluation were established: high (8–10), moderate (6–7.99), low (4–5.99), and very low (0–3.99). The NutriGrade scoring system (maximum of 10 points) comprises the following items: 1) risk of bias, study quality, and study limitations, 2) precision, 3) heterogeneity, 4) directness, 5) publication bias, 6) funding bias, 7) study design, 8) effect size, and 9) dose-response. The NutriGrade score varied between 2.9 (very low meta-evidence) and 8.8 (high meta-evidence) for meta-analyses of RCTs, and it ranged between 3.1 and 8.8 for meta-analyses of cohort studies. The κ value of the ratings for each scoring item varied from 0.32 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.42) for risk of bias for cohort studies and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.99) for study design, with a mean κ of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.79). The ICC of the total score was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.90). The NutriGrade scoring system showed good agreement and reliability. The initial findings regarding the performance of this newly established scoring system need further evaluation in independent analyses.",

    "abstract": "The potential cost-effectiveness and feasibility of dietary interventions aimed at reducing hypertension risk are of considerable interest and significance in public health. In particular, the effectiveness of restricted sodium or increased potassium intake on mitigating hypertension risk has been demonstrated in clinical and observational research. The role that modified sodium or potassium intake plays in influencing the renin-angiotensin system, arterial stiffness, and endothelial dysfunction remains of interest in current research. Up to the present date, no known systematic review has examined whether the sodium-to-potassium ratio or either sodium or potassium alone is more strongly associated with blood pressure and related factors, including the renin-angiotensin system, arterial stiffness, the augmentation index, and endothelial dysfunction, in humans. This article presents a systematic review and synthesis of the randomized controlled trials and observational research related to this issue. The main findings show that, among the randomized controlled trials reviewed, the sodium-to-potassium ratio appears to be more strongly associated with blood pressure outcomes than either sodium or potassium alone in hypertensive adult populations. Recent data from the observational studies reviewed provide additional support for the sodium-to-potassium ratio as a superior metric to either sodium or potassium alone in the evaluation of blood pressure outcomes and incident hypertension. It remains unclear whether this is true in normotensive populations and in children and for related outcomes including the renin-angiotensin system, arterial stiffness, the augmentation index, and endothelial dysfunction. Future study in these populations is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Recent observational and clinical studies have raised interest in the potential health effects of cranberry consumption, an association that appears to be due to the phytochemical content of this fruit. The profile of cranberry bioactives is distinct from that of other berry fruit, being rich in A-type proanthocyanidins (PACs) in contrast to the B-type PACs present in most other fruit. Basic research has suggested a number of potential mechanisms of action of cranberry bioactives, although further molecular studies are necessary. Human studies on the health effects of cranberry products have focused principally on urinary tract and cardiovascular health, with some attention also directed to oral health and gastrointestinal epithelia. Evidence suggesting that cranberries may decrease the recurrence of urinary tract infections is important because a nutritional approach to this condition could lower the use of antibiotic treatment and the consequent development of resistance to these drugs. There is encouraging, but limited, evidence of a cardioprotective effect of cranberries mediated via actions on antioxidant capacity and lipoprotein profiles. The mixed outcomes from clinical studies with cranberry products could result from interventions testing a variety of products, often uncharacterized in their composition of bioactives, using different doses and regimens, as well as the absence of a biomarker for compliance to the protocol. Daily consumption of a variety of fruit is necessary to achieve a healthy dietary pattern, meet recommendations for micronutrient intake, and promote the intake of a diversity of phytochemicals. Berry fruit, including cranberries, represent a rich source of phenolic bioactives that may contribute to human health.",

    "abstract": "Sustainability has become an integral consideration of the dietary guidelines of many countries in recent decades. However, a lack of clear metrics and a shared approach to measuring the multiple components of sustainable diets has hindered progress toward generating the evidence needed to ensure the credibility of new guidelines. We performed a systematic literature review of empirical research studies on sustainable diets to identify the components of sustainability that were measured and the methods applied to do so. Two independent reviewers systematically searched 30 databases and other sources with the use of a uniform set of search terms and a priori exclusion criteria. In total, 113 empirical studies were included in the final review. Nearly all of the studies were focused on high-income countries. Although there was substantial heterogeneity in the components of sustainability measured, the estimated greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) of various dietary patterns were by far most commonly measured (n = 71 studies). Estimating the GHGEs of foods through various stages of production, use, and recycling with the use of the Life Cycle Assessment approach was the most common method applied to measure the environmental impacts of diets (n = 49 studies). Many components of sustainable diets identified in existing conceptual frameworks are disproportionately underrepresented in the empirical literature, as are studies that examine consumer demand for sustainable dietary alternatives. The emphasis in the literature on high-income countries also overlooks the production and dietary alternatives most relevant to low- and middle-income countries. We propose 3 methodological and measurement approaches that would both improve the global relevance of our understanding of sustainable diets and attend more completely to the existing multidimensional, multiscale conceptual framing of sustainable diets.",

However, consumer knowledge about GMOs has not increased at the same rate as the adoption of GMO crops. Consumers worldwide are displaying limited understanding, misconceptions, and even unfamiliarity with GMO food products. Many consumers report that they receive information about GMO food products from the media, Internet, and other news sources. These sources may be less reliable than scientific experts whom consumers trust more to present the facts. Although many in the United States support mandatory GMO labeling (similar to current European standards), consumer awareness of current GMO labeling is low. A distinction must also be made between GMO familiarity and scientific understanding, because those who are more familiar with it tend to be more resistant to bioengineering, whereas those with higher scientific knowledge scores tend to have less negative attitudes toward GMOs. This brings to question the relation between scientific literacy, sources of information, and overall consumer knowledge and perception of GMO foods.",

    "abstract": "Dental caries affects ≤80% of the world's population with almost a quarter of US adults having untreated caries. Dental caries is costly to health care and negatively affects well-being. Dietary free sugars are the most important risk factor for dental caries. The WHO has issued guidelines that recommend intake of free sugars should provide ≤10% of energy intake and suggest further reductions to <5% of energy to protect dental health throughout life. These recommendations were informed by a systematic review of the evidence pertaining to amount of sugars and dental caries risk, which showed evidence of moderate quality from cohort studies that limiting free sugars to ≤10% of energy reduced, but did not eliminate, dental caries. Even low levels of dental caries in children are of concern because caries is a lifelong progressive and cumulative disease. The systematic review therefore explored if there were further benefits to dental health if the intake of free sugars was limited to <5% of energy. Available data were from ecologic studies and, although classified as being of low quality, showed lower dental caries when free sugar intake was <5% of energy compared with when it was >5% but ≤10% of energy. The WHO recommendations are intended for use by policy makers as a benchmark when assessing intake of sugars by populations and as a driving force for policy change. Multiple strategies encompassing both upstream and downstream preventive approaches are now required to translate the recommendations into policy and practice.",

    "abstract": "Human studies have established a positive association between the intake of industrial trans fatty acids and the development of cardiovascular diseases, leading several countries to enact laws that restrict the presence of industrial trans fatty acids in food products. However, trans fatty acids cannot be completely eliminated from the human diet since they are also naturally present in meat and dairy products of ruminant animals. Moreover, bans on industrial trans fatty acids have not yet been instituted in all countries. The epidemiological evidence against trans fatty acids by far overshadows mechanistic insights that may explain how trans fatty acids achieve their damaging effects. This review focuses on the mechanisms that underlie the deleterious effects of trans fatty acids by juxtaposing effects of trans fatty acids against those of cis-unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids (SFAs). This review also carefully explores the argument that ruminant trans fatty acids have differential effects from industrial trans fatty acids. Overall, in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that industrial trans fatty acids promote inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, although to a lesser degree than SFAs, whereas cis-unsaturated fatty acids are protective against ER stress and inflammation. Additionally, industrial trans fatty acids promote fat storage in the liver at the expense of adipose tissue compared with cis-unsaturated fatty acids and SFAs. In cultured hepatocytes and adipocytes, industrial trans fatty acids, but not cis-unsaturated fatty acids or SFAs, stimulate the cholesterol synthesis pathway by activating sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) 2-mediated gene regulation. Interestingly, although industrial and ruminant trans fatty acids show similar effects on human plasma lipoproteins, in preclinical models, only industrial trans fatty acids promote inflammation, ER stress, and cholesterol synthesis. Overall, clearer insight into the molecular mechanisms of action of trans fatty acids may create new therapeutic windows for the treatment of diseases characterized by disrupted lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this systematic review was to determine if dairy product consumption is detrimental, neutral, or beneficial to cardiovascular health and if the recommendation to consume reduced-fat as opposed to regular-fat dairy is evidence-based. A systematic review of metaanalyses of prospective population studies associating dairy consumption with cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, hypertension, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) was conducted on the basis of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. Quality of evidence was rated by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation scale. High-quality evidence supports favorable associations between total dairy intake and hypertension risk and between low-fat dairy and yogurt intake and the risk of T2D. Moderate-quality evidence suggests favorable associations between intakes of total dairy, low-fat dairy, cheese, and fermented dairy and the risk of stroke; intakes of low-fat dairy and milk and the risk of hypertension; total dairy and milk consumption and the risk of MetS; and total dairy and cheese and the risk of T2D. High- to moderate-quality evidence supports neutral associations between the consumption of total dairy, cheese, and yogurt and CVD risk; the consumption of any form of dairy, except for fermented, and CAD risk; the consumption of regular- and high-fat dairy, milk, and yogurt and stroke risk; the consumption of regular- and high-fat dairy, cheese, yogurt, and fermented dairy and hypertension risk; and the consumption of regular- and high-fat dairy, milk, and fermented dairy and T2D risk. Data from this systematic review indicate that the consumption of various forms of dairy products shows either favorable or neutral associations with cardiovascular-related clinical outcomes. The review also emphasizes that further research is urgently needed to compare the impact of low-fat with regular- and high-fat dairy on cardiovascular-related clinical outcomes in light of current recommendations to consume low-fat dairy.",

    "abstract": "Food environment research is increasingly gaining prominence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, in the absence of a systematic review of the literature, little is known about the emerging body of evidence from these settings. This systematic scoping review aims to address this gap. A systematic search of 6 databases was conducted in December 2017 and retrieved 920 records. In total, 70 peer-reviewed articles met the eligibility criteria and were included. Collectively, articles spanned 22 LMICs, including upper-middle-income countries (n = 49, 70%) and lower-middle-income countries (n = 18, 26%). No articles included low-income countries. Articles featured quantitative (n = 45, 64%), qualitative (n = 17, 24%), and mixed-method designs (n = 11, 8%). Studies analyzed the food environment at national, community, school, and household scales. Twenty-three articles (55%) assessed associations between food environment exposures and outcomes of interest, including diets (n = 14), nutrition status (n = 13), and health (n = 1). Food availability was associated with dietary outcomes at the community and school scales across multiple LMICs, although associations varied by vendor type. Evidence regarding associations between the food environment and nutrition and health outcomes was inconclusive. The paucity of evidence from high-quality studies is a severe limitation, highlighting the critical need for improved study designs and standardized methods and metrics. Future food environment research must address low-income and lower-middle-income countries, and include the full spectrum of dietary, nutrition, and health outcomes. Improving the quality of food environment research will be critical to the design of feasible, appropriate, and effective interventions to improve public health nutrition in LMICs.",

    "abstract": "It is estimated that >90% of Americans do not consume sufficient dietary vitamin E, as α-tocopherol, to meet estimated average requirements. What are the adverse consequences of inadequate dietary α-tocopherol intakes? This review discusses health aspects where inadequate vitamin E status is detrimental and additional vitamin E has reversed the symptoms. In general, plasma α-tocopherol concentrations <12 μmol/L are associated with increased infection, anemia, stunting of growth, and poor outcomes during pregnancy for both the infant and the mother. When low dietary amounts of α-tocopherol are consumed, tissue α-tocopherol needs exceed amounts available, leading to increased damage to target tissues. Seemingly, adequacy of human vitamin E status cannot be assessed from circulating α-tocopherol concentrations, but inadequacy can be determined from \"low\" values. Circulating α-tocopherol concentrations are very difficult to interpret because, as a person ages, plasma lipid concentrations also increase and these elevations in lipids increase the plasma carriers for α-tocopherol, leading to higher circulating α-tocopherol concentrations. However, abnormal lipoprotein metabolism does not necessarily increase α-tocopherol delivery to tissues. Additional biomarkers of inadequate vitamin E status are needed. Urinary excretion of the vitamin E metabolite α-carboxy-ethyl-hydroxychromanol may fulfill this biomarker role, but it has not been widely studied with regard to vitamin E status in humans or with regard to health benefits. This review evaluated the information available on the adverse consequences of inadequate α-tocopherol status and provides suggestions for avenues for research.",

    "abstract": "Proteins from plant-based compared with animal-based food sources may have different effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Numerous epidemiologic and intervention studies have evaluated their respective health benefits; however, it is difficult to isolate the role of plant or animal protein on CVD risk. This review evaluates the current evidence from observational and intervention studies, focusing on the specific protein-providing foods and populations studied. Dietary protein is derived from many food sources, and each provides a different composite of nonprotein compounds that can also affect CVD risk factors. Increasing the consumption of protein-rich foods also typically results in lower intakes of other nutrients, which may simultaneously influence outcomes. Given these complexities, blanket statements about plant or animal protein may be too general, and greater consideration of the specific protein food sources and the background diet is required. The potential mechanisms responsible for any specific effects of plant and animal protein are similarly multifaceted and include the amino acid content of particular foods, contributions from other nonprotein compounds provided concomitantly by the whole food, and interactions with the gut microbiome. Evidence to date is inconclusive, and additional studies are needed to further advance our understanding of the complexity of plant protein vs. animal protein comparisons. Nonetheless, current evidence supports the idea that CVD risk can be reduced by a dietary pattern that provides more plant sources of protein compared with the typical American diet and also includes animal-based protein foods that are unprocessed and low in saturated fat.",

    "abstract": "To maintain planetary health, human activities must limit the use of Earth's resources within finite boundaries and avoid environmental degradation. At present, food systems account for a substantial use of natural resources and contribute considerably to climate change, degradation of land, water use, and other impacts, which in turn threaten human health through food insecurity. Additionally, current dietary patterns, rich in animal products and excessive in calories, are detrimental to both population and planetary health. In order to resolve the diet-environment-health trilemma, population-level dietary changes are essential. Vegetarian diets are reported to be healthy options. Most plant-sourced foods are less resource intense and taxing on the environment than the production of animal-derived foods, particularly meat and dairy from ruminants. This review article explores simultaneously the environmental sustainability of vegetarian diets, and its alignment with people's health. In general, the progression from omnivorous to ovolactovegetarian and vegan diets is associated with increased environmental sustainability. Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from vegan and ovolactovegetarian diets are ∼50% and ∼35% lower, respectively, than most current omnivore diets, and with corresponding reductions in the use of natural resources. Concomitant health benefits could be obtained by shifting from current dietary patterns to sustainable vegetarian diets. Thus, there seems to be an alignment of health and environmental outcomes for vegetarian diets. Although this shows the human health and environmental sustainability benefits of vegetarian diets in high-income countries, questions remain about the challenges in other contexts and the political will to promote meat-free diets as the social norm.",

    "abstract": "The monounsaturated fatty acid palmitoleate (palmitoleic acid) is one of the most abundant fatty acids in serum and tissues, particularly adipose tissue and liver. Its endogenous production by stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gives rise to its cis isoform, cis-palmitoleate. Although trans-palmitoleate is also synthesized in humans, it is mainly found as an exogenous source in ruminant fat and dairy products. Recently, palmitoleate was considered to be a lipokine based on evidence demonstrating its release from adipose tissue and its metabolic effects on distant organs. After this finding, research has been performed to determine whether palmitoleate has beneficial effects on metabolism and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Thus, the aim of this work was to review the current status of knowledge about palmitoleate, its metabolism, and its influence on metabolic abnormalities. Results have shown mixed cardiovascular effects, direct or inverse correlations with obesity, and hepatosteatosis, but a significant amelioration or prevention of insulin resistance and diabetes. Finally, the induction of palmitoleate release from adipose tissue, dietary intake, and its supplementation are all interventions with a potential impact on certain metabolic diseases.",

We aimed to systematically review and quantify these associations. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and CINAHL up to December 2017. Three authors independently conducted a literature search, study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. Summary effect sizes were calculated with random effects models and studies were summarized narratively if results could not be pooled. We included 36 studies and pooled results from 25 observational studies (167,507 participants). Two common dietary patterns-\"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\"-were identified. Healthy dietary patterns-characterized by high intakes of vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, low-fat dairy, and lean protein foods-were associated with lower risk of preterm birth (OR for top compared with bottom tertile: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.91; I2 = 32%) and a weak trend towards a lower risk of small-for-gestational-age (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.01; I2 = 34%). Only statistically data-driven healthy dietary patterns, and not dietary index-based patterns, were associated with higher birth weight (mean difference: 67 g; 95% CI: 37, 96 g; I2 = 75%). Unhealthy dietary patterns-characterized by high intakes of refined grains, processed meat, and foods high in saturated fat or sugar-were associated with lower birth weight (mean difference: -40 g; 95% CI: -61, -20 g; I2 = 0%) and a trend towards a higher risk of preterm birth (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.39; I2 = 76%). Data from observational studies indicate that greater adherence to healthy dietary patterns during pregnancy is significantly related to lower risk of preterm birth. No consistent associations with birth weight and small- or large-for-gestational-age were observed.",

    "abstract": "Fructose is associated with the biochemical alterations that promote the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes. Its consumption has increased in parallel with MetS. It is metabolized by the liver, where it stimulates de novo lipogenesis. The triglycerides synthesized lead to hepatic insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Fructose-derived advanced glycation end products (AGEs) may be involved via the Maillard reaction. Fructose has not been a main focus of glycation research because of the difficulty in measuring its adducts, and, more importantly, because although it is 10 times more reactive than glucose, its plasma concentration is only 1% of that of glucose. In this focused review, I summarize exogenous and endogenous fructose metabolism, fructose glycation, and in vitro, animal, and human data. Fructose is elevated in several tissues of diabetic patients where the polyol pathway is active, reaching the same order of magnitude as glucose. It is plausible that the high reactivity of fructose, directly or via its metabolites, may contribute to the formation of intracellular AGEs and to vascular complications. The evidence, however, is still unconvincing. Two areas that have been overlooked so far and should be actively explored include the following: 1) enteral formation of fructose AGEs, generating an inflammatory response to the receptor for AGEs (which may explain the strong association between fructose consumption and asthma, chronic bronchitis, and arthritis); and 2) inactivation of hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase by a fructose-mediated increase in methylglyoxal flux (perpetuating lipogenesis, fatty liver, and insulin resistance). If proven correct, these mechanisms would put the fructose-mediated Maillard reaction in the limelight again as a contributing factor in chronic inflammatory diseases and MetS.",

    "abstract": "Chrono-nutrition is an emerging research field in nutritional epidemiology that encompasses 3 dimensions of eating behavior: timing, frequency, and regularity. To date, few studies have investigated how an individual's circadian typology, i.e., one's chronotype, affects the association between chrono-nutrition and cardiometabolic health. This review sets the directions for future research by providing a narrative overview of recent epidemiologic research on chronotype, its determinants, and its association with dietary intake and cardiometabolic health. Limited research was found on the association between chronotype and dietary intake in infants, children, and older adults. Moreover, most of the evidence in adolescents and adults was restricted to cross-sectional surveys with few longitudinal cohorts simultaneously collecting data on chronotype and dietary intake. There was a gap in the research concerning the association between chronotype and the 3 dimensions of chrono-nutrition. Whether chronotype modifies the association between diet and cardiometabolic health outcomes remains to be elucidated. In conclusion, further research is required to understand the interplay between chronotype, chrono-nutrition, and cardiometabolic health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In 2013, the WHO recommended that all member states aim to reduce population salt intake by 30% by 2025. The year 2019 represents the midpoint, making it a critical time to assess countries' progress towards this target. This review aims to identify all national salt reduction initiatives around the world in 2019, and to quantify countries' progress in achieving the salt reduction target. Relevant data were identified through searches of peer-reviewed and gray literature, supplemented with responses from prefilled country questionnaires sent to known country leads of salt reduction or salt champions, WHO regional representatives, and international experts to request further information. Core characteristics of each country's strategy, including evaluations of program impact, were extracted and summarized. A total of 96 national salt reduction initiatives were identified, representing a 28% increase in the number reported in 2014. About 90% of the initiatives were multifaceted in approach, and 60% had a regulatory component. Approaches include interventions in settings (n= 74), food reformulation (n = 68), consumer education (n = 50), front-of-pack labeling (n = 48), and salt taxation (n = 5). Since 2014, there has been an increase in the number of countries implementing each of the approaches, except consumer education. Data on program impact were limited. There were 3 countries that reported a substantial decrease (>2 g/day), 9 that reported a moderate decrease (1-2 g/day), and 5 that reported a slight decrease (<1 g/day) in the mean salt intake over time, but none have yet met the targeted 30% relative reduction in salt intake from baseline. In summary, there has been an increase in the number of salt reduction initiatives around the world since 2014. More countries are now opting for structural or regulatory approaches. However, efforts must be urgently accelerated and replicated in other countries and more rigorous monitoring and evaluation of strategies is needed to achieve the salt reduction target.",

    "abstract": "Diet is an essential factor that affects the risk of modern-day metabolic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and Alzheimer disease. The potential ability of certain foods and their bioactive compounds to reverse or prevent the progression of the pathogenic processes that underlie these diseases has attracted research attention. Red raspberries (Rubus idaeus L.) are unique berries with a rich history and nutrient and bioactive composition. They possess several essential micronutrients, dietary fibers, and polyphenolic components, especially ellagitannins and anthocyanins, the latter of which give them their distinctive red coloring. In vitro and in vivo studies have revealed various mechanisms through which anthocyanins and ellagitannins (via ellagic acid or their urolithin metabolites) and red raspberry extracts (or the entire fruit) could reduce the risk of or reverse metabolically associated pathophysiologies. To our knowledge, few studies in humans are available for evaluation. We review and summarize the available literature that assesses the health-promoting potential of red raspberries and select components in modulating metabolic disease risk, especially cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and Alzheimer disease—all of which share critical metabolic, oxidative, and inflammatory links. The body of research is growing and supports a potential role for red raspberries in reducing the risk of metabolically based chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Fortification is the process of adding nutrients or non-nutrient bioactive components to edible products (e.g., food, food constituents, or supplements). Fortification can be used to correct or prevent widespread nutrient intake shortfalls and associated deficiencies, to balance the total nutrient profile of a diet, to restore nutrients lost in processing, or to appeal to consumers looking to supplement their diet. Food fortification could be considered as a public health strategy to enhance nutrient intakes of a population. Over the past century, fortification has been effective at reducing the risk of nutrient deficiency diseases such as beriberi, goiter, pellagra, and rickets. However, the world today is very different from when fortification emerged in the 1920s. Although early fortification programs were designed to eliminate deficiency diseases, current fortification programs are based on low dietary intakes rather than a diagnosable condition. Moving forward, we must be diligent in our approach to achieving effective and responsible fortification practices and policies, including responsible marketing of fortified products. Fortification must be applied prudently, its effects monitored diligently, and the public informed effectively about its benefits through consumer education efforts. Clear lines of authority for establishing fortification guidelines should be developed and should take into account changing population demographics, changes in the food supply, and advances in technology. This article is a summary of a symposium presented at the ASN Scientific Sessions and Annual Meeting at Experimental Biology 2014 on current issues involving fortification focusing primarily on the United States and Canada and recommendations for the development of responsible fortification practices to ensure their safety and effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Kidney stone disease (KSD) (alternatively nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis) is a global health care problem that affects people in almost all of developed and developing countries. Its prevalence has been continuously increasing with a high recurrence rate after stone removal. Although effective therapeutic modalities are available, preventive strategies for both new and recurrent stones are required to reduce physical and financial burdens of KSD. To prevent kidney stone formation, its etiology and risk factors should be first considered. Low urine output and dehydration are the common risks of all stone types, whereas hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, and hypocitraturia are the major risks of calcium stones. In this article, up-to-date knowledge on strategies (nutrition-based mainly) to prevent KSD is provided. Important roles of fluid intake (2.5–3.0 L/d), diuresis (>2.0–2.5 L/d), lifestyle and habit modifications (for example, maintain normal body mass index, fluid compensation for working in high-temperature environment, and avoid cigarette smoking), and dietary management [for example, sufficient calcium at 1000–1200 mg/d, limit sodium at 2 or 3–5 g/d of sodium chloride (NaCl), limit oxalate-rich foods, avoid vitamin C and vitamin D supplements, limit animal proteins to 0.8–1.0 g/kg body weight/d but increase plant proteins in patients with calcium and uric acid stone and those with hyperuricosuria, increase proportion of citrus fruits, and consider lime powder supplementation] are summarized. Moreover, uses of natural bioactive products (for example, caffeine, epigallocatechin gallate, and diosmin), medications (for example, thiazides, alkaline citrate, other alkalinizing agents, and allopurinol), bacterial eradication, and probiotics are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, it has become increasingly obvious that dietary fiber or nondigestible carbohydrate (NDC) consumption is critical for maintaining optimal health and managing symptoms of metabolic disease. In accordance with this, the US FDA released its first official definition of dietary fiber in 2016 for regulation of Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. Included in this definition is the requirement of an isolated or synthetic NDC to produce an accepted physiologic health benefit, such as improved laxation or reduced fasting cholesterol concentrations, upon consumption. Even though NDC fermentation and production of short-chain fatty acids elicit many physiologic effects, including serving as a source of energy for colonocytes, curbing glycemic response and satiety, promoting weight loss, enhancing mineral absorption, reducing systemic inflammation, and improving intestinal health, the process of fermentation is not considered a physiologic endpoint. Instead, expensive and laborious clinical trials must be conducted and an accepted physiologic benefit observed. In this review, we discuss the physiologic importance of NDC fermentation through extensive examination of clinical evidence and propose that the degree of fermentability of an NDC, rather than the endpoints of a clinical trial, may be appropriate for classifying it as a dietary fiber.",

    "abstract": "There is emerging evidence that an unhealthy dietary pattern may increase the risk of developing depression or anxiety, whereas a healthy dietary pattern may decrease it. This nascent research suggests that dietary interventions could help prevent, or be an alternative or adjunct therapy for, depression and anxiety. The relation, however, is complex, affected by many confounding variables, and is also likely to be bidirectional, with dietary choices being affected by stress and depression. This complexity is reflected in the data, with sometimes conflicting results among studies. As the research evolves, all characteristics of the relation need to be considered to ensure that we obtain a full understanding, which can potentially be translated into clinical practice. A parallel and fast-growing body of research shows that the gut microbiota is linked with the brain in a bidirectional relation, commonly termed the microbiome–gut–brain axis. Preclinical evidence suggests that this axis plays a key role in the regulation of brain function and behavior. In this review we discuss possible reasons for the conflicting results in diet–mood research, and present examples of areas of the diet–mood relation in which the gut microbiota is likely to be involved, potentially explaining some of the conflicting results from diet and depression studies. We argue that because diet is one of the most significant factors that affects human gut microbiota structure and function, nutritional intervention studies need to consider the gut microbiota as an essential piece of the puzzle.",

Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are widely tested inflammatory markers involved in the development of these diseases. Several studies indicate a relation between nutritional status and the concentrations of human high-sensitivity CRP and IL-6. Similarly, the role of diet in reducing inflammation and thereby modulating the risk of non-communicable diseases is supported by numerous studies. This review focuses on the effects of the selected nutrition models in humans on the concentrations of CRP and IL-6. It seems that the Mediterranean diet model is most effective in inhibiting inflammation. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension model and the plant nutrition model also have proven to be beneficial. The data on low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets are inconclusive. Comprehensive studies are necessary, taking into account the cumulative effect of dietary and other factors on the inflammatory process.",

    "abstract": "Inulin-type fructans (ITF), including short-chain fructooligosaccharides (scFOS), oligofructose, and inulin, are commonly used fibers that are widely regarded as prebiotic for their ability to be selectively utilized by the intestinal microbiota to confer a health benefit. However, to our knowledge the literature thus far lacks a thorough discussion of the evidence from human clinical trials for the prebiotic effect of ITF, including beneficial effects on intestinal microbiota composition and intestinal and extraintestinal processes (e.g., glucose homeostasis, lipids, mineral absorption and bone health, appetite and satiety, inflammation and immune function, and body composition). Additionally, there has been a lack of discussion regarding aspects such as the effect of ITF chain length on its intestinal and extraintestinal effects. The overall objective of this systematic review was to summarize the prebiotic potential of ITF based on the results of human clinical trials in healthy adult populations. Evidence from studies included in the current review suggest that ITF have a prebiotic effect on the intestinal microbiota, promoting the abundances of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Beneficial health effects reported following ITF intake include improved intestinal barrier function, improved laxation, increased insulin sensitivity, decreased triglycerides and an improved lipid profile, increased absorption of calcium and magnesium, and increased satiety. Although there is some evidence for differing effects of ITF based on chain length, the lack of direct comparisons and detailed descriptions of physicochemical properties limits the ability to draw conclusions from human clinical studies. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota mediates or modifies the effects of ITF on human health and the contribution of individual factors such as age and metabolic health to the movement toward personalization of prebiotic applications.",

    "abstract": "Strong experimental evidence confirms that HDL directly alleviates atherosclerosis. HDL particles display diverse atheroprotective functions in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic processes. In certain inflammatory disease states, however, HDL particles may become dysfunctional and proatherogenic. Flavonoids show the potential to improve HDL function through their well-documented effects on cellular antioxidant status and inflammation. The aim of this review is to summarize the basic science and clinical research examining the effects of dietary flavonoids on RCT and HDL function. Based on preclinical studies that used cell culture and rodent models, it appears that many flavonoids (e.g., anthocyanidins, flavonols, and flavone subclasses) influence RCT and HDL function beyond simple HDL cholesterol concentration by regulating cellular cholesterol efflux from macrophages and hepatic paraoxonase 1 expression and activity. In clinical studies, dietary anthocyanin intake is associated with beneficial changes in serum biomarkers related to HDL function in a variety of human populations (e.g., in those who are hyperlipidemic, hypertensive, or diabetic), including increased HDL cholesterol concentration, as well as HDL antioxidant and cholesterol efflux capacities. However, clinical research on HDL functionality is lacking for some flavonoid subclasses (e.g., flavanols, flavones, flavanones, and isoflavones). Although there has been a tremendous effort to develop HDL-targeted drug therapies, more research is warranted on how the intake of foods or specific nutrients affects HDL function.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a nutritional disorder resulting from a chronic imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. This disease is characterized by inflammation in multiple cell types, including macrophages. M1 macrophage responses are correlated with the progression of obesity or diabetes; therefore, strategies that induce repolarization of macrophages from an M1 to an M2 phenotype may be promising for the prevention of obesity- or diabetes-associated pathology. Glutamine (the most abundant amino acid in the plasma of humans and many other mammals including rats) is effective in inducing polarization of M2 macrophages through the glutamine-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pathway and α-ketoglutarate produced via glutaminolysis, whereas succinate synthesized via glutamine-dependent anerplerosis or the γ-aminobutyric acid shunt promotes polarization of M1 macrophages. Interestingly, patients with obesity or diabetes show altered glutamine metabolism, including decreases in glutamine and α-ketoglutarate concentrations in serum but increases in succinate concentrations. Thus, manipulation of macrophage polarization through glutamine metabolism may provide a potential target for prevention of obesity- or diabetes-associated pathology.",

    "abstract": "The long-term associations between the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and low-calorie sweetened beverages (LCSBs) with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains inconsistent. To synthesize the evidence, we conducted a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies published up to 1 December, 2019 on the associations between SSB and LCSB intake and the risk of CVD incidence and mortality. Out of 5301 articles retrieved from our literature search, 11 articles evaluating the consumption of SSBs (16,915 incident CVD cases, 18,042 CVD deaths) and 8 articles evaluating the consumption of LCSBs (18,077 incident CVD cases, 14,114 CVD deaths) were included in the meta-analysis. A 1 serving/d increment of SSBs was associated with an 8% (RR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.14, I2 = 43.0%) and 8% (RR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.13, I2 = 40.6%) higher risk of CVD incidence and CVD mortality, respectively. A 1 serving/d increment of LCSBs was associated with a 7% (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.10, I2 = 0.0%) higher risk of CVD incidence. The association between LCSBs and CVD mortality appeared to be nonlinear (P = 0.003 for nonlinearity) with significant associations observed at high intake levels (>2 servings/d). Under an assumption of causality, the consumption of SSBs may be linked to 9.3% (95% CI: 6.6%, 11.9%) of predicted CVD incidence in the USA from 2015 to 2025, among men and nonpregnant women, who were aged 40-79 y in 2015-2016. The habitual consumption of SSBs was associated with a higher risk of CVD morbidity and mortality in a dose-response manner. LCSBs were also associated with a higher risk of these outcomes, however, the interpretation of these findings may be complicated by reverse causation and residual confounding.",

    "abstract": "Water security is a powerful concept that is still in its early days in the field of nutrition. Given the prevalence and severity of water issues and the many interconnections between water and nutrition, we argue that water security deserves attention commensurate with its importance to human nutrition and health. To this end, we first give a brief introduction to water insecurity and discuss its conceptualization in terms of availability, access, use, and stability. We then lay out the empirical grounding for its assessment. Parallels to the food-security literature are drawn throughout, both because the concepts are analogous and food security is familiar to the nutrition community. Specifically, we review the evolution of scales to measure water and food security and compare select characteristics. We then review the burgeoning evidence for the causes and consequences of water insecurity and conclude with 4 recommendations: 1) collect more water-insecurity data (i.e., on prevalence, causes, consequences, and intervention impacts); 2) collect better data on water insecurity (i.e., measure it concurrently with food security and other nutritional indicators, measure intrahousehold variation, and establish baseline indicators of both water and nutrition before interventions are implemented); 3) consider food and water issues jointly in policy and practice (e.g., establish linkages and possibilities for joint interventions, recognize the environmental footprint of nutritional guidelines, strengthen the nutrition sensitivity of water-management practices, and use experience-based scales for improving governance and regulation across food and water systems); and 4) make findings easily available so that they can be used by the media, community organizations, and other scientists for advocacy and in governance (e.g., tracking progress towards development goals and holding implementers accountable). As recognition of the importance of water security grows, we hope that so too will the prioritization of water in nutrition research, funding, and policy.",

Evidence from nutritional interventions aimed at alleviating inflammation could be a promising approach for the prevention of adverse health outcomes. We therefore aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to summarize the recent evidence on the effects of dietary patterns on inflammatory and immune-related biomarkers in humans. PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science databases were searched for publications up to October 2020. In total, 22 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The Mediterranean diet appeared as the dietary pattern that showed the most prominent reductions of inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6 [mean difference (MD): -1.07 pg/mL (95% CI: -1.94, -0.20); I2: 96%], IL-1β [MD: -0.46 pg/mL (95% CI: -0.66, -0.25); I2: 0%], and C-reactive protein [MD: -1.00 mg/L (95% CI: -2.02, 0.01); I2: 100%]. No substantial effects were observed for the additional dietary patterns studied in intervention research, including the Dietary Adherence to Stop Hypertension diet, and the vegetarian or vegan diets. Future large-scale multifactorial intervention studies are warranted to allow direct comparison of various dietary patterns in relation to a range of biomarkers reflecting multiple inflammatory and immune-related pathways.",

This systematic scoping review aimed to present a comprehensive inventory of DDIs and summarize evidence linking DDIs and dietary adequacy or health outcomes in adolescents and adults. Two search strategies were developed to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English up until June 2018 and were applied to Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus. A 2-stage screening process was used to select the studies to be reviewed. Four types of DDIs were identified among 161 articles, the majority of them belonging to the food group-based indicator type (n = 106 articles). Fifty studies indicated that DDIs were proxies of nutrient adequacy, but there was a lack of evidence about their relation with nutrients to limit. Associations between DDIs and health outcomes were largely inconsistent among 137 studies, especially when the outcomes studied were body weight (n = 60) and noncommunicable diseases (n = 41). We conclude that the ability of DDIs to reflect diet quality was found to be principally limited to micronutrient adequacy and that DDIs do not readily relate to health outcomes. These findings have implications for studies in low- and lower-middle-income economies where DDIs are often used to assess dietary patterns and overall diet quality.",

    "abstract": "The athlete's goal is to optimize their performance. Towards this end, nutrition has been used to improve the health of athletes' brains, bones, muscles, and cardiovascular system. However, recent research suggests that the gut and its resident microbiota may also play a role in athlete health and performance. Therefore, athletes should consider dietary strategies in the context of their potential effects on the gut microbiota, including the impact of sports-centric dietary strategies (e.g., protein supplements, carbohydrate loading) on the gut microbiota as well as the effects of gut-centric dietary strategies (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics) on performance. This review provides an overview of the interaction between diet, exercise, and the gut microbiota, focusing on dietary strategies that may impact both the gut microbiota and athletic performance. Current evidence suggests that the gut microbiota could, in theory, contribute to the effects of dietary intake on athletic performance by influencing microbial metabolite production, gastrointestinal physiology, and immune modulation. Common dietary strategies such as high protein and simple carbohydrate intake, low fiber intake, and food avoidance may adversely impact the gut microbiota and, in turn, performance. Conversely, intake of adequate dietary fiber, a variety of protein sources, and emphasis on unsaturated fats, especially omega-3 (ɷ-3) fatty acids, in addition to consumption of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics, have shown promising results in optimizing athlete health and performance. Ultimately, while this is an emerging and promising area of research, more studies are needed that incorporate, control, and manipulate all 3 of these elements (i.e., diet, exercise, and gut microbiome) to provide recommendations for athletes on how to \"fuel their microbes.\"",

There is increasing evidence for ALA largely based on its major food sources (i.e., walnuts and flaxseed); however, this lags behind our understanding of long-chain n-3 fatty acids. Meta-analyses of observational studies have shown that increasing dietary ALA is associated with a 10% lower risk of total cardiovascular disease and a 20% reduced risk of fatal coronary heart disease. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [AlphaOmega trial, Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) trial, and Lyon Diet Heart Study] all showed benefits of diets high in ALA on cardiovascular-related outcomes, but the AlphaOmega trial, designed to specifically evaluate ALA effects, only showed a trend for benefit. RCTs have shown that dietary ALA reduced total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and epidemiologic studies and some trials also have shown an anti-inflammatory effect of ALA, which collectively account for, in part, the cardiovascular benefits of ALA. A meta-analysis reported a trend toward diabetes risk reduction with both dietary and biomarker ALA. For metabolic syndrome and obesity, the evidence for ALA benefits is inconclusive. The role of ALA in cognition is in the early stages but shows promising evidence of counteracting cognitive impairment. Much has been learned about the health benefits of ALA and with additional research we will be better positioned to make strong evidence-based dietary recommendations for the reduction of many chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Data currently generated in the field of nutrition are becoming increasingly complex and high-dimensional, bringing with them new methods of data analysis. The characteristics of machine learning (ML) make it suitable for such analysis and thus lend itself as an alternative tool to deal with data of this nature. ML has already been applied in important problem areas in nutrition, such as obesity, metabolic health, and malnutrition. Despite this, experts in nutrition are often without an understanding of ML, which limits its application and therefore potential to solve currently open questions. The current article aims to bridge this knowledge gap by supplying nutrition researchers with a resource to facilitate the use of ML in their research. ML is first explained and distinguished from existing solutions, with key examples of applications in the nutrition literature provided. Two case studies of domains in which ML is particularly applicable, precision nutrition and metabolomics, are then presented. Finally, a framework is outlined to guide interested researchers in integrating ML into their work. By acting as a resource to which researchers can refer, we hope to support the integration of ML in the field of nutrition to facilitate modern research.",

We searched PubMed (Medline), Cochrane CENTRAL, and Embase for articles, irrespective of language or geography. Inclusion criteria were: 1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, cohort studies, and pre/post studies with control; 2) participants aged ≤10.9 y at exposure; 3) studies reporting greater consumption of unhealthy foods/beverages compared with no or low consumption; 4) studies assessing anthropometric and/or body composition; and 5) publication date ≥1971. Unhealthy foods and beverages were defined using nutrient- and food-based approaches. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I (risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions version I) and RoB2 [Cochrane RoB (version 2)] tools for nonrandomized and randomized studies, respectively. Narrative synthesis was complemented by meta-analyses where appropriate. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Of 26,542 identified citations, 60 studies from 71 articles were included. Most studies were observational (59/60), and no included studies were from low-income countries. The evidence base was low quality, as assessed by ROBINS-I and RoB2 tools. Evidence synthesis was limited by the different interventions and comparators across studies. Evidence indicated that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and unhealthy foods in childhood may increase BMI/BMI z-score, percentage body fat, or odds of overweight/obesity (low certainty of evidence). Artificially sweetened beverages and 100% fruit juice consumption make little/no difference to BMI, percentage body fat, or overweight/obesity outcomes (low certainty of evidence). Meta-analyses of a subset of studies indicated a positive association between SSB intake and percentage body fat, but no association with change in BMI and BMI z-score. High-quality epidemiological studies that are designed to assess the effects of unhealthy food consumption during childhood on risk of overweight/obesity are needed to contribute to a more robust evidence base upon which to design policy recommendations.

    "abstract": "In many non-Asian countries, soy is consumed via soy-based meat and dairy alternatives, in addition to the traditional Asian soyfoods, such as tofu and miso. Meat alternatives are typically made using concentrated sources of soy protein, such as soy protein isolate (SPI) and soy protein concentrate (SPC). Therefore, these products are classified as ultra-processed foods (UPFs; group 4) according to NOVA, an increasingly widely used food-classification system that classifies all foods into 1 of 4 groups according to the processing they undergo. Furthermore, most soymilks, even those made from whole soybeans, are also classified as UPFs because of the addition of sugars and emulsifiers. Increasingly, recommendations are being made to restrict the consumption of UPFs because their intake is associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes. Critics of UPFs argue these foods are unhealthful for a wide assortment of reasons. Explanations for the proposed adverse effects of UPFs include their high energy density, high glycemic index (GI), hyper-palatability, and low satiety potential. Claims have also been made that UPFs are not sustainably produced. However, this perspective argues that none of the criticisms of UPFs apply to soy-based meat and dairy alternatives when compared with their animal-based counterparts, beef and cow milk, which are classified as unprocessed or minimally processed foods (group 1). Classifying soy-based meat and dairy alternatives as UPFs may hinder their public acceptance, which could detrimentally affect personal and planetary health. In conclusion, the NOVA classification system is simplistic and does not adequately evaluate the nutritional attributes of meat and dairy alternatives based on soy.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is one of the primary causes of death worldwide, and its incidence continues to increase yearly. Despite significant advances in research, the search for effective and nontoxic preventive and therapeutic agents remains greatly important. Cancer is a multimodal disease, where various mechanisms play significant roles in its occurrence and progression. This highlights the need for multitargeted approaches that are not only safe and inexpensive but also provide effective alternatives for current therapeutic regimens. β-Sitosterol (SIT), the most abundant phytosterol found in various plant foods, represents such an option. Preclinical evidence over the past few decades has overwhelmingly shown that SIT exhibits multiple anticancer activities against varied cancers, such as liver, cervical, colon, stomach, breast, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, in addition to leukemia, multiple myeloma, melanoma, and fibrosarcoma. In this article, we present the latest advances and perspectives on SIT-systematically summarizing its antitumor mechanisms of action into 7 main sections and combining current challenges and prospects-for its use as a promising agent for cancer prevention and treatment. In particular, SIT plays a role in cancer prevention and treatment mainly by enhancing apoptosis, inducing cell cycle arrest, bidirectionally regulating oxidative stress, improving metabolic reprogramming, inhibiting invasion and metastasis, modulating immunity and inflammation, and combating drug resistance. Although SIT holds such great promise, the poor aqueous solubility and bioavailability coupled with low targeting efficacy limit its therapeutic efficacy and clinical application. Further research on novel drug delivery systems may improve these deficiencies. Overall, through complex and pleiotropic mechanisms, SIT has good potential for tumor chemoprevention and chemotherapy.

    "abstract": "Epidemiologic evidence supports a positive association between ultraprocessed food (UPF) consumption and body mass index. This has led to recommendations to avoid UPFs despite very limited evidence establishing causality. Many mechanisms have been proposed, and this review critically aimed to evaluate selected possibilities for specificity, clarity, and consistency related to food choice (i.e., low cost, shelf-life, food packaging, hyperpalatability, and stimulation of hunger/suppression of fullness); food composition (i.e., macronutrients, food texture, added sugar, fat and salt, energy density, low-calorie sweeteners, and additives); and digestive processes (i.e., oral processing/eating rate, gastric emptying time, gastrointestinal transit time, and microbiome). For some purported mechanisms (e.g., fiber content, texture, gastric emptying, and intestinal transit time), data directly contrasting the effects of UPF and non-UPF intake on the indices of appetite, food intake, and adiposity are available and do not support a unique contribution of UPFs. In other instances, data are not available (e.g., microbiome and food additives) or are insufficient (e.g., packaging, food cost, shelf-life, macronutrient intake, and appetite stimulation) to judge the benefits versus the risks of UPF avoidance. There are yet other evoked mechanisms in which the preponderance of evidence indicates ingredients in UPFs actually moderate body weight (e.g., low-calorie sweetener use for weight management; beverage consumption as it dilutes energy density; and higher fat content because it reduces glycemic responses). Because avoidance of UPFs holds potential adverse effects (e.g., reduced diet quality, increased risk of food poisoning, and food wastage), it is imprudent to make recommendations regarding their role in diets before causality and plausible mechanisms have been verified.",

    "abstract": "The immune system is key to host defense against pathogenic organisms. Aging is associated with changes in the immune system, with a decline in protective components (immunosenescence), increasing susceptibility to infectious disease, and a chronic elevation in low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), increasing the risk of multiple noncommunicable diseases. Nutrition is a determinant of immune cell function and of the gut microbiota. In turn, the gut microbiota shapes and controls the immune and inflammatory responses. Many older people show changes in the gut microbiota. Age-related changes in immune competence, low-grade inflammation, and gut dysbiosis may be interlinked and may relate, at least in part, to age-related changes in nutrition. A number of micronutrients (vitamins C, D, and E and zinc and selenium) play roles in supporting the function of many immune cell types. Some trials report that providing these micronutrients as individual supplements can reverse immune deficits in older people and/or in those with insufficient intakes. There is inconsistent evidence that this will reduce the risk or severity of infections including respiratory infections. Probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic strategies that modulate the gut microbiota, especially by promoting the colonization of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, have been demonstrated to modulate some immune and inflammatory biomarkers in older people and, in some cases, to reduce the risk and severity of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, although, again, the evidence is inconsistent. Further research with well-designed and well-powered trials in at-risk older populations is required to be more certain about the role of micronutrients and of strategies that modify the gut microbiota-host relationship in protecting against infection, especially respiratory infection.",

However, the classifications of PBDs vary depending on the type of diet. Some PBDs have been recognized as healthful for their high content of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber, or unhealthful if they are high in simple sugars and saturated fat. Depending on this classification, the type of PBD impacts its protective effects against disease dramatically. Metabolic syndrome (MetS), characterized by the presence of high plasma triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, impaired glucose metabolism, elevated blood pressure, and increased concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers, also increases the risk for heart disease and diabetes. Thus, healthful plant-based diets could be considered favorable for individuals having MetS. The different types of plant-based diets (vegan, lacto-vegetarian, lacto-ovo-vegetarian, or pescatarian) are discussed with a focus on specific effects of dietary components in maintaining a healthy weight, protecting against dyslipidemias, insulin resistance, hypertension, and low-grade inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The timing and nutritional composition of food intake are important zeitgebers for the biological clocks in humans. Thus, eating at an inappropriate time (e.g., during the night) may have a desynchronizing effect on the biological clocks and, in the long term, may result in adverse health outcomes (e.g., weight gain, obesity, and poor metabolic function). Being a very late or early chronotype not only determines preferred sleep and wake times but may also influence subsequent mealtimes, which may affect the circadian timing system. In recent years, an increased number of studies have examined the relation between chronotype and health outcomes, with a main focus on absolute food intake and metabolic markers and, to a lesser extent, on dietary intake distribution and eating behavior. Therefore, this review aimed to systematically determine whether chronotype indirectly affects eating behaviors, dietary intake (timing, choice, nutrients), and biomarkers leading to body composition outcomes in healthy adults. A systematic literature search on electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane library) was performed (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews number: CRD42020219754). Only studies that included healthy adults (aged >18 y), classified according to chronotype and body composition profiles, using outcomes of dietary intake, eating behavior, and/or biomarkers, were considered. Of 4404 articles, 24 met the inclusion criteria. The results revealed that late [evening type (ET)] compared with early [morning type (MT)] chronotypes were more likely to be overweight/obese with poorer metabolic health. Both MT and ET had similar energy and macronutrient intakes, consuming food during their preferred sleep–wake timing: later for ET than MT. Most of the energy and macronutrient intakes were distributed toward nighttime for ET and exacerbated by unhealthy eating behaviors and unfavorable dietary intakes. These findings from our systematic review give further insight why higher rates of overweight/obesity and unhealthier metabolic biomarkers are more likely to occur in ET.",

A better understanding of the effects of Mediterranean diet-based interventions on anthropometric variables could facilitate their implementation in efforts to prevent obesity in the young population. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of Mediterranean diet-based interventions on anthropometric and obesity indicators among children and adolescents. Four databases were systematically searched (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), including all studies up until 15 March, 2023. Eligible articles were randomized controlled trials measuring the effect of an intervention based on the promotion of the Mediterranean diet and obesity-associated parameters. The effect size of each study was estimated by Cohen's d for continuous variables or risk difference for categorical variables. Compared to the control group, the Mediterranean diet-based interventions showed small and significant reductions in body mass index (d = -0.14; 95% CI: -0.26, -0.01; I2 = 77.52%). Participants in the Mediterranean diet-based interventions had a significant reduction in the percentage of obesity (risk difference = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.23; I2 = 84.56%) in comparison with the control group. Interventions had greater effects when aiming at participants with excess weight (that is, overweight or obesity), both for body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, percentage of obesity, and percentage of abdominal obesity. Mediterranean diet-based interventions have a significant effect on reducing the body mass index as well as reducing obesity in children and adolescents (aged 3-18 y).

    "abstract": "The retirement phase is an opportunity to integrate healthy (nutrition/exercise) habits into daily life. We conducted this systematic review to assess which nutrition and exercise interventions most effectively improve body composition (fat/muscle mass), body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) in persons with obesity/overweight near retirement age (ages 55–70 y). We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trials, searching 4 databases from their inception up to July 12, 2022. The NMA was based on a random effects model, pooled mean differences, standardized mean differences, their 95% confidence intervals, and correlations with multi-arm studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Ninety-two studies were included, 66 of which with 4957 participants could be used for the NMA. Identified interventions were clustered into 12 groups: no intervention, energy restriction (i.e., 500–1000 kcal), energy restriction plus high-protein intake (1.1–1.7 g/kg/body weight), intermittent fasting, mixed exercise (aerobic and resistance), resistance training, aerobic training, high protein plus resistance training, energy restriction plus high protein plus exercise, energy restriction plus resistance training, energy restriction plus aerobic training, and energy restriction plus mixed exercise. Intervention durations ranged from 8 wk to 6 mo. Body fat was reduced with energy restriction plus any exercise or plus high-protein intake. Energy restriction alone was less effective and tended to decrease muscle mass. Muscle mass was only significantly increased with mixed exercise. All other interventions including exercise effectively preserved muscle mass. A BMI and/or WC decrease was achieved with all interventions except aerobic training/resistance training alone or resistance training plus high protein. Overall, the most effective strategy for nearly all outcomes was combining energy restriction with resistance training or mixed exercise and high protein. Health care professionals involved in the management of persons with obesity need to be aware that an energy-restricted diet alone may contribute to sarcopenic obesity in persons near retirement age.

    "abstract": "Evidence of associations between ultra-processed foods (UPF) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease is emerging, but it is unclear how much this is influenced by the methodology used to assess the UPF intake or by the level of consumption. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate 1) the association between UPF consumption and risk of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, using prospective cohort studies; 2) the differential associations depending on the methodology used to assess UPF intake and the level of UPF consumption and 3) the quality of evidence using the NutriGrade scoring system. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus through 1 April, 2023, on studies conducted in humans providing data for the highest compared with the lowest UPF consumption categories. Summary relative ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using a random-effects model. Out of 4522 articles retrieved from the literature search, 25 reports met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis, 7 for diabetes, 5 for hypertension, 3 for dyslipidemia, and 13 for obesity. A consistently positive association between high UPF intake and increased risk of developing diabetes (37%), hypertension (32%), hypertriglyceridemia (47%), low HDL cholesterol concentration (43%), and obesity (32%) was observed, even if the quality of evidence was not satisfying. However, these risks varied significantly depending on the methodology used to assess UPF consumption, with a difference of more than 50% between the methods. Based on the level of intake, we did not observe significant differences in the results. These findings show that UPF consumption is associated with higher risk of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, but the level of risk consistently changes depending on the methodology used to assess UPF intake. Therefore, caution should be used when interpreting and extrapolating the results.",

    "abstract": "Resistant starch (RS) has become a popular topic of research in recent years. Most scholars believe that there are 5 types of RS. However, accumulating evidence indicates that in addition to starch-lipid complexes, which are the fifth type of RS, complexes containing starch and other substances can also be generated. The physicochemical properties and physiologic functions of these complexes are worth exploring. New physiologic functions of several original RSs are constantly being discovered. Research shows that RS can provide health improvements in many patients with chronic diseases, including diabetes and obesity, and even has potential benefits for kidney disease and colorectal cancer. Moreover, RS can alter the short-chain fatty acids and microorganisms in the gut, positively regulating the body's internal environment. Despite the increase in its market demand, RS production remains limited. Upscaling RS production is thus an urgent requirement. This paper provides detailed insights into the classification, synthesis, and efficacy of RS, serving as a starting point for the future development and applications of RS based on the current status quo.",

    "abstract": "Each cell is equipped with a conserved housekeeping mechanism, known as autophagy, to recycle exhausted materials and dispose of injured organelles via lysosomal degradation. Autophagy is an early-stage cellular response to stress stimuli in both physiological and pathological situations. It is thought that the promotion of autophagy flux prevents host cells from subsequent injuries by removing damaged organelles and misfolded proteins. As a correlate, the modulation of autophagy is suggested as a therapeutic approach in diverse pathological conditions. Accumulated evidence suggests that intermittent fasting or calorie restriction can lead to the induction of adaptive autophagy and increase longevity of eukaryotic cells. However, prolonged calorie restriction with excessive autophagy response is harmful and can stimulate a type II autophagic cell death. Despite the existence of a close relationship between calorie deprivation and autophagic response in different cell types, the precise molecular mechanisms associated with this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, we aimed to highlight the possible effects of prolonged and short-term calorie restriction on autophagic response and cell homeostasis.",

As the NAD+ concentration in human skin, blood, liver, muscle and brain are thought to decrease with age, finding ways to increase NAD+ status could possibly influence the ageing process and associated metabolic sequelae. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a precursor for NAD+ biosynthesis, and in vitro/in vivo studies have demonstrated that NMN supplementation increases NAD+ concentration and could mitigate ageing-related disorders such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses. The promotion of NMN as an anti-ageing health supplement has gained popularity due to such findings; however, since most studies evaluating the effects of NMN have been conducted in cell or animal models, a concern remains regarding the safety and physiological effects of NMN supplementation in the human population. Nonetheless, a dozen human clinical trials with NMN supplementation are currently underway. This review summarizes the current progress of these trials and NMN/NAD+ biology to clarify the potential effects of NMN supplementation and to shed light on future study directions.",

    "abstract": "Through diverse roles, zinc determines a greater number of critical life functions than any other single micronutrient. Beyond the well-recognized importance of zinc for child growth and resistance to infections, zinc has numerous specific roles covering the regulation of glucose metabolism, and growing evidence links zinc deficiency with increased risk of diabetes and cardiometabolic disorders. Zinc nutriture is thus vitally important to health across the life course. Zinc deficiency is also one of the most common forms of micronutrient malnutrition globally. A clearer estimate of the burden of health disparity attributable to zinc deficiency in adulthood and later life emerges when accounting for its contribution to global elevated fasting blood glucose and related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Yet progress attenuating its prevalence has been limited due, in part, to the lack of sensitive and specific methods to assess human zinc status. This narrative review covers recent developments in our understanding of zinc's role in health; the impact of the changing climate and global context on zinc intake; novel functional biomarkers showing promise for monitoring population-level interventions; and solutions for improving population zinc intake. It aims to spur on implementation of evidence-based interventions for preventing and controlling zinc deficiency across the life course. Increasing zinc intake and combatting global zinc deficiency requires context-specific strategies and a combination of complementary, evidence-based interventions including supplementation, food fortification, and food and agricultural solutions such as biofortification, alongside efforts to improve zinc bioavailability. Enhancing dietary zinc content and bioavailability through zinc biofortification is an inclusive nutrition solution that can benefit the most vulnerable individuals and populations affected by inadequate diets to the greatest extent.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), contributes to substantial morbidity. Understanding the intricate interplay between dietary factors and the incidence and progression of IBD is essential for developing effective preventative and therapeutic strategies. This umbrella review comprehensively synthesizes evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses to evaluate these complex associations. Dietary factors associated with an increased incidence and/or progression of IBD include a high intake of red and processed meat, other processed foods, and refined sugars, together with a low intake of vegetables, fruits, and fiber. For most other food groups, the results are mixed or indicate no clear associations with IBD, CD, and UC. Some differences seem to exist between UC and CD and their risk factors, with increased intake of dietary fiber being inversely associated with CD incidence but not clearly associated with UC. Dietary fiber may contribute to maintaining the gut epithelial barrier and reduce inflammation, often through interactions with the gut microbiota. This seems to play an important role in inflammatory mechanisms in the gut and in IBD incidence and progression. Diets low in fermentable saccharides and polyols can alleviate symptom burden, but there are concerns regarding their impact on the gut microbiota and their nutritional adequacy. Mediterranean diets, vegetarian diets, and a diet low in grains, sugars, and lactose (specific carbohydrate diet) are also associated with lower incidence and/or progression of IBD. The associations of dietary patterns are mirrored by inflammatory biomarkers. IBD is typically treated pharmaceutically; however, many patients have a suboptimal response to medical treatments. The findings from this umbrella review could provide evidence for nutritional counseling and be a valuable addition to traditional treatment plans for IBD.

Previous systematic reviews have demonstrated benefits of the MIND diet for cognition and dementia, though an update is needed. Additionally, other outcomes relevant to brain aging have not been summarized. Therefore, this systematic review aims to give an up-to-date and complete overview on human studies that examined the MIND diet in relation to brain aging outcomes in adults aged ≥40 y. Ovid Medline, Web of Science core collection, and Scopus were searched up to July 25, 2023. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. We included 40 articles, of which 32 were unique cohorts. Higher MIND diet adherence was protective of dementia in 7 of 10 cohorts. Additionally, positive associations were demonstrated in 3 of 4 cohorts for global cognition and 4 of 6 cohorts for episodic memory. The protective effects of the MIND diet on cognitive decline are less apparent, with only 2 of 7 longitudinal cohorts demonstrating positive associations for global decline and 1 of 6 for episodic memory decline. For other brain outcomes (domain-specific cognition, cognitive impairments, Parkinson's disease, brain volume, and pathology), results were mixed or only few studies had been performed. Many of the cohorts demonstrating protective associations were of North American origin, raising the question if the most favorable diet for healthy brain aging is population-dependent. In conclusion, this systematic review provides observational evidence for protective associations between the MIND diet and global cognition and dementia risk, but evidence for other brain outcomes remains mixed and/or limited. The MIND diet may be the preferred diet for healthy brain aging in North American populations, though evidence for other populations seems less conclusive.

On the basis of the scientific literature, the authors engaged in consensus decision making in selecting nutrition-related determinants of health within each domain and socioecological level when creating the NHDF. The framework identifies how neighborhood food availability and access (individual/built environment) intersect with cultural norms and practices (interpersonal/sociocultural environment) to influence dietary behaviors, exposures, and risk of diet-related diseases. In addition, the NHDF shows how factors such as genetic predisposition (individual/biology), family dietary practices (interpersonal/behavioral), and food marketing policies (societal) may impact the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages and increase chronic disease risk. Family and peer norms (interpersonal/behavior) related to breastfeeding and early childhood nutrition interact with resource-poor environments such as lack of access to preventive healthcare settings (societal/healthcare system) and low usage of federal nutrition programs (societal/behavioral), which may increase risk of poor nutrition during childhood and food insecurity. The NHDF describes the synergistic interrelationships among factors at different levels of the socioecological model that influence nutrition-related outcomes and exacerbate health disparities. The framework is a useful resource for nutrition researchers, practitioners, food industry leaders, and policymakers interested in improving diet-related health outcomes and promoting health equity in diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "The food systems sustainability framework has four domains: nutrition, economics, environment, and society. To qualify as sustainable, individual foods and total diets need to be nutrient-rich, affordable, environmentally friendly, and socially acceptable. Pork is the most consumed meat globally, providing high-quality protein and several priority micronutrients. With research attention focused on plant-based diets, it is time to assess the place of pork meat protein in the global sustainability framework. First, not all proteins are equal. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) category of protein foods includes meat, poultry and fish, eggs, beans and legumes, and nuts and seeds. These protein sources have different protein digestibility profiles, different per calorie prices, and different environmental footprints, measured in terms of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). Second, most analyses of animal-source proteins combine beef, pork and lamb into a single category of red meat. Beef, pork and lamb have different nutrient profiles, different protein costs, and different impacts on the environment. Future analyses of nutrient density and monetary and carbon cost of alternative diets would do well to separate pork from beef, lamb, and chicken. There are also different profiles of global food demand. Prior analyses of global FAOSTAT food balance sheets joined with World Bank country incomes have consistently shown that rising incomes across lower-and middle-income countries (LMIC) create a growing demand for meat to replace the traditional plant proteins. Most of the observed increase has been for pork and chicken rather than beef. This ongoing LMIC protein transition toward more animal proteins may be irreversible as long as incomes grow. The present analyses explore the place of pork in sustainable healthy diets worldwide, given the need for high quality protein and the predictable patterns of global food demand.",

This perspective article summarizes the components of traditional Latin American, Asian, and African heritage diets, their association with diet quality and markers of health, and implications for nutrition programs and policy. Though these diets differ in specific foods and flavors, we present a common thread that emphasizes healthful plant foods and that is consistent with high dietary quality and low rates of major causes of disability and deaths. In this perspective, we propose that nutrition interventions that incorporate these cultural models of healthy eating show promise, though further research is needed to determine health outcomes and best practices for implementation.",

    "abstract": "The 2-component molecular-level model dividing body mass into fat and fat-free mass (FFM) is a cornerstone of contemporary body composition research across multiple disciplines. Confusion prevails, however, as the term lean body mass (LBM) is frequently used interchangeably with FFM in scientific discourse. Are LBM and FFM the same or different body components? Captain Albert R. Behnke originated the LBM concept in 1942 and he argued that his \"physiological\" LBM component included \"essential\" fat or structural lipids whereas FFM is a chemical entity \"free\" of fat. Classical experimental animal and human studies conducted during Behnke's era laid the foundation for the widely used body density and total body water 2-component molecular-level body composition models. Refined body composition models, organization of lipids into structural and functional groupings, and lipid extraction methods all have advanced since Behnke's era. Our review provides an in-depth analysis of these developments with the aim of clarifying distinctions between the chemical composition of LBM and FFM. Our retrospective analysis reveals that FFM, derived experimentally as the difference between body weight and extracted neutral or nonpolar lipids (mainly triglycerides), includes polar or structural lipids (that is, Behnke's \"essential\" fat). Accordingly, LBM as originally proposed by Behnke has the same chemical composition as FFM, thus answering a longstanding ambiguity in the body composition literature. Bringing body composition science into the modern era mandates the use of the chemically correct term FFM with the elimination of the duplicative term LBM that today has value primarily in a historical context. Avoiding the use of the term LBM additionally limits confusion surrounding similar widely used body composition terms such as lean mass, lean soft tissue mass, and lean muscle mass.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with the decline of tissue and cellular functions, which can promote the development of age-related diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and disorders of the musculoskeletal and immune systems. Healthspan is the length of time an individual is in good health and free from chronic diseases and disabilities associated with aging. Two modifiable factors that can influence healthspan, promote healthy aging, and prevent the development of age-related diseases, are the diet and microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract (gut microbiota). This review will discuss how dietary phytochemicals and gut microbiota can work in concert to promote a healthy gut and healthy aging. First an overview is provided of how the gut microbiota influences healthy aging through its impact on gut barrier integrity, immune function, mitochondria function and oxidative stress. Next, the mechanisms by which phytochemicals effect gut health, inflammation, and nurture a diverse and healthy microbial composition are discussed. Lastly, the gut microbiota can directly influence health by producing bioactive metabolites from phytochemicals in food like urolithin A, equol, hesperetin and sulforaphane. These and other phytochemical derived microbial metabolites that may promote healthspan are discussed. Importantly, an individual's capacity to produce health promoting microbial metabolites from cruciferous vegetables, berries, nuts, citrus and soy products will be dependent on the specific bacteria present in the individual's gut.",

    "abstract": "The circadian rhythm arises endogenously from genetically encoded molecular clocks, wherein the components collaborate to induce cyclic fluctuations, occurring approximately every 24 hours. The rhythms synchronize biological processes with regular and predictable environmental patterns to guarantee the host metabolism and energy homeostasis function and well-being. Disruptions to circadian rhythms are widely associated with metabolic disorders. Notably, microbial rhythms are influenced by both the host's intrinsic circadian clock and external rhythmic factors (i.e., light-dark cycle, diet patterns and diet composition), which affect the structure of microbial communities and metabolic functions. Moreover, microbiota and the metabolites also reciprocally influence host rhythms, potentially impacting host metabolic function. This review explores the bidirectional interactions between the circadian clock, factors influencing host-microbial circadian rhythms, and the effects on lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This review explores the factors influencing both host and microbial rhythms, highlighting the interactions between gut microbiota, the metabolites, and host circadian rhythms. Additionally, it emphasizes the impact of disruptions in microbial and host rhythms on the development of metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular risk factors begin in childhood and track into adulthood, increasing the possibility of impaired cardiometabolic health. Adopting healthy dietary patterns can help curb childhood obesity, a worrisome epidemic problem at present. In the era of personalized nutrition, dietary recommendations should be adapted to different stages of life, including children (older than 3 years) and adolescents. Hereby, we present an updated version of the Mediterranean Lifestyle Pyramid addressed to children and adolescents, wihich may be used as a prevention tool by health professionals, teachers, and stakeholders. This pyramid arises from a consensus position between participants in a forum on Mediterranean Food Cultures with international experts. During this meeting, after reviewing all literature published, a consensus was reached on the new Medieterranean Lifestyle Pyramid for kids including details such as labels of the pyramid, position of foods, servings, type of foods, and healthy lifestyle habits. All components of the pyramid are supported by the most recent scientifically sound research and are based upon top-level evidence in nutritional sciences. Fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, wholegrains, and EVOO continue to be at the basis of the pyramid, but the importance of an adequate intake of fish, dairy products, and meat during these particular ages, when body and brain development occurs, is also considered. The promotion of physical activity, adequate sleep and good emotional health are emphasized, as well as the consumption of seasonal and local products, and overall sustainability. Improving dietary habits in early stages of life should increase health in adulthood and reduce future incidence of non-communicable chronic diseases. The Mediterranean Diet and its graphic representation in the Lifestyle Pyramid should be a health-fostering tool not only for adults and children, but also for the entire planet because it promotes the diversity of species, respect for the earth, and the local economy.

    "abstract": "Malnutrition is a critical complication among cancer patients, affecting up to 80% of individuals depending on cancer type, stage, and treatment. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare, with potential applications in nutritional management to improve early detection, risk stratification, and personalized interventions. This systematic review evaluates the role of AI in identifying and managing malnutrition in cancer patients, focusing on its effectiveness in nutritional status assessment, prediction, clinical outcomes, and body composition monitoring. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Excerpta Medica Database from June to July 2024, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Quantitative primary studies investigating AI-based interventions for malnutrition detection, body composition analysis, and nutritional optimization in oncology were included. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools, and evidence certainty was evaluated with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine framework. Eleven studies (n=52,228 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were categorized into three overarching domains: Nutritional Status Assessment and Prediction, Clinical and Functional Outcomes, and Body Composition and Cachexia Monitoring. AI-based models demonstrated high predictive accuracy in malnutrition detection (AUC >0.80). Machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, outperformed conventional screening tools. Deep learning models applied to medical imaging achieved high segmentation accuracy (Dice Similarity Coefficient: 0.92-0.94), enabling early cachexia detection. AI-driven virtual dietitian systems improved dietary adherence (84%) and reduced unplanned hospitalizations. AI-enhanced workflows streamlined dietitian referrals, reducing referral times by 2.4 days. AI has demonstrated significant potential in optimizing malnutrition screening, body composition monitoring, and personalized nutritional interventions for cancer patients. Its integration into oncology nutrition care could enhance patient outcomes and optimize healthcare resource allocation. Further research is necessary to standardize AI models and ensure clinical applicability. 10.17605/OSF.IO/A259M STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This systematic review highlights the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence in oncology nutrition by demonstrating its superior accuracy in malnutrition detection, body composition monitoring, and personalized dietary interventions. Unlike previous studies, which focused on isolated AI applications, this work comprehensively evaluates AI-driven models across multiple clinical domains, emphasizing their integration into routine cancer care to enhance early detection, treatment personalization, and overall patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "There have been no comprehensive reviews of the relation of breakfast cereal consumption to nutrition and health. This systematic review of all articles on breakfast cereals to October 2013 in the Scopus and Medline databases identified 232 articles with outcomes related to nutrient intake, weight, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, digestive health, dental and mental health, and cognition. Sufficient evidence was available to develop 21 summary evidence statements, ranked from A (can be trusted to guide practice) to D (weak and must be applied with caution). Breakfast cereal consumption is associated with diets higher in vitamins and minerals and lower in fat (grade B) but is not associated with increased intakes of total energy or sodium (grade C) or risk of dental caries (grade B). Most studies on the nutritional impact are cross-sectional, with very few intervention studies, so breakfast cereal consumption may be a marker of an overall healthy lifestyle. Oat-, barley-, or psyllium-based cereals can help lower cholesterol concentrations (grade A), and high-fiber, wheat-based cereals can improve bowel function (grade A). Regular breakfast cereal consumption is associated with a lower body mass index and less risk of being overweight or obese (grade B). Presweetened breakfast cereals do not increase the risk of overweight and obesity in children (grade C). Whole-grain or high-fiber breakfast cereals are associated with a lower risk of diabetes (grade B) and cardiovascular disease (grade C). There is emerging evidence of associations with feelings of greater well-being and a lower risk of hypertension (grade D), but more research is required.",

A role for choline/phosphatidylcholine availability in the progression of NAFLD to liver injury and serious hepatic consequences in some individuals requires further elucidation. There are many reasons for poor choline/phosphatidylcholine availability in the liver, including low intake, estrogen status, and genetic polymorphisms affecting, in particular, the pathway for hepatic de novo phosphatidylcholine synthesis. In addition to free choline, phosphatidylcholine has been identified as a substrate for trimethylamine production by certain intestinal bacteria, thereby reducing host choline bioavailability and providing an additional link to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease faced by those with NAFLD. Thus human choline requirements are highly individualized and biomarkers of choline status derived from metabolomics studies are required to predict those at risk of NAFLD induced by choline deficiency and to provide a basis for human intervention trials.",

    "abstract": "Fruit and yogurt have been identified individually as indicators of healthy dietary patterns. Fruits are relatively low in energy density and are an excellent source of antioxidants and prebiotic fibers and polyphenols, which can promote digestive health. Yogurt, on the other hand, is a nutrient-dense food that is a good source of dairy protein, calcium, magnesium, vitamin B-12, conjugated linoleic acid, and other key fatty acids. In addition, it contains beneficial bacterial cultures, making it a potential source of probiotics. Yogurt's unique fermented food matrix provides added health benefits by enhancing nutrient absorption and digestion. Combining the intake of yogurt and fruit could provide probiotics, prebiotics, high-quality protein, important fatty acids, and a mixture of vitamins and minerals that have the potential to exert synergistic effects on health. Yogurt consumption has been associated with reduced weight gain and a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes, whereas fruits have established effects on reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Yogurt and fruits can be eaten together and may exert combined health benefits through potential prebiotic and probiotic effects. Furthermore, substituting high-energy, nutrient-deficient snacks with fruit and yogurt could reduce the intake of high-calorie obesogenic foods. In light of the positive cardiometabolic impacts of fruit and yogurt and their association with healthy dietary patterns, there is sufficient evidence to warrant further exploration into the potential synergistic health benefits of a combined intake of fruit and yogurt.",

    "abstract": "The effect of dietary fiber intake on chronic diseases has been explored in adults but is largely unknown in children. This paper summarizes the currently existing evidence on the implications of dietary fiber intake on constipation, obesity, and diabetes in children. Current intake studies suggest that all efforts to increase children's dietary fiber consumption should be encouraged. Available data, predominantly from adult studies, indicate significantly lower risks for obesity, diabetes, and constipation could be expected with higher dietary fiber consumption. However, there is a lack of data from clinical studies in children of various ages consuming different levels of dietary fiber to support such assumptions. The existing fiber recommendations for children are conflicting, a surprising situation, because the health benefits associated with higher dietary fiber intake are well established in adults. Data providing conclusive evidence to either support or refute some, if not all, of the current pediatric fiber intake recommendations are lacking. The opportunity to improve children's health should be a priority, because it also relates to their health later in life. The known health benefits of dietary fiber intake, as summarized in this paper, call for increased awareness of the need to examine the potential benefits to children's health through increased dietary fiber.",

    "abstract": "A sustainable diet is, by definition, nutritionally adequate, economically affordable, culturally acceptable, and environmentally respectful. Designing such a diet has to integrate different dimensions of diet sustainability that may not be compatible with each other. Among multicriteria assessment methods, diet optimization is a whole-diet approach that simultaneously combines several metrics for dimensions of diet sustainability. This narrative review based on 67 published studies shows how mathematical diet optimization can help with understanding the relations between the different dimensions of diet sustainability and how it can be properly used to identify sustainable diets. Diet optimization aims to find the optimal combination of foods for a population, a subpopulation, or an individual that fulfills a set of constraints while minimizing or maximizing an objective function. In the studies reviewed, diet optimization was used to examine the links between dimensions of diet sustainability, identify the minimum cost or environmental impact of a nutritionally adequate diet, or identify food combinations able to combine ≥2 sustainability dimensions. If some constraints prove difficult to fulfill, this signals an incompatibility between nutrient recommendations, over-monotonous food-consumption patterns, an inadequate supply of nutrient-rich foods, or an incompatibility with other dimensions. If diet optimization proves successful, it can serve to design nutritionally adequate, culturally acceptable, economically affordable, and environmentally friendly diets. Diet optimization results can help define dietary recommendations, tackle food security issues, and promote sustainable dietary patterns. This review emphasizes the importance of carefully choosing the model parameters (variables, objective function, constraints) and input data and the need for appropriate expertise to correctly interpret and communicate the results. Future research should make improvements in the choice of metrics used to assess each aspect of a sustainable diet, especially the cultural dimension, to improve the practicability of the results.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is on the rise; therefore, well-timed screening is important. Given that this is a nutritionally vulnerable population, it is imperative to conduct a detailed nutritional assessment so that timely and intensive interventions can be recommended. This review article summarizes the research, focusing on the nutritional status of individuals with ASDs based on their anthropometric measurements, biomarkers, and dietary assessments. Research examining anthropometric measurements reveals an abnormally accelerated rate of growth among children with autism but shows inconsistent findings on the prevalence of overweight/obesity in comparison with typically growing children. Although dysregulated amino acid metabolism, increased homocysteine, and decreased folate, vitamins B-6 and B-12, and vitamin D concentrations have been proposed as possible biomarkers for an early diagnosis of ASDs, research investigating their association with age, gender, severity, and other comorbid psychiatric/nonpsychiatric disorders is lacking. There is consensus that children with autism have selective eating patterns, food neophobia, limited food repertoire, and sensory issues. Although inadequate micronutrient but adequate macronutrient intakes are increasingly reported, there are inconsistent results about the extent and type of nutrient deficiencies. Identification and development of nutritional assessment indicators that serve as early warning signs during routine practice beginning at birth and extending throughout the child's growth are necessary. With this population aging, there is also a dire need to study the adult population. A more vigorous role by nutrition professionals is warranted because management of potential comorbidities and contributory factors may be particularly problematic.",

Electronic and hand searches were performed until August 2016. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) minimum intervention period of 12 mo; 2) primary prevention trials; 3) mean age ≥18 y; 4) interventions included vitamins, fatty acids, minerals, supplements containing combinations of vitamins and minerals, protein, fiber, prebiotics, and probiotics; and 5) primary outcome of all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes of mortality or incidence from CVD or cancer. Pooled effects across studies were estimated by using random-effects meta-analysis. Overall, 49 trials (69 reports) including 287,304 participants met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-two trials were judged as low risk–, 15 trials as moderate risk–, and 2 trials as high risk–of-bias studies. Supplements containing vitamin E (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.96) significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality risk, whereas supplements with folic acid reduced the risk of CVD (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.94). Vitamins D, C, and K; selenium; zinc; magnesium; and eicosapentaenoic acid showed no significant risk reduction for any of the outcomes. On the contrary, vitamin A was linked to an increased cancer risk (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.35). Supplements with β-carotene showed no significant effect; however, in the subgroup with β-carotene given singly, an increased risk of all-cause mortality by 6% (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.10) was observed. Taken together, we found insufficient evidence to support the use of dietary supplements in the primary prevention of cause-specific death, incidence of CVD, and incidence of cancer. The application of some supplements generated small beneficial effects; however, the heterogeneous types and doses of supplements limit the generalizability to the overall population.",

    "abstract": "Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is central to innate immunity. Aberrant expression of TLRs is found in neonatal inflammatory diseases. Several bioactive components of human milk modulate TLR expression and signaling pathways, including soluble toll-like receptors (sTLRs), soluble cluster of differentiation (sCD) 14, glycoproteins, small peptides, and oligosaccharides. Some milk components, such as sialyl (α2,3) lactose and lacto-N-fucopentaose III, are reported to increase TLR signaling; under some circumstances this might contribute toward immunologic balance. Human milk on the whole is strongly anti-inflammatory, and contains abundant components that depress TLR signaling pathways: sTLR2 and sCD14 inhibit TLR2 signaling; sCD14, lactadherin, lactoferrin, and 2′-fucosyllactose attenuate TLR4 signaling; 3′-galactosyllactose inhibits TLR3 signaling, and β-defensin 2 inhibits TLR7 signaling. Feeding human milk to neonates decreases their risk of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Thus, the TLR regulatory components found in human milk hold promise as benign oral prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for the many gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders mediated by abnormal TLR signaling.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin B-12 deficiency (<148 pmol/L) is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including developmental anomalies, spontaneous abortions, preeclampsia, and low birth weight (<2500 g). The importance of adequate vitamin B-12 status periconceptionally and during pregnancy cannot be overemphasized, given its fundamental role in neural myelination, brain development, and growth. Infants born to vitamin B-12-deficient women may be at increased risk of neural tube closure defects, and maternal vitamin B-12 insufficiency (<200 pmol/L) can impair infant growth, psychomotor function, and brain development, which may be irreversible. However, the underlying causal mechanisms are unknown. This review was conducted to examine the evidence that links maternal vitamin B-12 status and perinatal outcomes. Despite the high prevalence of vitamin B-12 deficiency and associated risk of pregnancy complications, few prospective studies and, to our knowledge, only 1 randomized trial have examined the effects of vitamin B-12 supplementation during pregnancy. The role of vitamin B-12 in the etiology of adverse perinatal outcomes needs to be elucidated to inform public health interventions.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRs) hybridize with complementary sequences in mRNA and silence genes by destabilizing mRNA or preventing translation of mRNA. Over 60% of human protein-coding genes are regulated by miRs, and 1881 high-confidence miRs are encoded in the human genome. Evidence suggests that miRs not only are synthesized endogenously, but also might be obtained from dietary sources, and that food compounds alter the expression of endogenous miR genes. The main food matrices for studies of biological activity of dietary miRs include plant foods and cow milk. Encapsulation of miRs in exosomes and exosome-like particles confers protection against RNA degradation and creates a pathway for intestinal and vascular endothelial transport by endocytosis, as well as delivery to peripheral tissues. Evidence suggests that the amount of miRs absorbed from nutritionally relevant quantities of foods is sufficient to elicit biological effects, and that endogenous synthesis of miRs is insufficient to compensate for dietary miR depletion and rescue wild-type phenotypes. In addition, nutrition alters the expression of endogenous miR genes, thereby compounding the effects of nutrition-miR interactions in gene regulation and disease diagnosis in liquid biopsies. For example, food components and dietary preferences may modulate serum miR profiles that may influence biological processes. The complex crosstalk between nutrition, miRs, and gene targets poses a challenge to gene network analysis and studies of human disease. Novel pipelines and databases have been developed recently, including a dietary miR database for archiving reported miRs in 15 dietary resources. miRs derived from diet and endogenous synthesis have been implicated in physiologic and pathologic conditions, including those linked with nutrition and metabolism. In fact, several miRs are actively regulated in response to overnutrition and tissue inflammation, and are involved in facilitating the development of chronic inflammation by modulating tissue-infiltrated immune cell function.",

    "abstract": "Growth charts for weight and height have provided the basis for assessment of children's nutritional status for over half a century, with charts for body mass index (BMI) introduced in the 1990s. However, BMI does not provide information on the proportions of fat and lean mass; and within the past decade, growth charts for children's body composition have been produced by using techniques such as skinfold thicknesses, body circumferences, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). For public health research, BIA and skinfold thicknesses show negligible average bias but have wider limits of agreement than specialized techniques. For patients, DXA is the best individual method, but multicomponent models remain ideal because they address perturbations in lean mass composition. Data can be expressed in age- and sex-specific SD scores, in some cases adjusting for height. Most such reference data derive from high-income countries, but techniques such as air-displacement plethysmography allow infant body composition growth charts to be developed in low- and middle-income settings, where the data may improve understanding of the effects of low birth weight, wasting, and stunting on body composition. Recent studies suggest that between-population variability in body composition may derive in part from genetic factors, suggesting a universal human body composition reference may not be viable. Body composition growth charts may be extended into adult life to evaluate changes in fat and lean mass through the entire life course. These reference data will improve the understanding of the association between growth, body composition, health, and disease.",

    "abstract": "The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have contributed to unprecedented reductions in poverty and improvement in the lives of millions of men, women, and children in low- and middle-income countries. Yet, hundreds of millions of children under 5 y of age are not reaching their developmental potential. This article reviews the scientific basis for early childhood nutrition and child development interventions, the impact of integrated interventions on children's linear growth and cognitive development, and implementation strategies for integrated nutrition and child development programs. Advances in brain science have documented that the origins of adult health and well-being are grounded in early childhood, from conception through age 24 mo (first 1000 d) and extending to age 5 y (second 1000 d). Young children with adequate nutrition, nurturant caregiving, and opportunities for early learning have the best chances of thriving. Evidence from adoption, experimental, and quasi-experimental studies has shown that stunting prevention is sensitive during the first 1000 d, and sensitivity to child development interventions extends through the second 1000 d. Cognitive development responds to interventions post–1000 d with effect sizes that are inversely associated with initial age and length of program exposure. Integrated interventions need governance structures that support integrated policies and programming, with attention to training, supervision, and monitoring. The MDGs have been replaced by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with targets for the next 15 y. Achievement of the SDGs depends on children receiving adequate nutrition, nurturant caregiving, and learning opportunities from conception through age 5.",

    "abstract": "The adult RDA is defined as the average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all healthy people. The RDA for protein for adults ≥18 y of age (0.8 g/kg) has been essentially unchanged for >70 y. In practice, the RDA for protein was derived to estimate the minimum amount of protein that must be eaten to avoid a loss of body nitrogen. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) (10-35% of calories as protein) was developed to express dietary recommendations in the context of a complete diet. It is noteworthy that the lowest level of protein intake reflected in the AMDR is higher than that of the RDA. Furthermore, recent studies, particularly in older individuals, suggest specific health benefits at levels of protein intake that significantly exceed the RDA. Translation of protein intake recommendations for the general adult population into dietary guidance for individuals requires an understanding of the derivation and intended use of both the protein RDA and AMDR. The following discussion will describe limitations to the derivation and practical application of the RDA compared with the use of the AMDR to help maximize health benefits associated with higher protein intake by using flexible calories inherent in different dietary patterns.",

    "abstract": "Although much is known about magnesium, its interactions with calcium and vitamin D are less well studied. Magnesium intake is low in populations who consume modern processed-food diets. Low magnesium intake is associated with chronic diseases of global concern [e.g., cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and skeletal disorders], as is low vitamin D status. No simple, reliable biomarker for whole-body magnesium status is currently available, which makes clinical assessment and interpretation of human magnesium research difficult. Between 1977 and 2012, US calcium intakes increased at a rate 2–2.5 times that of magnesium intakes, resulting in a dietary calcium to magnesium intake ratio of >3.0. Calcium to magnesium ratios <1.7 and >2.8 can be detrimental, and optimal ratios may be ∼2.0. Background calcium to magnesium ratios can affect studies of either mineral alone. For example, US studies (background Ca:Mg >3.0) showed benefits of high dietary or supplemental magnesium for CVD, whereas similar Chinese studies (background Ca:Mg <1.7) showed increased risks of CVD. Oral vitamin D is widely recommended in US age-sex groups with low dietary magnesium. Magnesium is a cofactor for vitamin D biosynthesis, transport, and activation; and vitamin D and magnesium studies both showed associations with several of the same chronic diseases. Research on possible magnesium and vitamin D interactions in these human diseases is currently rare. Increasing calcium to magnesium intake ratios, coupled with calcium and vitamin D supplementation coincident with suboptimal magnesium intakes, may have unknown health implications. Interactions of low magnesium status with calcium and vitamin D, especially during supplementation, require further study.",

Obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases are characterized by specific alterations in the human gut microbiota. Experimental studies with gut microbiota transplantations in mice and in humans indicate that a specific gut microbiota composition can be the cause and not just the consequence of the obese state and metabolic disease, which suggests a potential for gut microbiota modulation in prevention and treatment of obesity-related metabolic diseases. In addition, dietary intervention studies have suggested that modulation of the gut microbiota can improve metabolic risk markers in humans, but a causal role of the gut microbiota in such studies has not yet been established. Here, we review and discuss the role of the gut microbiota in obesity-related metabolic diseases and the potential of dietary modulation of the gut microbiota in metabolic disease prevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition is an important modifiable factor that affects bone health. Diet is a complex mixture of nutrients and foods that correlate or interact with each other. Dietary pattern approaches take into account contributions from various aspects of diet. Findings from dietary pattern studies could complement those from single-nutrient and food studies on bone health. In this study we aimed to conduct a scoping review of the literature that assessed the impact of dietary patterns (derived with the use of both a priori and data-driven approaches) on bone outcomes, including bone mineral status, bone biomarkers, osteoporosis, and fracture risk. We retrieved 49 human studies up to June 2016 from the PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases. Most of these studies used a data-driven method, especially factor analysis, to derive dietary patterns. Several studies examined adherence to a variety of the a priori dietary indexes, including the Mediterranean diet score, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI). The bone mineral density (BMD) diet score was developed to measure adherence to a dietary pattern beneficial to bone mineral density. Findings revealed a beneficial impact of higher adherence to a \"healthy\" dietary pattern derived using a data-driven method, the Mediterranean diet, HEI, AHEI, Dietary Diversity Score, Diet Quality Index–International, BMD Diet Score, Healthy Diet Indicator, and Korean Diet Score, on bone. In contrast, the \"Western\" dietary pattern and those featuring some aspects of an unhealthy diet were associated inversely with bone health. In both a priori and data-driven dietary pattern studies, a dietary pattern that emphasized the intake of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, poultry and fish, nuts and legumes, and low-fat dairy products and de-emphasized the intake of soft drinks, fried foods, meat and processed products, sweets and desserts, and refined grains showed a beneficial impact on bone health. Overall, adherence to a healthy dietary pattern consisting of the above-mentioned food groups can improve bone mineral status and decrease osteoporosis and fracture risk.",

    "abstract": "Many of the chronic illnesses that plague modern society derive in large part from poor food choices. Thus, it is not surprising that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, aimed at the population ≥2 y of age, recommends limiting consumption of salt, fat, and simple sugars, all of which have sensory properties that we humans find particularly palatable, and increasing the variety and contribution of fruits and vegetables in the diet, to promote health and prevent disease. Similar recommendations may soon be targeted at even younger Americans: the B-24 Project, led by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the USDA, is currently evaluating evidence to include infants and children from birth to 2 y of age in the dietary guidelines. This article reviews the underinvestigated behavioral phenomena surrounding how to introduce vegetables and fruits into infants' diets, for which there is much medical lore but, to our knowledge, little evidence-based research. Because the chemical senses are the major determinants of whether young children will accept a food (e.g., they eat only what they like), these senses take on even greater importance in understanding the bases for food choices in children. We focus on early life, in contrast with many other studies that attempt to modify food habits in older children and thus may miss sensitive periods that modulate long-term acceptance. Our review also takes into consideration ontogeny and sources of individual differences in taste perception, in particular, the role of genetic variation in bitter taste perception.",

This systematic review investigates micronutrient deficiencies and related adverse clinical outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women after bariatric surgery. A systematic approach involving critical appraisal was conducted independently by 2 researchers to examine deficiencies of phylloquinone, folate, iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium, iodide, copper, and vitamins A, D, and B-12 in pregnant and postpartum women after bariatric surgery, together with subsequent outcomes in the neonates. The search identified 29 relevant cases and 8 cohort studies. The quality of reporting among the case reports was weak according to the criteria based on the CARE (CAse REporting) guidelines as was that for the cohort studies based on the criteria from the Cohort Study Quality Assessment list of the Dutch Cochrane Center. The most common adverse neonatal outcomes related to maternal micronutrient deficiencies include visual complications (vitamin A), intracranial hemorrhage (phylloquinone), neurological and developmental impairment (vitamin B-12), and neural tube defects (folate). On the basis of the systematically collected information, we conclude that the evidence on micronutrient deficiencies in pregnant and postpartum women after bariatric surgery and subsequent adverse neonatal outcomes remains weak and inconclusive.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural water requirements differ between foods. Population-level dietary preferences are therefore a major determinant of agricultural water use. The \"water footprint\" (WF) represents the volume of water consumed in the production of food items, separated by water source; blue WF represents ground and surface water use, and green WF represents rain water use. We systematically searched for published studies using the WF to assess the water use of diets. We used the available evidence to quantify the WF of diets in different countries, and grouped diets in patterns according to study definition. \"Average\" patterns equated to those currently consumed, whereas \"healthy\" patterns included those recommended in national dietary guidelines. We searched 7 online databases and identified 41 eligible studies that reported the dietary green WF, blue WF, or total WF (green plus blue) (1964 estimates for 176 countries). The available evidence suggests that, on average, European (170 estimates) and Oceanian (18 estimates) dietary patterns have the highest green WFs (median per capita: 2999 L/d and 2924 L/d, respectively), whereas Asian dietary patterns (98 estimates) have the highest blue WFs (median: 382 L/d per capita). Foods of animal origin are major contributors to the green WFs of diets, whereas cereals, fruits, nuts, and oils are major contributors to the blue WF of diets. \"Healthy\" dietary patterns (425 estimates) had green WFs that were 5.9% (95% CI: −7.7, −4.0) lower than those of \"average\" dietary patterns, but they did not differ in their blue WFs. Our review suggests that changes toward healthier diets could reduce total water use of agriculture, but would not affect blue water use. Rapid dietary change and increasing water security concerns underscore the need for a better understanding of the amount and type of water used in food production to make informed policy decisions.",

Hedonic eating is thought to be that driven by the reward of food consumption and not metabolic need, and this has focused attention on the brain reward system and how its dysregulation may cause overeating and obesity. Here, we begin by examining the brain reward system and the evidence for its dysregulation in human obesity. We then consider the issue of how individuals are able to control their hedonic eating in the present obesogenic environment and compare 2 contrasting perspectives on the control of hedonic eating, specifically, enhanced control of intake via higher cognitive control and loss of control over intake as captured by the food addiction model. We conclude by considering what these perspectives offer in terms of directions for future research and for potential interventions to improve control over food intake at the population and the individual levels.",

    "abstract": "Personalized nutrition (PN) approaches have been shown to help drive behavior change and positively influence health outcomes. This has led to an increase in the development of commercially available PN programs, which utilize various forms of individual-level information to provide services and products for consumers. The lack of a well-accepted definition of PN or an established set of guiding principles for the implementation of PN creates barriers for establishing credibility and efficacy. To address these points, the North American Branch of the International Life Sciences Institute convened a multidisciplinary panel. In this article, a definition for PN is proposed: \"Personalized nutrition uses individual-specific information, founded in evidence-based science, to promote dietary behavior change that may result in measurable health benefits.\" In addition, 10 guiding principles for PN approaches are proposed: 1) define potential users and beneficiaries; 2) use validated diagnostic methods and measures; 3) maintain data quality and relevance; 4) derive data-driven recommendations from validated models and algorithms; 5) design PN studies around validated individual health or function needs and outcomes; 6) provide rigorous scientific evidence for an effect on health or function; 7) deliver user-friendly tools; 8) for healthy individuals, align with population-based recommendations; 9) communicate transparently about potential effects; and 10) protect individual data privacy and act responsibly. These principles are intended to establish a basis for responsible approaches to the evidence-based research and practice of PN and serve as an invitation for further public dialog. Several challenges were identified for PN to continue gaining acceptance, including defining the health–disease continuum, identification of biomarkers, changing regulatory landscapes, accessibility, and measuring success. Although PN approaches hold promise for public health in the future, further research is needed on the accuracy of dietary intake measurement, utilization and standardization of systems approaches, and application and communication of evidence.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding has been regarded first and foremost as a means of nutrition for infants, providing essential components for their unique growth and developmental requirements. However, breast milk is also rich in immunologic factors, highlighting its importance as a mediator of protection. In accordance with its evolutionary origin, the mammary gland offers via the breastfeeding route continuation of the maternal to infant immunologic support established in utero. At birth, the infant's immune system is immature, and although it was exposed to the maternal microbial flora during pregnancy, it experiences an abrupt change in its microbial environment during and after birth, which is challenging and renders the infant highly susceptible to infection. Active and passive immunity protects the infant via breast milk, which is rich in immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, lysozyme, cytokines, and numerous other immunologic factors, including maternal leukocytes. Breast milk leukocytes provide active immunity and promote development of immunocompetence in the infant. Additionally, it has been speculated that they play a role in the protection of the mammary gland from infection. Leukocytes are thought to exert these functions via phagocytosis, secretion of antimicrobial factors and/or antigen presentation in both the mammary gland and the gastrointestinal tract of the infant, and also in other infant tissues, where they are transported via the systemic circulation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that breast milk leukocytes respond dynamically to maternal as well as infant infections, and are fewer in nonexclusively compared with exclusively breastfeeding dyads, further emphasizing their importance for both the mother and infant. This review summarizes the current knowledge of human milk leukocytes and factors influencing them, and presents recent novel findings supporting their potential as a diagnostic marker for infections of the lactating breast and of the breastfed infant.",

    "abstract": "The food system is a major source of environmental impact, and dietary change has been recommended as an important and necessary strategy to reduce this impact. However, assessing the environmental performance of diets is complex due to the many types of foods eaten and the diversity of agricultural production systems and local environmental settings. To assess the state of science and identify knowledge gaps, an integrative review of the broad topic of environment and diet was undertaken, with particular focus on the completeness of coverage of environmental concerns and the metrics used. Compared with the 14 discrete environmental areas of concern identified in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the located journal literature mainly addressed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and, to a lesser extent, land and water use. Some relevant concerns were rarely addressed or not addressed at all. In the case of GHG emissions, changes in land use and soil carbon stocks were seldom considered. This represents a disconnect between the science informing strategic climate action in the agricultural sector and the science informing public health nutrition. In the case of land and water use, few studies used metrics that are appropriate in a life-cycle context. Some metrics produce inherently biased results, which misinform about environmental impact. The limited evidence generally points to recommended diets having lower environmental impacts than typical diets, although not in every case. This is largely explained by the overconsumption of food energy associated with average diets, which is also a major driver of obesity. A shared-knowledge framework is identified as being needed to guide future research on this topic. Until the evidence base becomes more complete, commentators on sustainable diets should not be quick to assume that a dietary strategy to reduce overall environmental impact can be readily defined or recommended.",

    "abstract": "Kidney disease affects almost 15% of the US population, and prevalence is anticipated to grow as the population ages and the obesity epidemic continues due to Western dietary practices. The densely caloric Western diet, characterized by high animal protein and low fruit and vegetable content, has fueled the growth of chronic diseases, including chronic kidney disease. The glomerulus or filtering unit of the kidney is very susceptible to barotrauma, and diets high in animal protein impede the glomerulus' ability to protect itself from hemodynamic injury. High animal protein intake combined with low intake of fruits and vegetables also leads to a high net endogenous acid production requiring augmentation of ammonium excretion in order to prevent acidosis. This higher workload of the kidney to maintain a normal serum bicarbonate level may further exacerbate kidney disease progression. This article reviews the potential mechanisms whereby several key characteristics of the typical Western diet may impact kidney disease incidence and progression. Reducing animal protein intake and egg yolk and increasing intake of fruits and vegetables and fiber may prevent or delay end-stage renal disease, but few clinical trials have examined vegetarian diets for management of chronic kidney disease. More research is needed to determine optimal dietary patterns for the prevention of kidney disease and its progression.",

    "abstract": "Because regular-fat dairy products are a major source of cholesterol-raising saturated fatty acids (SFAs), current US and Canadian dietary guidelines for cardiovascular health recommend the consumption of low-fat dairy products. Yet, numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported rather mixed effects of reduced- and regular-fat dairy consumption on blood lipid concentrations and on many other cardiometabolic disease risk factors, such as blood pressure and inflammation markers. Thus, the focus on low-fat dairy in current dietary guidelines is being challenged, creating confusion within health professional circles and the public. This narrative review provides perspective on the research pertaining to the impact of dairy consumption and dairy fat on traditional and emerging cardiometabolic disease risk factors. This comprehensive assessment of evidence from RCTs suggests that there is no apparent risk of potential harmful effects of dairy consumption, irrespective of the content of dairy fat, on a large array of cardiometabolic variables, including lipid-related risk factors, blood pressure, inflammation, insulin resistance, and vascular function. This suggests that the purported detrimental effects of SFAs on cardiometabolic health may in fact be nullified when they are consumed as part of complex food matrices such as those in cheese and other dairy foods. Thus, the focus on low-fat dairy products in current guidelines apparently is not entirely supported by the existing literature and may need to be revisited on the basis of this evidence. Future studies addressing key research gaps in this area will be extremely informative to better appreciate the impact of dairy food matrices, as well as dairy fat specifically, on cardiometabolic health.",

    "abstract": "Long-term consumption of a high-protein diet could be linked with metabolic and clinical problems, such as loss of bone mass and renal dysfunction. However, although it is well accepted that a high-protein diet may be detrimental to individuals with existing kidney dysfunction, there is little evidence that high protein intake is dangerous for healthy individuals. High-protein meals and foods are thought to have a greater satiating effect than high-carbohydrate or high-fat meals. The effect of high-protein diets on the modulation of satiety involves multiple metabolic pathways. Protein intake induces complex signals, with peptide hormones being released from the gastrointestinal tract and blood amino acids and derived metabolites being released in the blood. Protein intake also stimulates metabolic hormones that communicate information about energy status to the brain. Long-term ingestion of high amounts of protein seems to decrease food intake, body weight, and body adiposity in many well-documented studies. The aim of this article is to provide an extensive overview of the efficacy of high protein consumption in weight loss and maintenance, as well as the potential consequences in human health of long-term intake.",

    "abstract": "Food intake patterns begin to be shaped at the earliest points in life. Early exposures and experiences are critical for the acceptance of some foods, particularly healthful foods such as vegetables, which often have a bitter component in their flavor profiles. In addition to repeated exposure to these foods, the quality and emotional tone of parent-child interactions are important in facilitating children's acceptance of vegetables. During early childhood, parents are challenged by children's developmental characteristics related to eating, such as the emergence of child neophobia, and by individual characteristics of the child that are more biologically based, including genetic predispositions to bitter taste and sensory sensitivities. Experimental studies consistently show that repeated exposure to novel and rejected familiar foods is the most powerful method to improve acceptance. However, the manner and persistence with which these exposures are performed are critical. Research investigating influences on children's vegetable acceptance and ingestion has focused on associations among availability, parent intakes, child neophobia, and the parental feeding response to children's reluctance to try and consume vegetables. Because young children's dietary intakes are low and below dietary recommendations, investigations have focused more on factors that impede children's vegetable acceptance, such as controlling feeding practices, than on positive influences. Research that addresses the multifaceted nature of these interactions among different levels of social-ecological environment, individual traits, parental feeding styles and practices, and socioeconomic influences and that uses longitudinal designs and complex statistical approaches is called for to ascertain more effective methods to improve children's vegetable acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Although the term \"whole grain\" is well defined, there has been no universal standard of what constitutes a \"whole-grain food,\" creating challenges for researchers, the food industry, regulatory authorities, and consumers around the world. As part of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Technical Advisory Committee issued a call to action to develop definitions for whole-grain foods that could be universally accepted and applied to dietary recommendations and planning. The Committee's call to action, and the lack of a global whole-grain food definition, was the impetus for the Whole Grain Roundtable held 3–5 December 2012 in Chicago, Illinois. The objective was to develop a whole-grain food definition that is consistent with the quartet of needs of science, food product formulation, consumer behavior, and label education. The roundtable's expert panel represented a broad range of expertise from the United States and Europe, including epidemiology and dietary intervention researchers, consumer educators, government policy makers, and food and nutrition scientists from academia and the grain food industry. Taking into account the totality, quality, and consistency of available scientific evidence, the expert panel recommended that 8 g of whole grain/30 g serving (27 g/100 g), without a fiber requirement, be considered a minimum content of whole grains that is nutritionally meaningful and that a food providing at least 8 g of whole grains/30-g serving be defined as a whole-grain food. Having an established whole-grain food definition will encourage manufacturers to produce foods with meaningful amounts of whole grain, allow consistent product labeling and messaging, and empower consumers to readily identify whole-grain foods and achieve whole-grain dietary recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Preterm infants are extremely vulnerable to a range of morbidities and mortality. Underdeveloped cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune systems in the preterm period increase the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a serious disease of the gut. NEC affects 5–12% of very–low birth-weight infants, leads to surgery in 20–40% of cases, and is fatal in 25–50% of cases. There are multiple factors that may contribute to NEC, but the exact cause is not yet fully understood. Severe cases can result in intestinal resection or death, and the health care costs average >$300,000/infant when surgical management is required. Different types of nutrition may affect the onset or progression of NEC. Several studies have indicated that bovine milk–based infant formulas lead to a higher incidence of NEC in preterm infants than does human milk (HM). However, it is not clear why HM is linked to a lower incidence of NEC or why some infants fed an exclusively HM diet still develop NEC. An area that has not been thoroughly explored is the use of semielemental or elemental formulas. These specialty formulas are easy to digest and absorb in the gut and may be an effective nutritional intervention for reducing the risk of NEC. This review summarizes what is known about the factors that contribute to the onset and progression of NEC, discusses its health care cost implications, and explores the impact that different formulas and HM have on this disease.",

    "abstract": "Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can disrupt fetal developmental processes during pregnancy, leading to long-term adverse outcomes in humans. A major source of exposure to EDCs, such as phthalates and bisphenols, is the food supply, primarily due to contamination from processing and packaging. Therefore, this review aimed to 1) review food-monitoring sources of phthalates and bisphenols, and 2) evaluate methodologies and provide future directions needed to establish EDC-limiting dietary recommendations in pregnancy. Using PubMed, 10 peer-reviewed studies were found on dietary predictors of EDC exposure in pregnancy, and all were selected for review. Use of plastic containers in pregnancy was associated with higher urinary phthalate metabolites, whereas canned food consumption was associated with higher urinary bisphenol A (BPA) concentrations. Foods and dietary patterns associated with healthier food choices (e.g., organic/grown/raised/caught foods, folic acid supplements, vegetarianism) were generally associated with lower urinary phthalate metabolite and BPA concentrations. Despite the many food-monitoring studies reporting high BPA and phthalate concentrations in various foods, the designs of most studies described here were not sufficiently robust to consistently detect associations of specific foods/food groups with phthalates and BPA. Given the limitations of currently available research, future studies should incorporate more valid questionnaires to accurately assess dietary EDC exposure, strive for concurrent diet and exposure assessment, and assess whether geographical and cultural differences modify associations of diet with gestational EDC exposures. Such progress will be critical for developing dietary recommendations that ensure the safety and health of pregnant women.",

This review draws on a large scaling-up literature search and 4 case studies of large-scale nutrition programs with proven impact to synthesize critical elements for impact at scale. Nine elements emerged as central: 1) having a clear vision or goal for impact; 2) intervention characteristics; 3) an enabling organizational context for scaling up; 4) establishing drivers such as catalysts, champions, systemwide ownership, and incentives; 5) choosing contextually relevant strategies and pathways for scaling up, 6) building operational and strategic capacities; 7) ensuring adequacy, stability, and flexibility of financing; 8) ensuring adequate governance structures and systems; and 9) embedding mechanisms for monitoring, learning, and accountability. Translating current political commitment to large-scale impact on nutrition will require robust attention to these elements.",

It is also an adipokine that has been implicated in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance. RBP4 seems to be correlated with cardiometabolic markers in inflammatory chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). It has recently been suggested that inflammation produced by RBP4 induces insulin resistance and CVD. The clinical relevance of this hypothesis is discussed in this review. Knowledge concerning the association of RBP4 with inflammation markers, oxidative stress, and CVDs as well as concerning the role of diet and antioxidants in decreasing RBP4 concentrations are discussed. Special attention is given to methodologies used in previously published studies and covariates that should be controlled when planning new studies on this adipokine.",

    "abstract": "The enormous burden of diet-related chronic diseases has prompted interest in healthy food prescription programs. Yet, the impact of such programs remains unclear. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of healthy food prescription programs and evaluate their impact on dietary behavior and cardiometabolic parameters by meta-analysis. A systematic search was carried out in Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases since their inception to 3 January, 2020 without language restriction. A systematic search of interventional studies investigating the effect of healthy food prescription on diet quality and/or cardiometabolic risk factors including BMI, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), or blood lipids was carried out. Thirteen studies were identified for inclusion, most of which were quasi-experimental (pre/post) interventions without a control group (n = 9). Pooled estimates revealed a 22% (95% CI: 12, 32; n = 5 studies, n = 1039 participants; I2 = 97%) increase in fruit and vegetable consumption, corresponding to 0.8 higher daily servings (95% CI: 0.2, 1.4; I2 = 96%). BMI decreased by 0.6 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.2, 1.1; I2 = 6.4%) and HbA1c by 0.8% (95% CI: 0.1, 1.6; I2 = 92%). No significant change was observed in other cardiometabolic parameters. These findings should be interpreted with caution in light of considerable heterogeneity, methodological limitations of the included studies, and moderate to very low certainty of evidence. Our results support the need for well-designed, large, randomized controlled trials in various settings to further establish the efficacy of healthy food prescription programs on diet quality and cardiometabolic health.",

    "abstract": "In the 20th century, scientific and geopolitical events led to the concept of food as a delivery system for calories and specific isolated nutrients. As a result, conventional dietary guidelines have focused on individual nutrients to maintain health and prevent disease. For dairy foods, this has led to general dietary recommendations to consume 2-3 daily servings of reduced-fat dairy foods, without regard to type (e.g., yogurt, cheese, milk), largely based on theorized benefits of isolated nutrients for bone health (e.g., calcium, vitamin D) and theorized harms of isolated nutrients for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and obesity (e.g., total fat, saturated fat, total calories). However, advances in nutrition science have demonstrated that foods represent complex matrices of nutrients, minerals, bioactives, food structures, and other factors (e.g., phoshopholipids, prebiotics, probiotics) with correspondingly complex effects on health and disease. The present evidence suggests that whole-fat dairy foods do not cause weight gain, that overall dairy consumption increases lean body mass and reduces body fat, that yogurt consumption and probiotics reduce weight gain, that fermented dairy consumption including cheese is linked to lower CVD risk, and that yogurt, cheese, and even dairy fat may protect against type 2 diabetes. Based on the current science, dairy consumption is part of a healthy diet, without strong evidence to favor reduced-fat products; while intakes of probiotic-containing unsweetened and fermented dairy products such as yogurt and cheese appear especially beneficial.",

Cost and health concerns associated with sucrose spurred the development and consumption of other sugars and sweeteners, with the average American consuming 10 times more sugar than 100 y ago. In this review, we discuss how gut microbes are affected by changes in the consumption of sugars and other sweeteners through transcriptional, abundance, and genetic adaptations. We propose that these adaptations result in microbes taking on different metabolic, ecological, and genetic profiles along the intestinal tract. We suggest novel approaches to assess the consequences of these changes on host–microbe interactions to determine the safety of novel sugars and sweeteners.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global concern, affecting both developed and developing countries. Although there are large variations in obesity and breast cancer rates worldwide and across racial/ethnic groups, most studies evaluating the impact of obesity on breast cancer risk and survival have been conducted in non-Hispanic white women in the United States or Europe. Given the known racial/ethnic differences in tumor hormone receptor subtype distribution, obesity prevalence, and risk factor profiles, we reviewed published data for women of African, Hispanic, and Asian ancestry in the United States and their countries of origin. Although the data are limited, current evidence suggests a stronger adverse effect of obesity on breast cancer risk and survival in women of Asian ancestry. For African Americans and Hispanics, the strength of the associations appears to be more comparable to that of non-Hispanic whites, particularly when accounting for subtype and menopausal status. Central obesity seems to have a stronger impact in African-American women than general adiposity as measured by body mass index. International data from countries undergoing economic transition offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of rapid weight gain on breast cancer. Such studies should take into account genetic ancestry, which may help elucidate differences in associations between ethnically admixed populations. Overall, additional large studies that use a variety of adiposity measures are needed, because the current evidence is based on few studies, most with limited statistical power. Future investigations of obesity biomarkers will be useful to understand possible racial/ethnic biological differences underlying the complex association between obesity and breast cancer development and progression.",

    "abstract": "Infertility is an increasing problem that affects couples attempting pregnancy. A growing body of evidence points to a link between diet and female fertility. In fact, data show that a diet high in trans fats, refined carbohydrates, and added sugars can negatively affect fertility. Conversely, a diet based on the Mediterranean dietary patterns, i.e., rich in dietary fiber, omega-3 (ɷ-3) fatty acids, plant-based protein, and vitamins and minerals, has a positive impact on female fertility. An unhealthy diet can disrupt microbiota composition, and it is worth investigating whether the composition of the gut microbiota correlates with the frequency of infertility. There is a lack of evidence to exclude gluten from the diet of every woman trying to become pregnant in the absence of celiac disease. Furthermore, there are no data concerning adverse effects of alcohol on female fertility, and caffeine consumption in the recommended amounts also does not seem to affect fertility. On the other hand, phytoestrogens presumably have a positive influence on female fertility. Nevertheless, there are many unanswered questions with regard to supplementation in order to enhance fertility. It has been established that women of childbearing age should supplement folic acid. Moreover, most people experience vitamin D and iodine deficiency; thus, it is vital to control their blood concentrations and consider supplementation if necessary. Therefore, since diet and lifestyle seem to be significant factors influencing fertility, it is valid to expand knowledge in this area.",

    "abstract": "The role of agriculture in reducing undernutrition is widely recognized, yet there is also consensus on the need to make the sector nutrition-sensitive. Evidence on the impact pathways from nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) interventions, agricultural interventions with specific nutrition objectives, and actions detailing each temporal stage to reach nutrition outcomes is limited, however. We thus synthesized study results regarding impact of NSA interventions on nutrition outcomes relating to undernutrition, and constructed an impact pathway by mapping the evidence on each temporal stage from interventions to nutrition outcomes. We used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses to conduct and report our systematic review of studies on NSA interventions implemented in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Forty-three studies that met the inclusion criteria were extracted and synthesized across impact and pathways analyses. We carried out a thematic analysis of the effect of NSA interventions using evidence-based indicators and constructed the pathways by adopting a published framework on agriculture to nutrition pathways. Our findings reveal that NSA interventions can significantly improve dietary practices, and have the potential to enhance care practices and reduce occurrence of diseases, indicating their effectiveness in simultaneously addressing multiple determinants of undernutrition. However, NSA interventions have a lesser impact on nutritional status. NSA interventions lead to nutrition outcomes through 5 key pathways: food production, nutrition-related knowledge, agricultural income, women's empowerment, and strengthening of local institutions. We emphasize the need to carefully design, implement, and evaluate interventions with consideration for factors affecting impact pathways. Future research should focus on the effect of interventions combining multisector components, and pathways through non-food-production-related income, women's empowerment, strengthening of local institutions, food prices at intervention level, and expenditure on health care.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of vision loss in the elderly. With an increasingly aged population worldwide, the need for the prevention of AMD is rising. Multiple studies investigating AMD with the use of animal models and cell culture have identified oxidative stress–related retinal damage as an important contributing factor. In general, diet is an excellent source of the antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals necessary for healthy living; moreover, the general public is often receptive to recommendations made by physicians and health care workers regarding diet and supplements as a means of empowering themselves to avoid common and worrisome ailments such as AMD, which has made epidemiologists and clinicians enthusiastic about dietary intervention studies. A wide variety of nutrients, such as minerals, vitamins, ω-3 (n–3) fatty acids, and various carotenoids, have been associated with reducing the risk of AMD. Initial results from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) indicated that supplementation with antioxidants (β-carotene and vitamins C and E) and zinc was associated with a reduced risk of AMD progression. The AREDS2 follow-up study, designed to improve upon the earlier formulation, tested the addition of lutein, zeaxanthin, and ω-3 fatty acids. In this review, we examine the science behind the nutritional factors included in these interventional studies and the reasons for considering their inclusion to lower the rate of AMD progression.",

    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 1 in 5 women of reproductive age, and is characterized by menstrual irregularities, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and the presence of polycystic ovary morphology. One of the recommended treatment strategies in the international evidence-based guidelines is lifestyle modification, which includes diet and exercise, with the aim of improving a range of health outcomes. The incurable nature of PCOS reinforces the importance of developing novel and innovative symptomatic relief strategies, which are currently the only available approaches for improving quality of life for these women. Women with PCOS tend to be nutrient deficient in many common vitamins and minerals, thought to be associated with the psychological (depression, anxiety, etc.) and physiological (insulin resistance, diabetes, infertility, etc.) sequelae of the condition. Nutrient supplementation and the integration of complementary medicine as adjuncts to traditional lifestyle-based therapies in PCOS could therefore provide additional benefits to these women. In this review, we synthesize the evidence regarding nutrient supplementation and complementary therapies in PCOS, predominantly from randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, to provide an overview of the state of knowledge in this field. The evidence to date suggests that specific vitamins (B-12, inositols, folate, vitamins D, E, and K), vitamin-like nutrients (bioflavonoids and α-lipoic acid), minerals (calcium, zinc, selenium, and chromium picolinate), and other formulations (melatonin, ω-3 fatty acids, probiotics, and cinnamon), as well as some complementary approaches such as acupuncture and yoga may be beneficial in PCOS. However, there remain areas of uncertainty and key limitations in the literature that must be overcome before these therapies can be integrated into routine clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "High-oleic acid soybean oil (H-OSBO) is a trait-enhanced vegetable oil containing >70% oleic acid. Developed as an alternative for trans-FA (TFA)-containing vegetable oils, H-OSBO is predicted to replace large amounts of soybean oil in the US diet. However, there is little evidence concerning the effects of H-OSBO on coronary heart disease (CHD)(6) risk factors and CHD risk. We examined and quantified the effects of substituting high-oleic acid (HO) oils for fats and oils rich in saturated FAs (SFAs), TFAs, or n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) on blood lipids in controlled clinical trials. Searches of online databases through June 2014 were used to select studies that defined subject characteristics; described control and intervention diets; substituted HO oils compositionally similar to H-OSBO (i.e., ≥70% oleic acid) for equivalent amounts of oils high in SFAs, TFAs, or n-6 PUFAs for ≥3 wk; and reported changes in blood lipids. Studies that replaced saturated fats or oils with HO oils showed significant reductions in total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) (P < 0.05; mean percentage of change: -8.0%, -10.9%, -7.9%, respectively), whereas most showed no changes in HDL cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), the ratio of TC to HDL cholesterol (TC:HDL cholesterol), and apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1). Replacing TFA-containing oil sources with HO oils showed significant reductions in TC, LDL cholesterol, apoB, TGs, TC:HDL cholesterol and increased HDL cholesterol and apoA-1 (mean percentage of change: -5.7%, -9.2%, -7.3%, -11.7%, -12.1%, 5.6%, 3.7%, respectively; P < 0.05). In most studies that replaced oils high in n-6 PUFAs with equivalent amounts of HO oils, TC, LDL cholesterol, TGs, HDL cholesterol, apoA-1, and TC:HDL cholesterol did not change. These findings suggest that replacing fats and oils high in SFAs or TFAs with either H-OSBO or oils high in n-6 PUFAs would have favorable and comparable effects on plasma lipid risk factors and overall CHD risk.",

    "abstract": "Whole grains are a key component of a healthy diet, and enabling consumers to easily choose foods with a high whole-grain content is an important step for better prevention of chronic disease. Several definitions exist for whole-grain foods, yet these do not account for the diversity of food products that contain cereals. With the goal of creating a relatively simple whole-grain food definition that aligns with whole-grain intake recommendations and can be applied across all product categories, the Healthgrain Forum, a not-for-profit consortium of academics and industry working with cereal foods, established a working group to gather input from academics and industry to develop guidance on labeling the whole-grain content of foods. The Healthgrain Forum recommends that a food may be labeled as \"whole grain\" if it contains ≥30% whole-grain ingredients in the overall product and contains more whole grain than refined grain ingredients, both on a dry-weight basis. For the purposes of calculation, added bran and germ are not considered refined-grain ingredients. Additional recommendations are also made on labeling whole-grain content in mixed-cereal foods, such as pizza and ready meals, and a need to meet healthy nutrition criteria. This definition allows easy comparison across product categories because it is based on dry weight and strongly encourages a move from generic whole-grain labels to reporting the actual percentage of whole grain in a product. Although this definition is for guidance only, we hope that it will encourage more countries to adopt regulation around the labeling of whole grains and stimulate greater awareness and consumption of whole grains in the general population.",

    "abstract": "The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting the intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to <10% of energy/d and replacing dietary SFAs with unsaturated fatty acids. A Presidential Advisory from the American Heart Association recently released its evaluation of the relation between dietary fats and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and also recommended a shift from SFAs to unsaturated fatty acids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in conjunction with a healthy dietary pattern. However, the suggestion to increase the intake of PUFAs in general, and omega-6 (n-6) PUFAs in particular, continues to be controversial. This review was undertaken to provide an overview of the evidence and controversies regarding the effects of ω-6 PUFAs on cardiometabolic health, with emphasis on risks and risk factors for CVD (coronary heart disease and stroke) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Results from observational studies show that higher intake of ω-6 PUFAs, when compared with SFAs or carbohydrate, is associated with lower risks for CVD events (10-30%), CVD and total mortality (10-40%), and T2D (20-50%). Findings from intervention studies on cardiometabolic risk factors suggest that ω-6 PUFAs reduce concentrations of LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner compared with dietary carbohydrate, and have a neutral effect on blood pressure. Despite the concern that ω-6 fatty acids increase inflammation, current evidence from studies in humans does not support this view. In conclusion, these findings support current recommendations to emphasize consumption of ω-6 PUFAs as a replacement of SFAs; additional randomized controlled trials with cardiometabolic disease outcomes will help to more clearly define the benefits and risks of this policy.",

    "abstract": "Optimal nutrition early in life is critical to ensure proper structural and functional development of infant organ systems. Although pediatric nutrition historically has emphasized research on the relation between nutrition, growth rates, and gastrointestinal maturation, efforts increasingly have focused on how nutrition influences neurodevelopment. The provision of human milk is considered the gold standard in pediatric nutrition; thus, there is interest in understanding how functional nutrients and bioactive components in milk may modulate developmental processes. The piglet has emerged as an important translational model for studying neurodevelopmental outcomes influenced by pediatric nutrition. Given the comparable nutritional requirements and strikingly similar brain developmental patterns between young pigs and humans, the piglet is being used increasingly in developmental nutritional neuroscience studies. The piglet primarily has been used to assess the effects of dietary fatty acids and their accretion in the brain throughout neurodevelopment. However, recent research indicates that other dietary components, including choline, iron, cholesterol, gangliosides, and sialic acid, among other compounds, also affect neurodevelopment in the pig model. Moreover, novel analytical techniques, including but not limited to MRI, behavioral assessments, and molecular quantification, allow for a more holistic understanding of how nutrition affects neurodevelopmental patterns. By combining early-life nutritional interventions with innovative analytical approaches, opportunities abound to quantify factors affecting neurodevelopmental trajectories in the neonate. This review discusses research using the translational pig model with primary emphasis on early-life nutrition interventions assessing neurodevelopment outcomes, while also discussing nutritionally-sensitive methods to characterize brain maturation.",

    "abstract": "The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding of infants for the first 6 mo of life (EBF-6). We reviewed the evidence behind concerns related to this recommendation. The risk of iron deficiency among EBF-6 infants can be significantly reduced if delayed cord clamping is performed in all newborns. At the moment there is no population-level evidence indicating that exclusive breastfeeding for 6 mo compared with <6 mo increases the risk of developing food allergies. Mild to moderate maternal undernutrition may reduce amounts of some nutrients in breast milk but does not directly diminish milk volume. Persistent reports of insufficient milk by women globally are likely to be the result of lack of access to timely lactation counseling and social support rather than primary biological reasons. All newborns should have their growth, hydration status, and development carefully monitored. In instances where formula supplementation is required, it should be done under the guidance of a qualified provider taking into account that early introduction of breast-milk supplements is a risk factor for early termination of exclusive breastfeeding and any breastfeeding. We found no evidence to support changes to the EBF-6 public health recommendation, although variability in inter-infant developmental readiness is recognized. We suggest that infant and young feeding guidelines make clear that complementary foods should be introduced at around 6 mo of age, taking infant developmental readiness into account.",

    "abstract": "To update the European Association for the Study of Diabetes clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy, we conducted an umbrella review and updated systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) of prospective cohort studies of the association between dietary pulses with or without other legumes and cardiometabolic disease outcomes. We searched the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases through March 2019. We included the most recent SRMAs of prospective cohort studies and new prospective cohort studies published after the census dates of the included SRMAs assessing the relation between dietary pulses with or without other legumes and incidence and mortality of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) [including coronary heart disease (CHD), myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke], diabetes, hypertension, and/or obesity. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Risk estimates were pooled using the generic inverse variance method and expressed as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Six SRMAs were identified and updated to include 28 unique prospective cohort studies with the following number of cases for each outcome: CVD incidence, 10,261; CVD mortality, 16,168; CHD incidence, 7786; CHD mortality, 3331; MI incidence, 2585; stroke incidence, 8570; stroke mortality, 2384; diabetes incidence, 10,457; hypertension incidence, 83,284; obesity incidence, 8125. Comparing the highest with the lowest level of intake, dietary pulses with or without other legumes were associated with significant decreases in CVD (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.99), CHD (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99), hypertension (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.97), and obesity (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.94) incidence. There was no association with MI, stroke, and diabetes incidence or CVD, CHD, and stroke mortality. The overall certainty of the evidence was graded as \"low\" for CVD incidence and \"very low\" for all other outcomes. Current evidence shows that dietary pulses with or without other legumes are associated with reduced CVD incidence with low certainty and reduced CHD, hypertension, and obesity incidence with very low certainty. More research is needed to improve our estimates. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03555734.",

    "abstract": "To date, observational studies in nutrition have categorized foods into groups such as dairy, cereals, fruits, and vegetables. However, the strength of the association between food groups and chronic diseases is far from convincing. In most international expert surveys, risks are most commonly scored as probable, limited, or insufficient rather than convincing. In this position paper, we hypothesize that current food classifications based on botanical or animal origins can be improved to yield solid recommendations. We propose using a food classification that employs food processes to rank foods in epidemiological studies. Indeed, food health potential results from both nutrient density and food structure (i.e., the matrix effect), both of which can potentially be positively or negatively modified by processing. For example, cereal-based foods may be more or less refined, fractionated, and recombined with added salt, sugars, and fats, yielding a panoply of products with very different nutritional values. The same is true for other food groups. Finally, we propose that from a nutritional perspective, food processing will be an important issue to consider in the coming years, particularly in terms of strengthening the links between food and health and for proposing improved nutritional recommendations or actions.",

We discuss the available data and investigate the effects of dietary fructose on risk factors associated with metabolic disorders. The evidence suggests that fructose may be a predisposing cause in the development of insulin resistance in association with the induction of hypertriglyceridemia. Experiments in animals have shown this relation when they are fed diets very high in fructose or sucrose, and human studies also show this relation, although with conflicting results due to the heterogeneity of the studies. The link between increased fructose consumption and increases in uric acid also has been confirmed as a potential risk factor for metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia may be causally related to the development of hypertension. Collectively, these results suggest a link between high fructose intake and insulin resistance, although future studies must be of reasonable duration, use defined populations, and improve comparisons regarding the effects of relevant doses of nutrients on specific endpoints to fully understand the effect of fructose intake in the absence of potential confounding factors.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing public health concern affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide and costing the global economy hundreds of billions of dollars annually. This chronic disease damages the blood vessels and increases the risk of other cardiometabolic ailments such as cardiovascular disease and stroke. If left unmanaged it can also lead to nerve damage, kidney damage, blindness, and amputation. For the most part, many of these symptoms can be prevented or reduced through simple dietary modifications and proper nutrition. Therefore, identifying relatively inexpensive and easily implementable dietary modifications for the prevention and management of T2DM is of considerable value to human health and healthcare modalities around the globe. Protein-rich dairy products have consistently been shown in epidemiologic studies to be beneficial for reducing the risk of developing T2DM. The clinical evidence regarding both dairy foods and dairy proteins (i.e., casein and whey protein) have shown promise for improving insulin secretion in individuals with T2DM. However, the clinical research on dairy protein supplementation in subjects with T2DM has been limited to acute studies. These studies have been mostly descriptive and have not been focused on important T2DM endpoints such as prevention, management, or treatment. Long-term studies are clearly needed to help researchers and medical professionals better understand the effects of consistent dairy protein intake on the metabolic health of humans with T2DM.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for glycemic control in adults with impaired glucose control, including prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases, and trial registries up to February 2019. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of participants with prediabetes or T2DM. Eligible trials compared probiotics versus either placebo, no intervention, or comparison probiotics, or compared synbiotics versus prebiotics. Primary outcomes were mean change in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to short term (<12 wk) and long term (≥12 wk). We performed meta-analyses using the random-effects model. We included 28 RCTs (1947 participants). Overall, probiotics reduced FBG more than the placebo/no intervention group with a mean difference (MD) of -12.99 mg/dL (95% CI: -23.55, -2.42; P value: 0.016) over the short term; and -2.99 mg/dL (95% CI: -5.84, -0.13; P value: 0.040) over the long term. There was also some evidence for reduced HbA1c in the probiotics group at both short term (MD: -0.17; 95% CI: -0.37, 0.02; P value: 0.084) and long term (MD: -0.14; 95% CI: -0.34, 0.06; P value: 0.172), however, these did not reach statistical significance possibly because only a few trials reported HbA1c as an outcome. Subgroup analyses showed a greater reduction in HbA1c in participants not receiving insulin therapy than those receiving insulin therapy. Furthermore, the effect of probiotics on the reduction of FBG was more pronounced in participants with FBG >130 mg/dL and those not receiving insulin therapy than their counterparts. Probiotics were also effective in lowering serum cholesterol over the short and long term. In conclusion, we found that probiotics may have a glucose-lowering effect in T2DM participants. The effect appeared to be stronger in participants with poorly controlled diabetes and those not on insulin therapy. Systematic review registration: CRD42019121682.",

In particular, survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia have been found to be at risk of becoming overweight or obese early in treatment, with increases in weight maintained throughout treatment and beyond. Nutrition plays an important role in the etiology of obesity and cardiometabolic conditions and is among the few modifiable factors that can prevent or delay the early onset of these chronic conditions. However, nutritional intake in childhood cancer survivors has not been adequately examined and the evidence is built on data from small cohorts of survivors. In addition, the long-term impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment on survivors' nutritional intake as well as how survivors' nutritional intake is associated with chronic health conditions have not been well quantified in large-scale studies. Promoting family-based healthy lifestyles, preferably at a sensitive window of unhealthy weight gain, is a priority for preventing the early onset of obesity and cardiometabolic conditions in childhood cancer survivors.",

    "abstract": "Probiotics are increasingly used as a supplement to prevent adverse health outcomes in preterm infants. We conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and subgroup analysis of findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the magnitude of the effect of the probiotics on health outcomes among very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants. Relevant articles from January 2003 to June 2017 were selected from a broad range of databases, including Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. Studies were included if they used an RCT design, involved a VLBW infant (birthweight <1500 g or gestational age <32 wk) population, included a probiotic intervention group, measured necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) as a primary outcome, and measured sepsis, mortality, length of hospital stay, weight gain, and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) as additional outcomes. The initial database search yielded 132 potentially relevant articles and 32 (n = 8998 infants) RCTs were included in the final meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was used to evaluate the effects of the moderators on the outcome variables. In the probiotics group, it was found that NEC was reduced by 37% (95% CI: 0.51%, 0.78%), sepsis by 37% (95% CI: 0.72%, 0.97%), mortality by 20% (95% CI: 0.67%, 0.95%), and length of hospital stay by 3.77 d (95% CI: -5.94, -1.60 d). These findings were all significant when compared with the control group. There was inconsistent use of strain types among some of the studies. The results indicate that probiotic consumption can significantly reduce the risk of developing medical complications associated with NEC and sepsis, reduce mortality and length of hospital stay, and promote weight gain in VLBW infants. Probiotics are more effective when taken in breast milk and formula form, consumed for <6 wk, administered with a dosage of <109 CFU/d, and include multiple strains. Probiotics are not effective in reducing the incidence of IVH in VLBW infants.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota is increasingly implicated in the health and metabolism of its human host. The host's diet is a major component influencing the composition and function of the gut microbiota, and mounting evidence suggests that the composition and function of the gut microbiota influence the host's metabolic response to diet. This effect of the gut microbiota on personalized dietary response is a growing focus of precision nutrition research and may inform the effort to tailor dietary advice to the individual. Because the gut microbiota has been shown to be malleable to some extent, it may also allow for therapeutic alterations of the gut microbiota in order to alter response to certain dietary components. This article is the second in a 2-part review of the current research in the field of precision nutrition incorporating the gut microbiota into studies investigating interindividual variability in response to diet. Part I reviews the methods used by researchers to design and carry out such studies as well as analyze the results subsequently obtained. Part II reviews the findings of these studies and discusses the gaps in our current knowledge and directions for future research. The studies reviewed provide the current understanding in this field of research and a foundation from which we may build, utilizing and expanding upon the methods and results they present to inform future studies.",

    "abstract": "Cardiometabolic disease, comprising cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and their associated risk factors including metabolic syndrome and obesity, is the leading cause of death worldwide. Plant foods are rich sources of different groups of bioactive compounds, which might not be essential throughout life but promote health and well-being by reducing the risk of age-related chronic diseases. However, heterogeneity in the responsiveness to bioactive compounds can obscure associations between their intakes and health outcomes, resulting in the hiding of health benefits for specific population groups and thereby limiting our knowledge of the exact role of the different bioactive compounds for health. The heterogeneity in response suggests that some individuals may benefit more than others from the health effects of these bioactive compounds. However, to date, this interindividual variation after habitual intake of plant bioactive compounds has been little explored. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the existing research that has revealed interindividual variability in the responsiveness to plant-food bioactive compound consumption regarding cardiometabolic outcomes, focusing on polyphenols, caffeine and plant sterols, and the identified potential determinants involved.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the magnitude and impact of dietary pesticide exposures is a concern for some consumers. However, the ability of consumers to obtain and understand state-of-the-science information about how pesticides are regulated and how dietary exposure limits are set can be limited by the complicated nature of the regulations coupled with an abundance of sources seeking to cast doubt on the reliability of those regulations. Indeed, these regulations are sometimes not well understood within health care professions. As such, the objective of this review is to provide a historical perspective as to how modern pesticides were developed, current trends in pesticide use and regulation, and measures taken to reduce the risk of pesticide use to the consumer. Throughout the review, we provide specific examples for some of the concepts as they apply to glyphosate-a pesticide commonly used by both farmers and consumers. In addition, we describe current efforts to monitor pesticide use. We are confident that this succinct, yet thorough, review of this topic will be of interest to myriad researchers, public health experts, and health practitioners as they help communicate information about making healthful and sustainable food choices to the public.",

    "abstract": "There is consistent public guidance to limit sugars intakes. However, WHO recommendations are for \"free\" sugars, whereas some other guidance documents and public discussion focus on \"added\" sugars, and globally most food labeling states \"total\" sugars. Total sugars comprise all mono- and disaccharides, regardless of source, whereas both added and free sugars exclude the sugars that naturally occur in dairy products and intact fruit and vegetables. Definitions of added and free sugars differ mainly in their respective exclusion or inclusion of sugars in juiced or pureed fruit and vegetables. To date, there has been little evidence-based analysis of the scientific basis for these different sugar classifications or implications of their adoption for consumer communication and nutrition labeling. Evidence of discriminating relations of total compared with added or free sugars with weight gain or energy intake, type 2 diabetes, and dental caries was identified from recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The relations were weakest for total sugars and most consistent for dietary sources corresponding to free sugars (including sugars added to and in fruit juices). Consideration of these health outcomes suggests that the emphasis for intake monitoring, public health guidance, and consumer communication should be on free sugars. However, at present, the adoption of free sugars for these purposes would also carry challenges related to implementation, including consumer understanding, consensus on specifications, and current (labeling) regulations.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that affects a substantial part of the population around the world. Whether type I or type II, this disease has serious macro- and microvascular complications that constitute the primary cause of death in diabetic patients. Microvascular complications include diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Although these complications are clinically and etiologically diverse, they share a common factor: glucose-induced damage. In the progression of diabetic complications, oxidative stress, inflammation, and the formation of glycation end products play an important role. Previous studies have shown that a healthy diet is vital in preventing these complications; in particular, the intake of antioxidants has been studied for their potential effect in ameliorating hyperglycemic injuries. Carotenoids are lipid-soluble pigments synthesized by plants, bacteria, and some kinds of algae that are responsible for the yellow, red, and orange colors in food. These compounds are part of the antioxidant machinery in plants and have also shown their efficacy in quenching free radicals, scavenging reactive oxygen species, modulating gene expression, and reducing inflammation in vitro and in vivo, showing that they can potentially be used as part of a preventive strategy for metabolic disorders, including diabetes and its related complications. This review highlights the potential protective effects of 4 non-provitamin A carotenoids—lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin—in the development and progression of diabetic microvascular complications.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin B-6 in the form of pyridoxine (PN) is commonly used by the general population. The use of PN-containing supplements has gained lots of attention over the past years as they have been related to the development of peripheral neuropathy. In light of this, the number of reported cases of adverse health effects due to the use of vitamin B-6 have increased. Despite a long history of study, the pathogenic mechanisms associated with PN toxicity remain elusive. Therefore, the present review is focused on investigating the mechanistic link between PN supplementation and sensory peripheral neuropathy. Excessive PN intake induces neuropathy through the preferential injury of sensory neurons. Recent reports on hereditary neuropathy due to pyridoxal kinase (PDXK) mutations may provide some insight into the mechanism, as genetic deficiencies in PDXK lead to the development of axonal sensory neuropathy. High circulating concentrations of PN may lead to a similar condition via the inhibition of PDXK. The mechanism behind PDXK-induced neuropathy is unknown; however, there is reason to believe that it may be related to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. Compounds that inhibit PDXK lead to convulsions and reductions in GABA biosynthesis. The absence of central nervous system-related symptoms in PDXK deficiency could be due to differences in the regulation of PDXK, where PDXK activity is preserved in the brain but not in peripheral tissues. As PN is relatively impermeable to the blood–brain barrier, PDXK inhibition would similarly be confined to the peripheries and, as a result, GABA signaling may be perturbed within peripheral tissues, such as sensory neurons. Perturbed GABA signaling within sensory neurons may lead to excitotoxicity, neurodegeneration, and ultimately, the development of peripheral neuropathy. For several reasons, we conclude that PDXK inhibition and consequently disrupted GABA neurotransmission is the most plausible mechanism of toxicity.",

    "abstract": "In the field of human nutrition, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for establishing causal relations between exposure to nutrients, foods, or dietary patterns and prespecified outcome measures, such as body composition, biomarkers, or event rates. Evidence-based dietary guidance is frequently derived from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of these RCTs. Each decision made during the design and conduct of human nutrition RCTs will affect the utility and generalizability of the study results. Within the context of limited resources, the goal is to maximize the generalizability of the findings while producing the highest quality data and maintaining the highest levels of ethics and scientific integrity. The aim of this document is to discuss critical aspects of conducting human nutrition RCTs, including considerations for study design (parallel, crossover, factorial, cluster), institutional ethics approval (institutional review boards), recruitment and screening, intervention implementation, adherence and retention assessment, and statistical analyses considerations. Additional topics include distinguishing between efficacy and effectiveness, defining the research question(s), monitoring biomarker and outcome measures, and collecting and archiving data. Addressed are specific aspects of planning and conducting human nutrition RCTs, including types of interventions, inclusion/exclusion criteria, participant burden, randomization and blinding, trial initiation and monitoring, and the analysis plan.",

    "abstract": "Improving awareness and accessibility of healthy diets are key challenges for health professionals and policymakers alike. While the US government has been assessing and encouraging nutritious diets via the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) since 1980, the long-term sustainability, and thus availability, of those diets has received less attention. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) examined the evidence on sustainable diets for the first time, but this topic was not included within the scope of work for the 2020 DGAC. The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence on US dietary patterns and sustainability outcomes published from 2015 to 2019 replicating the 2015 DGAC methodology. The 22 studies meeting inclusion criteria reveal a rapid expansion of research on US dietary patterns and sustainability, including 8 studies comparing the sustainability of DGA-compliant dietary patterns with current US diets. Our results challenge prior findings that diets adhering to national dietary guidelines are more sustainable than current average diets and indicate that the Healthy US-style dietary pattern recommended by the DGA may lead to similar or increased greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, and water use compared with the current US diet. However, consistent with previous research, studies meeting inclusion criteria generally support the conclusion that, among healthy dietary patterns, those higher in plant-based foods and lower in animal-based foods would be beneficial for environmental sustainability. Additional research is needed to further evaluate ways to improve food system sustainability through both dietary shifts and agricultural practices in the United States.",

We searched PubMed, Embase, and national data archives for the studies using national survey data and published in English from January 1, 2007 to September 11, 2020. Forty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were systematically reviewed. After a short leveling-off during 2009–2012, the US national prevalence of obesity has steadily increased. Although women had higher racial/ethnic disparities in obesity and severe obesity than men, it decreased due to the significant drop in non-Hispanic black (NHB) women in the last 10 y. However, obesity and severe obesity prevalence increased in Mexican-American (MA) men, MA boys, and MA girls and became similar to or surpassing NHB groups. Substantial racial/ethnic disparities remained in the past decade. Even at the same level of BMI, MAs and non-Hispanic Asians had a higher percent of body fat and metabolic syndrome than other ethnic/racial groups. NHB's cultural preference for a large body significantly associated weight misperception and lower weight control practices. In addition to socioeconomic status, health behaviors, neighborhood environments, and early childhood health factors explained substantial racial/ethnic differences in obesity. Differences in biological, behavioral, and sociocultural characteristics should be considered in future public health intervention efforts to combat obesity in the USA.",

    "abstract": "Water is an essential nutrient that has primarily been considered in terms of its physiological necessity. But reliable access to water in sufficient quantities and quality is also critical for many nutrition-related behaviors and activities, including growing and cooking diverse foods. Given growing challenges to water availability and safety, including climate change, pollution, and infrastructure degradation, a broader conceptualization of water and its diverse uses is needed to sustainably achieve global nutrition targets. Therefore, we review empirical and qualitative evidence describing the linkages between water security (the reliable availability, accessibility, and quality of water for all household uses) and nutrition. Primary linkages include water security for drinking, food production and preparation, infant and young child feeding, and limiting exposure to pathogens and environmental toxins. We then identify knowledge gaps within each linkage and propose a research agenda for studying water security and nutrition going forward, including the concurrent quantification of both food and water availability, accessibility, use, and stability. By making explicit the connections between water security and nutritional well-being, we aim to promote greater collaboration between the nutrition and water, sanitation, and hygiene sectors. Interdisciplinary policies and programs that holistically address the water-nutrition nexus, versus those that focus on water and nutrition independently, are likely to significantly advance our ability to ensure equitable access to healthy foods and safe water for all.",

In the rapidly evolving field of precision nutrition, researchers aim to identify how genetics, epigenetics, and the microbiome interact to shape an individual's response to diet. With this understanding, personalized responses can be predicted and dietary advice can be tailored to the individual. With the integration of these complex sources of data, an important aspect of precision nutrition research is the methodology used for studying interindividual variability in response to diet. This article stands as the first in a 2-part review of current research investigating the contribution of the gut microbiota to interindividual variability in response to diet. Part I reviews the methods used by researchers to design and carry out such studies as well as the statistical and bioinformatic methods used to analyze results. Part II reviews the findings of these studies, discusses gaps in our current knowledge, and summarizes directions for future research. Taken together, these reviews summarize the current state of knowledge and provide a foundation for future research on the role of the gut microbiome in precision nutrition.",

    "abstract": "Dietary modifications, including caloric restriction, dietary restriction, various intervals of fasting, and even limiting the time when food is consumed can have a pronounced impact on longevity. In addition, dietary modifications are powerful interventions to delay, prevent, or treat many aging-related diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Restricting amino acid and protein intake generally decreases aging-related comorbidities and thereby increases health and longevity. However, chronic dietary interventions are likely not feasible for most people due to low adherence to dietary protocols or resistance to drastic changes to lifestyle, and might even cause detrimental effects, possibly by negatively affecting the immune system and wound healing. The periodic use of low-protein, low-calorie fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) has the potential to promote health benefits, while minimizing the burden of chronic restriction. Protein restriction and FMDs together have the potential to play an important complementary role in medicine by promoting disease prevention and treatment, and by delaying the aging process at least in part by stimulating stem cell-based regeneration in periods of normal food intake after periodic FMD cycles. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize research on the impact of protein restriction on health and longevity in model organisms and to discuss the implementation of an FMD in mice and in human clinical trials and its effects on biomarkers of healthy aging. Taking into account the importance of sex on aging and diet, we include this information in all discussed studies. Whereas for some model organisms of aging, such as rodents, many studies are available, results are more limited for primates and/or humans.",

    "abstract": "The number of cancer survivors is growing rapidly worldwide, especially long-term survivors. Although a healthy diet with a high vegetable and fruit consumption is a key factor in primary cancer prevention, there is a lack of specific dietary recommendations for cancer survivors, except in the case of breast cancer [World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)/American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) report]. We have therefore carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies reporting on the associations between vegetable and fruit intake with cancer recurrence and mortality and all-cause mortality in cancer patients. After a comprehensive search of PubMed and Scopus databases, the results of 28 selected articles were analyzed. A high vegetable intake before diagnosis was inversely associated with overall mortality in survivors of head and neck (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.87) and ovarian cancer (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.91). In ovarian cancer patients, prediagnosis fruit intake was also inversely associated with all-cause mortality (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.96). The evidence was insufficient for survivors of other cancers, although these associations generally tended to be protective. Therefore, more studies are needed to clarify the association between vegetable and fruit consumption and the prognosis of these different types of cancer. To date, the general recommendation to consume ≥5 servings of vegetables and fruit per day (∼400 g/d) could underestimate the needs of cancer survivors, particularly those with ovarian tumors, in which the recommendation could increase to ∼600 g/d (i.e., 300 g/d of vegetables and 300 g/d of fruit).",

    "abstract": "No meta-analysis has examined the effect of dose and duration of zinc interventions on their impact on risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D) or cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aimed first to compare the effects of zinc interventions dichotomized as low versus high dose (<25 mg/d and ≥25 mg/d, respectively) and short versus long duration (<12 wk and ≥12 wk, respectively) on risk factors for T2D and CVD. Second, it discusses the results from the low-dose and long-duration meta-analyses as a foundation for understanding what impact a zinc-biofortification intervention could have on these risk factors. The PubMed and Cochrane Review databases were searched through January 2020 for full-text, human studies providing zinc supplements (alone) at doses ≤75 mg/d and a placebo. Data on study and sample characteristics and several T2D and CVD risk factors were extracted. There were 1042 and 974 participants receiving zinc and placebo, respectively, from 27 studies. Low-dose zinc supplementation (<25 mg/d) significantly benefited fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. High-dose zinc supplementation (≥25 mg/d) benefited glycated hemoglobin and insulin resistance. Short-duration interventions (<12 wk) benefited fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and triglycerides, while long-duration studies (≥12 wk) benefited fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and total and LDL cholesterol. Effect sizes for low-dose and long-duration interventions were of equal or greater magnitude to those from high-dose or short-duration interventions. Low-dose and long-duration zinc supplementation each improved more risk factors for T2D and CVD than high-dose and short-duration interventions, respectively. It is currently unknown whether low doses of zinc delivered over long durations via a biofortified crop would similarly impact these risk factors. However, this review suggests that low-dose, long-duration zinc intake from supplements, and potentially biofortification, can benefit risk factors for T2D and CVD.",

    "abstract": "Dairy products have been suggested to be related to the prevention of overweight or obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These associations are currently controversial, however, and a systematic quantitative meta-analysis is lacking. In this study, we examined the associations between dairy products and the risk of overweight or obesity, hypertension, and T2DM and tested for dose-response relations. We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to April 2021. Cohort studies were included if dairy food consumption was reported at a minimum of 3 levels or as continuous variables, and the associations were assessed with overweight or obesity, hypertension, and T2DM. Summary RRs and 95% CIs were estimated for the dose-response association. Restricted cubic splines were used to evaluate the linear or nonlinear relations. Among the 9887 articles retrieved, 42 articles were included. For overweight or obesity, a linear association was observed for total dairy, milk, and yogurt. The risk decreased by 25%, 7%, and 12% per 200-g/d increase for total dairy, high-fat dairy, and milk, respectively, and by 13% per 50-g/d increment of yogurt. For hypertension, a nonlinear association was observed with total dairy, whereas significant inverse associations were found for low-fat dairy (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.98) and milk (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.97) per 200-g/d intake increase. For T2DM, all types of dairy food consumption except for milk and low-fat dairy products showed nonlinear associations, with total dairy and yogurt intake associated with 3% and 7% lower risk per 200-g/d and 50-g/d intake increase, respectively. In conclusion, our study suggests that total dairy is associated with a low risk of overweight or obesity, hypertension, and T2DM, especially milk and yogurt for overweight or obesity, low-fat dairy and milk for hypertension, and yogurt for T2DM.",

    "abstract": "Guideline recommendation for a plant bioactive such as flavan-3-ols is a departure from previous recommendations because it is not based on deficiencies but rather improvement in health outcomes. Nevertheless, there is a rapidly growing body of clinical data reflecting benefits of flavan-3-ol intake that outweigh potential harms. Thus, the objective of the Expert Panel was to develop an intake recommendation for flavan-3-ols and cardiometabolic outcomes to inform multiple stakeholders including clinicians, policymakers, public health entities, and consumers. Guideline development followed the process set forth by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, which includes use of the Evidence to Decision Framework. Studies informing this guideline (157 randomized controlled trials and 15 cohort studies) were previously reviewed in a recently published systematic review and meta-analysis. Quality and strength-of-evidence along with risk-of-bias in reporting was reviewed. In drafting the guideline, data assessments and opinions by authoritative scientific bodies providing guidance on the safety of flavan-3-ols were considered. Moderate evidence supporting cardiometabolic protection resulting from flavan-3-ol intake in the range of 400-600 mg/d was supported in the literature. Further, increasing consumption of dietary flavan-3-ols can help improve blood pressure, cholesterol concentrations, and blood sugar. Strength of evidence was strongest for some biomarkers (i.e., systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and insulin/glucose dynamics). It should be noted that this is a food-based guideline and not a recommendation for flavan-3-ol supplements. This guideline was based on beneficial effects observed across a range of disease biomarkers and endpoints. Although a comprehensive assessment of available data has been reviewed, evidence gaps identified herein can inform scientists in guiding future randomized clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Carotenoids have been related to a number of health benefits. Their dietary intake and circulating levels have been associated with a reduced incidence of obesity, diabetes, certain types of cancer, and even lower total mortality. Their potential interaction with the gut microbiota (GM) has been generally overlooked but may be of relevance, as carotenoids largely bypass absorption in the small intestine and are passed on to the colon, where they appear to be in part degraded into unknown metabolites. These may include apo-carotenoids that may have biological effects because of higher aqueous solubility and higher electrophilicity that could better target transcription factors, i.e., NF-κB, PPARγ, and RAR/RXRs. If absorbed in the colon, they could have both local and systemic effects. Certain microbes that may be supplemented were also reported to produce carotenoids in the colon. Although some bactericidal aspects of carotenoids have been shown in vitro, a few studies have also demonstrated a prebiotic-like effect, resulting in bacterial shifts with health-associated properties. Also, stimulation of IgA could play a role in this respect. Carotenoids may further contribute to mucosal and gut barrier health, such as stabilizing tight junctions. This review highlights potential gut-related health-beneficial effects of carotenoids and emphasizes the current research gaps regarding carotenoid-GM interactions.",

    "abstract": "Diet is considered an important modifiable lifestyle factor capable of attenuating early cognitive changes in healthy older people. The inclusion of nuts in the diet has been investigated as a dietary strategy for maintenance of brain health across the lifespan. This review aimed to present up-to-date evidence regarding the association between nut intake and cognitive performance. Four databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus, and Embase) were systematically searched from inception to April 2020. Eligible articles were interventional or observational studies in humans aged ≥18 y that measured the effects (or association) of nuts (almond, hazelnut, macadamia, pistachio, walnut, pecan, pine nut, Brazil nut, cashew, peanut) on cognitive outcomes. Out of the 2374 articles identified in the searches, 22 involving 43,793 participants met the criteria and were ultimately included in this review. Memory (immediate and delayed), attention, processing speed, executive function, and visual-spatial ability, as well as risk of mild cognitive impairment, were the outcomes investigated. Lack of consistency across the studies regarding study design, types of nut used, and cognitive outcomes measured resulted in inconsistent evidence that the regular consumption of mixed nuts has a protective effect on cognition in adults of different ages. Nonetheless, we observed that studies targeting populations with a higher risk of cognitive decline tended to find a more favorable outcome. Furthermore, homogeneous findings were observed in the studies that specifically addressed the association between walnut consumption and cognitive performance: out of the 6 studies, including 2 randomized controlled trials, only 1 did not find a positive association.",

Concurrently, older adults are recommended to consume an adequate amount of high-quality dietary protein for the prevention of age-related muscle loss. In the current Perspective article, we discuss why it may not be preferred to consume a vegan diet at an older age. Our perspective is based on the proposed lower bioavailability and functionality of proteins in a vegan diet due to the matrix of the whole-food protein sources, the lower essential amino acid (EAA) content, and specific EAA deficiencies in proteins derived from plant-based foods. We propose that a vegan diet increases the risk of an inadequate protein intake at an older age and that current strategies to improve the anabolic properties of plant-based foods are not feasible for many older adults. We provide recommendations for further research to substantiate the remaining knowledge gaps regarding the consequences of a vegan diet on skeletal muscle mass and strength at an older age.",

    "abstract": "PUFAs are known to regulate cholesterol synthesis and cellular uptake by multiple mechanisms that do not involve SFAs. Polymorphisms in any of the numerous proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis, as a result of genetic variation, could lead to higher or lower serum cholesterol. PUFAs are susceptible to lipid peroxidation, which can lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, atherosclerosis, cancer, and disorders associated with inflammation, such as insulin resistance, arthritis, and numerous inflammatory syndromes. Eicosanoids from arachidonic acid are among the most powerful mediators that initiate an immune response, and a wide range of PUFA metabolites regulate numerous physiological processes. There is a misconception that dietary SFAs can cause inflammation, although endogenous palmitic acid is converted to ceramides and other cell constituents involved in an inflammatory response after it is initiated by lipid mediators derived from PUFAs. This article will discuss the many misconceptions regarding how dietary lipids regulate serum cholesterol, the fact that all-cause death rate is higher in humans with low compared with normal or moderately elevated serum total cholesterol, the numerous adverse effects of increasing dietary PUFAs or carbohydrate relative to SFAs, as well as metabolic conversion of PUFAs to SFAs and MUFAs as a protective mechanism. Consequently, dietary saturated fats seem to be less harmful than the proposed alternatives.",

Summarizing the best evidence on essential health outcomes from the consumption of nuts is essential to provide optimal recommendations. Our objective is to comprehensively assess health outcome associations related to the consumption of nuts and seeds, using a culinary definition including tree nuts and peanuts (registered in PROSPERO: CRD42021258300). Health outcomes of interest include cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, respiratory disease, mortality, and their disease biomarkers. We present associations for high compared with low consumption, per serving, and dose–response relations. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Epistemonikos were searched and screened for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Evidence was extracted from 89 articles on the consumption of nuts and relevant health outcomes, including 23 articles with meta-analysis on disease and mortality, 66 articles on biomarkers for disease, and 9 articles on allergy/adverse outcomes. Intake of nuts was associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases and related risk factors, with moderate quality of evidence. An intake of 28 g/d nuts compared with not eating nuts was associated with a 21% RR reduction of cardiovascular disease (including coronary heart disease incidence and mortality, atrial fibrillation, and stroke mortality), an 11% risk reduction of cancer deaths, and 22% reduction in all-cause mortality. Nut consumption was also inversely associated with mortality from respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, and diabetes; however, associations between nut consumption and diabetes incidence were mixed. Meta-analyses of trials on biomarkers for disease generally mirrored meta-analyses from observational studies on cardiovascular disease, cancers, and diabetes. Allergy and related adverse reactions to nuts were observed in 1–2% of adult populations, with substantial heterogeneity between studies. Overall, the current evidence supports dietary recommendations to consume a handful of nuts and seeds per day for people without allergies to these foods.",

Emerging evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is a key determinant for this population heterogeneity. Here, we provide an overview of some of the major computational and experimental tools being applied to critical questions of microbiota-mediated personalized nutrition and health. First, we discuss the latest advances in in silico modeling of the microbiota-nutrition-health axis, including the application of statistical, mechanistic, and hybrid artificial intelligence models. Second, we address high-throughput in vitro techniques for assessing interindividual heterogeneity, from ex vivo batch culturing of stool and continuous culturing in anaerobic bioreactors, to more sophisticated organ-on-a-chip models that integrate both host and microbial compartments. Third, we explore in vivo approaches for better understanding of personalized, microbiota-mediated responses to diet, prebiotics, and probiotics, from nonhuman animal models and human observational studies, to human feeding trials and crossover interventions. We highlight examples of existing, consumer-facing precision nutrition platforms that are currently leveraging the gut microbiota. Furthermore, we discuss how the integration of a broader set of the tools and techniques described in this piece can generate the data necessary to support a greater diversity of precision nutrition strategies. Finally, we present a vision of a precision nutrition and healthcare future, which leverages the gut microbiota to design effective, individual-specific interventions.",

    "abstract": "Fish consumption is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) partly ascribed to the high content of long-chain (LC) n–3 PUFAs; however, not all fish types are equally rich in these components. To date, it is not clear whether the beneficial effects of fish consumption are shared by fatty and lean fish. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to synthesize knowledge regarding the relation between the intake of fatty fish or lean fish and the risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase until May 2021 for full text with a prospective design involving humans providing data for the highest compared with the lowest fish consumption categories. Summary risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a random-effects model. Out of 1902 articles retrieved from the literature search, 19 reports met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Altogether, studies on fatty fish comprised 1,320,596 person-years of follow-up, 20,531 incident coronary heart disease (CHD) cases, 9256 incident CVD cases, and 104,763 total deaths. Studies on lean fish comprised 937,362 person-years of follow-up, 21,636 incident CHD cases, 7315 incident CVD cases, and 16,831 total deaths. An inverse association was present for fatty fish with CHD incidence (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.97), CHD mortality (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.98), and total mortality (RR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.99). This was not the case for lean fish. The summary estimates for CVD incidence and mortality did not show significant association with both fatty fish and lean fish consumption. The study findings are innovative in highlighting that the health benefits so far linked to fish consumption are, in fact, driven by fatty fish.",

    "abstract": "Food insecurity, defined as insufficient access to nutritious foods, is a social determinant of health that may underpin health disparities in the US. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals experience many health inequities that may be related to food insecurity, but no systematic analyses of the existing evidence have been published. Thus, the objective of this scoping review was to assess the literature on food insecurity among AI/AN individuals and communities, with a focus on the prevalence of food insecurity and its relations to sociodemographic, nutrition, and health characteristics. Systematic search and data extraction processes were used. Searches were conducted on PubMed as well as peer-reviewed journal and government websites. Of 3174 identified references, 34 publications describing 30 studies with predominantly AI/AN sample populations were included in the final narrative synthesis. Twenty-two studies (73%) were cross-sectional and the remaining 8 (27%) described interventions. The weighted average prevalence of food insecurity across the studies was 45.7%, although estimates varied from 16% to 80%. Most studies used some version of the USDA Food Security Survey Modules, although evidence supporting its validity in AI/AN respondents is limited. Based on the review, recommendations for future research were derived, which include fundamental validity testing, better representation of AI/AN individuals in federal or local food security reports, and consideration of cultural contexts when selecting methodological approaches. Advances in AI/AN food insecurity research could yield tangible benefits to ongoing initiatives aimed at increasing access to traditional foods, improving food environments on reservations and homelands, and supporting food sovereignty.",

A total of 33 distinct indicators were identified, of which 10 were used to assess the environmental dimension (mainly, carbon, water, and ecological footprint), 8 were used to assess the nutritional dimension (mainly Health score and Nutrient Rich Food Index), 1 was used to assess the economic dimension (dietary cost), and 8 used combined indicators. The remaining 6 indicators for the assessment of sociocultural dimension were only identified in 1 study but were not measured. The Mediterranean diet had a lower environmental impact than Western diets and showed a carbon footprint between 0.9 and 6.88 kg CO2/d per capita, a water footprint between 600 and 5280 m3/d per capita, and an ecological footprint between 2.8 and 53.42 m2/d per capita. With regard to the nutritional dimension, the Mediterranean diet had a high nutritional quality and obtained 122 points on the Health score and ranged between 12.95 and 90.6 points on the Nutrient Rich Food Index. The cost of the Mediterranean diet is similar to other diets and varied between 3.33 and 14.42€/d per capita. These findings show that no uniformity in assessing the MDiet's sustainability exists.",

    "abstract": "Dietary assessment can be crucial for the overall well-being of humans and, at least in some instances, for the prevention and management of chronic, life-threatening diseases. Recall and manual record-keeping methods for food-intake monitoring are available, but often inaccurate when applied for a long period of time. On the other hand, automatic record-keeping approaches that adopt mobile cameras and computer vision methods seem to simplify the process and can improve current human-centric diet-monitoring methods. Here we present an extended critical literature overview of image-based food-recognition systems (IBFRS) combining a camera of the user's mobile device with computer vision methods and publicly available food datasets (PAFDs). In brief, such systems consist of several phases, such as the segmentation of the food items on the plate, the classification of the food items in a specific food category, and the estimation phase of volume, calories, or nutrients of each food item. A total of 159 studies were screened in this systematic review of IBFRS. A detailed overview of the methods adopted in each of the 78 included studies of this systematic review of IBFRS is provided along with their performance on PAFDs. Studies that included IBFRS without presenting their performance in at least 1 of the above-mentioned phases were excluded. Among the included studies, 45 (58%) studies adopted deep learning methods and especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in at least 1 phase of the IBFRS with input PAFDs. Among the implemented techniques, CNNs outperform all other approaches on the PAFDs with a large volume of data, since the richness of these datasets provides adequate training resources for such algorithms. We also present evidence for the benefits of application of IBFRS in professional dietetic practice. Furthermore, challenges related to the IBFRS presented here are also thoroughly discussed along with future directions.",

    "abstract": "Unsaturated fatty acids might be involved in the prevention of and improvement in mental disorders, but the evidence on these associations has not been comprehensively assessed. This umbrella review aimed to appraise the credibility of published evidence evaluating the associations between unsaturated fatty acids and mental disorders. In this umbrella review, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies comparing unsaturated fatty acids (including supplementation, dietary intake, and blood concentrations) in participants with mental disorders with healthy individuals were included. We reanalyzed summary estimates, between-study heterogeneity, predictive intervals, publication bias, small-study effects, and excess significance bias for each meta-analysis. Ninety-five meta-analyses from 29 systematic reviews were included, encompassing 43 studies on supplementation interventions, 32 studies on dietary factors, and 20 studies on blood biomarkers. Suggestive evidence was only observed for dietary intake, in which higher intake of fish was associated with reduced risk of depression (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.89) and Alzheimer disease (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.87), and higher intake of total PUFAs might be associated with a lower risk of mild cognitive impairment (RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.84). Evidence showed that PUFA supplementation was favorable but had weak credibility in anxiety, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), dementia, mild cognitive impairment, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia (P-random effects <0.001-0.040). There was also weak evidence on the effect of decreased circulating n-3 (ɷ-3) PUFAs among patients on risk of ADHD, ASD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (P-random effects <10-6-0.037). Our results suggest that higher levels of unsaturated fatty acids may relieve symptoms or reduce the risk of various mental disorders; however, the strength of the associations and credibility of the evidence were generally weak. Future high-quality research is needed to identify whether PUFA interventions should be prioritized to alleviate mental disorders.",

We aimed to assess the effect of whey protein supplementation alone or with vitamin D on lean mass (LM), strength, and function in older adults with or without sarcopenia or frailty. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that investigated the effect of whey protein supplementation with or without vitamin D on sarcopenia outcomes in healthy and sarcopenic or frail older adults were included. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for LM, muscle strength, and physical function data. The analysis showed that whey protein supplementation had no effect on LM and muscle strength; nevertheless, a significant improvement was found in physical function (SMD = 0.561; 95% confidence interval [CIs]: 0.256, 0.865, n = 33), particularly gait speed (GS). On the contrary, whey protein supplementation significantly improved LM (SMD = 0.982; 95% CI: 0.228, 1.736; n = 11), appendicular lean mass and physical function (SMD = 1.211; 95% CI: 0.588, 1.834; n = 16), and GS in sarcopenic/frail older adults. By contrast, co-supplementation with vitamin D enhanced LM gains (SMD =0.993; 95% CI: 0.112, 1.874; n = 11), muscle strength (SMD =2.005; 95% CI: 0.975, 3.035; n = 11), and physical function (SMD = 3.038; 95% CI: 2.196, 3.879; n = 18) significantly. Muscle strength and physical function improvements after whey protein supplementation plus vitamin D were observed without resistance exercise (RE) and short study duration subgroups. Moreover, the combination of whey protein and vitamin D with RE did not enhance the effect of RE. Whey protein supplementation improved LM and function in sarcopenic/frail older adults but had no positive effect in healthy older persons. By contrast, our meta-analysis showed that co-supplementation with whey protein and vitamin D is effective, particularly in healthy older adults, which is likely owing, we propose, to the correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency.

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library to identify meta-analyses/pooled analyses of prospective studies examining the association between cheese consumption and major health outcomes from inception to August 31, 2022. We reanalyzed and updated previous meta-analyses and performed de novo meta-analyses with recently published prospective studies, where appropriate. We calculated the summary effect size, 95% prediction confidence intervals, between-study heterogeneity, small-study effects, and excess significance bias for each health outcome. We identified 54 eligible articles of meta-analyses/pooled analyses. After adding newly published original articles, we performed 35 updated meta-analyses and 4 de novo meta-analyses. Together with 8 previous meta-analyses, we finally included 47 unique health outcomes. Cheese consumption was inversely associated with all-cause mortality (highest compared with lowest category: RR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.99), cardiovascular mortality (RR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99), incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (RR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.96), coronary heart disease (CHD) (RR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.98), stroke (RR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.98), estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer (RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.97), type 2 diabetes (RR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.98), total fracture (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.95), and dementia (RR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.99). Null associations were found for other outcomes. According to the NutriGrade scoring system, moderate quality of evidence was observed for inverse associations of cheese consumption with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, incident CVD, CHD, and stroke, and for null associations with cancer mortality, incident hypertension, and prostate cancer.

Previous (small-scale) studies have found a blood glucose-lowering effect of exogenous ketones. This study aimed to systematically review available evidence and conduct meta-analyses of studies reporting on exogenous ketones and blood glucose. We searched 6 electronic databases on 13 December 2021 for randomized and nonrandomized trials of any length that reported on the use of exogenous ketones. We calculated raw mean differences (MDs) in blood BHB and glucose in 2 main analyses: 1) after compared with before acute ingestion of exogenous ketones and 2) following acute ingestion of exogenous ketones compared with a comparator supplement. We pooled effect sizes using random-effects models and performed prespecified subgroup analyses to examine the effect of potential explanatory factors, including study population, exercise, blood BHB, and supplement type, dosing, and timing. Risk of bias was examined using Cochrane's risk-of-bias tools. Studies that could not be meta-analyzed were summarized narratively. Forty-three trials including 586 participants are summarized in this review. Following ingestion, exogenous ketones increased blood BHB (MD = 1.73 mM; 95% CI: 1.26, 2.21 mM; P < 0.001) and decreased mean blood glucose (MD = -0.54 mM; 95% CI: -0.68, -0.40 mM; P < 0.001). Similarly, when compared with placebo, blood BHB increased (MD = 1.98 mM; 95% CI: 1.52, 2.45 mM; P < 0.001) and blood glucose decreased (MD = -0.47 mM; 95% CI: -0.57, -0.36 mM; P < 0.001). Across both analyses, significantly greater effects were seen with ketone monoesters compared with salts (P < 0.001). The available evidence indicates that acute ingestion of exogenous ketones leads to increased blood BHB and decreased blood glucose. Limited evidence on prolonged ketone supplementation was found.",

    "abstract": "It is widely believed that diet and the gut microbiota are strongly related to the occurrence and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the effects of the interaction between dietary patterns and the gut microbiota on IBD have not been well elucidated. In this article, we aim to explore the complex relation between dietary patterns, gut microbiota, and IBD. We first comprehensively summarized the dietary patterns associated with IBD and found that dietary patterns can modulate the occurrence and progression of IBD through various signaling pathways, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and NF-κB. Besides, the gut microbiota performs a vital role in the progression of IBD, which can affect the expression of IBD susceptibility genes, such as dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) and APOA-1 , the intestinal barrier (in particular, the expression of tight junction proteins), immune function (especially the homeostasis between effector and regulatory T cells) and the physiological metabolism, in particular, SCFAs, bile acids (BAs), and tryptophan metabolism. Finally, we reviewed the current knowledge on the interaction between dietary patterns and the gut microbiota in IBD and found that dietary patterns modulate the onset and progression of IBD, which is partly attributed to the regulation of the gut microbiota (especially SCFAs-producing bacteria and Escherichia coli). Faecalibacteria as \"microbiomarkers\" of IBD could be used as a target for dietary interventions to alleviate IBD. A comprehensive understanding of the interplay between dietary intake, gut microbiota, and IBD will facilitate the development of personalized dietary strategies based on the regulation of the gut microbiota in IBD and expedite the era of precision nutritional interventions for IBD.",

    "abstract": "Various health-related effects of long-chain (LC) ω-3 PUFAs, EPA, and DHA have been suggested. LC ω-3 PUFAs reduce TG concentrations and have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiplatelet, and vascular protective effects. Controversially, they might help in restoring glucose homeostasis via the gut microbiota. However, previous studies have not shown the clear benefits of LC ω-3 PUFAs for CVDs. REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH-representative randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined whether LC ω-3 PUFAs would prevent major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events (MACE)-showed conflicting results with differences in the types, doses, or comparators of LC ω-3 PUFAs and study populations. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis using major RCTs to address this inconsistency and assess the clinical and biological effects of LC ω-3 PUFAs. We included RCTs that involved ≥500 participants with ≥1 y follow-up. Of 17 studies involving 143,410 people, LC ω-3 PUFA supplementation showed beneficial effects on CV death (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99; P = 0.029) and fatal or nonfatal MI (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.95; P = 0.010). RCTs on EPA alone showed better results for 3-point MACE, CV death, and fatal or nonfatal MI. However, the benefits were not found for fatal or nonfatal stroke, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure. Of note, studies of both the EPA/DHA combination and EPA alone showed a significant increase in risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation. Thus, well-designed studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in the distinct effects of EPA compared with DHA on cardiometabolic diseases. This review discusses the potential benefits and safety of LC ω-3 PUFAs from a cardiometabolic perspective focusing on recent updates and controversies.",

PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched up to March 2021. Prospective, observational cohort studies, nested case-control, and case-control designs that investigated the association between antioxidants and PD risk were included. A random-effects model was used to pool the RRs. The certainty of the evidence was rated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) scoring system. In addition, a dose-response relation was examined between antioxidant intake and PD risk. Six prospective cohort studies and 2 nested case-control (total n = 448,737 with 4654 cases), as well as 6 case-control (1948 controls, 1273 cases) studies were eligible. The pooled RR was significantly lower for the highest compared with the lowest intake categories of vitamin E (n = 7; 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.99) and anthocyanins (n = 2; 0.76; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.96) in cohort studies. Conversely, a significantly higher risk of PD was observed for higher lutein intake (n = 3; 1.86; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.88) among case-control studies. Dose-response meta-analyses indicated a significant association between a 50-mg/d increase in vitamin C (n = 6; RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99), a 5-mg/d increment in vitamin E (n = 7; RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.99), a 2-mg/d increment in β-carotene (n = 6; RR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89, 0.99), and a 1-mg/d increment in zinc (n = 1; OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.86) and a reduced risk of PD. Overall, higher intake of antioxidant-rich foods may be associated with a lower risk of PD. Future well-designed prospective studies are needed to validate the present findings.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of soluble fibers on blood lipids in adults were included. We estimated the change in blood lipids for each 5 g/d increment in soluble fiber supplementation in each trial and then calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI using a random-effects model. We estimated dose-dependent effects using a dose-response meta-analysis of differences in means.

    "abstract": "To identify how variables such as exercise condition, supplementation strategy, participant characteristics and demographics, and practices that control oral microbiota diversity could modify the effect of inorganic nitrate ingestion (as nitrate salt supplements, beetroot juice, and nitrate-rich vegetables) on exercise performance, we conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis. Studies were identified in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of inorganic nitrate on exercise performance in healthy adults. To assess the variation in effect size, we used meta-regression models for continuous variables and subgroup analysis for categorical variables. A total of 123 studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising 1705 participants. Nitrate was effective for improving exercise performance (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.101; 95% CI: 0.051, 0.151, P <0.001, I2 = 0%), although nitrate salts supplementation was not as effective (P = 0.629) as ingestion via beetroot juice (P <0.001) or a high-nitrate diet (P = 0.005). Practices that control oral microbiota diversity influenced the nitrate effect, with practices harmful to oral bacteria decreasing the ergogenic effect of nitrate. The ingestion of nitrate was most effective for exercise lasting between 2 and 10 min (P <0.001). An inverse dose-response relation between the fraction of inspired oxygen and the effect size (coefficient: -0.045, 95% CI: -0.085, -0.005, P = 0.028) suggests that nitrate was more effective in increasingly hypoxic conditions. There was a dose-response relation for acute administration (P = 0.049). The most effective acute dose was between 5 and 14.9 mmol provided ≥150 min prior to exercise (P <0.001). An inverse dose-response for protocols ≥2 d was observed (P = 0.025), with the optimal dose between 5 and 9.9 mmol·d-1 (P <0.001). Nitrate, via beetroot juice or a high-nitrate diet, improved exercise performance, in particular, in sessions lasting between 2 and 10 min. Ingestion of 5-14.9 mmolċd-1 taken ≥150 min prior to exercise appears optimal for performance gains and athletes should be aware that practices controlling oral microbiota diversity may decrease the effect of nitrate.",

We conducted a random-effect model meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of polyphenols on blood pressure, lipid profile, flow-mediated dilation (FMD), fasting blood glucose (FBG), waist circumference, and markers of inflammation. Effect size was expressed as weighted mean difference and 95% CI. RCTs published in English between 2000 and 2021 involving adult participants with cardiometabolic risks were searched in electronic databases. Forty-six RCTs involving 2494 participants with a mean age of 53.3 ±10 y were included in this review. Whole polyphenol-rich food but not purified food polyphenol extracts significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP, -3.69 mmHg; 95% CI: -4.24, -3.15 mmHg; P = 0.00001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP, -1.44 mmHg; 95% CI: -2.56, -0.31 mmHg; P = 0.0002). Concerning waist circumference, purified food polyphenol extracts led to a larger effect (-3.04 cm; 95% CI: -7.06, -0.98 cm; P = 0.14). Significant effects on total cholesterol (-9.03 mg/dL; 95% CI: -16.46, -1.06 mg/dL; P = 0.02) and TGs (-13.43 mg/dL; 95% CI: -23.63, -3.23; P = 0.01) were observed when purified food polyphenol extracts were considered separately. None of the intervention materials significantly affected LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, FBG, IL-6, and CRP. When both whole food and extracts were pooled together, there was a significant reduction in SBP, DBP, FMD, TGs, and total cholesterol. These findings suggest that polyphenols both as whole food and purified extracts can be efficacious in reducing cardiometabolic risks. However, these results must be interpreted with caution because of high heterogeneity and risk of bias among RCTs. This study was registered on PROSPERO as CRD42021241807.",

However, mechanistic evidence for how the microbiome influences energy metabolism is derived from animal models. In this narrative review, we included human studies investigating the relationship between gut microbiome and energy metabolism -i.e., energy expenditure in humans and energy harvest by the gut microbiome. Studies have found no consistent gut microbiome patterns associated with energy metabolism, and most interventions were not effective in modulating the gut microbiome to influence energy metabolism. To date, cause-and-effect relationships and mechanistic evidence on the impact of the gut microbiome on energy expenditure have not been established in humans. Future longitudinal observational studies and randomized controlled trials utilizing robust methodologies and advanced statistical analysis are needed. Such knowledge would potentially inform the design of therapeutic avenues and specific dietary recommendations to improve energy metabolism through gut microbiome modulation.",

    "abstract": "Individual amino acids are widely popular as supplements because of various perceived and real health benefits. However, currently, there are no recommendations set by national health agencies for tolerable upper intake levels (UL) for amino acids because of a lack of well-conducted human dose-response trials. In the past decade, under the initiative of the International Council on Amino Acid Science, a nonprofit organization, a series of UL human clinical studies were conducted. The goal of this narrative review is to summarize the studies on 6 essential amino acids (leucine, tryptophan, methionine, lysine, histidine, and phenylalanine), 2 nonessential amino acids (arginine and serine), and 2 nonproteinogenic amino acids (ornithine and citrulline) and provide the first set of ULs. A brief background of the concept of the DRI framework of UL, the concept of UL for amino acids, and a perspective of the results are also provided. The data suggest that in relatively healthy adult individuals, the tested amino acids are well tolerated, and ULs, or the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL), lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL), can be determined. The ULs were for leucine—young (35 g/d), tryptophan (4.5 g/d), and leucine—elderly (30 g/d); NOAEL and LOAEL for methionine at 3.2 and 6.4 g/d, respectively; NOAEL for arginine (30 g/d); NOAEL and LOAEL for lysine at 6 and 7.5 g/d, respectively; NOAEL and LOAEL for histidine at 8 and 12 g/d, respectively; and NOAEL for phenylalanine (12 g/d), serine (12 g/d), ornithine (12 g/d) and citrulline (24 g/d). This first set of human UL data are hoped to help national and international agencies set safety standards for supplemental amino acids.",

Growing evidence suggests that this interaction is mediated by signaling molecules derived from dietary components metabolized by the intestinal microbiota. Although recent studies have provided a substantial understanding of the cell-specific effects of gut microbial molecules in gut microbiome-brain research, further validation is needed. This review presents recent findings on gut microbiota-derived dietary metabolites that enter the systemic circulation and influence the cell-to-cell interactions between gut microbes and cells in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly microglia, astrocytes, and neuronal cells, ultimately affecting cognitive function, mood, and behavior. Specifically, this review highlights the roles of metabolites produced by the gut microbiota via dietary component transformation, including short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bile acid metabolites, in promoting the function and maturation of brain cells and suppressing inflammatory signals in the CNS. We also discuss future directions for gut microbiome-brain research, focusing on diet-induced microbial metabolite-based therapies as possible novel approaches to mental health treatment.",

We also discuss the latest progress in understanding the pathways by which the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites from the host or diet regulate AD. By understanding the effects of dietary components on brain function, microbiota composition, and microbial metabolites, we examine the potential for manipulation of the gut microbiota through dietary intervention to delay the progression of AD.

    "abstract": "The health and environmental advantages of plant-predominant diets will likely lead to increasing numbers of consumers reducing their reliance on animal products. Consequently, health organizations and professionals will need to provide guidance on how best to make this change. In many developed countries, nearly twice as much protein is derived from animal versus plant sources. Potential benefits could result from consuming a higher share of plant protein. Advice to consume equal amounts from each source is more likely to be embraced than advice to eschew all or most animal products. However, much of the plant protein currently consumed comes from refined grains, which is unlikely to provide the benefits associated with plant-predominant diets. In contrast, legumes provide ample amounts of protein as well other components such as fiber, resistant starch, and polyphenolics, which are collectively thought to exert health benefits. But despite their many accolades and endorsement by the nutrition community, legumes make a negligible contribution to global protein intake, especially in developed countries. Furthermore, evidence suggests the consumption of cooked legumes will not substantially increase over the next several decades. We argue here that plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs) made from legumes are a viable alternative, or a complement, to consuming legumes in the traditional manner. These products may be accepted by meat eaters because they can emulate the orosensory properties and functionality of the foods they are intended to replace. PBMAs can be both transition foods and maintenance foods in that they can facilitate the transition to a plant-predominant diet and make it easier to maintain. PBMAs also have a distinct advantage of being able to be fortified with shortfall nutrients in plant-predominant diets. Whether existing PBMAs provide similar health benefits as whole legumes, or can be formulated to do so, remains to be established.",

Especially in childhood, consuming a nutritionally adequate diet is an essential driver of health, growth, and development. Household-level factors can present challenges to support the nutritional needs of low-income and food-insecure household members. The aim of this scoping review is to identify the contributing household factors to dietary quality and food security in US households of school-aged children 5 to 19 years and synthesize the evidence around emergent themes for application to future interventions. The scoping review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols Extension for Scoping Reviews using search terms addressing food insecurity, low income, and dietary behaviors in the database PubMed. Screening by 3 independent reviewers of the title, abstract, and full study phases identified 44 studies. The 5 themes around which the studies grouped were: parental behaviors, child/adolescent behaviors, food procurement behaviors, food preparation behaviors, and household environment factors. Most studies were cross-sectional (n = 41, 93%) and focused on parental behaviors (n = 31, 70%), followed by food preparation and procurement behaviors. The themes identified were interrelated and suggest that incorporating education on parent and child behaviors that influence food procurement and preparation, along with strengthening organization and planning in the household environment, may hold promise to improve dietary quality and food security among food-insecure and low-income households. The findings can be used to inform future nutrition education interventions aimed at improving dietary quality and food security in households with school-aged children.",

We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science to synthesize evidence published between 1980 and 2022 on HM components and anthropometry through 2 y of age among term-born infants. From 9992 abstracts screened, 141 articles were included and categorized based on their reporting of HM micronutrients, macronutrients, or bioactive components. Bioactives including hormones, HM oligosaccharides (HMOs), and immunomodulatory components are reported here, based on 75 articles from 69 unique studies reporting observations from 9980 dyads. Research designs, milk collection strategies, sampling times, geographic and socioeconomic settings, reporting practices, and outcomes varied considerably. Meta-analyses were not possible because data collection times and reporting were inconsistent among the studies included. Few measured infant HM intake, adjusted for confounders, precisely captured breastfeeding exclusivity, or adequately described HM collection protocols. Only 5 studies (6%) had high overall quality scores. Hormones were the most extensively examined bioactive with 46 articles (n = 6773 dyads), compared with 13 (n = 2640 dyads) for HMOs and 12 (n = 1422 dyads) for immunomodulatory components. Two studies conducted untargeted metabolomics. Leptin and adiponectin demonstrated inverse associations with infant growth, although several studies found no associations. No consistent associations were found between individual HMOs and infant growth outcomes. Among immunomodulatory components in HM, IL-6 demonstrated inverse relationships with infant growth. Current research on HM bioactives is largely inconclusive and is insufficient to address the complex composition of HM. Future research should ideally capture HM intake, use biologically relevant anthropometrics, and integrate components across categories, embracing a systems biology approach to better understand how HM components work independently and synergistically to influence infant growth.",

To provide a meta-analytical and comprehensive review on the adverse effects of all kinds of omega-3 PUFAs supplementations reported in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in human subjects. A systematic review RCTs published between 1987 and 2023 was carried out based on the searches in 8 electronic databases. All RCTs that compared the adverse effect of omega-3 PUFAs, containing eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, or both, versus controls (a placebo or a standard treatment). The primary outcome was the events of adverse effects related to omega-3 PUFAs prescription. A total of 90 RCTs showed that the omega-3 PUFAs group, when compared with the placebo, had significantly higher odds of occurrence of diarrhea (Odd ratio (OR)=1.257, p=.010), dysgeusia (OR=3.478, p<.001), and bleeding tendency (OR=1.260, p=.025), but lower rates of back pain (OR =.727, p<.001). The subgroup analysis showed that the prescription omega-3 PUFA products (RxOME3FAs) had a higher omega-3 PUFAs dosage than those using general omega-3 PUFAs (OME3FAs) 3056.38± 1113.28 mg/d versus 2315.92± 1725.61 mg/d) and performed more standard assessments on adverse effects (63% vs 36%). There was no report of definite omega-3 PUFAs-related serious adverse events. The subjects taking omega-3 PUFAs were at higher odds of experiencing adverse effects, while comprehensive assessments of the adverse effects may help to detect minor/subtle adverse effects associated with omega-3 PUFAs. Both RxOME3FAs and OME3FAs would be associated with higher rates of some types of adverse effects. Moreover, although RxOME3FAs may appear to have more adverse effects than OME3FAs, this differences may be due to the higher dosage and the systematic evaluation of adverse effects commonly performed in the trials using RxOME3FAs.

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are associated with increased intestinal permeability, characterized by loss of gut epithelial integrity, resulting in unregulated passage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other inflammatory triggers into circulation, i.e., metabolic endotoxemia. In obesity, shifts in the gut microbiome negatively impact intestinal permeability. Probiotics are an intervention that can target the gut microbiome by introducing beneficial microbial species, potentially restoring gut barrier integrity. Currently, the role of probiotic supplementation in ameliorating obesity- and overweight-associated increases in gut permeability has not been reviewed. This systematic review aimed to summarize findings from both animal and clinical studies that evaluated the effect of probiotic supplementation on obesity-induced impairment in intestinal permeability (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, CRD42022363538). A literature search was conducted using PubMed (Medline), Web of Science, and CAB Direct from origin until August 2023 using keywords of intestinal permeability, overweight or obesity, and probiotic supplementation. Of 920 records, 26 eligible records were included, comprising 12 animal and 14 clinical studies. Clinical trials ranged from 3 to 26 wk and were mostly parallel-arm (n = 13) or crossover (n = 1) design. In both animal and clinical studies, plasma/serum LPS was the most common measure of intestinal permeability. Eleven of 12 animal studies reported a positive effect of probiotic supplementation in reducing intestinal permeability. However, results from clinical trials were inconsistent, with half reporting reductions in serum LPS and half reporting no differences after probiotic supplementation. Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Akkermansia emerged as the most common genera in probiotic formulations among the animal and clinical studies that yielded positive results, suggesting that specific bacteria may be more effective at reducing intestinal permeability and improving gut barrier function. However, better standardization of strain use, dosage, duration, and the delivery matrix is needed to fully understand the probiotic impact on intestinal permeability in individuals with overweight and obesity.",

However, some meta-analyses have found that habitual consumers of ASBs (compared with low or no consumption) had an increased risk on some health outcomes. We performed an umbrella review of meta-analyses to grade the credibility of the evidence of claimed observational associations between ASBs and health outcomes. Data were searched in Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed for systematic reviews published up to 25 May 2022, examining association between ASBs and any health outcomes. Certainty of the evidence for each health outcome was obtained based on statistical results of tests used in umbrella reviews. The AMSTAR-2 tool (16 items) was used to identify high-quality systematic reviews. Answers of each item were rated as yes, no, or partial yes (for a partial adherence to the standard). We included data from 11 meta-analyses with unique population, exposure, comparison group, outcome obtained from 7 systematic reviews (51 cohort studies and 4 case-control studies). ASBs were associated with higher risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, all-cause mortality, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease incidence (supported by highly suggestive evidence). Evidence for other outcomes (colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, cancer mortality, cardiovascular mortality, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, and stroke) was weak. Results of the quality assessment of systematic reviews using AMSTAR-2 showed some notable deficiencies: unclear sources of funding of eligible studies and lack of predefined study protocols to guide authors. The consumption of ASBs was associated with a higher risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, all-cause mortality, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease incidence. However, further cohort studies and clinical trials in humans are still needed to understand the impact of ASBs on health outcomes.",

Optimizing nutrient intake can minimize accrual of DNA damage. To (i) assemble and systematically analyse high-level evidence for the effect of supplementation with micronutrients and phytochemicals on base-line levels of DNA damage in humans and (ii) use this knowledge to identify which of these essential micronutrients or non-essential phytochemicals promote DNA integrity in vivo in humans. We conducted systematic literature searches of the PubMed database to identify interventional, prospective, cross-sectional, or in vitro studies that explored the association between nutrients and established biomarkers of DNA damage associated with developmental and degenerative disease risk. Biomarkers included lymphocyte chromosome aberrations, lymphocyte and buccal cell micronuclei, DNA methylation, lymphocyte/leukocyte DNA strand breaks, DNA oxidation, telomere length, telomerase activity, and mitochondrial DNA mutations. Only randomized, controlled interventions and uncontrolled longitudinal intervention studies conducted in humans were selected for evaluation and data extraction. These studies were ranked for the quality of their study design. In all, 96 of the 124 articles identified reported studies that achieved a quality assessment score ≥ 5 (from a maximum score of 7) and were included in the final review. Based on these studies, nutrients associated with protective effects included vitamin A and its precursor β-carotene, vitamins C, E, B1, B12, folate, minerals selenium and zinc, and phytochemicals such as curcumin (with piperine), lycopene, and proanthocyanidins. These findings highlight the importance of nutrients involved in (i) DNA metabolism and repair (folate, vitamin B12, and zinc), and (ii) prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation (vitamins A, C, E, lycopene, curcumin, proanthocyanidins, selenium and zinc). Supplementation with certain micronutrients and their combinations may reduce DNA damage and promote cellular health by improving maintenance of genome integrity.",

    "abstract": "The term prebiotic has been used for almost 3 decades and has undergone numerous updates over the years. The scientific literature reveals that despite continuous efforts to establish a globally unified definition to guide jurisdictional regulations and product innovations, ambiguity continues to surround the terms prebiotic and prebiotic effect, leading to products that lack in full regulatory adherence being marketed worldwide. Thus, to reflect the current state of scientific research and knowledge and for the continuous advancement of the category, an update to the current prebiotic definition is warranted. This update includes removing the term selectivity, considering additional locations of action besides the gut, highlighting prebiotic performance benefits such as cognitive and athletic, and providing a clear standalone definition for prebiotic effect. The Global Prebiotic Association (GPA) is a leading information and industry hub committed to raising awareness about prebiotics, their emerging and well-established health benefits, and prebiotic product integrity and efficacy. In this position paper, GPA builds on previous prebiotic definitions to propose the following expanded definition for prebiotic: \"a compound or ingredient that is utilized by the microbiota producing a health or performance benefit.\" In addition to prebiotic, GPA also defines prebiotic effect as \"a health or performance benefit that arises from alteration of the composition and/or activity of the microbiota, as a direct or indirect result of the utilization of a specific and well-defined compound or ingredient by microorganisms.\" With these 2 definitions, GPA aims to paint a clearer picture for the term prebiotic, and by incorporating an industry point of view, these updated definitions may be used alongside current scientific and regulatory perspectives to move the category forward.",

Eating disorders (EDs) are psychiatric conditions that may impact the development of PCOS and comorbidities including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this scoping review was to determine the prevalence of EDs and disordered eating, and to review the etiology of EDs in PCOS. The review was conducted using search terms addressing PCOS, EDs, and disordered eating in databases, including PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. Structured interviews, self-administered questionnaires, chart review, or self-reported diagnosis were used to identify EDs in 38 studies included in the review. The prevalence of any ED in those with PCOS ranged from 0% to 62%. Those with PCOS were 3-6-fold more likely to have an ED and higher odds ratios (ORs) of an elevated ED score compared with controls. In those with PCOS, 30% had a higher OR of bulimia nervosa and binge ED was 3-fold higher compared with controls. Studies were limited on anorexia nervosa and other specified feeding or ED (such as night eating syndrome) and these were not reported to be higher in PCOS. To our knowledge, no studies reported on avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, rumination disorder, or pica in PCOS. Studies showed strong associations between overweight, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating in PCOS. The etiologic development of EDs in PCOS remains unclear; however, psychological, metabolic, hypothalamic, and genetic factors are implicated. The prevalence of any ED in PCOS varied because of the use of different diagnostic and screening tools. Screening of all individuals with PCOS for EDs is recommended and high-quality studies on the prevalence, pathogenesis of specific EDs, relationship to comorbidities, and effective interventions to treat ED in those with PCOS are needed.",

    "abstract": "Food and nutrition insecurity disproportionately impact low-income households in the United States, contributing to higher rates of chronic diseases among this population. Addressing this challenge is complex because of various factors affecting the availability and accessibility of nutritious food. Short value chain (SVC) models, informally known as local food systems, offer a systemic approach that aims to optimize resources and align values throughout and beyond the food supply chain. Although specific SVC interventions, such as farmers markets, have been studied individually, a comprehensive review of SVC models was pursued to evaluate their relative impact on food security, fruit and vegetable intake, diet quality, health-related markers, and barriers and facilitators to participation among low-income households. Our systematic literature search identified 37 articles representing 34 studies from 2000–2020. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies revealed that farmers market interventions had been evaluated more extensively than other SVC models (i.e., produce prescription programs, community-supported agriculture, mobile markets, food hubs, farm stands, and farm-to-school). Fruit and vegetable intake was the most measured outcome; other outcomes were less explored or not measured at all. Qualitative insights highlighted common barriers to SVC use, such as lack of program awareness, limited accessibility, and cultural incongruence, whereas facilitators included health-promoting environments, community cohesion, financial incentives, and high-quality produce. Social marketing and dynamic nutrition education appeared to yield positive program outcomes. Financial incentives were used in many studies, warranting further investigation into optimal amounts across varying environmental contexts. SVC models are increasingly germane to national goals across the agriculture, social, and health care sectors. This review advances the understanding of key knowledge gaps related to their implementation and impact; it emphasizes the need for research to analyze SVC potential comprehensively across the rural-urban continuum and among diverse communities through long-term studies of measurable health impact and mixed-method studies investigating implementation best practices.

MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant publications up until May 2023. Studies were eligible if they had a cohort, case-control, or randomized controlled trial (RCT) design and examined dietary intake, supplementation, or circulating levels of these antioxidants as exposure, and insulin resistance, beta cell function, or T2D incidence as outcomes. Summary relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using random-effects models. The certainty of evidence was assessed with GRADE. Among 6,190 screened records, 25 prospective observational studies and 15 RCTs were eligible. Inverse associations were found between dietary and circulating antioxidants and T2D (observational studies). The lowest risk was at intakes up to 70 mg/day of vitamin C (RR: 0.76; CI 0.61, 0.95), 12 mg/day of vitamin E (RR: 0.72; CI 0.61, 0.86), and 4 mg/day of beta-carotene (RR: 0.78; CI 0.65, 0.94). Supplementation with vitamin E (RR: 1.01; CI 0.93, 1.10) or beta-carotene (RR: 0.98; CI 0.90, 1.07) did not have a protective effect on T2D (RCTs), and data on vitamin C supplementation was limited. Regarding insulin resistance, higher dietary vitamin C (RR: 0.85; CI 0.74, 0.98) and vitamin E supplementation (MD: -0.35; CI -0.65, -0.06) were associated with a reduced risk. The certainty of evidence was high for the associations between T2D and dietary vitamin E and beta-carotene, and low to moderate for other associations. In conclusion, moderate intakes of vitamins C, E, and beta-carotene may lower the risk of T2D by reducing insulin resistance. Lack of protection with supplementation in RCTs suggests that adequate rather than high intakes may play a role in T2D prevention. PROSPERO(CRD42022343482)",

    "abstract": "Adequate nutrition is necessary for achieving optimal growth and neurodevelopment. Growth is a natural and expected process that happens concomitantly with rapid advancements in neurodevelopment. Serial weight, length, and head circumference growth measures are essential for monitoring development, although identifying pathological deviations from normal growth can pose challenges. Appropriate growth assessments require considerations that a range of sizes for length, head circumference, and weight are expected and appropriate. Because of genetic differences and morbidities, there is a considerable overlap between the growth of healthy infants and those with growth alterations. Parents tend to be over-concerned about children who plot low on growth charts and often need reassurance. Thus, the use of terms such as \"poor\" growth or growth \"failure\" are discouraged when growth is approximately parallel to growth chart curves even if their size is smaller than specific percentiles. No specific percentile should be set as a growth goal; individual variability should be expected. An infant's size at birth is important information that goes beyond the common use of prognostic predictions of appropriate compared with small or large for gestational age. The lower the birthweight, the lower the nutrient stores and the more important the need for nutrition support. Compared to term infants, preterm infants at term-equivalent age have a higher percentage of body fat, but this diminishes over the next months. Current research findings support expert recommendations that preterm infants should grow, after early postnatal weight loss, similar to the fetus and then term-born infants, which translates to growth approximately parallel to growth chart curves. There is no need for a trade-off between optimum cognition and optimum future health. Each high-risk infant needs individualized nutrition and growth assessments. This review aims to examine infant growth expectations and messaging for parents of preterm and term-born infants within the broader causal framework.",

    "abstract": "Precision nutrition (PN) considers multiple individual-level and environmental characteristics or variables, in order to better inform dietary strategies and interventions for optimizing health, including managing obesity and metabolic disorders. Here, we review the evidence on potential mechanisms – including ones to identify those most likely to respond – that can be leveraged in the development of PN interventions addressing obesity. We conducted a review of the literature and included laboratory, animal, and human studies evaluating biochemical and genetic data, completed and ongoing clinical trials, and public programs in this review. Our analysis describes the potential mechanisms related to six domains including genetic predisposition; circadian rhythms; physical activity and sedentary behavior; metabolomics; the gut microbiome, and behavioral and socioeconomic characteristics; i.e. the factors that can be leveraged to design PN-based interventions to prevent and treat obesity-related outcomes such as weight loss or metabolic health as laid out by the NIH 2030 Strategic Plan for Nutrition Research. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can modify responses to certain dietary interventions, and epigenetic modulation of obesity risk via physical activity patterns and macronutrient intake have also been demonstrated. Additionally, we identified limitations including questions of equitable implementation across a limited number of clinical trials. These include the limited ability of current PN interventions to address systemic influences such as supply chains and food distribution, healthcare systems, racial or cultural inequities, and the economic disparities particularly when designing and implementing PN interventions in low- and middle-income communities. PN has the potential to treat obesity by addressing inter-individual variation, as opposed to a \"one-size fits all\" standardized intervention, though there is limited clinical trial evidence to date. Optimizing dietary strategies and interventions at the individual level through genetic and microbiome assessment, lifestyle pattern analysis, and phenotyping may help advance our ability to modulate and/or manage individualized physiological factors involved in obesity.",

Development of malnutrition screening and diagnostic tools for early detection of malnutrition is necessary to prevent long-term complications to patients' health and well-being.

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) allows for automated tools to detect malnutrition in an earlier stage to prevent long-term consequences. In this study, a systematic literature review was carried out with the goal of providing detailed information on what patient groups, screening tools, machine learning algorithms, data types, and variables are being used, as well as the current limitations and implementation stage of these AI-based tools. The results showed that a staggering majority exceeding 90% of all AI models go unused in day-to-day clinical practice. Furthermore, supervised learning models seemed to be the most popular type of learning. Alongside this, disease-related malnutrition was the most common category of malnutrition found in the analysis of all primary studies.

Multiple antioxidants have been applied in different clinical scenarios, but their effects on fertility in women with ovarian aging are still unclear. To address this, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antioxidants on fertility in women with ovarian aging. A total of 20 randomized clinical trials with 2617 participants were included. The results showed that use of antioxidants not only significantly increased the number of retrieved oocytes and high-quality embryo rates but also reduced the dose of gonadotropin, contributing to higher clinical pregnancy rates. According to the subgroup analysis of different dose settings, better effects were more pronounced with lower doses; in terms of antioxidant types, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) tended to be more effective than melatonin, myo-inositol, and vitamins. When compared with placebo or no treatment, CoQ10 showed more advantages, whereas small improvements were observed with other drugs. In addition, based on subgroup analysis of CoQ10, the optimal treatment regimen of CoQ10 for improving pregnancy rate was 30 mg/d for 3 mo before the controlled ovarian stimulation cycle, and women with diminished ovarian reserve clearly benefited from CoQ10 treatment, especially those aged <35 y. Our study suggests that antioxidant consumption is an effective and safe complementary therapy for women with ovarian aging. Appropriate antioxidant treatment should be offered at a low dose according to the patient's age and ovarian reserve. This study was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42022359529.",

    "abstract": "Vaccines can prevent infectious diseases, but their efficacy varies, and factors impacting vaccine effectiveness remain unclear. Iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency, affecting >2 billion individuals. It is particularly common in areas with high infectious disease burden and in groups that are routinely vaccinated, such as infants, pregnant women, and the elderly. Recent evidence suggests that iron deficiency and low serum iron (hypoferremia) not only cause anemia but also may impair adaptive immunity and vaccine efficacy. A report of human immunodeficiency caused by defective iron transport underscored the necessity of iron for adaptive immune responses and spurred research in this area. Sufficient iron is essential for optimal production of plasmablasts and IgG responses by human B-cells in vitro and in vivo. The increased metabolism of activated lymphocytes depends on the high-iron acquisition, and hypoferremia, especially when occurring during lymphocyte expansion, adversely affects multiple facets of adaptive immunity, and may lead to prolonged inhibition of T-cell memory. In mice, hypoferremia suppresses the adaptive immune response to influenza infection, resulting in more severe pulmonary disease. In African infants, anemia and/or iron deficiency at the time of vaccination predict decreased response to diphtheria, pertussis, and pneumococcal vaccines, and response to measles vaccine may be increased by iron supplementation. In this review, we examine the emerging evidence that iron deficiency may limit adaptive immunity and vaccine responses. We discuss the molecular mechanisms and evidence from animal and human studies, highlight important unknowns, and propose a framework of key research questions to better understand iron-vaccine interactions.",

Other endpoints such as mental, dental, or immune health were not specifically addressed. We concluded that there is sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety for clinicians and consumers to consider using specific probiotics for some indications - such as the use of probiotics to support gut function during antibiotic use or to reduce the risk of respiratory tract infections - for certain people. However, we did not find a sufficiently high level of evidence to support unconditional, population-wide recommendations for other preventive endpoints we reviewed for healthy people.

    "abstract": "Personalized Nutrition (PN) represents an approach aimed at delivering tailored dietary recommendations, products or services to support both prevention and treatment of nutrition-related conditions and improve individual health using genetic, phenotypic, medical, nutritional, and other pertinent information. However, current approaches have yielded limited scientific success in improving diets or in mitigating diet-related conditions. In addition, PN currently caters to a specific subgroup of the population rather than having a widespread impact on diet and health at a population level. Addressing these challenges requires integrating traditional biomedical and dietary assessment methods with psycho-behavioral, and novel digital and diagnostic methods for comprehensive data collection, which holds considerable promise in alleviating present PN shortcomings. This comprehensive approach not only allows for deriving personalized goals (\"what should be achieved\") but also customizing behavioral change processes (\"how to bring about change\"). We herein outline and discuss the concept of \"Adaptive Personalized Nutrition Advice Systems\" (APNASs), which blends data from three assessment domains: 1) biomedical/health phenotyping; 2) stable and dynamic behavioral signatures; and 3) food environment data. Personalized goals and behavior change processes are envisaged to no longer be based solely on static data but will adapt dynamically in-time and in-situ based on individual-specific data. To successfully integrate biomedical, behavioral and environmental data for personalized dietary guidance, advanced digital tools (e.g., sensors) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods will be essential. In conclusion, the integration of both established and novel static and dynamic assessment paradigms holds great potential for transitioning PN from its current focus on elite nutrition to a widely accessible tool that delivers meaningful health benefits to the general population.",

    "abstract": "Food-as-Medicine (FAM) is an emerging trend among medical doctors, health insurers, startups, and governmental public-health and non-governmental organizations. FAM implies using food as a part of an individual's health plan to prevent or help treat acute and chronic health conditions and diseases. We highlight trends and hurdles in the FAM intervention pyramid. Our viewpoint is to indicate how interventions might change the future demand for specific food groups, their transport in supply chains, and the technologies used to process them. Based on national guidelines, dietary interventions can help to prevent and treat many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. FAM R&D and services offer more individualized treatments. This is challenging given the inter-individual variability and complexity of the body's response to food and related factors, such as dietary habits, genetics, lifestyle, and biosphere. Quantifying health improvements is essential to prove the added value of more individualized FAM interventions compared to adopting a general healthy diet. It is unclear which level of individualization of interventions produces the largest health benefits at the lowest costs for the patient, healthcare system, and climate. FAM interventions can support and complement conventional medical treatment. They will require a shift to producing more health-promoting foods, including whole foods, minimally-processed foods, and selected processed foods. The food processing industry and supply chains must adapt to these new scenarios. Auxiliary technologies and methods are enablers, including delivery services, wearable technology, health-monitoring apps, and data-driven consumer behavior analysis.",

Assessing seafood as a food group, rather than a source of nutrients or contaminants, can inform future dietary guidance. To update and assess relationships between seafood consumption during childhood and adolescence and neurocognitive development. Three electronic databases were searched up to Sept 2024 to update a previous search from 2000-2019. Articles were included if associations were assessed between seafood during childhood and adolescence and neurocognitive development outcomes (cognitive development, behavior, movement/physical development, language/communication development, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder). All articles were screened at title, abstract, and full-text levels by two independent analysts. Data were extracted, quality checked by a second analyst, and synthesized narratively by two analysts independently, considering direction, magnitude, and statistical significance of results for each outcome; discrepancies were resolved via discussion. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-E and ROB 2.0. Certainty of evidence was assessed with GRADE. Eighteen articles from 5 short-term (12-16 weeks) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in Northern Europe and 9 prospective cohort studies (PCSs) conducted in various countries were included. The evidence suggested a relationship between higher seafood consumption and improved cognitive development outcomes for children and adolescents aged 0-18 years old (GRADE: low). This conclusion was informed by 5 short-term RCTs in which children aged 10 months to 15 years were provided fatty fish vs meat, poultry, or fish oil supplements. These RCTs were largely supported by results from 5 longer-term PCS. Evidence was inconsistent for behavior outcomes and was lacking for other outcomes.

Identifying social vulnerability factors (i.e., characteristics of a person or group regarding their capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover from the effects of child food insecurity (CFI)) and their positive or negative relationship with CFI is important to support targeted action with a scale and intensity that is proportionate to the level of disadvantage. This review aimed to systematically and comprehensively identify key social vulnerability contributors to CFI in economically developed countries and discuss the factors in the context of the socio-ecological model (SEM). Five research databases were searched for observational studies published from 2000 assessing social vulnerability factors related to FI in children residing in developed countries. Data screening and extraction was independently conducted by two reviewers who recorded factors related to CFI. The QualSyst tool was used to assess risk of bias. From the studies identified (N=5,689), 49 papers, predominantly from the United States (U.S.) and Canada, met the inclusion criteria. The identified social vulnerability factors associated with CFI were grouped into five based on the SEM: i) individual child; ii) parental; iii) household; iv) community; and v) societal factors. The most frequently reported contributors to CFI were income (household factor). Other social vulnerability factors were identified, including child's age, parental depression, household crowdedness, social connection, poverty and residential instability. The lack of consistent measures to define both social vulnerability and CFI in diverse population subgroups impeded meaningful pooling and interpretation of factors interacting with CFI. Recommendations for future studies are to use comparable measures to estimate the extent and severity of CFI and to investigating the relation between social vulnerability, severity, and trajectories of CFI in developed countries. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022291638).",

    "abstract": "Growth monitoring and promotion (GMP), the process of periodic anthropometric measurements to assess the adequacy of individual child growth, is implemented across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The epidemiological foundations of GMP (i.e., that GMP can accurately diagnose or screen for inadequate growth) have never been critically reviewed. We first assessed growth patterns of individual healthy children. Using longitudinal data from low-, middle-, and high-income countries, we evaluated whether commonly used GMP criteria can be used for diagnosis and screening; i.e., if they accurately identify current, or predict subsequent, inadequate growth in individual children. The growth of individual healthy children does not track along a specific growth curve which challenges the notion that growth measurements alone can be used to distinguish between healthy and inadequate growth. We demonstrate that GMP criteria do not provide meaningful diagnostic information and that GMP is not a meaningful screening activity: commonly used GMP criteria are inaccurate predictors of (inadequate) growth later in childhood; and collecting individual children's weight and height does not help to identify who needs support or who will benefit. Our results do not undermine the importance of dedicated programs to diagnose wasting in individual children nor do they challenge the need for well-child care to support parents and to ensure children's optimal nutrition, health, and development. Our findings, however, highlight the need to carefully reconsider the current design of GMP in LMICs.",

    "abstract": "Managing diabetes in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is challenging due to the combined effects of dietary glucose, glucose from dialysate, and other medical complications. Advances in technology that enable continuous biological data collection are transforming traditional management approaches. This review explores how multi-omics technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) are enhancing glucose management in this patient population. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers significant advantages over traditional markers like hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Unlike HbA1c, which reflects an average glucose level, CGM provides real-time, dynamic glucose data that allow clinicians to make timely adjustments, leading to better glycemic control and outcomes. Multi-omics approaches are valuable for understanding genetic factors that influence susceptibility to diabetic complications, particularly those related to advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Identifying genetic polymorphisms that modify a patient's response to AGEs allows for personalized treatments, potentially reducing the severity of diabetes-related pathologies. Metabolomic analyses of peritoneal dialysis effluent are also promising, as they help identify early biomarkers of metabolic dysregulation. Early detection can lead to timely interventions and more tailored treatment strategies, improving long-term patient care. AI integration is revolutionizing diabetes management for PD patients by processing vast datasets from CGM, genetic, metabolic and microbiome profiles. AI can identify patterns and predict outcomes that may be difficult for humans to detect, enabling highly personalized recommendations for diet, medication, and dialysis management. Furthermore, AI can assist clinicians by automating data interpretation, improving treatment plans and enhancing patient education. Despite the promise of these technologies, there are limitations. CGM, multi-omics and AI require significant investment in infrastructure, training and validation studies. Additionally, integrating these approaches into clinical practice presents logistical and financial challenges. Nevertheless, personalized, data-driven strategies offer great potential for improving outcomes in diabetes management for PD patients.",

It is essential to integrate the most reliable evidence regarding intake of different food groups and risk of mortality to optimize dietary guidance. Our aim is to systematically and comprehensively assess the associations between the consumption of various food groups and all-cause mortality. The food groups under consideration include edible grains (refined and whole grains), fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, fish and fish products, eggs, dairy products/milk, meat and meat products (including processed meat, unprocessed red and white meat), sugar-sweetened beverages, and added sugars. We present these associations with high versus low consumption and per serving comparisons. We comprehensively and systematically reviewed a search in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Epistemonikos (PROSPERO: CRD42024498035), identifying 41 meta-analyses involving over a million participants, many of which showed significant heterogeneity. Of the 41 studies, 18 were rated high quality, 8 moderate quality, 5 low quality, and 10 critically low quality according to AMSTAR-2 assessments. Our findings revealed that higher consumption of nuts, whole grains, fruits, vegetables and fish was associated with lower mortality rates, both in high versus low comparisons and per serving analyses. Similarly, we observed favorable outcomes for legumes and white meat in high versus low comparisons. Conversely, high intakes of red and processed meats, as well as sugar-sweetened beverages, were linked to higher all-cause mortality. Dairy products and refined grains did not show clear associations with mortality, while there was a tendency in all-cause mortality for high intakes of added sugars and eggs.",

    "abstract": "Sodium is the major cation of extracellular fluid (ECF) and, due to its osmotic action, is involved in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure (BP). The ingested sodium is almost completely absorbed by the intestine. Circulating sodium is filtered by the glomeruli and its renal tubular handling is responsible for the maintenance of sodium and water balance. Sodium deficiency is rare and occurs just in some medical condition. High dietary sodium intake is associated with ECF volume expansion and is a leading risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular diseases; it also adds to the risk of gastric cancer, nephrolithiasis, reduced bone mineral density and osteoporosis. Salt added while cooking and eating, the amount added during food transformation and that occurring naturally in foods contribute to the dietary sodium intake. Additional small amounts of sodium may be occasionally acquired through oral or parenteral medications. The National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) set an Adequate Intake (AI) of 1.5 g and a Chronic Disease Risk Reduction intake (CDRR) of 2.3 g of sodium per day for the adult population. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) set a Standard Dietary Target (SDT) for sodium of 2 g/day (5 g of salt). Recent studies highlighted the relevance of salt intake reduction for all-cause mortality risk and, in particular, for stroke. Sodium also appears to affect the activity of the immune system by influencing the gut microbiota composition and the macrophage and lymphocyte differentiation.",

We aimed to systematically assess the credibility and certainty of evidence of associations of Hcy and Hcy-lowering therapies with various health outcomes. We retrieved observational meta-analyses examining the associations between Hcy and health outcomes, interventional meta-analyses investigating health outcomes related to Hcy-lowering treatments, and Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies exploring the causal associations of Hcy with health outcomes to perform an umbrella review. A total of 135 observational meta-analyses, 106 MR studies, and 26 interventional meta-analyses were included. Among observational studies, 10 associations of diseases/outcomes were classified as highly suggestive; only one outcome (digestive tract cancer) was supported by convincing evidence (class I; OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.16-1.40; P=6.79×10-7; I2=0, 95% prediction interval excluding null, >1000 cases; P>0.1 for tests of both small-study effects and excess significance bias). In MR studies, 5 outcomes associated with Hcy presented robust evidence (P<0.01, power>80%). Among 25 outcomes explored by both observational meta-analyses and MR studies, 7 had consistent results, indicating that elevated Hcy is causally associated with an increased risk for these outcomes. The 3 types of studies collectively suggested that the association of stroke with Hcy was supported by observational studies, causally by MR studies, and further validated by intervention meta-analyses showing that Hcy-lowering with folic acid significantly reduced risk of stroke. For dementia and colorectal cancer, Hcy was significantly associated in meta-analyses of observational studies and folic acid decreased disease risks in interventional meta-analyses. The current umbrella review indicates that convincing evidence for a definitive role of Hcy exposure solely exists in the context of digestive tract cancer excluding bias; however, Hcy may not be causal for this disease. All the three type of studies collectively support that Hcy is a key causal risk factor, and Hcy-lowering (specifically with folic acid) may serve as an effective intervention for stroke.

However, the lack of standardized isolation and characterization protocols poses significant challenges. This review aims to evaluate and compare various methods for the isolation and characterization of HMEVs, highlighting their effectiveness and potential applications. Preliminary purification steps, including the removal of cells, fat globules, and casein micelles, enhance the purity of isolated HMEVs. We categorized isolation methods into density-based, size-based, and affinity-based techniques. Density-based methods include differential and density gradient ultracentrifugation. Size-based methods encompass polymer precipitation, membrane filtration, electrophoretic filtration, size exclusion chromatography, and microfluidics. Affinity-based methods involve immunoisolation using antibodies specific to HMEV surface proteins. Characterization techniques discussed include flow cytometry, dynamic light scattering (DLS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS), electron microscopy (EM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), confocal microscopy, western blotting (WB), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and lateral flow immunoassay systems (LFIA). Differential ultracentrifugation, considered the \"gold standard,\" provides high purity but is time-consuming. Density gradient ultracentrifugation offers precise separation. Size-based methods like PEG precipitation and membrane filtration are simple and fast. Electrophoretic filtration and microfluidics provide precise control of sample flow. Affinity-based methods are highly specific but costly. Advanced characterization techniques provide comprehensive insights into HMEV properties and functions. Standardizing isolation protocols and employing advanced characterization techniques are essential for advancing HMEV research. Future studies should focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms of HMEVs, exploring the impact of maternal health, and developing targeted delivery technologies. These efforts will enhance the therapeutic potential of HMEVs in neonatal care and contribute to personalized nutritional interventions. This review aims to evaluate and compare various methods for the isolation and characterization of human milk extracellular vesicles (HMEVs), highlighting their effectiveness and potential applications. It also emphasizes the importance of preliminary purification of human milk in order to remove cells, fat globules and casein micelles, the natural components of human milk, that if not removed may be confused with EVs during later analysis.",

To map the existing evidence on diet-related health inequalities in high-income countries through a scoping review of observational studies, identifying populations most affected and key dietary outcomes across social determinants of health. We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase for observational studies published between January 2011 and March 2021. Eligible studies assessed diet-related health outcomes stratified by at least one PROGRESS-Plus determinant. We followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered the review with PROSPERO (CRD42021234567). Data were charted and analyzed thematically according to PROGRESS categories. A total of 163 studies were included. Most studies focused on education, socioeconomic status, and place of residence, while fewer addressed gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability. Common dietary indicators included fruit and vegetable intake, dietary patterns, and food group consumption. Evidence consistently showed that lower education and income levels were associated with poorer dietary outcomes. Notably, certain population groups (e.g., ethnic minorities, rural residents, individuals with low education or income) experienced cumulative disadvantages. The scoping review highlights persistent and intersecting diet-related health inequalities in high-income countries.

    "abstract": "Fat plays multiple roles in determining the desirable physicochemical properties, sensory attributes, nutritional profile, and biologic response of food products. Overconsumption of fats is linked to chronic diseases, such as obesity, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. There is therefore a need to develop reduced-fat products with physicochemical properties and sensory profiles that match those of their full-fat counterparts. In addition, foods may be redesigned to increase the feelings of satiety and satiation, and thereby reduce overall food intake. The successful design of these types of functional foods requires a good understanding of the numerous roles that fat plays in determining food attributes and the development of effective strategies to replace these attributes. This article provides an overview of the current understanding of the influence of fat on the physicochemical and physiologic attributes of emulsion-based food products and highlights approaches to create high-quality foods with reduced-fat contents.",

The collective term \"dietary fiber\" groups structures that have different physiologic effects. Since 1995, some dietary fibers have been denoted as prebiotics, implying a beneficial physiologic effect related to increasing numbers or activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota. Given the complex composition of the microbiota, the demonstration of such beneficial effects is difficult. In contrast, an exploration of the metabolites of dietary fiber formed as a result of its fermentation in the colon offers better perspectives for providing mechanistic links between fiber intake and health benefits. Positive outcomes of such studies hold the promise that claims describing specific health benefits can be granted. This would help bridge the \"fiber gap\"—that is, the considerable difference between recommended and actual fiber intakes by the average consumer.",

    "abstract": "Plasma transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma protein secreted by the liver that circulates bound to retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and its retinol ligand. TTR is the sole plasma protein that reveals from birth to old age evolutionary patterns that are closely superimposable to those of lean body mass (LBM) and thus works as the best surrogate analyte of LBM. Any alteration in energy-to-protein balance impairs the accretion of LBM reserves and causes early depression of TTR production. In acute inflammatory states, cytokines induce urinary leakage of nitrogenous catabolites, deplete LBM stores, and cause an abrupt decrease in TTR and RBP4 concentrations. As a result, thyroxine and retinol ligands are released in free form, creating a second frontline that strengthens that primarily initiated by cytokines. Malnutrition and inflammation thus keep in check TTR and RBP4 secretion by using distinct and unrelated physiologic pathways, but they operate in concert to downregulate LBM stores. The biomarker complex integrates these opposite mechanisms at any time and thereby constitutes an ideally suited tool to determine residual LBM resources still available for metabolic responses, hence predicting outcomes of the most interwoven disease conditions.",

A comprehensive literature search on MEDLINE and ISI Web of Knowledge from 1966 through June 2016 was conducted to examine the relation between yogurt consumption and weight gain, as well as the risk of overweight, obesity, or metabolic syndrome, in prospective cohort studies. Ten articles met all the inclusion criteria and were included in our systematic review. Of the 10 cohort studies, 3 analyzed the relation between yogurt consumption and the risk of overweight or obesity, 8 analyzed changes in waist circumference or weight changes, 3 studied the association with the risk of developing metabolic syndrome, and 1 studied the probability of abdominal obesity reversion. Although an inverse association between yogurt consumption and the risk of developing overweight or obesity was not fully consistent or always statistically significant, all studies but one showed in their point estimates inverse associations between yogurt consumption and changes in waist circumference, changes in weight, risk of overweight or obesity, and risk of metabolic syndrome during follow-up, although not all estimates were statistically significant (2 studies). Prospective cohort studies consistently suggested that yogurt consumption may contribute to a reduction in adiposity indexes and the risk of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, there is a need for more prospective studies and high-quality randomized clinical trials to confirm this apparent inverse association.",

    "abstract": "Total fruit intake in the United States is ~1 cup equivalent per day, or one-half of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendation for adults. Two-thirds of the fruit consumed is whole fruit and one-third is 100% juice. The nutritional value of whole fruit, with the exception of fiber and vitamin C, may be retained with appropriate juice production methods and storage conditions. One-hundred percent fruit juice consumption is associated with a number of health benefits, such as improved cardiovascular health and decreased obesity, although some of these and other potential benefits are controversial. Comprehensive analyses of the evidence by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in 2014, the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee in 2010, and the Australian Dietary Guidelines of 2013 concluded that 100% fruit juice is not related to adiposity in children when consumed in appropriate amounts for age and energy needs. However, some reports suggest the consumption of fruit juice contributes to unhealthful outcomes, particularly among children. A dietary modeling study on the best ways to meet the fruit intake shortfall showed that a combination of whole fruit and 100% juice improved dietary density of potassium and vitamin C without significantly increasing total calories. Notably, 100% juice intake was capped at amounts consistent with the 2001 American Pediatric Association guidance. The preponderance of evidence supports the position that 100% fruit juice delivers essential nutrients and phytonutrients, provides year-round access to a variety of fruits, and is a cost-effective way to help people meet fruit recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Fat is an important macronutrient in the human diet. For patients with intestinal failure who are unable to absorb nutrients via the enteral route, intravenous lipid emulsions play a critical role in providing an energy-dense source of calories and supplying the essential fatty acids that cannot be endogenously synthesized. Over the last 50 y, lipid emulsions have been an important component of parenteral nutrition (PN), and over the last 10–15 y many new lipid emulsions have been manufactured with the goal of improving safety and efficacy profiles and achieving physiologically optimal formulations. The purpose of this review is to provide a background on the components of lipid emulsions, their role in PN, and to discuss the lipid emulsions available for intravenous use. Finally, the role of parenteral fat emulsions in the pathogenesis and management of PN-associated liver disease in PN-dependent pediatric patients is reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Biofortification is the breeding of crops to increase their nutritional value, including increased contents of micronutrients or their precursors. Biofortification aims to increase nutrient levels in crops during plant growth rather than during processing of the crops into foods. Emerging research from 8 human trials conducted in the past decade with staple food crops that have been biofortified by traditional plant breeding methods were presented in this symposium. Specifically, data from 6 efficacy and 2 effectiveness trials were discussed to assess the effects of regular consumption of these enhanced staple crops on improving population vitamin A and iron status and reducing the burden of micronutrient deficiencies in targeted populations living in South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. Biofortified food crops appear to have a positive impact on nutritional and functional health outcomes, as the results from the trials suggest. Additional implementation research will be needed to ensure maximization of the beneficial impact of this intervention and a smooth scaling up to make biofortification a sustainable intervention in public health. The challenge for the global health community remains how to take this efficacious intervention and implement at large scale in the real world.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has increased in parallel with central obesity, and its prevalence is anticipated to increase as the obesity epidemic remains unabated. NAFLD is now the most common cause of chronic liver disease in developed countries and is defined as excessive lipid accumulation in the liver, that is, hepatosteatosis. NAFLD ranges in severity from benign fatty liver to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and NASH is characterized by hepatic injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. NASH can progress to cirrhosis, and cirrhosis is a risk factor for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevention of NASH will lower the risk of cirrhosis and NASH-associated HCC. Our studies have focused on NASH prevention. We developed a model of NASH by using mice with the LDL cholesterol receptor gene ablated fed the Western diet (WD). The WD induces a NASH phenotype in these mice that is similar to that seen in humans and includes robust induction of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. With the use of transcriptomic, lipidomic, and metabolomic approaches, we examined the capacity of 2 dietary ω-3 (n–3) polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5ω-3; EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6ω-3; DHA), to prevent WD-induced NASH. Dietary DHA was superior to EPA at attenuating WD-induced changes in plasma lipids and hepatic injury and at reversing WD effects on hepatic metabolism, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. The outcome of these studies suggests that DHA may be useful in preventing NASH and reducing the risk of HCC.",

    "abstract": "Sports-related concussions or mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) are becoming increasingly recognized as a major public health concern; however, no effective therapy for these injuries is currently available. ω-3 (n–3) fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have important structural and functional roles in the brain, with established clinical benefits for supporting brain development and cognitive function throughout life. Consistent with these critical roles of DHA in the brain, accumulating evidence suggests that DHA may act as a promising recovery aid, or possibly as a prophylactic nutritional measure, for mTBI. Preclinical investigations demonstrate that dietary consumption of DHA provided either before or after mTBI improves functional outcomes, such as spatial learning and memory. Mechanistic investigations suggest that DHA influences multiple aspects of the pathologic molecular signaling cascade that occurs after mTBI. This review examines the evidence of interactions between DHA and concussion and discusses potential mechanisms by which DHA helps the brain to recover from injury. Additional clinical research in humans is needed to confirm the promising results reported in the preclinical literature.",

    "abstract": "Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended by the WHO for the first 6 mo of life because human milk protects against gastrointestinal infections and supplies balanced and adequate nutrient contents to the infant. However, reliable data on micronutrient concentrations in human milk are sparse, especially because some micronutrients are affected by maternal diet. Microbiological and competitive protein-binding assays, nuclear magnetic resonance or inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy, and chromatographic analyses are among the methods that have been applied to human-milk micronutrient analysis. However, the validation or evaluation of analytical methods in terms of their suitability for the complex human-milk matrix has been commonly ignored in reports, even though the human-milk matrix differs vastly from blood, plasma, or urine matrixes. Thus, information on the validity, accuracy, and sensitivity of the methods is essential for the estimation of infant and maternal intake requirements to support and maintain adequate milk micronutrient concentrations for healthy infant growth and development. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on methods used for analyzing water- and fat-soluble vitamins as well as iron, copper, zinc, iodine, and selenium in human milk and their different forms in milk; the tools available for quality control and assurance; and guidance for preanalytical considerations. Finally, we recommend preferred methodologic approaches for analysis of specific milk micronutrients.",

    "abstract": "Milk and dairy products contain multiple nutrients and contribute significantly to meet the nutritional requirements for protein, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, selenium, vitamin A, riboflavin, vitamin B-12, and pantothenic acid. However, consumption of dairy is decreasing and moving away from the advised level in many countries and the potential benefits of milk and dairy products for health have come under question. This, in spite that numerous studies report health benefits associated with dairy consumption. The present supplement aims to assess and summarize scientific evidence regarding the impact of dairy intake on health and all-cause mortality, and on the prevention of diverse chronic diseases, mainly from meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There seem to positive associations between moderate maternal milk intake during pregnancy and infant birth weight, length and bone mineral content during childhood. Moreover, consumption of dairy products in older subjects may reduce the risk of frailty and decrease the risk for sarcopenia. The highest consumption of dairy products did not show a clear association with total osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture risk; however, a diminished risk of vertebral fracture was found. Analysis of the differences between high and low dairy consumption and for dose-response found no association between dairy product consumption and risk of all-cause mortality. Total and low-fat dairy consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing metabolic syndrome and current evidence supports that consumption of dairy does not adversely affect the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and may even have a subtle protective effect. Moreover, evidence has been provided of an inverse association between the consumption of dairy products and ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction. Also, the evidence suggests that dairy consumption, particularly low-fat dairy and yogurt is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Likewise, moderate compared with medium consumption of dairy is associated lower risk for colorectal and bladder cancer and has no association with prostate cancer. Finally, consumption of milk or dairy products did not show a proinflammatory effect on healthy subjects, overweight/obese individuals, or individuals with other metabolic abnormalities, and fortification of dairy products with phytosterols and ω-3 fatty acids seems to be a good approach to improve cardiometabolic risk biomarkers. In conclusion, the systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the present supplement support adequate milk consumption at various stages of life and in the prevention/control of various noncommunicable chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Current dietary recommendations to limit consumption of saturated fat are largely based on early nutrition studies demonstrating a direct link between dietary saturated fat, elevated blood cholesterol levels, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. As full-fat dairy products are rich in saturated fat, these dietary guidelines recommend consumption of fat-free or low-fat dairy products in place of full-fat dairy. However, dairy products vary greatly in both their nutrient content and their bioactive ingredients, and research increasingly highlights the importance of focusing on whole foods (i.e., the food matrix) as opposed to single nutrients, such as saturated fat. In fact, the weight of evidence from recent large and well-controlled studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses of both observational studies and randomized controlled trials indicates that full-fat dairy products, particularly yogurt and cheese, do not exert the detrimental effects on insulin sensitivity, blood lipid profile, and blood pressure as previously predicted on the basis of their sodium and saturated fat contents; they do not increase cardiometabolic disease risk and may in fact protect against cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Although more research is warranted to adjust for possible confounding factors and to better understand the mechanisms of action of dairy products on health outcomes, it becomes increasingly clear that the recommendation to restrict dietary saturated fat to reduce risk of cardiometabolic disease is getting outdated. Therefore, the suggestion to restrict or eliminate full-fat dairy from the diet may not be the optimal strategy for reducing cardiometabolic disease risk and should be re-evaluated in light of recent evidence.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in both men and women in the United States. Various a priori dietary patterns that take into account diet complexity have been associated with CRC risk. This systematic review augments the evidence for an association between CRC risk and the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and provides new evidence for a novel Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII). Human studies published in English after 31 December 2008 were reviewed. Five case-control studies and 7 prospective cohort studies conducted in the United States and Europe were identified. Five of the studies examined the MDS, 4 examined the HEI, and 4 examined the DII. Comparing highest to lowest score groups, higher MDSs were associated with an 8–54% lower CRC risk, and higher HEI scores were associated with a 20–56% lower CRC risk. More proinflammatory diet scores were associated with a 12–65% higher CRC risk compared with more anti-inflammatory diets in studies that used the DII. The results reported by sex suggested similar associations for men and women. This review builds upon the evidence supporting the association between higher overall diet quality and lower risk of CRC. Increasing scores of MDS and HEI and anti-inflammatory DII scores are characterized by high intake of plant-based foods and low intake of animal products. Future studies in more diverse populations and with consistent scoring calculations are recommended.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans has consistently recommended that consumers decrease consumption of saturated fatty acids due to the correlation of saturated fatty acid intake with coronary artery disease. This recommendation has not been easy to achieve because saturated fatty acids play an important role in the quality, shelf life, and acceptability of foods. This is because solid fats are critical to producing desirable textures (e.g., creaminess, lubrication, and melt-away properties) and are important in the structure of foods such as frozen desserts, baked goods, and confectionary products. In addition, replacement of saturated fats with unsaturated fats is limited by their susceptibility to oxidative rancidity, which decreases product shelf life, causes destruction of vitamins, and forms potentially toxic compounds. This article will discuss the fundamental chemical and physical properties in fats and how these properties affect food texture, structure, flavor, and susceptibility to degradation. The current sources of solid fats will be reviewed and potential replacements for solid fats will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to describe the role of macronutrient composition on the suppression of short-term food intake (FI) and weight loss. The effects of macronutrient composition on short-term FI will be reviewed first, followed by a brief examination of longer-term clinical trials that vary in effects of dietary macronutrient composition on weight loss. The objectives were: 1) to examine the effect of macronutrient composition on the suppression of short-term FI, 2) to determine whether some macronutrient sources suppress FI beyond their provision of energy, 3) to assess the combined effects of macronutrients on FI and glycemic response, and 4) to determine whether knowledge of the effect of macronutrients on short-term FI has led to greater success in spontaneous weight loss, adherence to energy-restricted diets, and better weight maintenance after weight loss. Although knowledge of macronutrient composition on short-term FI regulation has advanced our understanding of the role of diet composition on energy balance, it has yet to lead to greater success in long-term weight loss and weight maintenance. It is clear from this review that many approaches based on manipulating dietary macronutrient composition can help people lose weight as long as they follow the diets. However, only by evaluating the interaction between the physiologic systems that govern FI and body weight may the benefits of dietary macronutrient composition be fully realized.",

    "abstract": "Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that probiotics reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC ≥ Stage II), late onset sepsis (LOS), all-cause mortality, and feeding intolerance in preterm neonates. Data from observational studies is important to confirm probiotic effects in clinical practice. We aimed to compare outcomes before and after implementing routine probiotic supplementation (RPS) in preterm neonates (<37 weeks of gestation) by performing a systematic review of non-RCTs using Cochrane methodology. Databases including PubMed, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Cochrane Central library, and Google Scholar were searched in May 2020. A meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model. Categorical measure of effect size was expressed as OR and 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by the chi-squared test, I2 statistic. The level of evidence (LOE) was summarized using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) guidelines. Primary outcomes were NEC ≥ Stage II, LOS, and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included probiotic sepsis. Thirty good-quality non-RCTs (n = 77,018) from 18 countries were included. The meta-analysis showed RPS was associated with significantly reduced: 1) NEC ≥ Stage II (30 studies, n = 77,018; OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.73; P <0.00001, I2: 65%; LOE: Moderate), 2) LOS: (21 studies, n = 65,858; OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.97; P = 0.02, I2: 74%; LOE: Low), and 3) all-cause mortality (27 non-RCTs, n = 70,977; OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.88; P = 0.0001, I2: 49%; LOE: Low). Subgroups: 1) extremely low birth weight (ELBW: birth weight <1000 g) neonates: RPS was associated with significantly reduced NEC ≥ Stage II (4.5% compared with 7.9%). However, there was no difference in LOS and mortality. 2) Multistrain RPS was more effective than single strain. One study reported 3 nonfatal cases of probiotic sepsis. In summary, moderate- to low-quality evidence indicates that RPS was associated with significantly reduced NEC ≥ Stage II, LOS, and all-cause mortality in neonates <37 weeks of gestation and NEC ≥ Stage II in ELBW neonates.",

    "abstract": "Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-saving nutritional support for a large population of hospitalized infants, and lipids make a substantial contribution to their energy and essential fatty acid (FA) needs. A challenge in the care of these infants is that their metabolic needs require prolonged PN support that increases the risk of PN-associated liver disease (PNALD). In recent years, the emergence of new parenteral lipid emulsions containing different source lipids and FA profiles has created nutritional alternatives to the first-generation, soybean oil–based lipid emulsion Intralipid. The limited U.S. introduction of the new-generation fish-oil emulsion Omegaven has generated promising results in infants with PNALD and spawned a renewed interest in how PN and lipid emulsions, in particular, contribute to this disease. Studies suggest that the lipid load and constituents, such as specific FAs, ratio of n–3 (ω-3) to n–6 (ω-6) long-chain polyunsaturated FAs, phytosterols, and vitamin E content, may be involved. There is an existing literature describing the molecular mechanisms whereby these specific nutrients affect hepatic metabolism and function via lipid and bile acid sensing nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α, liver X receptor, and farnesoid X receptor, yet virtually no information as to how they interact and modulate liver function in the context of PN in pediatric patients or animal models. This article will review the recent development of parenteral lipid emulsions and their influence on PNALD and highlight some of the emerging molecular mechanisms that may explain the effects on liver function and disease.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in cranberry research have expanded the evidence for the role of this Vaccinium berry fruit in modulating gut microbiota function and cardiometabolic risk factors. The A-type structure of cranberry proanthocyanidins seems to be responsible for much of this fruit's efficacy as a natural antimicrobial. Cranberry proanthocyanidins interfere with colonization of the gut by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli in vitro and attenuate gut barrier dysfunction caused by dietary insults in vivo. Furthermore, new studies indicate synergy between these proanthocyanidins, other cranberry components such as isoprenoids and xyloglucans, and gut microbiota. Together, cranberry constituents and their bioactive catabolites have been found to contribute to mechanisms affecting bacterial adhesion, coaggregation, and biofilm formation that may underlie potential clinical benefits on gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections, as well as on systemic anti-inflammatory actions mediated via the gut microbiome. A limited but growing body of evidence from randomized clinical trials reveals favorable effects of cranberry consumption on measures of cardiometabolic health, including serum lipid profiles, blood pressure, endothelial function, glucoregulation, and a variety of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. These results warrant further research, particularly studies dedicated to the elucidation of dose-response relations, pharmacokinetic/metabolomics profiles, and relevant biomarkers of action with the use of fully characterized cranberry products. Freeze-dried whole cranberry powder and a matched placebo were recently made available to investigators to facilitate such work, including interlaboratory comparability.",

    "abstract": "Recent dietary guidance for heart health recommends a reduction (by ∼50%) in saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake to reduce LDL cholesterol and to decrease risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends substituting unsaturated fat [both polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs and MUFAs, respectively)] for SFAs. There are many dietary options that can be implemented to replace SFAs, given the different sources of unsaturated fats in the food supply. Compelling evidence exists for the cardioprotective benefits of n–3 (ω-3) PUFAs, both marine- and plant-derived. In addition, the evidence of cardioprotective benefits of n–6 (ω-6) PUFAs is strong, whereas that for MUFAs is mixed, although there is emerging evidence of benefits. Quantitatively, lowering SFAs by 50% will require, in part, substituting food sources of n–6 and n–3 PUFAs and MUFAs for food sources of SFAs. The use of n–3 PUFAs as a replacement for SFAs will result in a shortfall in reaching the SFA goal because of the relatively low amounts that can be incorporated in the diet, even with very high n–3 PUFA substitution. SFAs also can be replaced with dietary carbohydrate and/or protein. Replacing SFAs with carbohydrate, specifically refined sources, however, has little impact on reducing CVD risk. There is evidence about the health benefits of dietary protein on CVD risk, which merits study. Dietary guidelines have advanced considerably with the \"replacement of SFA with unsaturated fat message\" instead of recommending decreasing SFAs alone.

    "abstract": "Despite the critical role of vitamin B-12 in infant development, existing recommendations for infant and maternal intake during lactation are based on milk vitamin B-12 concentrations analyzed with outdated methods in a sample of 9 Brazilian women. Accurate quantification of vitamin B-12 in the milk matrix requires effective hydrolysis of the vitamin from haptocorrin, its binding protein. The objective of the present systematic review is to consider and critique evidence of associations between milk vitamin B-12 concentration and time postpartum, maternal vitamin B-12 consumption, maternal vitamin B-12 status, and sample collection methodology. A systematic search of published literature was undertaken using the US National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE/PubMed bibliographic search engine. Observational and intervention studies were included if research was original and vitamin B-12 concentration in human milk was measured using an appropriate method during the first 12 mo of lactation. Eleven studies met inclusion criteria. Vitamin B-12 concentration was highest in colostrum and decreased in a poorly delineated trajectory over the first 3–4 mo of lactation. There was some evidence of a positive association between habitual maternal vitamin B-12 intake and milk vitamin B-12 concentration in marginally nourished women. Supplementation with 50–250 µg vitamin B-12/d during pregnancy and lactation raised human milk vitamin B-12 concentrations while intervention was ongoing, whereas supplementation with 2.6–8.6 µg/d was effective in a population with poor baseline vitamin B-12 status but not in other populations. Whether milk vitamin B-12 concentration varies with maternal circulating vitamin B-12 concentrations or sampling methodology requires further research as existing data are conflicting. Additional research is needed to bridge knowledge gaps in the understanding of human milk vitamin B-12 concentrations. Reference values for vitamin B-12 in human milk and recommended intakes during infancy and lactation should be reevaluated using modern methods of analysis.",

    "abstract": "Research-based dietary guidelines suggest that consumers \"make half their grains whole.\" Yet some advocate ingesting only whole-grain foods (WGFs) and avoiding all refined-grain foods (RGFs). Some even recommend avoiding all grain-based foods (GBFs). This article will provide arguments to counter negative deductions about GBFs and RGFs, especially staple ones, and to support dietary guidance recommending a balance of GBFs-achieved through the right mix, type, and quantity of WGFs and RGFs. Studies looking at early mortality, body weight, and glucose tolerance and diabetes will be used as examples to characterize the literature about GBFs. The following issues are highlighted: 1) inconsistent findings between epidemiological and interventional studies and impacts of GBFs on health outcomes, and the underreporting of findings showing RGFs neither raise nor lower health risks; 2) multiple confounding and potential interactions make adequate statistical adjustment difficult; 3) nonuniform WGF definitions among studies make comparison of results challenging, especially because some WGFs may contain 49-74% refined grain (RG); 4) binary categorization of GBFs creates bias because nearly all categories of WGFs are recommended, but nearly half the RGF categories are not; 5) ingestion of >5 (30-g) servings RGFs/d and <1 serving WFGs/d creates dietary imbalance; 6) pattern names (e.g., \"white bread\") may impugn RGFs, when names such as \"unbalanced\" or \"few fruits and vegetables\" may more fairly characterize the dietary imbalance; 7) avoidance of all enriched RGs may not only impair status of folate and other B vitamins and certain minerals such as iron and zinc but also decrease acceptability of WGFs; 8) extrapolation beyond median documented intakes in high-WGF consumers (∼48 g whole grain/d) in most cohorts is speculative; 9) recommended dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet demonstrate that the right mix of WGFs and RGFs contributes to positive health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Recently, low-residue diets were removed from the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Nutrition Care Manual due to the lack of a scientifically accepted quantitative definition and the unavailability of a method to estimate the amount of food residue produced. This narrative review focuses on defining the similarities and/or discrepancies between low-residue and low-fiber diets and on the diagnostic and therapeutic values of these diets in gastrointestinal disease management. Diagnostically, a low-fiber/low-residue diet is used in bowel preparation. A bowel preparation is a cleansing of the intestines of fecal matter and secretions conducted before a diagnostic procedure. Therapeutically, a low-fiber/low-residue diet is part of the treatment of acute relapses in different bowel diseases. The available evidence on low-residue and low-fiber diets is summarized. The main findings showed that within human disease research, the terms \"low residue\" and \"low fiber\" are used interchangeably, and information related to the quantity of residue in the diet usually refers to the amount of fiber. Low-fiber/low-residue diets are further explored in both diagnostic and therapeutic situations. On the basis of this literature review, the authors suggest redefining a low-residue diet as a low-fiber diet and to quantitatively define a low-fiber diet as a diet with a maximum of 10 g fiber/d. A low-fiber diet instead of a low-residue diet is recommended as a diagnostic value or as specific therapy for gastrointestinal conditions.",

    "abstract": "A large body of evidence supports the notion that incorrect or insufficient nutrition contributes to disease development. A pivotal goal is thus to understand what exactly is appropriate and what is inappropriate in food ingestion and the consequent nutritional status and health. The effective application of these concepts requires the translation of scientific information into practical approaches that have a tangible and measurable impact at both individual and population levels. The agenda for the future is expected to support available methodology in nutrition research to personalize guideline recommendations, properly grading the quality of the available evidence, promoting adherence to the well-established evidence hierarchy in nutrition, and enhancing strategies for appropriate vetting and transparent reporting that will solidify the recommendations for health promotion. The final goal is to build a constructive coalition among scientists, policy makers, and communication professionals for sustainable health and nutritional policies. Currently, a strong rationale and available data support a personalized dietary approach according to personal variables, including sex and age, circulating metabolic biomarkers, food quality and intake frequency, lifestyle variables such as physical activity, and environmental variables including one's microbiome profile. There is a strong and urgent need to develop a successful commitment among all the stakeholders to define novel and sustainable approaches toward the management of the health value of nutrition at individual and population levels. Moving forward requires adherence to well-established principles of evidence evaluation as well as identification of effective tools to obtain better quality evidence. Much remains to be done in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Diet is an important, modifiable lifestyle factor of cardiometabolic disease risk, and an improved diet can delay or even prevent the onset of disease. Recent evidence suggests that individuals could benefit from diets adapted to their genotype and phenotype: that is, personalized nutrition. A novel strategy is to tailor diets for groups of individuals according to their metabolic phenotypes (metabotypes). Randomized controlled trials evaluating metabotype-specific responses and nonresponses are urgently needed to bridge the current gap of knowledge with regard to the efficacy of personalized strategies in nutrition. In this Perspective, we discuss the concept of metabotyping, review the current literature on metabotyping in the context of cardiometabolic disease prevention, and suggest potential strategies for metabotype-based nutritional advice for future work. We also discuss potential determinants of metabotypes, including gut microbiota, and highlight the use of metabolomics to define effective markers for cardiometabolic disease-related metabotypes. Moreover, we hypothesize that people at high risk for cardiometabolic diseases have distinct metabotypes and that individuals grouped into specific metabotypes may respond differently to the same diet, which is being tested in a project of the Joint Programming Initiative: A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional research and policies have been criticized for relying on observational evidence, using self-report diet assessment methods, and supposedly being unable to present a consensus on what constitutes a healthy diet. In particular, it is often asserted that for progress to occur in nutrition science, large, simple trials, which have worked well in evaluating the efficacy of drugs, need to replace most observational research and small trials in nutrition. However, this idea is infeasible, and is unlikely to advance nutritional sciences or improve policies. This article addresses some commonly held and unfounded \"myths\" surrounding dietary assessments, effect sizes, and confounding, demonstrating how carefully conducted observational studies can provide reliable and reproducible evidence on diet and health. Also, there is a strong consensus among nutritional researchers and practitioners about the basic elements of a healthy diet. To move forward, we should continue to improve study design and diet assessment methodologies, reduce measurement errors, and leverage new technologies. Advances in the field lie in coalescing evidence from multiple study designs, methodologies, and technologies, and translating what we already know into policy and practice, so we can improve diet quality and enhance health in an equitable and sustainable manner across the world.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has increased rapidly. Adopting a heathy diet is suggested as one of the effective behaviors to prevent or delay onset of T2D. Dairy consumption has been recommended as part of a healthy diet, but there remains uncertainty in both the scientific community and the public about the effect of different dairy products on T2D risk. In a recent workshop, the evidence on dairy products and T2D risk was presented and discussed by a group of experts. The main conclusions from the workshop are presented in this position paper and are as follows. 1) Available evidence from large prospective cohort studies and limited randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that total dairy consumption has a neutral or moderately beneficial effect on T2D risk. 2) Increasing evidence from prospective cohort studies indicates that yogurt is most strongly associated with a lower T2D risk, but evidence from RCTs is scarce. 3) Fatty acids from dairy (medium-chain, odd, and very long-chain SFAs as well as trans-palmitoleic acid) are associated with lower T2D risk and improved metabolic health, but more research is needed on studies that explore cause and effect relations to exclude the possibility that the dairy fatty acids simply serve as markers of overall dairy consumption. 4) The food matrix can be a stronger determinant of health effects than SFA content. This review further identifies research gaps in the existing knowledge and highlights key research questions that need to be addressed to better understand the impact of dairy consumption on future T2D risk.",

    "abstract": "Because infants are born with small amounts of stored intrathyroidal iodine, they depend on human-milk iodine for normal physical and neurologic growth and development. The mammary gland concentrates iodide; however, there is a lack of consensus on the concentrations of breast-milk iodine necessary to achieve equilibrium in the infant. The objectives of the present review are to consider trends in breast-milk iodine concentrations over the course of lactation, to determine which maternal factors or interventions influence breast-milk iodine concentrations, to examine the association between breast-milk iodine concentrations and infant iodine status, and to identify how newer data contribute to the literature and inform recommendations for achieving optimal breast-milk iodine concentrations. A systematic search of the published literature was undertaken by using the US National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE/PubMed bibliographic search engine. Observational and intervention studies were included if the research was original, the study had not been included in a previous review, and iodine concentration in human milk was measured at ≥1 time point during the first 12 mo of lactation. Results of the systematic review indicate that breast-milk iodine concentrations vary widely between populations but are highest in colostrum and decrease gradually throughout the lactation period. Included studies did not replicate earlier findings of an inverse correlation between breast-milk iodine and perchlorate concentrations. Supplementation with high-dose or daily iodine during lactation was effective in increasing breast-milk iodine concentrations with some evidence of a dose-response relationship, which is consistent with findings of earlier supplementation trials in pregnancy and lactation. Although additional and globally representative research is needed, data suggest that breast-milk iodine concentrations in the range of 150 μg/L during the first 6 mo of lactation would achieve or exceed infant iodine equilibrium and prevent the developmental consequences of iodine deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Recovery from nutritionally induced height deficits continues to garner attention. The current literature on catch-up growth, however, has 2 important limitations: wide-ranging definitions of catch-up growth are used, and it remains unclear whether children can recover from the broader consequences of undernutrition. We addressed these shortcomings by reviewing the literature on the criteria for catch-up in linear growth and on the potential to recover from undernutrition early in life in 3 domains: linear growth, developmental epigenetics, and child brain and neurocognitive development. Four criteria must be met to demonstrate catch-up growth in height: after a period in which a growth-inhibiting condition (criterion 1) causes a reduction in linear growth velocity (criterion 2), alleviation of the inhibiting condition (criterion 3) leads to higher-than-normal velocity (criterion 4). Accordingly, studies that are observational, do not use absolute height, or have no alleviation of an inhibiting condition cannot be used to establish catch-up growth. Adoption and foster care, which provide dramatic improvements in children's living conditions not typically attained in nutrition interventions, led to some (but incomplete) recovery in linear growth and brain and neurocognitive development. Maternal nutrition around the time of conception was shown to have long-term (potentially permanent) effects on DNA methylation in the offspring. Undernourishment early in life may thus have profound irreversible effects. Scientific, program, and policy efforts should focus on preventing maternal and child undernutrition rather than on correcting its consequences or attempting to prove they can be corrected.",

    "abstract": "Low magnesium intakes coupled with high calcium intakes and high calcium-to-magnesium (Ca:Mg) intake ratios have been associated with increased risk for multiple chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, as well as some cancers (colorectal, prostate, esophageal), and total mortality. A high dietary Ca:Mg ratio (>2.60) may affect body magnesium status while, on the other hand, high intakes of magnesium could adversely impact individuals with an exceedingly low dietary Ca:Mg ratio (<1.70). Thus, a Ca:Mg ratio range of 1.70-2.60 (weight to weight) has been proposed as an optimum range. Data from NHANES surveys have shown the mean Ca:Mg intake ratio from foods alone for US adults has been >3.00 since 2000. One-third of Americans consume a magnesium supplement with a mean dose of 146 mg/d, and 35% of Americans consume a calcium supplement with a mean dose of 479 mg/d. Our review of Ca:Mg ratios in dietary supplements sold in the United States and listed in NIH's Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) found a mean ratio of 2.90 across all calcium- and magnesium-containing products, with differences by product form. The ratios ranged from a low of 0.10 in liquid products to a high of 48.5 in powder products. Thirty-one percent of products fell below, 40.5% fell within, and 28.3% fell above the ratio range of 1.70-2.60. Our findings of calculated Ca:Mg ratios from dietary supplements coupled with food-intake data suggest that, in individuals with high calcium intakes from diet and/or supplements, magnesium supplementation may be warranted to establish a more favorable dietary Ca:Mg ratio in their total diet. Additional research may provide greater insight into whether the Ca:Mg ratio is a biomarker of interest for moderating chronic disease and which population groups may derive benefit from moderating that ratio.",

    "abstract": "Although levodopa remains the most effective drug for symptomatic management of Parkinson's Disease (PD), treatment during advanced disease stages may raise unpredictable motor fluctuations and other complications. Counteracting these complications with other pharmacological therapies may prompt a vicious circle of side effects, and here, nutritional therapy may have great potential. Knowledge about the role of diet in PD is emerging and multiple studies have investigated nutritional support specifically with respect to levodopa therapy. With this systematic review, we aim to give a comprehensive overview of dietary approaches to optimize levodopa treatment in PD. A systematic search was performed using the databases of PubMed and Scopus between January 1985 and September 2020. Nutritional interventions with the rationale to optimize levodopa therapy in human PD patients were eligible for this study and their quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. In total, we included 22 papers that addressed the effects of dietary proteins (n = 10), vitamins (n = 7), fiber (n = 2), soybeans (n = 1), caffeine (n = 1), and ketogenic diets (n = 1) on levodopa therapy. Interventions with protein redistribution diets (PRDs), dietary fiber, vitamin C, and caffeine improved levodopa absorption, thereby enhancing clinical response and reducing motor fluctuations. Furthermore, supplementation of vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and folic acid successfully reduced high homocysteine concentrations that emerged from levodopa metabolism and promoted many metabolic and clinical complications, such as neuropathology and osteoporosis. In conclusion, dietary interventions have the potential to optimize levodopa efficacy and control side effects. Nutrition that improves levodopa absorption, including PRDs, fiber, vitamin C, and caffeine, is specifically recommended when fluctuating clinical responses appear. Supplements of vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and folic acid are advised along with levodopa initiation to attenuate hyperhomocysteinemia, and importantly, their potential to treat consequent metabolic and clinical complications warrants future research.",

    "abstract": "The DRIs define a range of acceptable dietary intakes for each nutrient. The range is defined from the minimum intake to avoid risk of inadequacy (i.e., the RDA) up to an upper limit (UL) based on a detectable risk of adverse effects. For most nutrients, the minimum RDA is based on alleviating a clear deficiency condition, whereas higher intakes are often recommended to optimize specific health outcomes. Evidence is accumulating that similar logic should be applied to dietary recommendations for protein. Although the RDA for protein of 0.8 g/kg body weight is adequate to avoid obvious inadequacies, multiple studies provide evidence that many adults may benefit from protein quantity, quality, and distribution beyond guidelines currently defined by the RDA. Further, the dietary requirement for protein is a surrogate for the constituent amino acids and, in particular, the 9 considered to be indispensable. Leucine provides an important example of an essential amino acid where the RDA of 42 mg/kg body weight is significantly less than the 100-110 mg/kg required to optimize metabolic regulation and skeletal muscle protein synthesis. This review will highlight the benefits of higher protein diets to optimize health during aging, inactivity, bed rest, or metabolic dysfunction such as type 2 diabetes.",

Two reviewers screened results to identify studies that evaluated supplements or dietary sources of lutein/zeaxanthin on MPOD among adults with healthy eyes. One reviewer extracted data and assessed strength of evidence, which was confirmed by a second reviewer. Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias. Meta-analyses were stratified by total lutein/zeaxanthin dose. We included 46 studies (N = 3189 participants; mean age = 43 y; 42% male). There was no statistically significant change in MPOD among studies evaluating <5 mg/d of total lutein/zeaxanthin intake which primarily assessed dietary interventions for 3-6 mo (pooled mean difference, 0.02; 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.05). The pooled mean increase in MPOD was 0.04 units (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.07) among studies evaluating 5 to <20 mg/d of lutein/zeaxanthin and was 0.11 units (95% CI: 0.06 to 0.16) among studies evaluating ≥20 mg/d of lutein/zeaxanthin for 3-12 mo. MPOD increased with lutein/zeaxanthin intake, particularly at higher doses, among adults with healthy eyes. The effects of lutein/zeaxanthin intake at doses <5 mg/d or from dietary sources is less clear. Increased lutein/zeaxanthin intake can help with maintaining ocular health. Future research is needed to determine the minimum dose and duration of lutein/zeaxanthin intake that is associated with a clinically important change in MPOD or visual function.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient profiling (NP) models aim to assess the nutritional quality of individual foods, according to their energy content and nutrient composition. NP models, initially created to prevent obesity in high-income countries, have tended to penalize dietary energy by giving lower ratings to foods containing excessive calories, fat, sugar, and salt. Energy-driven NP models may need to be reconceptualized for use in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where hunger, undernutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies continue to be issues of public health concern. Consistent with the position of the WHO that the purpose of NP methods is to address an identified public health problem, NP models intended for use in LMIC ought to address inadequate intakes of vitamin A, B vitamins, folate, calcium, iron, iodine, and zinc and the frequent lack of high-quality protein. Those models of nutrient density that feature beneficial nutrients (high-quality protein, vitamins, minerals, and trace elements) may be better suited to LMIC needs than are some current NP models that are wholly based around nutrients to limit. NP models intended for LMIC and global use will also need to take food fortification into account. The challenge for LMIC public health agencies is how to balance the future risk of excess \"empty\" calories against the continuing danger of inadequate nutrients and micronutrient deficiencies that persist at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Systemic chronic inflammation may be a contributing factor to many noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. With the rapid rise of these conditions, identifying the causes of and treatment for chronic inflammation is an important research priority, especially with regard to modifiable lifestyle factors such as diet. An emerging body of evidence indicates that consuming certain foods, including dairy foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt, may be linked to a decreased risk for inflammation. To discuss both broader research on diet and inflammation as well as research on links between individual foods and inflammation, the National Dairy Council sponsored a satellite session entitled \"Exploring the Links between Diet and Inflammation: Dairy Foods as Case Studies\" at the American Society for Nutrition's 2020 LIVE ONLINE Conference. This article, a review based on the topics discussed during that session, explores the links between diet and inflammation, focusing most closely on the relations between intake of dairy fat and dairy foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt, and biomarkers of inflammation from clinical trials. While there is currently insufficient evidence to prove an \"anti-inflammatory\" effect of dairy foods, the substantial body of clinical research discussed in this review indicates that dairy foods do not increase concentrations of biomarkers of chronic systemic inflammation.",

This review examines the benefits and limitations of different types of plant-based diets in terms of health and nutrition, affordability and accessibility, cultural (ethical and religious) acceptability, and the environment (i.e., the 4 pillars underlying sustainable healthy diets). Results suggest that, without professional supervision, traditional plant-based diets (vegan, vegetarian, and pescatarian diets) can increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies among infants, children/adolescents, women, pregnant/lactating women, and the elderly. In contrast, flexitarian diets and territorial diversified diets (TDDs; e.g., Mediterranean and New Nordic diets) that include large quantities of plant-sourced foods, low amounts of red meat, and moderate amounts of poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy can meet the energy and nutrition needs of different populations without the need for dietary education or supplementation. Compared with vegan, vegetarian, and pescatarian diets, more diverse flexitarian diets and TDDs are associated with reduced volumes of food waste and may be more acceptable and easier to maintain for people who previously followed Western diets. Although flexitarian diets and TDDs have a greater impact on the environment than vegan, vegetarian, and pescatarian diets, the negative effects are considerably reduced compared with Western diets, especially if diets include locally sourced seasonal foods. Further studies are required to define more precisely optimal sustainable healthy diets for different populations and to ensure that diets are affordable and accessible to people in all countries.",

In 2017, American people consumed 9.2 kg of tomatoes from a fresh market and 33.2 kg of processed tomato products per capita. One commonly asked question by consumers and the nutrition community is \"Are processed tomato products as nutritious as fresh tomatoes?\" This review addresses this question by summarizing the current understandings on the effects of industrial processing on the nutrients and bioactive compounds of tomatoes. Twelve original research papers were found to study the effects of different industrial processing methods on the nutrients and/or bioactive compounds in tomato products. The data suggested that different processing methods had different effects on different compounds in tomatoes. However, currently available data are still limited, and the existing data are often inconsistent. The USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Legacy was utilized to estimate nutrient contents from raw tomatoes and processed tomato products. In addition, several other important factors specifically related to the industrial processing of tomatoes were also discussed. To conclude, there is no simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to the question \"Are processed tomato products as nutritious as fresh tomatoes?\" Many factors must be considered when comparing the nutritious value between fresh tomatoes and processed tomato products. At this point, we do not have sufficient data to fully understand all of the factors and their impacts.",

    "abstract": "Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a popular dietary strategy that emphasizes the timing of meals in alignment with diurnal circadian rhythms, permitting ad libitum energy intake during a restricted (∼8-10 h) eating window each day. Unlike energy-restricted diets or intermittent fasting interventions that focus on weight loss, many of the health-related benefits of TRE are independent of reductions in body weight. However, TRE research to date has largely ignored what food is consumed (i.e., macronutrient composition and energy density), overlooking a plethora of past epidemiological and interventional dietary research. To determine some of the potential mechanisms underpinning the benefits of TRE on metabolic health, future studies need to increase the rigor of dietary data collected, assessed, and reported to ensure a consistent and standardized approach in TRE research. This Perspective article provides an overview of studies investigating TRE interventions in humans and considers dietary intake (both what and when food is eaten) and their impact on selected health outcomes (i.e., weight loss, glycemic control). Integrating existing dietary knowledge about what food is eaten with our recent understanding on when food should be consumed is essential to optimize the impact of dietary strategies aimed at improving metabolic health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Food insecurity is a significant public health problem for Indigenous peoples in Canada. A comprehensive literature review is needed to organize the evidence according to the 4 pillars of food security (i.e., availability, access, utilization, and stability) and identify gaps in the published literature on this topic. Therefore, in this scoping review we aimed to summarize the published research discussing any of the 4 pillars of food security among Indigenous peoples in Canada. We conducted a literature search of the following databases: Ovid Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), and CINAHL, as well as the Indigenous Studies Portal (up to June 19, 2021). Population-based studies of any design were included, except for review-style articles. Articles published in languages other than English were also excluded. Of the 4687 studies identified by the database searches, 91 met our inclusion criteria. Evidence from these studies indicates that all dimensions of food security among Indigenous peoples in Canada have been impacted. Lack of availability of both traditional and market foods is highlighted among Inuit and First Nation communities. Economic disadvantages, high food prices, and lack of access to transportation are major factors affecting the accessibility pillar of food security. Major factors affecting the utilization pillar of food security are the loss of traditional knowledge and skills, lack of knowledge on market foods, low quality of market foods, and food safety issues. Climate change has affected all 4 pillars of food security among Indigenous peoples. These findings suggest that resolving food insecurity issues among Indigenous peoples in Canada, especially those living in remote communities, requires a culturally specific integrated approach targeting food availability, food cost, food knowledge, food safety, and food quality.",

We conducted a systematic review followed by a meta-analysis and critical appraisal of human studies published from 1997 to 2021. Thirty publications were identified. The meta-analysis included 5 of 7 case-control studies studying neural tube defects (NTDs) in relation to maternal choline intakes/circulating concentrations. Low maternal choline intake/circulating concentrations were associated with a higher OR for NTDs among 1131 mothers of newborns with NTDs and 4439 control mothers (pooled estimate = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.67). The 95% prediction intervals were 0.78, 2.36. Findings and critical evaluation of 10 publications with interventional designs showed that higher maternal choline intakes during the second half of pregnancy and early postnatal period (550 mg up to 1 g/d on top of the diet) or a child intake of 513 to 625 mg/d from supplements were safe and likely to demonstrate favorable effects on several domains of child neurocognition, such as memory, attention, and visuospatial learning versus the comparators. Findings from observational studies (n = 13) partly supported the association between maternal choline intake/serum concentrations and child neurocognition, but there was low confidence in the use of plasma choline concentrations as a choline intake marker. In conclusion, low maternal choline intakes were associated with a higher OR for NTDs. The risk could be up to 2.36-fold in some populations. Despite limitations of available trials and observational studies, higher maternal choline intake was likely to be associated with better child neurocognition/neurodevelopment. The results should be used to guide choline intake recommendations in pregnancy and lactation, especially because most young women are not achieving the reference intake of choline.

    "abstract": "Recent scientific evidence has shown the importance of diet and lifestyle habits for the proper functioning of the human body. A balanced and healthy diet, physical activity, and psychological well-being have a direct beneficial effect on health and can have a crucial role in the development and prognosis of certain diseases. The Southern European Atlantic diet, also named the Atlantic diet, is a unique dietary pattern that occurs in regions that present higher life expectancy, suggesting that this specific dietary pattern is associated with positive health effects. In fact, it is enriched with nutrients of high biological value, which, together with its cooking methods, physical activity promotion, reduction in carbon footprint, and promoting of family meals, promote these positive effects on health. The latest scientific advances in the field of nutri-epigenetics have revealed that epigenetic markers associated with food or nutrients and environmental factors modulate gene expression and, therefore, are involved with both health and disease. Thus, in this review, we evaluated the main aspects that define the Southern European Atlantic diet and the potential epigenetic changes associated with them based on recent studies regarding the main components of these dietary patterns. In conclusion, based on the information existing in the literature, we postulate that the Southern European Atlantic diet could promote healthy aging by means of epigenetic mechanisms. This review highlights the necessity of performing longitudinal studies to demonstrate this proposal.",

    "abstract": "Despite earlier meta-analyses on the association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MD) and risk of diabetes, there is no comprehensive and updated study assessing this issue. Furthermore, no earlier study has examined the nonlinear dose-response relation between consumption of an MD and risk of diabetes. The current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the linear and nonlinear dose-response relation between MD and incidence of diabetes. Using relevant keywords, electronic searches for prospective studies were conducted in ISI Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus until January 2022. The reported HRs or ORs in the primary studies were regarded as RRs. The overall effect was calculated using a random-effects model that accounts for between-study variability. The potential nonlinear dose-response associations were tested using a 2-stage hierarchical regression model. Based on 16 prospective studies (with 17 effect sizes), we found that the greatest adherence to the MD was significantly associated with a reduced risk of diabetes (pooled RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.90; I2 = 79%, P ≤ 0.001). Based on linear dose-response analysis, each 1-score increase in the Mediterranean diet score was associated with a 3% decreased risk of diabetes (HR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96, 0.98; P < 0.001). A nonlinear relation (P-nonlinearity = 0.001) was also observed between MD score and risk of type 2 diabetes. Even modest adherence to the MD was linked to a decreased incidence of type 2 diabetes.

Online databases were searched up to December 2020 to identify relevant, English-language articles that examined the effect of Lf supplementation in human subjects of all ages, on either inflammation, immune cell populations or activity, or the incidence, duration, or severity of respiratory illness or RTIs. Twenty-five studies (n = 20 studies in adults) were included, of which 8 of 13 studies (61%) in adults reported a decrease in at least 1 systemic inflammatory biomarker. Immune function improved in 6 of 8 studies (75%) in adults, with changes in immune cell populations in 2 of 6 studies (33%), and changes in immune cell activity in 2 of 5 studies (40%).

    "abstract": "Nondigestible carbohydrates (NDCs) are food components, including nonstarch polysaccharides and resistant starches. Many NDCs are classified as dietary fibers by the US FDA. Because of their beneficial effects on human health and product development, NDCs are widely used in the food supply. Although there are dietary intake recommendations for total dietary fiber, there are no such recommendations for individual NDCs. NDCs are heterogeneous in their chemical composition and physicochemical properties—characteristics that contribute to their tolerable intake levels. Guidance on tolerable intake levels of different NDCs is needed because overconsumption can lead to undesirable gastrointestinal side effects, further widening the gap between actual and suggested fiber intake levels. In this review, we synthesize the literature on gastrointestinal effects of NDCs that the FDA accepts as dietary fibers (β-glucan, pectin, arabinoxylan, guar gum, alginate, psyllium husk, inulin, fructooligosaccharides and oligofructose, galactooligosaccharides, polydextrose, cellulose, soy fiber, resistant maltodextrin/dextrin) and present tolerable intake dose recommendations for their consumption. We summarized the findings from 103 clinical trials in adults without gastrointestinal disease who reported gastrointestinal effects, including tolerance (e.g., bloating, flatulence, borborygmi/rumbling) and function (e.g., transit time, stool frequency, stool consistency). These studies provided doses ranging from 0.75–160 g/d and lasted for durations ranging from a single-meal tolerance test to 28 wk. Tolerance was NDC specific; thus, recommendations ranged from 3.75 g/d for alginate to 25 g/d for soy fiber. Future studies should address gaps in the literature by testing a wider range of NDC doses and consumption forms (solid compared with liquid). Furthermore, future investigations should also adopt a standard protocol to examine tolerance and functional outcomes across studies consistently.",

A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Medline databases for English-language papers and Wanfang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases for Chinese-language papers. A total of 186 studies evaluating the human milk lipid profiles were included. According to random-effects models based on worldwide data, the summarized means (95% CIs) as percentages of total fat were 42.2% (41.1%, 43.3%) for SFAs, 36.6% (35.6%, 37.5%) for MUFAs, and 21.0% (19.3%, 22.7%) for PUFAs. However, the study heterogeneity was high for most types of fatty acids (I2 > 99%). Human milk from Western countries had higher concentrations of MUFAs and 18:1n-9 (ω-9), but lower concentrations of PUFAs, 18:2n-6, 20:4n-6, 18:3n-3, 20:5n-3, 22:6n-3, and total n-6 PUFA compared with those from non-Western countries (P < 0.001-0.011). Significant lactation stage differences were observed for total fat and some individual fatty acids. The concentrations of SFAs and 16:0 were significantly negatively correlated with sampling year (P < 0.001-0.028). In contrast, a significant positive correlation between the concentrations of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 and sampling year was observed (P < 0.001-0.035). Our results suggest that the pooling of data on human milk lipid profiles in different studies should be done with caution due to the high between-study heterogeneity. The concentration of lipids, including total fat, cholesterol, and specific fatty acids, differs in human milk according to lactation stage, geographical region, and year of sample collection.",

    "abstract": "The effects of exercise training (Ex), dietary interventions (DIs), and a combination of Ex and DI (Ex + DI) on leptin and adiponectin have been established. However, less is known regarding the comparisons of Ex with DI and of Ex + DI with either Ex or DI alone. The aim of the present meta-analysis is to compare the effects of Ex with those of DI and those of Ex + DI with those of either Ex or DI alone on circulating leptin and adiponectin in individuals who are overweight and those with obesity. PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE were searched to identify original articles, published through June 2022, that compared the effects of Ex with those of DI and/or the effects of Ex + DI with those of Ex and/or DI on leptin and adiponectin in individuals with BMIs (in kg/m2) of ≥25 and aged 7–70 y. Standardized mean differences (SMDs), weighted mean differences, and 95% CIs were calculated using random-effect models for outcomes. Forty-seven studies, comprising 3872 participants who were overweight and those with obesity, were included in the current meta-analysis. DI reduced the concentration of leptin (SMD: −0.30; P = 0.001) and increased the concentration of adiponectin (SMD: 0.23; P = 0.001) compared with Ex, as did Ex + DI (leptin: SMD: −0.34; P = 0.001; adiponectin: SMD: 0.37; P = 0.004) compared with Ex alone. However, Ex + DI did not affect the concentration of adiponectin (SMD: 0.10; P = 0.11) and led to inconsistent and nonsignificant changes in the concentration of leptin (SMD: −0.13; P = 0.06) compared with DI alone. Subgroup analyses showed that age, BMI, duration of intervention, type of supervision, quality of the study, and magnitude of energy restriction are sources of heterogeneity. Our results suggest that Ex alone was not as effective as DI or Ex + DI for decreasing leptin and increasing adiponectin in individuals with overweight and obesity. However, Ex + DI was not more effective than DI alone, suggesting that diet plays a critical role in beneficially altering the concentrations of leptin and adiponectin.

We aimed to assess the state of available scientific literature on meat intake and gut microbiota in humans (PROSPERO, International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, CRD42020135649). We first conducted a scoping review to identify observational and interventional studies on this topic. Searches were performed for English language articles using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and CINAHL (Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) databases from inception to August 2021 and using keywords related to meat (inclusive of mammalian, avian, and aquatic subtypes) and gut microbiota. Of 14,680 records, 85 eligible articles were included in the scoping review, comprising 57 observational and 28 interventional studies. One prospective observational study and 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified in adults without diagnosed disease. We included the 13 RCTs, comprising 18 comparisons, in the systematic review to assess the effects of higher and lower intakes of total meat and meat subtypes on the gut microbiota composition. The bacterial composition was differentially affected by consuming diets with and without meat or with varied meat subtypes. For example, higher meat intake tended to decrease population sizes of genera Anerostipes and Faecalibacterium, but it increased the population size of Roseburia across studies. However, the magnitude and directionality of most microbial responses varied, with inconsistent patterns of responses across studies. The data were insufficient for comparison within or between meat subtypes. The paucity of research, especially among meat subtypes, and heterogeneity of findings underscore the need for more well-designed prospective studies and full-feeding RCTs to address the relationships between and effects of consuming total meat and meat subtypes on gut microbiota, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Food security has become a pressing issue in the modern world. The ever-increasing world population, ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and political conflicts together with climate change issues make the problem very challenging. Therefore, fundamental changes to the current food system and new sources of alternative food are required. Recently, the exploration of alternative food sources has been supported by numerous governmental and research organizations, as well as by small and large commercial ventures. Microalgae are gaining momentum as an effective source of alternative laboratory-based nutritional proteins as they are easy to grow under variable environmental conditions, with the added advantage of absorbing carbon dioxide. Despite their attractiveness, the utilization of microalgae faces several practical limitations. Here, we discuss both the potential and challenges of microalgae in food sustainability and their possible long-term contribution to the circular economy of converting food waste into feed via modern methods. We also argue that systems biology and artificial intelligence can play a role in overcoming some of the challenges and limitations; through data-guided metabolic flux optimization, and by systematically increasing the growth of the microalgae strains without negative outcomes, such as toxicity. This requires microalgae databases rich in omics data and further developments on its mining and analytics methods.",

This study aimed to synthesize the associations between high (compared with low) MD adherence and PF levels with each of its components (cardiorespiratory, motor, and musculoskeletal) in adulthood. We conducted a systematic search in 5 databases from inception to January 2022. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials were included. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and effect sizes (Cohen d index) with their 95% CIs were calculated via a random effects model. A total of 30 studies were included (19 cross-sectional in young, middle-aged, and older adults; 10 prospective cohort in older adults; and 1 randomized controlled trial in young adults) involving 36,807 individuals (mean age range: 20.9-86.3 y). Pooled effect sizes showed a significant cross-sectional association between higher MD adherence scores (as a continuous variable) and overall PF (d = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.75; I2 = 91.0%, n = 6). The pooled ORs from cross-sectional data showed that high adherence to MD was associated with higher cardiorespiratory fitness (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 2.06, 2.47; I2 = 0%, n = 4), musculoskeletal fitness (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.47; I2 = 61.4%, n = 13), and overall PF (OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.68; I2 = 83.2%, n = 17) than low adherence to MD (reference category: 1). Pooled ORs from prospective cohort studies (3- to 12-y follow-up) showed that high adherence to MD was associated with higher musculoskeletal fitness (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.38; I2 = 0%, n = 4) and overall PF (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.26; I2 = 9.7%, n = 7) than low adherence to MD (reference category: 1). Conversely, no significant association was observed between MD and motor fitness. High adherence to MD was associated with higher PF levels, a crucial marker of health status throughout adulthood.

    "abstract": "The health effects of dairy products are still a matter of scientific debate owing to inconsistent findings across trials. Therefore, this systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to compare the effects of different dairy products on markers of cardiometabolic health. A systematic search was conducted in 3 electronic databases [MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science; search date: 23 September 2022]. This study included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a ≥12-wk intervention comparing any 2 of the eligible interventions [e.g., high dairy (≥3 servings/d or equal amount in grams per day), full-fat dairy, low-fat dairy, naturally fermented milk products, and low dairy/control (0–2 servings/d or usual diet)]. A pairwise meta-analysis and NMA using random-effects model was performed in the frequentist framework for 10 outcomes [body weight, BMI, fat mass, waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and systolic blood pressure]. Continuous outcome data were pooled using mean differences (MDs) and dairy interventions ranked using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Nineteen RCTs with 1427 participants were included. High-dairy intake (irrespective of fat content) showed no detrimental effects on anthropometric outcomes, blood lipids, and blood pressure. Both low-fat and full-fat dairy improved systolic blood pressure (MD: −5.22 to −7.60 mm Hg; low certainty) but, concomitantly, may impair glycemic control (fasting glucose—MD: 0.31–0.43 mmol/L; glycated hemoglobin—MD: 0.37%–0.47%). Full-fat dairy may increase HDL cholesterol compared with a control diet (MD: 0.26 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.49 mmol/L). Yogurt improved waist circumference (MD: −3.47 cm; 95% CI: −6.92, −0.02 cm; low certainty), triglycerides (MD: −0.38 mmol/L; 95% CI: −0.73, −0.03 mmol/L; low certainty), and HDL cholesterol (MD: 0.19 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.38 mmol/L) compared with milk. In conclusion, our findings indicate that there is little robust evidence that a higher dairy intake has detrimental effects on markers of cardiometabolic health.

    "abstract": "Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide recommendations to clinicians based on current medical knowledge to guide and reduce variability in clinical care. With advances in nutrition science research, CPGs increasingly include dietary guidance; however, the degree of consistency in dietary recommendations across CPGs has not been investigated. Using a systematic review approach adapted for meta-epidemiologic research, this study compared dietary guidance from current guidelines developed by governments, major medical professional societies, and large health stakeholder associations owing to their often well-defined and standardized processes for guideline development. CPGs making recommendations for dietary patterns and food groups or components for generally healthy adults or those with prespecified chronic diseases were eligible. Literature from January 2010 to January 2022 was searched in 5 bibliographic databases and augmented by searches in point-of-care resource databases and relevant websites. Reporting followed an adapted PRISMA statement and included narrative synthesis and summary tables. Seventy-eight CPGs for major chronic conditions (autoimmune, 7; cancers, 5; cardiovascular-related, 35; digestive, 11; diabetes, 12; weight-related, 4; or multiple, 3) and general health promotion (n = 1) were included. Nearly, all (91%) made dietary pattern recommendations, and approximately half (49%) endorsed patterns centered on plant foods. Overall, CPGs were most closely aligned in promoting consumption of major plant food groups (vegetables = 74% of CPGs, fruit = 69%, whole grains = 58%), whereas discouraging intake of alcohol (62%) and salt or sodium (56%). CVD and diabetes CPGs were similarly aligned with additional messaging to consume legumes/pulses (60% of CVD CPGs; 75%, diabetes), nuts and seeds (67%, CVD), and low-fat dairy (60%, CVD). Diabetes guidelines discouraged sweets/added sugars (67%) and sweetened beverages (58%). This alignment across CPGs should boost clinician confidence in relaying such dietary guidance to patients in accordance with their relevant CPGs.

We convened attendees at various career stages with diverse viewpoints in the field. We held a \"Food Processing Primer\" to build foundational knowledge of how and why foods are processed, followed by presentations about how processed foods may affect energy intake, obesity, and CMD risk. Breakout groups discussed potential mechanistic and confounding explanations for associations between processed foods and obesity and CMD risk. Facilitators created research questions (RQs) based on key themes from discussions. Different breakout groups convened to discuss what is known and unknown for each RQ and to develop sub-RQs to address gaps. Workshop attendees focused on ultra-processed foods (UPFs; Nova Group 4) because the preponderance of evidence is based on this classification system. Yet, heterogeneity and subjectivity in UPF classification was a challenge for RQ development. The 6 RQs were: 1) What objective methods or measures could further categorize UPFs, considering food processing, formulation, and the interaction of the two? 2) How can exposure assessment of UPF intake be improved? 3) Does UPF intake influence risk for obesity or CMDs, independent of diet quality? 4) What, if any, attributes of UPFs influence ingestive behavior and contribute to excess energy intake? 5) What, if any, attributes of UPFs contribute to clinically meaningful metabolic responses? 6) What, if any, external environmental factors lead people to consume high amounts of UPFs? Uncertainty and complexity around UPF intake warrant further complementary and interdisciplinary causal, mechanistic, and methodological research related to obesity and CMD risk to understand the utility of applying classification by degree of processing to foods in the United States.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of healthy and sustainable diets and the transition to sustainable food systems is of principal importance in order to counteract the double burden of climate change and noncommunicable diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MD) has been widely recognized as a biodiversity and healthy nutrition resource to support sustainable development and food security. This study explored biodiversity in terms of food plants species, subspecies, varieties, and races, and also addressed food plant diversity differences between the MD and Western-type consumption patterns. It was funded by the EU BioValue Project, aiming to promote the integration of underutilized crops into the food value chains. Using a 2-stage scheme, data were selected from MEDUSA and Euro+Med databases (including 449 species, 2366 subspecies, varieties, and races). Furthermore, 12 countries from North Africa and Europe were classified in 2 groups according to their subregional attributes and their traditionally most prevalent dietary pattern (MD or Western-type diets). Statistical analysis showed that the mean of the majorly cultivated food plants in the MD was significantly higher than its counterpart in the Western diet. Furthermore, no statistical difference was detected in the averages of native food plants between the MD group and the Western diet group, implying that the higher diversity in food plants observed in the MD seems to be attributed to crop utilization rather than crop availability. Our findings indicated the interlinkage between biodiversity and prevailing dietary patterns and further underlined that biodiversity could constitute a prerequisite for dietary diversity and hence nutrition security. In addition, this study demonstrated that diets and nutrition should be approached in a broader way within the context of both agro-food and ecological systems.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence supports the beneficial role of breastfeeding in lowering obesity risk, but the enduring impact of breastfeeding on longitudinal changes of body mass index (i.e., BMI trajectories) remains unclear. This systematic review summarised evidence on how breastfeeding influenced the longitudinal trajectories of BMI later in life. Literature searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect to identify studies that assessed how breastfeeding (versus other feeding types or duration) was associated with longitudinal trajectories of BMI or BMI z-score. Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 24 longitudinal cohort studies were included. Two thirds (18/27) of studies were rated as acceptable or high quality. Most cohort studies (9/11) showed that children who continued to breastfeed at 3-12 months of age had a lower BMI trajectory or lower odds of following a high BMI trajectory than those who were formula-fed or mixed-fed. The BMI differences between breastfeeding and other feeding groups were evident from age 7 months and remained up to 8 years, and the magnitude of between-group BMI differences increased with age. For breastfeeding duration, 12 out of 15 cohort studies found that longer breastfeeding duration was associated with lower BMI trajectories up to age 18 years. Moreover, beneficial associations were observed for both exclusive and any breastfeeding with BMI trajectory. In contrast, mixed findings were reported from three RCTs that compared BMI trajectories from birth to ages 12-24 months between breastfeeding promotion versus control or breastfeeding versus formula-feeding groups. The current review provides further longitudinal evidence from cohort studies that breastfeeding versus formula/mixed feeding or longer breastfeeding duration was associated with lower BMI trajectories. Such associations initiated in early childhood, became more apparent with age, and were sustained into early adulthood. The existing evidence substantiates the importance of breastfeeding promotion and continuation to support obesity prevention. This is the first systematic review that critically evaluated the longitudinal evidence linking breastfeeding versus other feeding types or breastfeeding duration and trajectories of body mass index over three or more time points later in childhood and adulthood.",

Higher intakes of legumes, compared with lower intakes, were associated with a reduced risk of mortality from all causes (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.98; n = 27) and stroke (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.99; n = 5). There was no significant association for CVD mortality (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.09; n =11), CHD mortality (HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.09; n = 5), or cancer mortality (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.01; n = 5). In the linear dose–response analysis, a 50 g/d increase in legume intake was associated with a 6% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.99; n = 19), but no significant association was observed for the remaining outcomes. The certainty of evidence was judged from low to moderate. A higher legume intake was associated with lower mortality from all causes and stroke, but no association was observed for CVD, CHD, and cancer mortality. These results support dietary recommendations to increase the consumption of legumes.",

    "abstract": "Human milk (HM) provides a plethora of nutritional and non-nutritional compounds that support infant development. For many compounds, concentrations vary substantially among mothers and across lactation, and their impact on infant growth is poorly understood. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science to synthesize evidence published between 1980 and 2022 on HM components and anthropometry through 2 y of age among term-born infants. Outcomes included weight-for-length, length-for-age, weight-for-age, body mass index (in kg/m2)–for–age, and growth velocity. From 9992 abstracts screened, 144 articles were included and categorized based on their reporting of HM micronutrients, macronutrients, or bioactive components. Micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) are reported here, based on 28 articles involving 2526 mother-infant dyads. Studies varied markedly in their designs, sampling times, geographic and socioeconomic settings, reporting practices, and the HM analytes and infant anthropometrics measured. Meta-analysis was not possible because data were sparse for most micronutrients. The most-studied minerals were zinc (15 articles, 1423 dyads) and calcium (7 articles, 714 dyads). HM iodine, manganese, calcium, and zinc concentrations were positively associated with several outcomes (each in ≥2 studies), whereas magnesium (in a single study) was negatively associated with linear growth during early lactation. However, few studies measured HM intake, adjusted for confounders, provided adequate information about complementary and formula feeding, or adequately described HM collection protocols. Only 4 studies (17%) had high overall quality scores. The biological functions of individual HM micronutrients are likely influenced by other HM components; yet, only 1 study analyzed data from multiple micronutrients simultaneously, and few addressed other HM components. Thus, available evidence on this topic is largely inconclusive and fails to address the complex composition of HM. High-quality research employing chronobiology and systems biology approaches is required to understand how HM components work independently and together to influence infant growth and to identify new avenues for future maternal, newborn, or infant nutritional interventions.",

    "abstract": "Among exclusively breastfed infants, human milk (HM) provides complete nutrition in the first mo of life and remains an important energy source as long as breastfeeding continues. Consisting of digestible carbohydrates, proteins, and amino acids, as well as fats and fatty acids, macronutrients in human milk have been well studied; however, many aspects related to their relationship to growth in early life are still not well understood. We systematically searched Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science to synthesize evidence published between 1980 and 2022 on HM components and anthropometry through 2 y of age among term-born healthy infants. From 9992 abstracts screened, 57 articles reporting observations from 5979 dyads were included and categorized based on their reporting of HM macronutrients and infant growth. There was substantial heterogeneity in anthropometric outcome measurement, milk collection timelines, and HM sampling strategies; thus, meta-analysis was not possible. In general, digestible carbohydrates were positively associated with infant weight outcomes. Protein was positively associated with infant length, but no associations were reported for infant weight. Finally, HM fat was not consistently associated with any infant growth metrics, though various associations were reported in single studies. Fatty acid intakes were generally positively associated with head circumference, except for docosahexaenoic acid. Our synthesis of the literature was limited by differences in milk collection strategies, heterogeneity in anthropometric outcomes and analytical methodologies, and by insufficient reporting of results. Moving forward, HM researchers should accurately record and account for breastfeeding exclusivity, use consistent sampling protocols that account for the temporal variation in HM macronutrients, and use reliable, sensitive, and accurate techniques for HM macronutrient analysis.",

    "abstract": "The current guidelines recommend that people consume 2 or more servings of fat-rich fish per week to obtain enough omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids to prevent cardiovascular events. However, the cardiovascular benefits of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in patients with diabetes are unclear, and related large-scale trials have produced conflicting results. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials that attempted to assess the effects of ω-3 fatty acid supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes. In PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, we searched for data from all randomized controlled trials on ω-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes published before July 2022. Eight eligible studies involving 57,754 participants were ultimately included. Meta-analysis showed that ω-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients with diabetes (rate ration [RR] = 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90, 0.97; P = 0.0009). Among them, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but not EPA plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), significantly reduced the risk of CVD in patients with diabetes (EPA [RR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.90; P=0.0001]). This meta-analysis suggests that ω-3 fatty acid supplementation is an effective strategy to prevent CVD in patients with diabetes, but further well-designed, large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the safety of ω-3 fatty acid supplementation, and its effect on atrial fibrillation.

Nutritional consideration for the athlete requires optimization of energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient intakes, and potentially the judicious selection of dietary supplements, all specified to meet the individual athlete's training and performance goals. The purpose of this review is to assess whether adopting a vegan diet is likely to impinge on such optimal nutrition and, where so, consider evidence based yet practical and pragmatic nutritional recommendations. Current evidence does not support that a vegan-type diet will enhance performance, adaptation, or recovery in athletes, but equally suggests that an athlete can follow a (more) vegan diet without detriment. A clear caveat, however, is that vegan diets consumed spontaneously may induce suboptimal intakes of key nutrients, most notably quantity and/or quality of dietary protein and specific micronutrients (eg, iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and vitamin D). As such, optimal vegan sports nutrition requires (more) careful consideration, evaluation, and planning. Individual/seasonal goals, training modalities, athlete type, and sensory/cultural/ethical preferences, among other factors, should all be considered when planning and adopting a vegan diet.",

    "abstract": "Serine has been recently identified as an essential metabolite for oncogenesis, progression, and adaptive immunity. Influenced by many physiologic or tumor environmental factors, the metabolic pathways of serine synthesis, uptake, and usage are heterogeneously reprogrammed and frequently amplified in tumor or tumor-associated cells. The hyperactivation of serine metabolism promotes abnormal cellular nucleotide/protein/lipid synthesis, mitochondrial function, and epigenetic modifications, which drive malignant transformation, unlimited proliferation, metastasis, immunosuppression, and drug resistance of tumor cells. Dietary restriction of serine or phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase depletion mitigates tumor growth and extends the survival of tumor patients. Correspondingly, these findings triggered a boom in the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting serine metabolism. In this study, recent discoveries in the underlying mechanism and cellular function of serine metabolic reprogramming are summarized. The vital role of serine metabolism in oncogenesis, tumor stemness, tumor immunity, and therapeutic resistance is outlined. Finally, some potential tumor therapeutic concepts, strategies, and limitations of targeting the serine metabolic pathway are described in detail. Taken together, this review underscores the importance of serine metabolic reprogramming in tumorigenesis and progression and highlights new opportunities for dietary restriction or selective pharmacologic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Carotenoids have been associated with risk reduction for several chronic diseases, including the association of their dietary intake/circulating levels with reduced incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancer, and even lower total mortality. In addition to some carotenoids constituting vitamin A precursors, they are implicated in potential antioxidant effects and pathways related to inflammation and oxidative stress, including transcription factors such as nuclear factor κB and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. Carotenoids and metabolites may also interact with nuclear receptors, mainly retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, which play a role in the immune system and cellular differentiation. Therefore, a large number of downstream targets are likely influenced by carotenoids, including but not limited to genes and proteins implicated in oxidative stress and inflammation, antioxidation, and cellular differentiation processes. Furthermore, recent studies also propose an association between carotenoid intake and gut microbiota. While all these endpoints could be individually assessed, a more complete/integrative way to determine a multitude of health-related aspects of carotenoids includes (multi)omics-related techniques, especially transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics, as well as metagenomics, measured in a variety of biospecimens including plasma, urine, stool, white blood cells, or other tissue cellular extracts. In this review, we highlight the use of omics technologies to assess health-related effects of carotenoids in mammalian organisms and models.",

Milk production is intricately regulated by both endocrine and autocrine control mechanisms, with oestrogens and progesterone playing pivotal roles in this process. In addition to endogenously produced hormones, external substances capable of interfering with normal hormonal actions, including phytoestrogens, mycoestrogens, synthetic oestrogens, and hormonal contraceptives, can influence milk production. The effects of these extrinsic hormones on milk production may vary based on maternal body mass index. This comprehensive review examines the multifaceted causes of LMS, focusing on the involvement of oestrogens, progesterone, and related external factors in milk production. Furthermore, it investigates the interplay between hormonal factors and obesity, aiming to elucidate the endocrine mechanisms underlying obesity-associated LMS. Insights from this review provide valuable perspectives for developing interventions to improve milk production and address the challenges associated with LMS.",

Whole-milk dairy foods, including milk, cheese, and yogurt, are leading sources of saturated fat in the diet. Dietary guidelines around the world recommend the consumption of low-fat and fat-free dairy foods to obtain overall healthy dietary patterns that help meet nutrient recommendations while keeping within recommended calorie and saturated fat limitations. A body of observational and clinical evidence indicates, however, that whole-milk dairy food consumption, despite saturated fat content, does not increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. This review describes the proposed biological mechanisms underlying inverse associations between whole-milk dairy food consumption and risk markers for cardiometabolic health, such as altered lipid digestion, absorption, and metabolism; influence on the gut microflora; and regulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. The dairy food matrix, a term used to describe how the macronutrients and micronutrients and other bioactive components of dairy foods are differentially packaged and compartmentalized among fluid milk, cheese, and yogurt, may dictate how each affects cardiovascular risk. Current evidence indicates consideration of dairy foods as complex food matrices, rather than delivery systems for isolated nutrients, such as saturated fatty acids, is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence has long been considered a permanent state of cell cycle arrest occurring in proliferating cells subject to different stressors, used as a cellular defense mechanism from acquiring potentially harmful genetic faults. However, recent studies highlight that senescent cells might also alter the local tissue environment and concur to chronic inflammation and cancer risk by secreting inflammatory and matrix remodeling factors, acquiring a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Indeed, during aging and age-related diseases, senescent cells amass in mammalian tissues, likely contributing to the inevitable loss of tissue function as we age. Cellular senescence has thus become one potential target to tackle age-associated diseases as well as cancer development. One important aspect characterizing senescent cells is their telomere length. Telomeres shorten as a consequence of multiple cellular replications, gradually leading to permanent cell cycle arrest, known as replicative senescence. Interestingly, in the large majority of cancer cells, a senescence escape strategy is used and telomere length is maintained by telomerase, thus favoring cancer initiation and tumor survival. There is growing evidence showing how (poly)phenols can impact telomere maintenance through different molecular mechanisms depending on dose and cell phenotypes. Although normally, (poly)phenols maintain telomere length and support telomerase activity, in cancer cells this activity is negatively modulated, thus accelerating telomere attrition and promoting cancer cell death. Some (poly)phenols have also been shown to exert senolytic activity, thus suggesting both antiaging (directly eliminating senescent cells) and anticancer (indirectly, via SASP inhibition) potentials. In this review, we analyze selective (poly)phenol mechanisms in senescent and cancer cells to discriminate between in vitro and in vivo evidence and human applications considering (poly)phenol bioavailability, the influence of the gut microbiota, and their dose-response effects.",

    "abstract": "Improving diet quality while simultaneously maintaining planetary health is of critical interest globally. Despite the shared motivation, advancement remains slow and the research community continues to operate in silos, focusing on certain pairings (diet-climate), or with a discipline-specific lens, of a sustainable diet, rather than examining their totality. This review aimed to summarise the literature on adherence to a priori defined dietary patterns in consideration of diet quality, metabolic risk factors of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), environmental impacts, and affordability. A methodology using PRISMA guidelines was followed, and searches were performed in seven databases as of October 2022. The Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) and the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool for observational cohort studies were employed for quality appraisal. The evidence was narratively synthesised according to the characteristics of the diet quality metrics. The review includes 24 studies published from 2017-2023. Thirteen distinct diet quality scores were identified, with those measuring adherence to national dietary guidelines the most reported. Thirteen distinct environmental impact indicators were identified, with greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) (n=23) reported most. All studies reported on Body Mass Index (BMI) and seven studies assessed the cost of adherence. Our results are consistent with previous findings that healthier diets can reduce environmental impacts, however incongruities between population and planetary health can occur. Hence, the 'sustainability' of dietary patterns is dependent on the choice of indicators selected. Further, healthy, lower impact diets can increase financial cost, but may also provide a protective role against risk of obesity. Given the Global Syndemic, strategies to reduce obesity prevalence should emphasise the win-win opportunities for population and planetary health through dietary change. Research should identify diets that address multiple environmental concerns, to curtail burdens potentially transferring, and harmonize with sociocultural and equity dimensions.

This umbrella review aimed to review and grade the evidence for the associations between dietary factors and pancreatic cancer risk. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL for eligible literature. We included meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or prospective observational studies. We used AMSTAR-2, a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews, to evaluate the methodological quality of the included meta-analyses. For each association, we calculated the summary effect size, 95% CI, heterogeneity, number of cases, 95% prediction interval, small-study effect, and excess significance bias. The protocol for this review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022333669). We included 41 meta-analyses of prospective observational studies describing 59 associations between dietary factors and pancreatic cancer risk. None of the retrieved meta-analyses included RCTs. No association was supported by convincing or highly suggestive evidence; however, there was suggestive evidence of a positive association between fructose intake and pancreatic cancer risk. There was weak evidence for an inverse association of nuts intake or adherence to the Mediterranean diet with pancreatic cancer incidence, and for positive associations between a higher intake of red meat or heavy alcohol intake and pancreatic cancer incidence. The remaining 54 associations were nonsignificant. Consistent with the American Institute for Cancer Research review, this umbrella review found that regular consumption of nuts and reduced intake of fructose, red meat, and alcohol were associated with a lower risk of pancreatic cancer. Emerging weak evidence supported an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and pancreatic cancer risk. As some associations were rated as weak and most were considered nonsignificant, further prospective studies are needed to investigate the role of dietary factors and risk of pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "Poor nutrition is linked to morbidity and mortality globally. The nutrition transition toward diets composed of high amounts of ultraprocessed foods that are more refined, calorie-dense, and poor in nutrients is considered a factor in the rise of diet-related metabolic diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Historically, nutrition strategies aimed at mitigating metabolic diseases linked to suboptimal diets have targeted isolated nutrients such as fats; however, they overlook the complexity and importance of whole foods and food matrices, which can lead to unintended consequences such as avoidance of nutrient-dense foods. Dairy foods, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, are underconsumed nutrient-dense foods that often fall in the cross-hairs of reductionist nutrition strategies because of their contribution of calories, saturated fat, and sodium to the diet. This article highlights dairy foods as an example for exploring the complex matrices of food, nutrients, and other bioactive components that are associated with improved nutrient status and reduced risk of metabolic diseases while considering a holistic approach to improving diet quality and human health.",

    "abstract": "Greater intake of whole grains, compared to refined grains, is consistently associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, both of which are associated with cognitive decline. To better understand the relationship between whole-grain intake, cognition, mood, and anxiety, a systematic review was conducted to synthesize available evidence linking whole grains to these outcomes. Four electronic databases were searched from inception to August 2021 for potentially relevant observational and interventional studies. Risk of bias (RoB) assessments were performed using the newly developed Nutrition Quality Evaluation Strengthening Tools, and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to determine the strength of evidence for each outcome. In total, 23 studies [4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 19 observational studies] met the predefined eligibility criteria. Of these,12 studies included analysis of whole-grain intake and cognitive decline, 9 included mood outcomes, and 2 included both cognition and mood outcomes. The overall evidence for an association between whole-grain intake and cognition is inconclusive. With respect to mood outcomes, evidence from RCTs prospective cohort and case-control studies suggest that higher intake is linked to improved outcomes for mood and depression although the evidence is mixed for cross-sectional studies. Reporting of whole-grain intake fell short of suggested standards, and the strength of available evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. A high RoB toward studies reporting results was also noted, complicating both the interpretation of some studies and the combined evidence. Of note, few well-designed RCTs assessing the effect of whole-grain intake on measures of cognition, mood, and anxiety were identified, highlighting the need for more studies in this area. The available, although limited, evidence suggests that greater whole-grain intake is associated with better mood and anxiety-related scores and is inconclusive regarding cognitive outcomes.

    "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet is a global, well-known healthy dietary pattern. This review aims to synthesize the existing evidence on the relationship between the maternal Mediterranean diet during pregnancy and perinatal outcomes, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies. PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 10 March, 2023, supplemented by manual screening. A random-effect model was used to estimate pooled sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for specific outcomes of interest. Data from 5 RCTs and 18 cohort studies with 107,355 pregnant participants were synthesized. In RCTs, it was observed that the maternal Mediterranean diet significantly reduced the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus [odds ratio (OR), 0.56; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.93], as well as small for gestational age (0.55; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.88). In cohort studies, the highest adherence score to the maternal Mediterranean diet was inversely associated with a lower risk of various adverse pregnancy outcomes, including gestational diabetes mellitus (OR, 0.82; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.00), pregnancy-induced hypertension (0.73; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.89), pre-eclampsia (0.77; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.93), preterm delivery (0.67; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.91), low birth weight (0.70; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.78), intrauterine growth restriction (0.46; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.91), and increased gestational age at delivery (weighted mean difference, 0.11 wk; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.20). Meta-regression analyses did not identify the adjustment for confounders and geographical location as predictive factors for heterogeneity. The results suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy appears to be beneficial for perinatal outcomes.

    "abstract": "In infants worldwide, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory infections, including bronchiolitis, which is a major source of infant mortality. Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory infection and the major cause of hospitalization in the first 6 mo of life. Infant responses to RSV infection are highly diverse, with symptoms varying from asymptomatic or mild to so severe as to require mechanical ventilation. Breastfed infants present a lower incidence and less severe forms of RSV lower respiratory infections. Among the multitude of human milk bioactive compounds, human milk oligosaccharides (hMOSs) are strong candidates for having a protective effect against RSV. hMOS reduces the viral load and the inflammatory signaling in cultured RSV-infected respiratory human cells. In addition to this direct effect, indirect mechanisms, notably gut microbiota composition and metabolism, have been proposed to mediate the protective effect of hMOS. Intake of infant formula containing synthetic hMOS has been shown to increase Bifidobacterium abundance and that of its metabolites, especially acetate, in infant feces and to reduce lower respiratory tract infections during the first year of life. Breastfeeding and the use of hMOS are promising approaches to protect against and treat RSV disease. Here, we review current evidence on the role of hMOS with regard to RSV infection and disease, attending to knowledge gaps and future research directions.",

    "abstract": "With emerging Asian-derived diet quality indices and data-driven dietary patterns available, we aimed to synthesize the various dietary patterns and quantify its association with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) among Asian populations. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science for observational studies in South, Southeast, and East Asia. Dietary patterns were grouped \"high-quality,\" which included high intakes of three or more of the following food groups: 1) fruits and vegetables, 2) whole grains, 3) healthy protein sources (legumes and nuts, fish and seafood, low-fat dairy, and lean meat and poultry), and 4) liquid plant oils. High-quality patterns were further subcategorized based on their derivation methods: non-Asian indices, Asian indices, data-driven patterns, and plant-based indices. Dietary patterns were grouped \"low-quality,\" which included high intakes of two or more of the following: 5) ultraprocessed food, 6) beverages and foods with added sugars, 7) foods high in salt, and 8) alcoholic beverages. Data-driven dietary patterns characterized by animal food sources were labeled \"animal-based,\" and studies using dietary diversity scores were labeled \"diet diversity indices.\" Dietary patterns that could not be meaningfully categorized were summarized narratively. Study-specific effect estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. Forty-one studies were included in this review. Higher adherence to high-quality dietary patterns in the top compared with bottom tertile defined by non-Asian indices (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.88; GRADE: moderate), Asian indices (RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.90; GRADE: low), and data-driven patterns (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.89; GRADE: moderate) were associated with lower CVD risk. Plant-based, low-quality, animal-based, and diet diversity indices dietary patterns were not associated with CVD. Associations of Asian diet quality indices and CVD risk were weaker than those with non-Asian indices, highlighting the need for current Asian diet quality criteria to be updated to better capture the impact of diet on CVD.

    "abstract": "The vitamin E family contains α-tocopherol (αT), βT, γT, and δT and α-tocotrienol (TE), βTE, γTE, and δTE. Research has revealed distinct roles of these vitamin E forms in prostate cancer (PCa). The ATBC trial showed that αT at a modest dose significantly decreased PCa mortality among heavy smokers. However, other randomized controlled trials including the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) indicate that supplementation of high-dose αT (≥400 IU) does not prevent PCa among nonsmokers. Preclinical cell and animal studies also do not support chemopreventive roles of high-dose αT and offer explanations for increased incidence of early-stage PCa reported in the SELECT. In contrast, accumulating animal studies have demonstrated that γT, δT, γTE, and δTE appear to be effective for preventing early-stage PCa from progression to adenocarcinoma in various PCa models. Existing evidence also support therapeutic roles of γTE and its related combinations against advanced PCa. Mechanistic and cell-based studies show that different forms of vitamin E display varied efficacy, that is, δTE ≥ γTE > δT ≥ γT >> αT, in inhibiting cancer hallmarks and enabling characteristics, including uncontrolled cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammation possibly via blocking 5-lipoxygenase, nuclear factor κB, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, modulating sphingolipids, and targeting PCa stem cells. Overall, existing evidence suggests that modest αT supplement may be beneficial to smokers and γT, δT, γTE, and δTE are promising agents for PCa prevention for modest-risk to relatively high-risk population. Despite encouraging preclinical evidence, clinical research testing γT, δT, γTE, and δTE for PCa prevention is sparse and should be considered.",

This review summarizes the current research on prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) immunomodulatory mechanisms mediated by bacterial-derived metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids, to maintain immune homeostasis. The potential applications of GOS as immunotherapy for age-related disease prevention in older individuals are also highlighted.

    "abstract": "Heart failure is a progressive condition associated with a high mortality rate. Despite advancements in treatment, many patients continue to experience less-than-ideal outcomes. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been studied as a potential supplementary therapy for heart failure, but the optimal dosage and duration of supplementation remain unclear. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to assess the efficacy of various n-3 PUFAs supplementation regimens in heart failure patients, focusing on dose- and time-dependent effects. We conducted a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on n-3 PUFAs supplementation in heart failure up to September 13th, 2024. The primary outcome was the change in heart function, specifically left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Secondary outcomes included changes in peak oxygen consumption (VO2), blood BNP levels, and quality of life. The safety analysis focused on dropout rates (i.e., patients leaving the study for any reason before completion) and all-cause mortality. A frequentist-based NMA was performed. This NMA, which included 14 RCTs with 9075 participants (mean age 66.0 years, 23.3% female), found that high-dose n-3 PUFAs supplementation (2000-4000 mg/day) over a duration of at least one year significantly improved LVEF and peak VO2 compared to control groups. Lower doses and shorter treatment periods did not produce the same benefits. No significant differences were found in dropout rates or all-cause mortality between the n-3 PUFAs and control groups. Long-term, high-dose n-3 PUFAs supplementation, particularly with a predominance of docosahexaenoic acid or eicosapentaenoic acid, enhances cardiac function in heart failure patients without increasing the risk of adverse events. Further well-designed RCTs with long treatment durations (i.e., more than one year) and stringent heart failure inclusion criteria are necessary to confirm these findings and reduce potential biases.

The association between exposure to Pb from seafood during PL on children's neurodevelopment is uncertain. This systematic review assessed the association of exposure to Pb from seafood during PL on children's neurodevelopment. Embase, PubMed, CENTRAL and PsycINFO were searched for English-language peer-reviewed articles. Two independent reviewers screened at title and abstract and full-text levels. Experimental and observational studies comparing different levels of exposure to seafood and Pb were eligible if: 1) the exposed population was healthy pregnant or lactating individuals from high or very high Human Development Index countries; 2) assessed neurodevelopment in children ≤18 years old; and 3) measured maternal seafood intake, Pb exposure and analyzed their relationship with each other and/or their association with child neurodevelopment. The Cochrane ROBINS-E and GRADE tools were used to assess the risk of bias and certainty of evidence. Four included articles from three prospective cohort studies in Asia examined cognition, motor development, and behavior in children 12-60 months. Only one study reported an analysis between seafood intake and lead concentrations during PL which showed a weak, insignificant association. Pb concentrations were not associated with child cognitive development or behavioral problems, but a weak, negative association with child motor development was reported. The certainty of evidence was very low due to few included studies with some or high risk of bias. Higher seafood intake in this evidence favored positive developmental outcomes from one prospective cohort study, though significance varied. Overall, evidence was not available to address a direct association between Pb exposure from seafood intake during PL and child neurodevelopment. Several other limitations resulted in a very low certainty of overall evidence.

Diet quality indexes are widely used to quantify dietary patterns. However, the optimal tool for assessing dietary quality in relation to chronic inflammation remains unclear. To synthesise the literature on food-based diet quality indexes and their association with chronic inflammation. A systematic scoping review of scientific databases was conducted from inception to March 2024. Studies describing the development and validation of original dietary-inflammatory indexes or assessed associations between established indexes and inflammatory biomarkers were included. Studies that predominantly focused on nutrient-based indexes were excluded. Forty-three food-based indexes, evaluated across 65 studies were categorised into four distinct groups based on: dietary patterns (n=18), dietary guidelines (n=14), dietary-inflammatory potential (n=6) and therapeutic diets (n=5). Established indexes based on the Mediterranean diet and dietary guidelines, were the most extensively utilised, demonstrating inverse associations with several inflammatory biomarkers across diverse populations. The Anti-Inflammatory Diet Index (AIDI), Dietary Inflammation Score (DIS), and Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Index (EDII) were identified as robust, empirically derived indexes to assess diet quality based on its inflammatory potential. The dietary composition of the evaluated indexes ranged from four to twenty-eight dietary components with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes consistently classified as favourable, while red/processed meats and added sugars were unfavourable. This scoping review identified several promising food-based indexes for assessing inflammation-related diet quality. Methodological variations and inconsistencies in algorithms underscore the need for further validation across diverse populations. Future research should consider the scoring methods, dietary composition, and validated inflammatory biomarkers when selecting indexes to evaluate diet-inflammation associations. Understanding the characteristics that underpin these indexes informs their application in nutrition research and clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "A group of academic and industry experts in the fields of nutrition, cardiology, epidemiology, food science, bone health, and integrative medicine examined the data on the relationship between calcium supplement use and risk of cardiovascular events, with an emphasis on 4 of the Bradford Hill criteria for causal inference: strength, consistency, dose-response, and biological plausibility. Results from 2 epidemiological studies and a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials, including a subgroup analysis from the Women's Health Initiative, have prompted concern about a potential association between calcium supplement use and a small increase in the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. However, a number of issues with the studies, such as inadequate compliance with the intervention, use of nontrial calcium supplements, potential bias in event ascertainment, and lack of information on and adjustment for known cardiovascular risk determinants, suggest that bias and confounding cannot be excluded as explanations for the reported associations. Findings from other cohort studies also suggest no detrimental effect of calcium from diet or supplements, with or without vitamin D, on cardiovascular disease risk. In addition, little evidence exists for plausible biological mechanisms to link calcium supplement use with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The authors do not believe that the evidence presented to date regarding the hypothesized relationship between calcium supplement use and increased cardiovascular disease risk is sufficient to warrant a change in the Institute of Medicine recommendations, which advocate use of supplements to promote optimal bone health in individuals who do not obtain recommended intakes of calcium through dietary sources.",

    "abstract": "An imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure is the primary etiology for excess weight gain. Increased energy expenditure via exercise and energy restriction via diet are commonly used approaches to induce weight loss. Such behavioral interventions, however, have generally resulted in a smaller than expected weight loss, which in part has been attributed to compensatory adaptations in other components contributing to energy balance. Current research points to a loose coupling between energy intake and energy expenditure on a daily basis, and evidence for long-term adaptations has been inconsistent. The lack of conclusive evidence on compensatory adaptations in response to alterations in energy balance can be attributed to differences in intervention type and study population. Physical activity (PA) levels may be reduced in response to aerobic exercise but not in response to resistance exercise. Furthermore, athletic and lean adults have been shown to increase their energy intake in response to exercise, whereas no such response was observed in obese adults. There is also evidence that caloric restriction is associated with a decline in PA. Generally, humans seem to be better equipped to defend against weight loss than avoid weight gain, but results also show a large individual variability. Therefore, individual differences rather than group means should be explored to identify specific characteristics of \"compensators\" and \"noncompensators.\" This review emphasizes the need for more research with simultaneous measurements of all major components contributing to energy balance to enhance the understanding of the regulation of energy balance, which is crucial to address the current obesity epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Ruminants are more vulnerable to copper deficiency than humans because rumen sulfide generation lowers copper availability from forage, increasing the risk of conditions such as swayback in lambs. Molybdenum-rich pastures promote thiomolybdate (TM) synthesis and formation of unabsorbable Cu-TM complexes, turning risk to clinical reality (hypocuprosis). Selection pressures created ruminant species with tolerance of deficiency but vulnerability to copper toxicity in alien environments, such as specific pathogen–free units. By contrast, cases of copper imbalance in humans seemed confined to rare genetic aberrations of copper metabolism. Recent descriptions of human swayback and the exploratory use of TM for the treatment of Wilson's disease, tumor growth, inflammatory diseases, and Alzheimer's disease have created unexpected common ground. The incidence of pre–hemolytic copper poisoning in specific pathogen–free lambs was reduced by an infection with Mycobacterium avium that left them more responsive to treatment with TM but vulnerable to long-term copper depletion. Copper requirements in ruminants and humans may need an extra allowance for the \"copper cost\" of immunity to infection. Residual cuproenzyme inhibition in TM-treated lambs and anomalies in plasma copper composition that appeared to depend on liver copper status raise this question \"can chelating capacity be harnessed without inducing copper-deficiency in ruminants or humans?\" A model of equilibria between exogenous (TM) and endogenous chelators (e.g., albumin, metallothionein) is used to predict risk of exposure and hypocuprosis; although risk of natural exposure in humans is remote, vulnerability to TM-induced copper deficiency may be high. Biomarkers of TM impact are needed, and copper chaperones for inhibited cuproenzymes are prime candidates.",

We have conducted a systematic literature review of studies reporting the concentration of LA in subcutaneous adipose tissue of US cohorts.

    "abstract": "Environmental and lifestyle factors are known to play an important role during gestation, determining newborns' health status and influencing their risk of being subject to certain noncommunicable diseases later in life. In particular, maternal nutritional patterns characterized by a low intake of plant-derived foods could increase the risk of gestation-related issues, such as preeclampsia and pregravid obesity, increase genotoxicant susceptibility, and contribute to the onset of pediatric diseases. In particular, the risk of pediatric wheeze, diabetes, neural tube defects, orofacial clefts, and some pediatric tumors seems to be reduced by maternal intake of adequate amounts of vegetables, fruits, and selected antioxidants. Nevertheless, plant-based diets, like any other diet, if improperly balanced, could be deficient in some specific nutrients that are particularly relevant during gestation, such as n–3 (ω-3) fatty acids, vitamin B-12, iron, zinc, and iodine, possibly affecting the offspring's health state. Here we review the scientific literature in this field, focusing specifically on observational studies in humans, and highlight protective effects elicited by maternal diets enriched in plant-derived foods and possible issues related to maternal plant-based diets.",

Numerous risk factors have been identified for CVD, including a number of nutritional factors. Recently, attention has been focused on fructose-containing sugars and their putative link to risk factors for CVD. In this review, we focus on recent studies related to sugar consumption and cardiovascular risk factors including lipids, blood pressure, obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. We then examine the scientific basis for competing recommendations for sugar intake. We conclude that although it appears prudent to avoid excessive consumption of fructosecontaining sugars, levels within the normal range of human consumption are not uniquely related to CVD risk factors with the exception of triglycerides, which may rise when simple sugars exceed 20% of energy per day, particularly in hypercaloric settings.",

    "abstract": "Small-intestinal growth and function are critical for optimal animal growth and health and play a major role in nutrient digestion and absorption, energy and nutrient expenditure, and immunological competence. During fetal and perinatal development, the small intestine is affected by the maternal environment and nutrient intake. In ruminants, altered small-intestinal mass, villi morphology, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, vascularity, and gene expression have been observed as a result of poor gestational nutrition or intrauterine growth restriction. Although many of these data come from fetal stages, data have also demonstrated that nutrition during mid- and late gestation affects lamb small-intestinal growth, vascularity, digestive enzyme activity, and gene expression at 20 and 180 d of age as well. The small intestine is known to be a highly plastic tissue, changing with nutrient intake and physiological state even in adulthood, and the maternal small intestine adapts to pregnancy and advancing gestation. In ruminants, the growth, vascularity, and gene expression of the maternal small intestine also adapt to the nutritional plane and specific nutrient intake such as high selenium during pregnancy. These changes likely alter both pre- and postnatal nutrient delivery to offspring. More research is necessary to better understand the role of the offspring and maternal small intestines in whole-animal responses to developmental programming, but programming of this plastic tissue seems to play a dynamic role in gestational nutrition impacts on the whole animal.",

    "abstract": "Studies on the relation between health and nutrition are often inconclusive. There are concerns about the validity of many research findings, and methods that can deliver high-quality evidence-such as the randomized controlled trial (RCT) method-have been embraced by nutritional researchers. Unfortunately, many nutritional RCTs also yield ambiguous results. It has been argued that RCTs are ill-suited for certain settings, including nutritional research. In this perspective, we investigate whether there are fundamental limitations of the RCT method in nutritional research. To this end, and to limit the scope, we use probiotic studies as an example. We use an epistemological approach and evaluate the presuppositions that underlie the RCT method. Three general presuppositions are identified and discussed. We evaluate whether these presuppositions can be considered true in probiotic RCTs, which appears not always to be the case. This perspective concludes by exploring several alternative study methods that may be considered for future probiotic or nutritional intervention trials.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional epidemiology is an inherently complex and multifaceted research area. Dietary intake is a complex exposure and is challenging to describe and assess, and links between diet, health, and disease are difficult to ascertain. Consequently, adequate reporting is necessary to facilitate comprehension, interpretation, and generalizability of results and conclusions. The STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement is an international and collaborative initiative aiming to enhance the quality of reporting of observational studies. We previously presented a checklist of 24 reporting recommendations for the field of nutritional epidemiology, called \"the STROBE-nut.\" The STROBE-nut is an extension of the general STROBE statement, intended to complement the STROBE recommendations to improve and standardize the reporting in nutritional epidemiology. The aim of the present article is to explain the rationale for, and elaborate on, the STROBE-nut recommendations to enhance the clarity and to facilitate the understanding of the guidelines. Examples from the published literature are used as illustrations, and references are provided for further reading.",

Cutoffs generally have an underlying relation to health status and are one of the important quantitative criteria against which biomarker outputs are compared. For this reason, cutoffs are integral for surveys, surveillance, screening, interventions, monitoring, and evaluation. Despite their importance, nutritional biomarker cutoffs have not been adequately addressed in the literature. Furthermore, the field has not reached a consensus on which cutoff to use for each biomarker, and different cutoffs are often used for the same biomarkers in published studies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of cutoffs related to nutritional biomarkers and highlights some of the high-priority research gaps and challenges of using micronutrient case studies.",

    "abstract": "The United States is the largest refugee resettlement country in the world. Refugees may face health-related challenges after resettlement in the United States, including higher rates of chronic diseases due to problems such as language barriers and difficulty adapting to new food environments. However, reported refugee diet challenges varied, and no systematic examination has been reported. This study examined refugee food intake pre- and postresettlement in the United States and differences in intake across various refugee groups. We systematically reviewed relevant studies that reported on refugee food intake and adaptation to the US food environment. We searched PubMed for literature published between January 1985 and April 2015, including cross-sectional and prospective studies. Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. Limited research has been conducted, and most studies were based on small convenience samples. In general, refugees increased meat and egg consumption after resettling in the United States. Changes in refugee intake of vegetables, fruits, and dairy products varied by socioeconomic status, food insecurity, past food deprivation experience, length of stay in the United States, region of origin, and age. South Asians were more likely to maintain traditional diets, and increased age was associated with more conservative and traditional diets. Despite the abundance of food in the United States, postresettlement refugees reported difficulty in finding familiar or healthy foods. More research with larger samples and follow-up data are needed to study how refugees adapt to the US food environment and what factors may influence their food- and health-related outcomes. The work could inform future interventions to promote healthy eating and living among refugees and help to reduce health disparities.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the world, a high prevalence of obesity in older populations has created a new phenotype of frailty: the obese, functionally frail older adult. The convergence of the obesity epidemic with global graying will undoubtedly increase the prevalence of this concern. Barriers to treatment include ambiguities about the appropriate level of obesity that should trigger an intervention, due to age-related physiologic changes and a lack of consensus on specific criteria and cutoffs. Moreover, obesity interventions for this population have been limited by concerns about negative effects on lean mass, bone mineral density, and even mortality. However, newly reported approaches for restoring physical function by obesity reduction have shown good short-term efficacy. Because the majority of these interventions have used exercise as part of the treatment, this review focuses specifically on current understanding of the discrete effects of dietary interventions for geriatric obesity with regards to functional outcomes on tests including the Short Physical Performance Battery, the Physical Performance Test, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The literature showed roughly equal benefits to function from a weight reduction diet or exercise regimen, although neither modality was as efficacious alone as the 2 combined. Only 1 of 3 studies of protein intake during weight loss showed a positive effect of protein on function, but findings to date are too limited to prove or disprove a protein benefit. We conclude that although diet and exercise should be combined whenever possible, it remains important to further investigate the beneficial and likely unique effects that calorie restriction and/or nutrient modification can provide, particularly for obese and functionally frail older populations.",

    "abstract": "Healthy dietary habits are the cornerstone of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Numerous researchers have developed diet quality indices to help evaluate and compare diet quality across and within various populations. The availability of these new indices raises questions regarding the best selection relevant to a given population. In this perspective, we critically evaluate a priori–defined dietary indices commonly applied in epidemiological studies of CVD risk and mortality. A systematic literature search identified 59 observational studies that applied a priori–defined diet quality indices to CVD risk factors and/or CVD incidence and/or CVD mortality. Among 31 different indices, these scores were categorized as follows: 1) those based on country-specific dietary patterns, 2) those adapted from distinct dietary guidelines, and 3) novel scores specific to key diet-related factors associated with CVD risk. The strengths and limitations of these indices are described according to index components, calculation methods, and the application of these indices to different population groups. Also, the importance of identifying methodological challenges faced by researchers when applying an index are considered, such as selection and weighting of food groups within a score, since food groups are not necessarily equivalent in their associations with CVD. The lack of absolute cutoff values, emphasis on increasing healthy food without limiting unhealthy food intake, and absence of validation of scores with biomarkers or other objective diet assessment methods further complicate decisions regarding the best indices to use. Future research should address these limitations, consider cross-cultural and other differences between population groups, and identify translational challenges inherent in attempting to apply a relevant diet quality index for use in CVD prevention at a population level.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, cancer has been viewed as a set of diseases that are driven by the accumulation of genetic mutations, but we now understand that disruptions in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are prevalent in cancer as well. Unlike genetic mutations, however, epigenetic alterations are reversible, making them desirable therapeutic targets. The potential for diet, and bioactive dietary components, to target epigenetic pathways in cancer is now widely appreciated, but our understanding of how to utilize these compounds for effective chemopreventive strategies in humans is in its infancy. This review provides a brief overview of epigenetic regulation and the clinical applications of epigenetics in cancer. It then describes the capacity for dietary components to contribute to epigenetic regulation, with a focus on the efficacy of dietary epigenetic regulators as secondary cancer prevention strategies in humans. Lastly, it discusses the necessary precautions and challenges that will need to be overcome before the chemopreventive power of dietary-based intervention strategies can be fully harnessed.",

    "abstract": "Food insecurity (FI) may limit cognitive functioning during aging. The goal of this systematic review was to summarize existing evidence linking FI and general or specific cognitive functions in middle and older adulthood. A systematic search of human studies published between 1 January 2000 and 30 April 2018 was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and CAB Direct. Four independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of identified articles and conducted data extraction and data quality assessment. Ten studies were included in the review, including 1 cluster-randomized controlled trial, 2 longitudinal studies, and 7 cross-sectional studies. Three studies reported the association between early-life FI experience and a global cognitive function measure. Nine studies reported later-life FI experience in relation to global or specific cognitive functions. The results suggest an adverse association between FI experienced in early or later life and global cognitive function; and between later-life FI and executive function and memory. Findings from the review are preliminary because of sparse data, heterogeneity across study populations, exposure and outcome assessments, and potential risk of bias across studies. Future studies are recommended to better understand the role of FI in cognitive function, with the goal of identifying possible critical windows for correction of FI in vulnerable subpopulations to prevent neurocognitive deficit in adulthood.",

Despite some progress, efforts to alleviate malnutrition are hampered by a shortage in number, skills, and geographic coverage, of a workforce for nutrition. Here, we report the findings of the Castel Gandolfo workshop, a convening of experts from diverse fields in March 2014 to consider how to develop the capacity of a global cadre of nutrition professionals for the post-2015 development era. Workshop participants identified several requirements for developing a workforce for nutrition, including an ability to work as part of a multisectoral team; communication, advocacy, and leadership skills to engage decision makers; and a set of technical skills to address future challenges for nutrition. Other opportunities were highlighted that could immediately contribute to capacity development, including the creation of a consortium to link global North and South universities, online training modules for middle managers, and practical, hands-on experiences for frontline nutrition workers. Institutional and organizational support is needed to enable workshop recommendations on education and training to be effectively implemented and sustained. The findings from the Castel Gandolfo workshop can contribute to the delivery of successful nutrition-relevant actions in the face of mounting external pressures and informing and attaining the forthcoming Sustainable Development Goals.",

    "abstract": "Refined grain intake is widely assumed to be associated with adverse health outcomes, including increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and obesity. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended that to improve dietary quality, the US population should replace most refined grains with whole grains. This recommendation was based largely on results from studies that examined dietary patterns, not separate food groups. A Western dietary pattern typically includes red and processed meat, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, French fries, and high-fat dairy products, as well as refined grains, and has been linked to increased risk of many chronic diseases. However, when evaluated as a distinct food category, 11 meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies, which included a total of 32 publications with data from 24 distinct cohorts, demonstrated that refined grain intake was not associated with all-cause mortality, T2D, CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, hypertension, or cancer. By contrast, consumption of red and processed meat was consistently associated with increased risk of these same health outcomes. Refined grain consumption up to 6-7 servings/d (1 serving = 30 g) was not associated with higher risk of CHD, T2D, hypertension, or all-cause mortality. Moreover, total grain intake was not associated with risk of CVD, CHD, stroke, or cancer, but was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality. Consequently, the recommendation to reduce refined grain intake based on results from studies linking a Western dietary pattern to numerous adverse health outcomes is contrary to a substantial body of published scientific evidence. Future research needs to better define refined grain intake to distinguish between staple grain foods and indulgent grain foods, and to better design randomized controlled trials to resolve discrepancies between results from observational studies and such trials with regard to determining the benefits of whole grains compared with refined grains.",

    "abstract": "The influence of diet on the gut microbiota is an emerging research area with significant impact on human health and disease. However, the effects of beef, the most consumed red meat in the United States, on gut microbial profile are not well studied. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols, the objective of this systematic review was to conduct a rigorous and thorough review of the current scientific literature regarding the effects of beef protein and the resulting bioactivity of beef protein and amino acids on the gut microbiota, with the goal of identifying gaps in the literature and guiding future research priorities. Utilizing MEDLINE Complete, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, we conducted searches including terms and combinations of the following: animal protein, amino acid, beef, bioactive compounds, diet, health, microbiome, peptide, processed beef, and protein. We identified 131 articles, from which 15 were included in our review. The effects of beef on mouse and rat models were mostly consistent for the bacterial phylum level. Short-term (1-4-wk) beef intakes had little to no effect on microbial profiles in humans. Most studies utilized high beef feeding (240-380 g/d), and no study examined recommended amounts of protein [∼3.71 oz/d (105 g/d) meats, poultry, and eggs, or ∼26 oz/week (737 g/wk) from these food sources] according to US dietary guidelines. Additionally, the majority of animal and human studies with adverse findings examined the impact of beef in the context of a diet high in fat or sugar. In conclusion, an extensive gap exists in the literature regarding beef and the microbiota. More studies are necessary to elucidate the role of the microbiota following the consumption of beef, especially in interaction with other dietary compounds, and how beef preparation, processing, and cooking methods differentially influence the biological effects of beef on human health.",

    "abstract": "Results from observational studies indicate that whole grain (WG) intake is inversely associated with BMI and risk of weight gain. WG intake may influence energy balance and body composition through effects on appetite and energy intake. To evaluate the impact of WG food consumption on appetite and energy intake, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing WG food consumption, appetite, and energy intake in adults. A search of PubMed, Scopus, and Food Science and Technology Abstracts yielded 36 RCTs measuring subjective appetite ratings after consuming WG foods compared with refined grain (RG) controls. Thirty-two of these studies reported AUCs for subjective appetite (hunger, fullness, satiety, desire to eat, or prospective consumption) and/or energy intake and were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled estimates from meta-analyses are expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs). Compared with RG foods, intake of WG foods resulted in significant differences in AUCs for subjective hunger (SMD: −0.34; 95% CI: −0.46, −0.22; P < 0.001), fullness (SMD: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.66; P < 0.001), satiety (SMD: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.47; P < 0.001), and desire to eat (SMD: −0.33; 95% CI: −0.46, −0.20; P < 0.001). There were small, nonsignificant reductions in prospective consumption ratings (P = 0.08) and energy intake (P = 0.07) with WG intake compared with RG. These results support the view that consumption of WG foods, compared with RG foods, significantly impacts subjective appetite, and might partly explain the inverse associations between WG food intake and risk of overweight, obesity, and weight gain over time.

    "abstract": "Fibers are increasingly recognized as an indispensable part of our diet and vital for maintaining health. Notably, complex mixtures of fibers have been found to improve metabolic health. Following an analysis of the fiber content of plant-based products, we found the taproot of the chicory plant (Cichorium intybusL.) to be 1 of the vegetables with the highest fiber content, comprising nearly 90% of its dry weight. Chicory roots consist of a mixture of inulin, pectin, and (hemi-)cellulose and also contain complex phytochemicals, such as sesquiterpene lactones that have been characterized in detail. Nowaday, chicory roots are mainly applied as a source for the extraction of inulin, which is used as prebiotic fiber and food ingredient. Chicory roots, however, have long been consumed as a vegetable by humans. The whole root has been used for thousands of years for nutritional, medicinal, and other purposes, and it is still used in traditional dishes in various parts of the world. Here, we summarize the composition of chicory roots to explain their historic success in the human diet. We revisit the intake of chicory roots by humans and describe the different types of use along with their various methods of preparation. Hereby, we focus on the whole root in its complex, natural form, as well as in relation to its constituents, and discuss aspects regarding legal regulation and the safety of chicory root extracts for human consumption. Finally, we provide an overview of the current and future applications of chicory roots and their contribution to a fiber-rich diet.",

    "abstract": "Plant foods are universally promoted for their links to improved human health, yet carbohydrate-containing foods are often maligned based on isolated, reductionist methods that fail to assess carbohydrate foods as a matrix of nutrients and food components. Currently accepted positive carbohydrate quality indices include plant food, whole-grain content, and dietary fiber, while negative health outcomes are linked to high intakes of added sugar and high glycemic index. More recently, negative health aspects have been linked to ultra-processed foods, which are often high in carbohydrates. Yet, carbohydrate staples such as grains and dairy products are both enriched and fortified, resulting in these carbohydrate foods containing important nutrients of concern such as dietary fiber, potassium, vitamin D, and calcium. This Perspective analyzes carbohydrate metrics used in dietary guidance and labeling and finds limitations in accepted indices included in standardized quality carbohydrate definitions and also proposes additional indices to benefit both human and environmental health. As nutrition recommendations shift away from a single-nutrient focus to a more holistic dietary pattern approach that is flexible and adaptable for each individual, it is necessary to determine the quality components that make up these patterns. This review concludes that current approaches that demonize staple carbohydrate foods do little to promote the recommended patterns of foods known to improve health status and reduce disease risk.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of osteoporosis among women aged 50 y and older is expected to reach 13.6 million by 2030. Alternative nonpharmaceutical agents for osteoporosis, including nutritional interventions, are becoming increasingly popular. Prunes (dried plums; Prunus domestica L.) have been studied as a potential whole-food dietary intervention to mitigate bone loss in preclinical models of osteoporosis and in osteopenic postmenopausal women. Sixteen preclinical studies using in vivo rodent models of osteopenia or osteoporosis have established that dietary supplementation with prunes confers osteoprotective effects both by preventing and reversing bone loss. Increasing evidence from 10 studies suggests that, in addition to antiresorptive effects, prunes exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Ten preclinical studies have found that prunes and/or their polyphenol extracts decrease malondialdehyde and NO secretion, increase antioxidant enzyme expression, or suppress NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Two clinical trials have investigated the impact of dried plum consumption (50-100 g/d for 6-12 mo) on bone health in postmenopausal women and demonstrated promising effects on bone mineral density and bone biomarkers. However, less is known about the impact of prune consumption on oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators in humans and their possible role in modulating bone outcomes. In this review, the current state of knowledge on the relation between inflammation and bone health is outlined. Findings from preclinical and clinical studies that have assessed the effect of prunes on oxidative stress, inflammatory mediators, and bone outcomes are summarized, and evidence supporting a potential role of prunes in modulating inflammatory and immune pathways is highlighted.

    "abstract": "Nutritional epidemiological studies have frequently reported associations between higher (poly)phenol intake and a decrease in the risk or incidence of noncommunicable diseases. However, the assessment methods that have been used to quantify the intakes of these compounds in large-population samples are highly variable. This systematic review aims to characterize the methods used to assess dietary (poly)phenol intake in observational studies, report the validation status of the methods, and give recommendations on method selection and data reporting. Three databases were searched for publications that have used dietary assessment methods to measure (poly)phenol intake and 549 eligible full texts were identified. Food-frequency questionnaires were found to be the most commonly used tool to assess dietary (poly)phenol intake (73%). Published data from peer-reviewed journals were the major source of (poly)phenol content data (25%). An increasing number of studies used open-access databases such as Phenol-Explorer and USDA databases on flavonoid content since their inception, which accounted for 11% and 23% of the data sources, respectively. Only 16% of the studies reported a method that had been validated for measuring the target (poly)phenols. For future research we recommend: 1) selecting a validated dietary assessment tool according to the target compounds and target period of measurement; 2) applying and combining comprehensive (poly)phenol content databases such as USDA and Phenol-Explorer; 3) detailing the methods used to assess (poly)phenol intake, including dietary assessment method, (poly)phenol content data source; 4) follow the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology-Nutritional Epidemiology (STROBE-nut) framework; and 5) complementing dietary intake assessment based on questionnaires with measurement of (poly)phenols in biofluids using appropriate and validated analytical methods.",

    "abstract": "Mobile dietary record apps have been increasingly validated by studies with various study designs. This review aims to evaluate the overall accuracy of dietary record apps in measuring the intake of energy, macro- and micronutrients, and food groups in real-life settings and the designs of validation studies. We systematically searched mobile dietary record validation studies published during the period from 2013 to 2019. We identified 14 studies for the systematic review, of which 11 studies were suitable for meta-analyses on energy intake and 8 studies on macronutrient intake. Mean differences and SDs of nutrient estimations between the app and the reference method from studies were pooled using a random-effects model. All apps underestimated energy intake when compared with their reference methods, with a pooled effect of -202 kcal/d (95% CI: -319, -85 kcal/d); the heterogeneity of studies was 72%. After stratification, studies that used the same food-composition table for both the app and the reference method had a lower level of heterogeneity (0%) and a pooled effect of -57 kcal/d (95% CI: -116, 2 kcal/d). The heterogeneity of studies in the differences in carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake was 54%, 73%, and 80%, with the pooled effect of -18.8 g/d, -12.7 g/d, and -12.2 g/d, respectively, after excluding outliers. The intakes of micronutrients and food groups were statistically nonsignificantly underestimated by the apps in most cases. In conclusion, dietary record apps underestimated food consumption compared with traditional dietary assessment methods. Moreover, varying study designs have been found across studies. Recommended practices for conducting validation studies were formulated including considering biomarkers as the reference, testing in a larger and more representative study population for a longer period, avoiding the learning effect of each method, and comparing food group or food item consumption in addition to comparing energy and nutrient intakes.",

    "abstract": "Refugees remain vulnerable to acute food insecurity, malnutrition, and critically inadequate food and nutrient intake after migration, regardless of the economic level of the host country. We conducted this systematic review to summarize and evaluate the dietary intake and nutritional status among refugees resettled in non-camp settings worldwide. We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases to review relevant studies published between 2009 and 2020 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We also conducted an additional manual search through PubMed and Google Scholar. Studies that evaluated both dietary intake and nutritional status of refugees in host countries were included. A total of 15 articles from 10 countries were included and assessed for study quality and outcomes. Poor dietary diversity and insufficient intake of specific food groups were reported. In addition to these dietary patterns, a high prevalence of stunting, underweight, and anemia was reported, particularly among children. A double burden of malnutrition was also observed across and within studies. Post-resettlement dietary intake and nutritional status of refugees are both influenced by factors at the pre- and post-resettlement stages as refugees transition to their host countries. Those factors, including pre-resettlement experiences, host country resources, socioeconomic status, acculturation, and food security, were summarized and presented in a conceptual model. There is a need for comprehensive dietary and health screening as well as culturally appropriate and sustainable nutrition education resources and interventions for refugees to improve their diet and nutrition. Longitudinal studies and novel methodological approaches are also suggested to measure changes in refugees' food intake and nutritional status as well as to further investigate factors associated with these 2 components.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 2 decades, many African countries have undergone dietary and nutrition transitions fueled by globalization, rapid urbanization, and development. These changes have altered African food environments and, subsequently, dietary behaviors, including food acquisition and consumption. Dietary patterns associated with the nutrition transition have contributed to Africa's complex burden of malnutrition-obesity and other diet-related noncommunicable diseases (DR-NCDs)-along with persistent food insecurity and undernutrition. Available evidence links unhealthy or obesogenic food environments (including those that market and offer energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and beverages) with suboptimal diets and associated adverse health outcomes. Elsewhere, governments have responded with policies to improve food environments. However, in Africa, the necessary research and policy action have received insufficient attention. Contextual evidence to motivate, enable, and create supportive food environments in Africa for better population health is urgently needed. In November 2020, the Measurement, Evaluation, Accountability, and Leadership Support for Noncommunicable Diseases Prevention Project (MEALS4NCDs) convened the first Africa Food Environment Research Network Meeting (FERN2020). This 3-d virtual meeting brought researchers from around the world to deliberate on future directions and research priorities related to improving food environments and nutrition across the African continent. The stakeholders shared experiences, best practices, challenges, and opportunities for improving the healthfulness of food environments and related policies in low- and middle-income countries. In this article, we summarize the proceedings and research priorities identified in the meeting to advance the food environment research agenda in Africa, and thus contribute to the promotion of healthier food environments to prevent DR-NCDs, and other forms of malnutrition.",

    "abstract": "Food fermentation using sourdough—i.e., consortia of lactic bacteria and yeasts—is increasingly considered among the public as a natural transformation yielding nutritional benefits; however, it is unclear whether its alleged properties are validated by science. The aim of this study was to systematically review the clinical evidence related to the effect of sourdough bread on health. Bibliographic searches were performed in 2 different databases (The Lens and PubMed) up to February 2022. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials involving adults, healthy or not, given any type of sourdough bread compared with those given any type of yeast bread. A total of 573 articles were retrieved and investigated, of which 25 clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The 25 clinical trials included a total of 542 individuals. The main outcomes investigated in the retrieved studies were glucose response (N = 15), appetite (N = 3), gastrointestinal markers (N = 5), and cardiovascular markers (N = 2). Overall, it is currently difficult to establish a clear consensus with regards to the beneficial effects of sourdough per se on health when compared with other types of bread because a variety of factors, such as the microbial composition of sourdough, fermentation parameters, cereals, and flour types potentially influence the nutritional properties of bread. Nonetheless, in studies using specific strains and fermentation conditions, significant improvements were observed in parameters related to glycemic response, satiety, or gastrointestinal comfort after bread ingestion. The reviewed data suggest that sourdough has great potential to produce a variety of functional foods; however, its complex and dynamic ecosystem requires further standardization to conclude its clinical health benefits.",

    "abstract": "Food insecurity has disproportionately impacted Hispanic/Latinx households in the United States, specifically those with young children. Although the literature provides evidence of an association between food insecurity and adverse health outcomes in young children, minimal research has addressed the social determinants and related risk factors associated with food insecurity among Hispanic/Latinx households with children under three, a highly vulnerable population. Using the Socio-Ecological Model (SEM) as a framework, this narrative review identified factors associated with food insecurity among Hispanic/Latinx households with children under three. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and four additional search engines. Inclusion criteria consisted of articles published in English from November 1996 to May 2022 that examined food insecurity among Hispanic/Latinx households with children under three. Articles were excluded if conducted in settings other than the US and/or focused on refugees and temporary migrant workers. Data were extracted (i.e., objective, setting, population, study design, measures of food insecurity, results) from the final articles (n = 27). The strength of each article's evidence was also evaluated. Results identified individual factors (i.e., intergenerational poverty, education, acculturation, language, etc.), interpersonal factors (i.e., household composition, social support, cultural customs), organizational factors (i.e., interagency collaboration, organizational rules), community factors (i.e., food environment, stigma, etc.), and public policy/societal factors (i.e., nutrition assistance programs, benefit cliffs, etc.) associated with a food security status of this population. Overall, most articles were classified as \"medium\" or higher quality for the strength of evidence, and more frequently focused on individual or policy factors. Findings indicate the need for more research to include a focus on public policy/society factors, as well as on multiple levels of the SEM with considerations of how individual and policy levels intersect and to create or adapt nutrition-related and culturally appropriate interventions to improve food security of Hispanic/Latinx households with young children.",

    "abstract": "Dietary components can induce epigenetic changes through DNA methylation, histone modification, and regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs). Studies of diet-induced epigenetic regulation can inform anticipatory trials and fine-tune public health guidelines. We systematically reviewed data on the effect of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and its phenolic compounds (OOPCs) on the epigenetic landscape. We conducted a literature search using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and scrutinized published evidence. After applying selection criteria (e.g., inclusion of in vitro, animal, or human studies supplemented with EVOO or its OOPCs), we thoroughly reviewed 51 articles, and the quality assessment was performed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool. The results show that both EVOO and its OOPCs can promote epigenetic changes capable of regulating the expression of genes and molecular targets involved in different metabolic processes. For example, oleuropein (OL) may be an epigenetic regulator in cancer, and hydroxytyrosol (HT) modulates the expression of miRNAs involved in the development of cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. We conclude that EVOO and its OOPCs can regulate gene expression by modifying epigenetic mechanisms that impact human pathophysiology. A full elucidation of the epigenetic effects of EVOO and its OOPCs may contribute to developing different pharma-nutritional strategies that exploit them as epigenetic agents.

    "abstract": "Error in self-reported food and beverage intake affects the accuracy of dietary intake data. Systematically synthesizing available data on contributors to error within and between food groups has not been conducted but may help inform error mitigation strategies. In this review we aimed to systematically identify, quantify, and compare contributors to error in estimated intake of foods and beverages, based on short-term self-report dietary assessment instruments, such as 24-h dietary recalls and dietary records. Seven research databases were searched for studies including self-reported dietary assessment and a comparator measure of observed intake (e.g., direct observation or controlled feeding studies) in healthy adults up until December 2021. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data from included studies, recording quantitative data on omissions, intrusions, misclassifications, and/or portion misestimations. Risk of bias was assessed using the QualSyst tool. A narrative synthesis focused on patterns of error within and between food groups. Of 2328 articles identified, 29 met inclusion criteria and were included, corresponding to 2964 participants across 15 countries. Most frequently reported contributors to error were omissions and portion size misestimations of food/beverage items. Although few consistent patterns were seen in omission of consumed items, beverages were omitted less frequently (0-32% of the time), whereas vegetables (2-85%) and condiments (1-80%) were omitted more frequently than other items. Both under- and overestimation of portion size was seen for most single food/beverage items within study samples and most food groups. Studies considered and reported error in different ways, impeding the interpretation of how error contributors interact to impact overall misestimation. We recommend that future studies report 1) all error contributors for each food/beverage item evaluated (i.e., omission, intrusion, misclassification, and portion misestimation), and 2) measures of variation of the error.

This narrative review explores recent studies on malnutrition and muscle loss as well as nutritional and multimodal interventions to treat these conditions in the context of the changing treatment landscape in lung cancer. Various types of interventions, including individualized counseling, protein and other specific nutrient supplementation, as well as multimodal interventions to treat malnutrition and muscle loss, have been investigated. Overall, individualized dietary counseling, increasing protein intake, and supplementation with omega-3 (n–3) fatty acids appear to be beneficial for some, albeit varying, patient outcomes. Multimodal interventions, generally including a nutrition and exercise component, show promising results; however, the impact on patient outcomes is mixed. A key finding of this review is a lack of large, randomized trials to guide nutrition intervention specifically in people with lung cancer. Despite the high prevalence of malnutrition and muscle loss in people with lung cancer and the known adverse outcomes, current evidence for nutrition intervention is limited. A targeted effort is required to improve the quality of evidence for nutrition intervention in this population to provide support for clinicians to deliver effective nutrition care.",

    "abstract": "Dairy milk is a ubiquitous nutrient-dense beverage and ingredient, especially in Western diets. However, consumers are increasingly seeking alternatives to dairy, called plant-based milks (PBMs), to avoid allergens, pursue a plant-based diet, or reduce their environmental impacts. The base ingredients used in PBMs have a wide range of environmental impacts, which may translate to substantial variation across the impacts associated with PBMs themselves. To assess the state of the literature on this topic, we performed a scoping review of the environmental impacts of PBMs, following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews. Recent growth in the variety of PBMs available means that there is unlikely yet enough data for conclusive statements regarding environmental impacts of all PBM types, which makes this topic appropriate for a scoping review. We included all relevant documents found through searching scholarly databases. We found 20 studies covering 6 types of PBMs, but the literature does not examine many other types of PBMs. All studies examined use the life cycle assessment methodology. The most data regarding environmental impacts were available for soy- and almond-based milks, and the most common impact quantified was greenhouse gas emissions. We also examined the nutrient composition of PBMs compared with dairy using data from the USDA. PBMs attempt to replicate the organoleptic properties of dairy but often do not exactly match the nutrient profile of dairy. We identified a need for the application of a standardized methodology to facilitate more comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts of the wide variety of PBMs available, which are presented as environmentally preferable to dairy.",

    "abstract": "Infants born preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) often experience feeding problems during hospitalization. Whether difficulties persist or have long-term sequelae on childhood eating is unclear. We aimed to describe the oromotor eating skills (e.g., chewing/swallowing), eating behaviors (e.g., food neophobia), food parenting practices (e.g., pressure to eat), and dietary patterns of preterm children during late infancy (6–12 mo) and early childhood (>12 mo–7 y) and to determine whether these differed from those of term-born peers. We identified 67 articles (57 unique studies) for inclusion. We used random-effects meta-analysis of proportions to examine the prevalence of oromotor eating skill and eating behavior challenges among preterm children, standard meta-analysis for comparisons with term-born peers, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Forty-three percent (95% CI: 24%, 62%) of infants and 25% (95% CI: 17%, 33%) of children born preterm experienced oromotor eating difficulties and 16% (95% CI: 4%, 27%) and 20% (95% CI: 11%, 28%), respectively, exhibited challenging eating behaviors. During late infancy and early childhood, oromotor eating difficulties (OR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.71, 4.77; I2 = 67.8%) and challenging eating behaviors (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.10; I2 = 0.0%) were more common in those born preterm than in those born term: however, the certainty of evidence was very low. Owing to the low number and heterogeneity of studies, we narratively reviewed literature on food parenting and dietary patterns. Mothers of preterm infants appeared to have heightened anxiety while feeding and utilized coercive food parenting practices; their infants reportedly received less human milk, started solid foods earlier, and had poorer diet quality than term-born peers. In conclusion, meta-analyses show preterm children experience frequent oromotor eating difficulties and challenging eating behaviors throughout the early years. Given preterm birth increases risk of later obesity and diet-related chronic disease, research examining the effects of caregiver–child interactions on subsequent diet is warranted.

It serves as a central signaling node to coordinate cell growth and metabolism by sensing diverse extracellular and intracellular inputs, including amino acid-, growth factor-, glucose-, and nucleotide-related signals. It is well documented that mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosomal surface, where it is activated and, accordingly, modulates downstream effectors involved in regulating protein, lipid, and glucose metabolism. mTORC1 is thus the central node for coordinating the storage and mobilization of nutrients and energy across various tissues. However, emerging evidence indicated that the overactivation of mTORC1 induced by nutritional disorders leads to the occurrence of a variety of metabolic diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, as well as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging. That the mTORC1 pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the occurrence of metabolic diseases renders it a prime target for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Here, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying how mTORC1 integrates metabolic inputs as well as the role of mTORC1 in the regulation of nutritional and metabolic diseases.",

The aim of this umbrella review was to grade the evidence for the association between dietary factors and EC risk. A protocol for this review was registered with the PROSPERO database (CRD42021283232). Publications were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL databases. Only systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies (cohort studies, case-cohort studies, nested case-control studies) were eligible. AMSTAR-2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) was used to assess the methodological quality of included systematic reviews. For each association, random-effects pooled effect size, 95% CI, number of cases, 95% prediction interval, heterogeneity, small-study effect, and excess significance bias were calculated to grade the evidence. From 882 publications, 107 full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility, and 20 systematic reviews and meta-analyses describing 32 associations between dietary factors and EC risk were included in the present umbrella review. By assessing the strength and validity of the evidence, 1 association (positively associated with alcohol intake) was supported by highly suggestive evidence and 1 (inversely associated with calcium intake) showed a suggestive level of evidence. Evidence for 7 associations was weak (positively associated with red meat and processed-meat intake; inversely associated with whole grains, fruits, green leafy vegetables, green tea, and zinc intake). The remaining 23 associations were nonsignificant. In conclusion, the findings of this umbrella review emphasize that habitually consuming calcium, whole grains, fruits, green leafy vegetables, green tea, and zinc and reducing alcohol, red meat, and processed-meat intake are associated with a lower risk of EC. Since this umbrella review included only observational study data and some of the associations were graded as weak, caution should be exercised in interpreting these relations.",

    "abstract": "Dietary metabolomics is a relatively objective approach to identifying new biomarkers of dietary intake and for use alongside traditional methods. However, methods used across dietary feeding studies vary, thus making it challenging to compare results. To synthesize methodological components of controlled human feeding studies designed to quantify the diet-related metabolome in biospecimens, including plasma, serum, and urine following dietary interventions. Six electronic databases were searched. Included studies were (1) conducted in healthy adults; (2) intervention studies; (3) feeding studies focusing on dietary patterns; and (4) measured the dietary metabolome. From 12,425 texts, 50 met all inclusion criteria. Interventions were primarily cross-over (n=25) and parallel RCTs (n=22), with between 8 to 395 participants. Seventeen different dietary patterns were tested, with the most common being \"High versus Low Glycaemic Index/Load\" pattern (n=11) and \"Typical Country Intake\" (n=11); with 32 providing all or the majority (90%) of food, 16 providing some food, and two providing no food. Metabolites were identified in urine (n=31) and plasma/serum (n=30). Metabolites were quantified using liquid chromatography, mass spectroscopy (n=31) and used untargeted metabolomics (n=37). There was extensive variability in the methods used in controlled human feeding studies examining the metabolome, including dietary patterns tested, biospecimen sample collection, and metabolomic analysis techniques. To improve comparability and reproducibility of controlled human feeding studies examining the metabolome, it is important to provide detailed information about the dietary interventions being tested, including information about included or restricted foods, food groups, and meal plans provided. Strategies to control for individual variability, such as a cross-over study design, statistical adjustment methods, dietary-controlled run-in periods, or providing standardized meals or test foods throughout the study should also be considered.

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that the timing of introduction, types, and amounts of complementary foods/allergenic foods may influence the risk of allergic disease. However, the evidence has not been updated and comprehensively synthesized. The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed databases were searched from the inception of each database up to 31 May 2023 (articles prior to 2000 were excluded manually). Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5. The GRADE approach was followed to rate the certainty of evidence. Compared with >6 mo, early introduction of eggs (≤6 mo of age) might reduce the risk of food allergies in preschoolers aged <6 y (odds ratio [OR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53, 0.81), but had no effect on asthma or atopic dermatitis (AD). Consumption of fish at 6-12 mo might reduce the risk of asthma in children (aged 5-17 y) compared with late introduction after 12 mo (OR, 0.61; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.72). Introduction of allergenic foods for ≤6 mo of age, compared with >6 mos, was a protective factor for the future risk (children aged ≤10 y) of AD (OR, 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.97). Probiotic intervention for infants at high risk of allergic disease significantly reduced the risk of food allergy at ages 0-3 y (OR, 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.94), asthma at 6-12 y (OR, 0.61; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.90), and AD at aged <6 y (3-6 y: OR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.94; 0-3 y: OR, 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.91). Early introduction of complementary foods or the high-dose vitamin D supplementation in infancy was not associated with the risk of developing food allergies, asthma, or AD during childhood. Early introduction to potential allergen foods for normal infants or probiotics for infants at high risk of allergies may protect against development of allergic disease.

    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption remains inconsistently correlated with fracture risk, and a dose-response meta-analysis for specific outcomes is lacking. The objective of this study was to quantitatively integrate the data on the relationship between alcohol consumption and fracture risk. Pertinent articles were identified in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases up to 20 February 2022. Combined RRs and 95% CIs were estimated by random- or fixed-effects models. Restricted cubic splines were used to model linear or nonlinear relationships. Forty-four articles covering 6,069,770 participants and 205,284 cases of fracture were included. The combined RRs and 95% CIs for highest compared with lowest alcohol consumption were 1.26 (1.17-1.37), 1.24 (1.13-1.35), and 1.20 (1.03-1.40) for total, osteoporotic, and hip fractures, respectively. A linear positive relationship between alcohol consumption and total fracture risk was detected (Pnonlinearity = 0.057); the risk was correlated with a 6% increase (RR, 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.10) per 14 g/d increment of alcohol consumption. J-shaped relationships of alcohol consumption with risk of osteoporotic fractures (Pnonlinearity < 0.001) and hip fractures (Pnonlinearity < 0.001) were found. Alcohol consumption of 0 to 22 g/d was linked to a reduced risk of osteoporotic fractures and hip fractures. Our findings show that any level of alcohol consumption is a risk factor for total fractures. Moreover, this dose-response meta-analysis shows that an alcohol consumption level of 0 to 22 g/d is related to a reduction in the risk of osteoporotic and hip fractures.

    "abstract": "Nearly all approaches to personalized nutrition (PN) use information such as the gene variants of individuals to deliver advice that is more beneficial than a generic \"1-size-fits-all\" recommendation. Despite great enthusiasm and the increased availability of commercial services, thus far, scientific studies have only revealed small to negligible effects on the efficacy and effectiveness of personalized dietary recommendations, even when using genetic or other individual information. In addition, from a public health perspective, scholars are critical of PN because it primarily targets socially privileged groups rather than the general population, thereby potentially widening health inequality. Therefore, in this perspective, we propose to extend current PN approaches by creating adaptive personalized nutrition advice systems (APNASs) that are tailored to the type and timing of personalized advice for individual needs, capacities, and receptivity in real-life food environments. These systems encompass a broadening of current PN goals (i.e., what should be achieved) to incorporate \"individual goal preferences\" beyond currently advocated biomedical targets (e.g., making sustainable food choices). Moreover, they cover the \"personalization processes of behavior change\" by providing in situ, \"just-in-time\" information in real-life environments (how and when to change), which accounts for individual capacities and constraints (e.g., economic resources). Finally, they are concerned with a \"participatory dialog between individuals and experts\" (e.g., actual or virtual dieticians, nutritionists, and advisors) when setting goals and deriving measures of adaption. Within this framework, emerging digital nutrition ecosystems enable continuous, real-time monitoring, advice, and support in food environments from exposure to consumption. We present this vision of a novel PN framework along with scenarios and arguments that describe its potential to efficiently address individual and population needs and target groups that would benefit most from its implementation.",

    "abstract": "Dairy intake may influence cognition through several molecular pathways. However, epidemiologic studies yield inconsistent results, and no dose-response meta-analysis has been conducted yet. Therefore, we performed a systematic review with a dose-response meta-analysis about the association between dairy intake and cognitive decline or incidence of dementia. We investigated prospective studies with a follow-up ≥6 mo on cognitive decline or dementia incidence in adults without known chronic conditions through a systematic search of Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from inception to 11 July 2023. We evaluated the dose-response association using a random-effects model. We identified 15 eligible cohort studies with >300,000 participants and a median follow-up of 11.4 y. We observed a negative nonlinear association between cognitive decline/dementia incidence and dairy intake as assessed through the quantity of consumption, with the nadir at ∼150 g/d (risk ratio: 0.88; 95% confidence interval: 0.78, 0.99). Conversely, we found an almost linear negative association when we considered the frequency of consumption (risk ratio for linear trend: 0.84; 95% confidence interval: 0.77, 0.92 for 1 time/d increase of dairy products). Stratified analysis by dairy products showed different shapes of the association with linear inverse relationship for milk intake, whereas possibly nonlinear for cheese. The inverse association was limited to Asian populations characterized by generally lower intake of dairy products, compared with the null association reported by European studies. In conclusion, our study suggests a nonlinear inverse association between dairy intake and cognitive decline or dementia, also depending on dairy types and population characteristics, although the heterogeneity was still high in overall and several subgroup analyses. Additional studies should be performed on this topic, including a wider range of intake and types of dairy products, to confirm a potential preventing role of dairy intake on cognitive decline and identify ideal intake doses.

    "abstract": "Food fortification with micronutrients is widely implemented to reduce micronutrient deficiencies and related outcomes. Although many factors affect the success of fortification programs, high population coverage is needed to have a public health impact. We aimed to provide recent global coverage estimates of salt, wheat flour, vegetable oil, maize flour, rice, and sugar among countries with mandatory fortification legislation. The indicators were the proportion of households consuming the: food, fortifiable food (that is, industrially processed), fortified food (to any extent), and adequately fortified food (according to national or international standards). We estimated the number of individuals reached with fortified foods. We systematically retrieved and reviewed all applicable evidence from: published reports and articles from January 2010 to August 2021, survey lists/databases from key organizations, and reports/literature received from key informants. We analyzed data with R statistical package using random-effects meta-analysis models. An estimated 94.4% of households consumed salt, 78.4% consumed fortified salt (4.2 billion people), and 48.6% consumed adequately fortified salt in 64, 84, and 31 countries, respectively. Additionally, 77.4% of households consumed wheat flour, 61.6% consumed fortifiable wheat flour, and 47.1% consumed fortified wheat flour (66.2 million people) in 15, 8, and 10 countries, respectively, and 87.0% consumed vegetable oil, 86.7% consumed fortifiable oil, and 40.1% consumed fortified oil (123.9 million people) in 10, 7, and 5 countries, respectively. Data on adequately fortified wheat flour and vegetable oil and coverage indicators for maize flour, rice, and sugar were limited. There are major data gaps on fortification coverage for most foods except salt. All countries with mandatory fortification programs should generate and use more coverage data to assess program performance and adjust programs as needed to realize their potential to reduce micronutrient deficiencies (PROSPERO CRD42021269364).",

    "abstract": "The idea that increasing physical activity directly adds to TEE in humans (additive model) has been challenged by the energy constrained hypothesis (constrained model). This model proposes that increased physical activity decreases other components of metabolism to constrain TEE. There is a logical evolutionary argument for trade-offs in metabolism, but, to date, evidence supporting constraint is subject to several limitations, including cross-sectional and correlational studies with potential methodological issues from extreme differences in body size/composition and lifestyle, potential statistical issues such as regression dilution and spurious correlations, and conclusions drawn from deductive inference rather than direct observation of compensation. Addressing these limitations in future studies, ideally, randomized controlled trials should improve the accuracy of models of human energy expenditure. The available evidence indicates that in many scenarios, the effect of increasing physical activity on TEE will be mostly additive although some energy appears to \"go missing\" and is currently unaccounted for. The degree of energy balance could moderate this effect even further.",

Moderators assessed were age, BMI, percentage of body fat (%BF), macronutrient content of test meals, energy intake (kcals), sex, and ghrelin isoform (AG, DAG, or TG).The analysis included 47 studies (110 trials, n = 1799, age: 31.4 ± 12.0 y, BMI: 26.0 ± 4.75 kg/m2) and measured AG (n = 47 trials), DAG (n = 12 trials), and TG (n = 51 trials). The overall model indicated that ghrelin concentrations and perceptions of hunger were moderately correlated (r = 0.43, P < 0.001), and ghrelin isoform significantly moderated this relationship (AG: r = 0.60, P < 0.001; TG: r = 0.215, P = 0.01; DAG: r = 0.53, P = 0.695).

This perspective summarizes the evidence on food and nutrition insecurity across Europe in terms of prevalence, consequences, and current mitigation strategies, with the aim of outlining the challenges and opportunities for dietitians. Prevalence in the general population ranges between 5% and 20%, with higher rates identified in women, children, older adults, single-parent households, those with low educational attainment, and on low or unstable income and/or employment. In users of food aid, the prevalence of food insecurity is above 70%. Responses to food and nutrition insecurity include welfare policies and food assistance programs at regional and national levels. However, most current strategies are not successful in tackling the structural drivers of food and nutrition insecurity, nor do they guarantee diet quality. Despite limited involvement to-date, dietitians can play an important role in addressing food and nutrition insecurity across Europe. This narrative identifies 4 areas: 1) create awareness of the existence and severity of food and nutrition insecurity, 2) advocate for comprehensive, robust data on the determinants and prevalence, 3) partner with diverse stakeholders, social assistance providers, local authorities, and nongovernmental organizations in a comprehensive, intersectoral, and integrated manner, 4) participate in the development of political instruments and interventions that ensure equitable access to high-quality safe food.",

Herein, we propose consideration of a dietary nitrate from plant foods as a conditionally essential nutrient for cardiovascular health based on its role in nitric oxide homeostasis. Nitrate derived from plant foods may function as a conditionally essential nutrient, whereas nitrate obtained from other dietary sources, such as drinking water and cured/processed meats, warrants separate consideration because of the associated health risks. We have surveyed the literature and summarized epidemiological evidence regarding the effect of dietary nitrate on cardiovascular disease and risk factors. Meta-analyses and population-based observational studies have consistently demonstrated an inverse association of dietary nitrate with blood pressure and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Considering the available evidence, we suggest 2 different approaches to providing dietary guidance on nitrate from plant-based dietary sources as a nutrient: the Dietary Reference Intakes developed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and the dietary guidelines evaluated by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Ultimately, this proposal underscores the need for food-based dietary guidelines to capture the complex and context-dependent relationships between nutrients, particularly dietary nitrate, and health.",

    "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCD) are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with higher risk of death in low- and middle-income countries. Diet and excess weight are risk factors for NCDs. In Mexico, the prevalence of overweight and obesity increased dramatically in the last 30 years and is among the highest in the world. To address this public health problem, governments and public health professionals have several policy instruments available. In this study, we present the policy instruments currently approved in Mexico, which include fiscal, informational, and authoritative tools that aim to improve the food environment and promote healthy behaviours (taxes, school food guidelines, front of pack labelling, marketing regulations and dietary guidelines). These types of interventions are important in regions like Latin America, where social inequities and poor access to information are common, and individual healthy choices often limited. These interventions target the environments in which individuals live, study, work, and seek entertainment, while limiting access to unhealthy choices and offering information to promote healthy alternatives. The Mexican experience in design, implementation, and evaluation of policies to improve the food environment can be useful for other low and middle income countries facing similar challenges. There are a number of cost-effective policy tools that help improve the food environment and prevent non communicable diseases. In countries with vast inequalities and with food systems incentivized to produce unhealthy options, a mix of policy tools is needed to effectively modify food environments, promote healthier food choices, and prevent and control the increasing trends in obesity and non-communicable diseases. In addition, more complex, global initiatives are required to achieve the transformation of the food system.",

    "abstract": "Livelihoods have changed dramatically over the past decade in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). These shifts are happening in tandem with shifts in individual and household food choice behaviors. This scoping review aimed to identify and characterize mechanisms through which livelihood changes could affect food choice behaviors in LMIC, including behaviors relating to food production, acquisition, preparation, distribution, and consumption. A literature search was conducted using four databases: PubMed, PsycInfo, AGRICOLA, and Embase. Studies were included if they measured or focused on a livelihood change, described or assessed a change in at least one food choice behavior, and focused on LMIC contexts. Studies were excluded if they did not meet the inclusion criteria or focused on migration from LMIC to a high-income country. Of the 433 articles that were identified by the database search and expert solicitation, 53 met the inclusion criteria. Five recurring mechanisms of how livelihood change affects food choice were identified: occupation, locality, time, income, and social relations. Changes in occupation altered the balance of the availability and affordability of foods in local food environments versus individual food production. Changes in location, time use, and income influenced where food was purchased, what types of foods were acquired, and how or where foods were prepared. Additionally, altered social relationships and norms led to expanded food preferences, particularly among urban populations. Key drivers of ultra-processed food consumption included livelihood induced time limitations and higher discretionary incomes. Understanding the relationships between livelihood change and food choice may help inform future evidence-based actions in LMIC, including the development of policies, programs, and other actions to promote sustainable healthy diets and planetary health.",

    "abstract": "Iron deficiency (ID) is a common and challenging problem in adolescence. In order to prevent, recognize, and treat ID in this age range, it is critical to understand the recommended daily intake of iron in relation to an adolescent's activity, dietary habits, and basal iron losses. Adolescents following vegetarian or vegan diets exclusively rely on plant based, non-heme iron which has decreased bioavailability compared to heme iron and requires increased total iron intake. Individuals with disordered eating habits, excessive menstrual blood loss, and certain chronic health conditions (including inflammatory bowel disease and heart failure) are at high risk of ID and the development of symptomatic iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Adolescent athletes and those with sleep and movement disorders may also be more sensitive to changes in iron status. Iron deficiency is typically treated with oral iron supplementation. To maximize iron absorption, oral iron should be administered no more than once daily, ideally in the morning, while avoiding foods and drinks that inhibit iron absorption. Oral iron therapy should be provided for at least three months in the setting of ID to reach a ferritin of 20 ng/mL prior to discontinuation. Intravenous iron is being increasingly used in this population and has demonstrated efficacy and safety in adolescents. It should be considered in those with persistent ID despite a course of oral iron, in the setting of severe and/or symptomatic IDA, and chronic inflammatory conditions characterized by decreased gastrointestinal iron absorption.",

    "abstract": "Medical education faces an urgent need for evidence-based physician nutrition education. Since the publication of the 1985 National Academies report \"Nutrition Education in the United States Medical Schools,\" little has changed. Although several key efforts sought to increase nutrition content in undergraduate medical education over the past 40 y, most medical schools still fail to include the recommended minimum of 25 h of nutrition training. Without foundational concepts of nutrition in undergraduate medical education, graduate medical education unsurprisingly falls short of meeting patient needs for nutritional guidance in clinical practice. Meanwhile, diet-sensitive chronic diseases continue to escalate, although largely preventable and treatable by nutritional therapies and dietary lifestyle changes. Fortunately, recent recognition and adoption of Food is Medicine programs across the country increasingly connect patients with healthy food resources and nutrition education as core to their medical care, and physicians must be equipped to lead these efforts alongside their dietitian colleagues. Filling the gap in nutrition training will require an innovative and interprofessional approach that pairs nutrition with personal wellness, interprofessional practice, and community service learning. The intersectional benefits of connecting these domains will help prepare future physicians to address the social, behavioral, and lifestyle determinants of health in a way that recognizes nourishing food access as a core part of clinical practice. There are numerous strategies to integrate nutrition into education pathways, including didactic and experiential learning. Culinary medicine, an evidence-based field combining the culinary arts with nutritional science and medicine, is 1 promising educational framework with a hands-on, interprofessional approach that emphasizes community engagement. Advancing the critical need for widespread adoption of nutrition education for physicians will require support and engagement across societal stakeholders, including co-leadership from registered dietitian nutritionists, health system and payor reform, and opportunities for clinical innovation that bring this essential field to frontline patient care.",

    "abstract": "Vegetable oils, derived from diverse sources such as seeds, nuts, and some fruits, play a significant role in dietary health. However, the current evidence on the health effects of different types of vegetable oil consumption remains controversial. This umbrella review aims to synthesize evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses to assess the health outcomes associated with various vegetable oils. A comprehensive literature search was performed up to 31 July, 2023 on 12 databases for studies examining the association of different vegetable oils with health outcomes in adults. Data was extracted independently by 2 authors, with evidence strength assessed using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation criteria. A total of 48 studies, including 206 meta-analyses, were included. Moderate to very low certainty evidence showed that monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as canola oil, virgin olive oil, and rice bran oil are beneficial in reducing serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations. Conversely, low to very low certainty evidence suggests that oils high in saturated fats, such as coconut oil and palm oil, increase total cholesterol and LDL concentrations but also raise high-density lipoprotein concentrations. Very low certainty evidence showed the consumption of olive oil, sesame oil, and coconut oil could improve blood sugar control. Low certainty evidence showed olive oil consumption reduced risk of breast, digestive, and other cancers. Moderate to very low certainty evidence suggested that canola oil and sesame oil consumption reduced body weight. The consumption of vegetable oil appears to offer different health benefits, with summary estimates indicating beneficial effects on reducing lipid concentrations, especially with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated rich oils when consumed in recommended amounts. Future research should focus on long-term studies and comprehensive dietary assessments to better understand the health impacts of vegetable oils, providing a basis for informed dietary recommendations.

    "abstract": "Cannabis use has increased sharply in the last 20 years among adults, including reproductive-aged women. Its recent widespread legalization is associated with a decrease in risk perception of cannabis use during breastfeeding. However, the effect of cannabis use (if any) on milk production and milk composition is not known. This narrative review summarizes current knowledge related to maternal cannabis use during breastfeeding and provides an overview of possible pathways whereby cannabis might affect milk composition and production. Several studies have demonstrated that cannabinoids and their metabolites are detectable in human milk produced by mothers who use cannabis. Due to their physicochemical properties, cannabinoids are stored in adipose tissue, can easily reach the mammary gland, and can be secreted in milk. Moreover, cannabinoid receptors are present in adipocytes and mammary epithelial cells. The activation of these receptors directly modulates fatty acid metabolism, potentially causing changes in milk fatty acid profiles. Additionally, the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is intimately connected to the endocrine system. As such, it is probable that interactions of exogenous cannabinoids with the ECS might modify release of critical hormones (e.g., prolactin and dopamine) that regulate milk production and secretion. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated effects of cannabis use (including on milk production and composition) in lactating women. Additional research utilizing robust methodologies are needed to elucidate whether and how cannabis use affects human milk production and composition. To our knowledge, no review has focused on the potential effects of maternal cannabis use on human milk composition and production. The evidence provided herein supports the possibility that, through several well documented pathways, cannabinoids might alter lipid metabolism in the mammary gland, as well as milk production and secretion. Considering the recent increase in cannabis use among reproductive-aged women, this narrative review highlights the need for well designed, focused studies to address this question.",

    "abstract": "Microbiota in early life is closely associated with the health of infants, especially premature ones. Probiotics are important drivers of gut microbiota development in preterm infants; however, there is no consensus regarding the characteristics of specific microbiota in preterm infants receiving probiotics. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of 5 microbiome data sets (1816 stool samples from 706 preterm infants) to compare the gut microbiota of preterm infants exposed to probiotics with that of preterm infants not exposed to probiotics across populations. Despite study-specific variations, we found consistent differences in gut microbial composition and predicted functional pathways between the control and probiotic groups across different cohorts of preterm infants. The enrichment of Acinetobacter, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus spp and the depletion of the potentially pathogenic bacteria Finegoldia, Veillonella, and Klebsiella spp. were the most consistent changes in the gut microbiota of preterm infants supplemented with probiotics. Probiotics drove microbiome transition into multiple preterm gut community types, and notably, preterm gut community type 3 had the highest α-diversity, with enrichment of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides spp. At the functional level, the major predicted microbial pathways involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis consistently increased in preterm infants supplemented with probiotics; in contrast, the crucial pathways associated with heme biosynthesis consistently decreased. Interestingly, Bifidobacterium sp. rather than Lactobacillus sp. gradually became dominant in gut microbiota of preterm infants using mixed probiotics, although both probiotic strains were administered at the same dosage. Taken together, our meta-analysis suggests that probiotics contribute to reshaping the microbial ecosystem of preterm infants at both the taxonomic and functional levels of the bacterial community. More standardized and relevant studies may contribute to better understanding the crosstalk among probiotics, the gut microbiota, and subsequent disease risk, which could help to give timely nutritional feeding guidance to preterm infants.

    "abstract": "Isoflavones are naturally occurring compounds found in a wide range of plants, but among commonly consumed foods are especially abundant in soybeans and foods derived from this legume. Much of the substantial amount of research conducted on soy protein and soy foods over the past 30 years is because of their isoflavone content. Research interest in isoflavones increased dramatically beginning in the early 1990s as evidence highlighted their possible role in the prevention of a wide range of cancers, including breast, prostate and colon cancer. Recognition that isoflavones preferentially bind to estrogen receptor (ER)β in comparison to ERα provided a conceptual basis for classifying these diphenolic molecules as selective estrogen receptor modulators. Isoflavone research soon greatly expanded beyond cancer to include areas such as coronary artery disease, bone health, cognitive function and vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Nevertheless, safety concerns about isoflavones, based primarily on the results of animal studies and presumed estrogenic effects, also arose. However, recent work challenges the traditional view of the estrogenicity of isoflavones. Furthermore, safety concerns have largely been refuted by intervention and population studies. On the other hand, investigation of the proposed benefits of isoflavones has produced inconsistent data. The small sample size and short duration common to many intervention trials, combined with marked interindividual differences in isoflavone metabolism, likely contribute to the conflicting findings. Also, many different intervention products have been employed, which vary not only in the total amount, but also the relative proportion of the three soybean isoflavones, and the form in which they are delivered (glycoside vs aglycone). For those interested in exploring the proposed benefits of isoflavones, studies justify an intake recommendation of ∼50 mg/d, an amount provided by approximately two servings of traditional Asian soy foods.",

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to explore the association of malnutrition with sarcopenia in middle-aged and older adults and the prognostic association of malnutrition and sarcopenia vs. sarcopenia alone on all-cause mortality. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception until January 2024. A meta-analysis using a random-effect model was employed, utilizing the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) malnutrition tool as a continuous and categorical variable.

Malnutrition was significantly associated with a greater risk of sarcopenia (continuous: k = 12, odds ratio (OR): 1.38, 95% CI 1.18 - 1.61, I2 = 94.8%, P < 0.01; categorical: k = 37, OR: 2.99, 95% CI 2.26 - 3.96, I2 = 78.3%, P < 0.01).

Meta-regression showed age, sex, and number of adjustments did not explain heterogeneity among studies. The included studies had moderate risk of bias. Malnutrition is associated with a higher odds of sarcopenia and their combined presence is a better predictor of all-cause mortality compared to sarcopenia alone, further highlighting the importance of applying interventions to counteract these two closely related phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Purine nucleotide biosynthesis de novo (PNB) requires 2 folate-dependent transformylases—5′-phosphoribosyl-glycinamide (GAR) and 5′-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) transformylases—to introduce carbon 8 (C8) and carbon 2 (C2) into the purine ring. Both transformylases utilize 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-formyl-H4folate), where the formyl-carbon sources include ring-2-C of histidine, 3-C of serine, 2-C of glycine, and formate. Our findings in human studies indicate that glycine provides the carbon for GAR transformylase (exclusively C8), whereas histidine and formate are the predominant carbon sources for AICAR transformylase (C2). Contrary to the previous notion, these carbon sources may not supply a general 10-formyl-H4folate pool, which was believed to equally provide carbons to C8 and C2. To explain these phenomena, we postulate that GAR transformylase is in a complex with the trifunctional folate-metabolizing enzyme (TFM) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase to channel carbons of glycine and serine to C8. There is no evidence for channeling carbons of histidine and formate to AICAR transformylase (C2). GAR transformylase may require the TFM to furnish 10-formyl-H4folate immediately after its production from serine to protect its oxidation to 10-formyldihydrofolate (10-formyl-H2folate), whereas AICAR transformylase can utilize both 10-formyl-H2folate and 10-formyl-H4folate. Human liver may supply AICAR to AICAR transformylase in erythrocytes/erythroblasts. Incorporation of ring-2-C of histidine and formate into C2 of urinary uric acid presented a circadian rhythm with a peak in the morning, which corresponds to the maximum DNA synthesis in the bone marrow, and it may be useful in the timing of the administration of drugs that block PNB for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease.",

    "abstract": "Dyslipidemias have been shown to bear a close association with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis in particular. As efforts are being made to find alternative therapies and ways to prevent disease, there is a corresponding rise in public interest in food and/or active food components that contribute to an improved lipid profile and, thus, to better health. Besides supplying the basic nutrients necessary for well-being, some foods add further physiologic benefits. In fact, specific foods and bioactive components could be beneficial in controlling dyslipidemias. From a review of the literature on foods and bioactive compounds, their recommended quantities, and expected effects, we found that the following nutrients and food components could positively impact the lipid profile: monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, soluble fiber, vegetable proteins, phytosterols, and polyphenols. Therefore, incorporating these components into the regular diets of individuals is justified, because they contribute additional positive effects. This suggests that they also be recommended in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the impact of school-based nutrition interventions, accurate and reliable methods are needed to assess what children eat at school. The primary objective of this study was to systematically review methodological evidence on the relative accuracy and reliability of dietary assessment methods used in the school context. The secondary objective was to assess the frequency of methods and analytical approaches used in studies reporting in-school dietary outcomes. Three health databases were searched for full-text English-language studies. Twenty-two methodological studies were reviewed. For school meal recalls, the majority of studies (n = 8 of 12) reported poor accuracy when accuracy was measured by using frequencies of misreported foods. However, when energy report rates were used as a measure of accuracy, studies suggested that children were able to accurately report energy intake as a group. Results regarding the accuracy of food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and food records (FRs) were promising but limited to a single study each. Meal observations offered consistently good interrater reliability across all studies reviewed (n = 11). Studies reporting in-school dietary outcomes (n = 47) used a broad range of methods, but the most frequently used methods included weighed FRs (n = 12), school meal recalls (n = 10), meal observations by trained raters (n = 8), and estimated FRs (n = 7). The range of dietary components was greater among studies relying on school meal recalls and FRs than among studies using FFQs. Overall, few studies have measured the accuracy of dietary assessment methods in the school context. Understanding the methodological characteristics associated with dietary instruments is vital for improving the quality of the evidence used to inform and evaluate the impact of school-based nutrition policies and programs.",

    "abstract": "Evidence-based dietary guidance in the United States has progressed substantially since its inception >100 y ago. This review describes the historical development and significance of dietary guidance in the United States, including the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs), and emphasizes the foundations upon which they were developed, the process in the formation of past and current guidelines, and present and future applications. Dietary guidance during the first half of the 20th century was focused primarily on food groups in a healthy diet, food safety, safe food storage, and the role of some minerals and vitamins in the prevention of disease. This was punctuated by World War II messaging to reduce food waste and increase food storage. In 1980, the first DGA report was released, and later, the USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) were given a mandate for reissuance and reassessment every 5 y. An ad hoc advisory committee made up of nongovernmental experts was established for each edition to review the scientific evidence and provide content recommendations to the Secretaries of the USDA and the HHS. Wording was changed from negative (avoid) to positive (choose) and emphasis was increasingly placed on reducing the prevalence of overweight and obesity and prevention of chronic diseases. Today, the DGAs guide all federally funded feeding and educational programs, including food policies, food assistance programs, and consumer education programs, as well as these programs at the regional, state, and local levels. Additional users include dietitians and other health professionals, food service personnel, food and beverage manufacturers, schools, and day care facilities. Currently, the DGAs are intended for individuals aged ≥2 y. Future editions of the DGAs will include guidance for infants and children <2 y, as well as pregnant women.",

Consumers report that they seek information on nutrition and healthy eating, but most are not paying attention to dietary recommendations. For guidance to be effective, it must be realistic. Even with increasingly detailed nutrition information and evidence that diet affects health outcomes, convenience and taste remain the strongest determinants of food choices. It is up to health educators to clear up confusion and give consumers control with nutrition messages that are realistic, positive, easy to understand, and actionable without an expectation that consumers will surrender foods they love.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin A in human milk is critical for meeting infant requirements and building liver stores needed after weaning. A number of studies have measured milk retinol, but only a subset have corrected for fat, which serves as the retinol carrier in breast milk. The purpose of the present work was to review and analyze studies in which human-milk retinol concentrations were reported in relation to milk fat and to compare these results with unadjusted breast-milk retinol concentrations in terms of time trends over the course of lactation, influences of maternal nutritional and constitutional factors, and effects of maternal vitamin A supplementation. A systematic approach was used to search the available literature by using the US National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE/PubMed bibliographic search engine. Observational and intervention studies were included if the research was original and the retinol-to-fat ratio (retinol:fat) in human milk was measured at ≥1 time point during the first 12 mo of lactation. Retinol:fat and retinol were highest in colostrum, declined rapidly in early lactation, and achieved statistical stability by 2 and 4 wk lactation, respectively. In mature milk, retinol concentration was positively correlated with milk fat (r = 0.61, P = 0.008). Breast-milk retinol:fat and retinol were positively associated with maternal vitamin A intake but were associated with plasma retinol only when dietary intake was inadequate. Postpartum supplementation with high-dose vitamin A (200,000-400,000 IU) resulted in significantly higher breast-milk retinol:fat for 3 mo and retinol for 6 mo (P < 0.05). In populations, the 2 indexes show similar trends and associations with maternal factors. Future studies should monitor how the uptake of retinol into the mammary gland affects maternal vitamin reserves, particularly in women who are at risk of vitamin A deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Dietary guidelines commonly recommend that children aged >2 y consume reduced-fat dairy products rather than regular- or whole-fat dairy. In adults, most studies have not found the consumption of whole-fat dairy products to be associated with increased cardiometabolic or adiposity risk. Associations in children could differ due to growth and development. We systematically reviewed the literature in indexed, peer-reviewed journals to summarize pediatric studies (children aged from 2 to 18 y) assessing associations between whole- and reduced-fat dairy intake and measures of adiposity as well as biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease risk, including the serum lipid profile, blood pressure, low-grade chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and measures of glucose homeostasis. For the purposes of this review, a \"whole-fat\" dairy product was defined as a product with the natural fat content, whereas a \"reduced-fat\" dairy product was defined as a product with some or all of the fat removed (including \"low-fat\" and \"skim\" versions). A total of 29 journal articles met our criteria for inclusion. The majority were conducted in the United States and were prospective or cross-sectional observational studies, with only 1 randomized controlled trial. Studies were consistent in reporting that whole-fat dairy products were not associated with increased measures of weight gain or adiposity. Most evidence indicated that consumption of whole-fat dairy was not associated with increased cardiometabolic risk, although a change from whole-fat to reduced-fat dairy improved outcomes for some risk factors in 1 study. Taken as a whole, the limited literature in this field is not consistent with dietary guidelines recommending that children consume preferably reduced-fat dairy products. High-quality randomized controlled trials in children that directly compare the effects of whole-fat compared with reduced-fat dairy intake on measures of adiposity or biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease risk are needed to provide better quality evidence in this area.",

    "abstract": "Various global public health agencies recommend minimizing exposure to sweet-tasting foods or beverages. The underlying rationale is that reducing exposure to the perception of sweet tastes, without regard to the source of sweetness, may reduce preferences for sweetness, added sugar intake, caloric intake, and body weight. However, the veracity of this sequence of outcomes has yet to be documented, as revealed by findings from recent systematic reviews on the topic. Efforts to examine and document the effects of sweetness exposure are needed to support evidence-based recommendations. They require a generally agreed-upon methodology for measuring sweetness in foods, beverages, and the overall diet. Although well-established sensory evaluation techniques exist for individual foods in laboratory settings, they are expensive and time-consuming, and agreement on the optimal approach for measuring the sweetness of the total diet is lacking. If such a measure could be developed, it would permit researchers to combine data from different studies and populations and facilitate the design and conduct of new studies to address unresolved research questions about dietary sweetness. This narrative review includes an overview of available sensory techniques, their strengths and limitations, recent efforts to measure the sweetness of foods and diets across countries and cultures, and a proposed future direction for improving methods for measuring sweetness toward developing the data required to support evidence-based recommendations around dietary sweetness.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects many people worldwide. Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common and most studied type of epilepsy, but the pathological mechanisms underlying this condition are poorly understood. More than 20 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been developed and used for the treatment of epilepsy; however, 30% of patients still experience uncontrolled epilepsy and associated comorbidities, which impair their quality of life. In addition, various side effects have been reported for AEDs, such as drowsiness, unsteadiness, dizziness, blurred or double vision, tremor (shakiness), greater risk of infections, bruising, and bleeding. Thus, critical medical needs remain unmet for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. Flavonoids belong to a subclass of polyphenols that are widely present in fruits, vegetables, and certain beverages. Recently, many studies have reported that some flavonoids elicit various beneficial effects in patients with epilepsy without causing the side effects associated with conventional medical therapies. Moreover, flavonoids may have a property of regulating microRNA expression associated with inflammation and cell survival. These findings suggest that flavonoids, which are more effective but impose fewer adverse effects than conventional AEDs, could be used in the treatment of epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies regarding the putative associations between dietary intake of homocysteine metabolism-related B-vitamins (vitamin B-6, folate, and vitamin B-12) and stroke risk have yielded inconsistent results. Thus, we conducted a systematic meta-analysis of prospective studies in order to examine the relation between the dietary (from diet and supplements) intake of these B-vitamins and the risk of stroke. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles published through to 25 February, 2020, and RR of stroke in relation to dietary intake of vitamin B-6, folate, and vitamin B-12 were pooled using a random-effects model. Eleven publications of 12 prospective studies comprising 389,938 participants and 10,749 cases were included in the final analysis. We found that dietary intake of vitamin B-6 and folate were associated with a reduced risk of stroke, and this inverse association remained significant in studies with >10 y of follow-up periods and among participants without a pre-existing stroke event. A dose-response analysis revealed a linear inverse association between folate and vitamin B-6 intake and the risk of stroke, with a pooled RR of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90–0.98) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89–0.99) for each 100 μg/d increment in folate intake and 0.5 mg/d increment in vitamin B-6 intake, respectively. In contrast, we found no significant association between dietary vitamin B-12 intake and the risk of stroke, with an RR of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.97–1.06) per 3 μg/d increase. In conclusion, our findings suggest that increased intake of vitamin B-6 and folate is associated with a reduced risk of stroke, supporting the notion that increasing habitual folate and vitamin B-6 intake may provide a small but beneficial effect with respect to stroke.",

    "abstract": "Sphingomyelin (SM) is a widely occurring sphingolipid that is a major plasma membrane constituent. Milk and dairy products are rich SM sources, and human milk has high SM content. Numerous studies have evaluated the roles of SM in maintaining cell membrane structure and cellular signal transduction. There has been a growing interest in exploring the role of dietary SM, especially from human milk, in imparting health benefits. This review focuses on recent publications regarding SM content in several dietary sources and dietary SM metabolism. SM digestion and absorption are slow and incomplete and mainly occur in the middle sections of the small intestine. This review also evaluates the effect of dietary SM on gut health and cognitive development. Studies indicate that SM may promote gut health by reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption in adults. However, there has been a lack of data supporting clinical trials. An association between milk SM and neural development is evident before childhood. Hence, additional studies and well-designed randomized controlled trials that incorporate dietary SM evaluation, SM metabolism, and its long-term functions on infants and children are required.",

    "abstract": "High-glycemic index (high-GI) foods (so-called fast carbs) have been hypothesized to promote fat storage and increase risk of obesity. To clarify whether dietary GI impacts body weight, we searched PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for observational studies reporting associations between BMI and dietary GI, and for meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low-GI and high-GI diets for weight loss. Data on 43 cohorts from 34 publications, totaling 1,940,968 adults, revealed no consistent differences in BMI when comparing the highest with the lowest dietary GI groups. In the 27 cohort studies that reported results of statistical comparisons, 70% showed that BMI was either not different between the highest and lowest dietary GI groups (12 of 27 cohorts) or that BMI was lower in the highest dietary GI group (7 of 27 cohorts). Results of 30 meta-analyses of RCTs from 8 publications demonstrated that low-GI diets were generally no better than high-GI diets for reducing body weight or body fat. One notable exception is that low-GI diets with a dietary GI at least 20 units lower than the comparison diet resulted in greater weight loss in adults with normal glucose tolerance but not in adults with impaired glucose tolerance. While carbohydrate quality, including GI, impacts many health outcomes, GI as a measure of carbohydrate quality appears to be relatively unimportant as a determinant of BMI or diet-induced weight loss. Based on results from observational cohort studies and meta-analyses of RCTs, we conclude that there is scant scientific evidence that low-GI diets are superior to high-GI diets for weight loss and obesity prevention.",

    "abstract": "A protective role for vitamin K in cardiovascular disease (CVD), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, has been proposed because vitamin K-dependent proteins, such as matrix Gla (γ-carboxyglutamic acid) protein (MGP), are present in vascular tissue. MGP functions as a vascular calcification inhibitor-but only when it is carboxylated, which requires vitamin K. There is more than one naturally occurring form of vitamin K. Phylloquinone (vitamin K1) is found in plant-based foods, whereas menaquinones (vitamin K2) are a class of vitamin K compounds found in animal-based and fermented foods. Phylloquinone and menaquinones are capable of carboxylating MGP and other vitamin K-dependent proteins. In rodent models, high intakes of either phylloquinone or menaquinone reduced vascular calcification. Evidence of the relative importance of phylloquinone and menaquinone to CVD in humans is limited and controversial. In some observational studies, higher dietary menaquinone intake, but not phylloquinone intake, was associated with less coronary artery calcification (a subclinical manifestation of CVD) and a lower risk for clinical CVD events. These findings have led to claims that menaquinones have unique cardiovascular health benefits compared with phylloquinone. However, this claim is not supported by the results of the limited number of intervention trials conducted to date. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding the role of vitamin K in vascular calcification, CVD, and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Seventeen per cent of the world's population is estimated to be at risk of inadequate zinc intake, which could in part be addressed by zinc fortification of widely consumed foods. We conducted a review of efficacy and effectiveness studies to ascertain the effect of zinc fortification [postharvest fortification of an industrially produced food or beverage; alone or with multiple micronutrients (MMN)] on a range of health outcomes. Previous reviews have required that the effect of zinc be isolated; because zinc is always cofortified with MMN in existing fortification programs, we did not impose this condition. Outcomes assessed were zinc-related biomarkers (plasma or serum, hair or urine zinc concentrations, comet assay, plasma fatty acid concentrations, and the proportion of and total zinc absorbed in the intestine from the diet), child anthropometry, morbidity, mortality, cognition, plasma or serum iron and copper concentrations, and for observational studies, a change in consumption of the food vehicle. Fifty-nine studies were included in the review; 54 in meta-analyses, totaling 73 comparisons. Zinc fortification with and without MMN increased plasma zinc concentrations (efficacy, n = 27: 4.68 μg/dL; 95% CI: 2.62-6.75; effectiveness, n = 13: 6.28 μg/dL; 95% CI: 5.03-7.77 μg/dL) and reduced the prevalence of zinc deficiency (efficacy, n = 11: OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.60-0.96; effectiveness, n = 10: OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.31-0.64). There were statistically significant increases in child weight (efficacy, n = 11: 0.43 kg, 95% CI: 0.11-0.75 kg), improvements in short-term auditory memory (efficacy, n = 3: 0.32 point, 95% CI: 0.13-0.50 point), and decreased incidence of diarrhea (efficacy, n = 3: RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68-0.92) and fever (efficacy, n = 2: RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.97). However, these effects cannot be solely attributed to zinc. Our review found that zinc fortification with or without MMN reduced the prevalence of zinc deficiency and may provide health and functional benefits, including a reduced incidence of diarrhea.",

    "abstract": "Little is known of the impact of individual SFAs and their isoenergetic substitution with other SFAs or unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) on the prevention of cardiometabolic disease (CMD). This systematic literature review assessed the impact of such dietary substitutions on a range of fasting CMD risk markers, including lipid profile, markers of glycemic control and inflammation, and metabolic hormone concentrations. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigated the effect of isoenergetic replacements of individual dietary SFAs for ≥14 d on ≥1 CMD risk markers in humans. Searches of the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases on 14 February, 2021 identified 44 RCTs conducted in participants with a mean ± SD age of 39.9 ± 15.2 y. Studies' risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2.0 for RCTs. Random-effect meta-analyses assessed the effect of ≥3 similar dietary substitutions on the same CMD risk marker. Other dietary interventions were described in qualitative syntheses. We observed reductions in LDL-cholesterol concentrations after the replacement of palmitic acid (16:0) with UFAs (-0.36 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.50, -0.21 mmol/L; I2 = 96.0%, n = 18 RCTs) or oleic acid (18:1n-9) (-0.16 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.28, -0.03 mmol/L; I2 = 89.6%, n = 9 RCTs), with a similar impact on total cholesterol and apoB concentrations. No effects on other CMD risk markers, including HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glucose, insulin, or C-reactive protein concentrations, were evident. Similarly, we found no evidence of a benefit from replacing dietary stearic acid (18:0) with UFAs on CMD risk markers (n = 4 RCTs). In conclusion, the impact of replacing dietary palmitic acid with UFAs on lipid biomarkers is aligned with current public health recommendations. However, owing to the high heterogeneity and limited studies, relations between all individual SFAs and biomarkers of cardiometabolic health need further confirmation from RCTs.

    "abstract": "Although the association of dietary inflammatory potential, evaluated by the dietary inflammatory index (DII), with all-cause and cause-specific mortality has been reported, evidence remains equivocal, with no relevant dose-response meta-analysis having been conducted. To examine the dose-response association of dietary inflammatory potential with risk of all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched up to August 9, 2021. Cohort studies were included if DII was reported as ≥3 levels or per incremental increase, and if the associations of DII with all-cause, cancer, and CVD mortality were assessed. Generalized least squares regression was used to estimate study-specific dose-response associations, and the random effect model was used to pool the RRs and 95% CIs of all-cause, cancer, and CVD mortality per 1-unit increase in DII. Restricted cubic splines were used to intuitively display the dose-response association between dietary inflammatory potential and mortality. Of the 1415 studies retrieved, 15 articles (17 cohort studies involving 397,641 participants) were included in this meta-analysis. With per 1-unit increase in DII, the risks were significantly increased for all-cause mortality (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.05, I2 = 51.8%; P-heterogeneity = 0.009), cancer mortality (RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.04, I2 = 58.6%; P-heterogeneity = 0.013), and CVD mortality (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.06, I2 = 85.7%; P-heterogeneity <0.001), respectively. Restricted cubic splines showed significant positive linear associations between DII and the above 3 outcomes. Our study indicated that proinflammatory diets can increase the risk of all-cause, cancer, and CVD mortality in a linear manner.",

    "abstract": "The EAT-Lancet Commission's planetary health guidelines suggest a reduction in the consumption of animal-source foods (ASFs) for better health and more sustainable food systems. ASFs are highly nutrient dense, therefore suited to address the widespread issue of micronutrient deficiencies, particularly in low-resource settings where diets are predominantly plant based. ASFs are also believed to contain the meat factor, a substance enhancing the absorption of micronutrients from plant-based foods. We conducted a scoping review with the objective of systematically mapping the available evidence on the meat factor. The MEDLINE/PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for literature published up to September 2021. Articles eligible for inclusion were all studies assessing the effect of adding ASFs and/or ASF fractions on micronutrient absorption from a plant-based meal or the overall diet in animal models and human subjects. Screening and data extraction were performed, and results were charted into 12 categories. We identified 77 articles eligible for inclusion, 52 of which were conducted in human subjects, 24 in animal models, and 1 in both. The addition of muscle tissue and muscle tissue fractions to single plant-based meals steadily increased absorption of iron and zinc across studies. The efficacy of the meat factor in increasing iron and zinc absorption in the overall diet is less clear. No clear differences emerged between red meat, poultry, and fish in promoting the meat factor effect. No clear evidence indicates that milk and egg products contain the meat factor. Our review highlights the importance of muscle tissue for the potential of the meat factor to enhance absorption of micronutrients of concern. Although the literature supports including sustainable and economically accessible forms of these ASFs into the diet, we found limited studies in resource-poor countries and of diets with low meat intake.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation on blood pressure (BP). However, the optimal intake of CoQ10 for BP regulation in patients with cardiometabolic disorders is unknown, and its effect on circulating CoQ10 is also unclear. We aimed to assess the dose-response relation between CoQ10 and BP, and quantify the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on the concentration of circulating CoQ10 by synthesizing available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A comprehensive literature search was performed in 3 databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library) to 21 March, 2022. A novel 1-stage restricted cubic spline regression model was used to evaluate the nonlinear dose-response relation between CoQ10 and BP. Twenty-six studies comprising 1831 subjects were included in our meta-analysis. CoQ10 supplementation significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-4.77 mmHg, 95% CI: -6.57, -2.97) in patients with cardiometabolic diseases; this reduction was accompanied by a 1.62 (95% CI: 1.26, 1.97) μg/mL elevation of circulating CoQ10 compared with the control group. Subgroup analyses revealed that the effects of reducing SBP were more pronounced in patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia and in studies with longer durations (>12 wk). Importantly, a U-shaped dose-response relation was observed between CoQ10 supplementation and SBP level, with an approximate dose of 100-200 mg/d largely reducing SBP (χ2 = 10.84, Pnonlinearity = 0.004). The quality of evidence was rated as moderate, low, and very low for SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and circulating CoQ10 according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach (GRADE), respectively. The current finding demonstrated that the clinically beneficial effects of CoQ10 supplementation may be attributed to the reduction in SBP, and 100-200 mg/d of CoQ10 supplementation may achieve the greatest benefit on SBP in patients with cardiometabolic diseases.

    "abstract": "Comprehensive metrics that provide a measure of dietary patterns at global and national levels are needed to inform and assess the effectiveness of policy actions that promote sustainable healthy diets. In 2019, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization reported 16 guiding principles of sustainable healthy diets, but it is still unknown how these principles are considered in dietary metrics. This scoping review aimed to explore how principles of sustainable healthy diets are considered in dietary metrics used worldwide. Forty-eight food-based, investigator-defined dietary pattern metrics assessing diet quality in free-living, healthy populations at the individual or household level were assessed against the 16 guiding principles of sustainable healthy diets, which was used as a theoretical framework. A strong adherence of the metrics to health-related guiding principles was found. Metrics had a weak adherence to principles related to environmental and sociocultural aspects of diets, except for the principle related to diets being culturally appropriate. No existing dietary metric captures all principles of sustainable healthy diets. Notably, the significance food processing, environmental, and sociocultural aspects of diets are generally understated. This likely reflects the lack of focus on these aspects in current dietary guidelines, which highlights the importance of including these emerging topics in future dietary recommendations. The absence of quantitative metrics that comprehensively measure sustainable healthy diets limits the body of evidence that would otherwise inform national and international guideline developments. Our findings can help grow the quantity and quality of the body of evidence available to inform policy activities to realize 2030 Sustainable Development Goals of multiple United Nations.

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of food and nutrition information requires new ways of data sharing and dissemination. Interactive platforms integrating data portals and visualization dashboards have been effectively utilized to describe, monitor, and track information related to food and nutrition; however, a comprehensive evaluation of emerging interactive systems is lacking. We conducted a systematic review on publicly available dashboards using a set of 48 evaluation metrics for data integrity, completeness, granularity, visualization quality, and interactivity based on 4 major principles: evidence, efficiency, emphasis, and ethics. We evaluated 13 dashboards, summarized their characteristics, strengths, and limitations, and provided guidelines for developing nutrition dashboards. We applied mixed effects models to summarize evaluation results adjusted for interrater variability. The proposed metrics and evaluation principles help to improve data standardization and harmonization, dashboard performance and usability, broaden information and knowledge sharing among researchers, practitioners, and decision makers in the field of food and nutrition, and accelerate data literacy and communication.",

    "abstract": "The association between egg consumption and mortality is extremely debatable. This study aimed to investigate the potential dose-response association of egg consumption with risk of mortality from all causes and cause-specific in the general population. The primary comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Embase up to March 2021, as well as reference lists of relevant original papers and key journals. We calculated summary RRs and their 95% CIs for the highest and lowest categories, as well as the linear trend estimation of egg intake, using the random-effects model. Thirty-three (32 publications) cohort studies were included. These studies enrolled 2,216,720 participants and recorded 232,408 deaths from all causes. Comparing highest versus lowest egg intake categories was not associated with the risk of mortality from all causes (RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.11; n = 25), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.87, 1.23, n = 11), coronary heart disease (CHD) (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.16; n = 10), stroke (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.02; n = 9), and respiratory disease (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.71; n = 3); however, it was associated with a higher risk of cancer mortality (RR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.39; n = 13). In the linear dose-response analysis, an additional intake of 1 egg per week was associated with a 2% and 4% increased risk of all-cause and cancer mortality, respectively, and a 4% decreased risk of stroke mortality. The certainty of the evidence was rated as low to moderate. Higher egg consumption was not associated with an increased risk of mortality from all causes, CVD, CHD, stroke, or respiratory disease, whereas an elevated risk was observed for cancer mortality. These findings suggest that eggs be consumed in low to moderate amounts (≤1 egg/d) as part of a healthy diet.",

    "abstract": "The immune system is weakened by advancing age, often referred to as immunosenescence, increasing the vulnerability to, and frequently the severity of, infectious diseases in older people. This has become very apparent in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for which older people are at higher risk of severe outcomes, even those who are fully vaccinated. Aging affects both the innate and adaptive immune systems and is characterized by an imbalanced inflammatory response. Increasing evidence shows that optimal status of nutrients such as vitamins C, D, and E and selenium and zinc as well as the omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids DHA and EPA can help compensate for these age-related changes. While inadequate intakes of these nutrients are widespread in the general population, this is often more pronounced in older people. Maintaining adequate intakes is a challenge for them due to a range of factors such as physical, physiological, and cognitive changes; altered absorption; and the presence of noncommunicable diseases. While nutritional requirements are ideally covered by a balanced diet, this can be difficult to achieve, particularly for older people. Fortified foods and nutritional complements are effective in achieving adequate micronutrient intakes and should be considered as a safe and cost-effective means for older people to improve their nutritional status and hence support their defense against infections. Complementing the diet with a combination of micronutrients, particularly those playing a key role in the immune system such as vitamins C, D, and E and selenium and zinc as well as DHA and EPA, is recommended for older people. Optimal nutrition to support the immune system in older people will remain essential, particularly in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic and, thus, developing strategies to ensure adequate nutrition for the growing number of older adults will be an important and cost-effective investment in the future.",

    "abstract": "A large body of evidence exists on diet and cardiovascular mortality, but limited studies have investigated the long-term intake of food groups, which may have cumulative effects on cardiovascular health in the long term. This review therefore evaluated the relationship between the long-term consumption of 10 food groups and cardiovascular mortality. We conducted a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and Web of Science till January 2022. Of the 5318 studies initially identified, 22 studies with a total of 70,273 participants with cardiovascular mortality were included. Summary HRs and 95% CIs were estimated using a random effects model. We found that a long-term high intake of whole grains (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.95; P = 0.001), fruits and vegetables (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.85; P < 0.0001), and nuts (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.81; P < 0.00001) significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality. Each 10-gram increase in whole grain consumption per day was associated with a 4% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular mortality, whereas each 10-gram increase in red/processed meat consumption per day was associated with a 1.8% increase in the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Compared with the lowest intake category, red/processed meat consumption in the highest category was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.39; P = 0.006). High intake of dairy products (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.34; P = 0.28), and legumes (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.38; P = 0.53) were not associated with cardiovascular mortality. However, in the dose-response analysis, each 10-gram increase in legume intake per week was associated with a 0.5% reduction in cardiovascular mortality. We conclude that the long-term high intake of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and a low intake of red/processed meat are associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality. More data on the long-term effects of legumes on cardiovascular mortality are encouraged. This study was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42020214679.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient profiling (NP) models are useful for characterizing the healthfulness of foods, and for underpinning various nutrition-related public health strategies. Recently, there has been a rapid increase in the number of NP models developed by different organizations worldwide. A systematic review (SR) summarizing the key characteristics of NP models with applications in government-led nutrition policies was carried out in 2016 and published by Labonté et al. (Adv Nutr, 2018). Given the continuous proliferation of NP models, the current study aimed to update this SR. Systematic searches were performed in databases of both the peer-reviewed (n=7) and grey (n=1) literature, to identify publications related to NP published between May 2016 and September 2020. The full text of relevant publications was assessed independently by two reviewers to build a list of potential models. Each model was classified as \"already identified in the original SR\" or as \"newly identified\". The eligibility of the \"newly identified\" models, and of some models excluded from the previous SR because their details were not known at that time, were then assessed independently by two reviewers based on pre-established criteria. A total of 151 potential NP models were assessed for eligibility, of which 93 were \"newly identified\", 28 were originally excluded from the previous SR, and 30 were identified from additional online searches during the eligibility assessment stage. Twenty-six models met the inclusion criteria. Their most frequent applications were food labeling (n=17) and regulation of food marketing to children (n=7). They all included nutrients to limit, with sodium, saturated fat and total sugars being the most frequently considered. Content or face validity testing was conducted for 11 (42%) of the included models. As NP models are increasingly used worldwide to support public health strategies, having an up-to-date resource listing them and detailing their characteristics is crucial.

    "abstract": "Carotenoids appear to have anticancer effects. Prospective evidence for the relation between serum carotenoids and breast cancer is controversial. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the link between circulating carotenoids and the risk of breast cancer. We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to 30 November, 2022. Prospective studies on adults aged ≥18 y that have reported risk estimates for the association between circulating carotenoids and breast cancer risk were considered. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A random-effects model was used for combining studies' risk estimates. Dose-response relations were explored through a 1-stage random-effects model. Fifteen publications (17 nested case-control studies and 1 cohort study) with 20,188 participants and 7608 cases were included. We observed an inverse association between the highest level of circulating total carotenoids (relative risk [RR]: 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62, 0.93; n = 8), α-carotene (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.87; n = 13), β-carotene (RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.98; n = 15), β-cryptoxanthin (RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.96; n = 11), lycopene (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.98; n = 13), and lutein (RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.93; n = 6) and the risk of breast cancer compared with the lowest level. Additionally, each 10 μg/dL of total carotenoids, α-carotene, β-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin was associated with 2%, 22%, 4%, and 10% lower risk of breast cancer, respectively. This relationship was stronger at lower levels of total carotenoids and β-cryptoxanthin. The certainty of evidence was rated from very low to low. Most studies were performed among Western nations, which should be acknowledged for extrapolation of findings. Total circulating carotenoids, α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein seem to be related to a decreased risk of breast cancer. Our findings could have practical importance for public health. This study was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42023434983.",

Both F and I are halogens, and it has been suggested that F may interfere with the role of I in thyroid function. We provide a scoping review of the literature on I and F exposure dur pregnancy and their individual effects on thyroid function and offspring neurodevelopment. We first discuss I intake and status in pregnancy and the relationship to thyroid function and offspring neurodevelopment. We follow with the F in pregnancy and offspring neurodevelopment.

    "abstract": "Nutrient databases are a critical component of nutrition science and the basis of exciting new research in precision nutrition (PN). To identify the most critical components needed for improvement of nutrient databases, food composition data were analyzed for quality, with completeness being the most important measure, and for FAIRness, how well the data conformed with the data science criteria of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Databases were judged complete if they provided data for all 15 nutrition fact panel (NFP) nutrient measures and all 40 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) essential nutrient measures for each food listed. Using the gold standard the USDA standard reference (SR) Legacy database as surrogate, it was found that SR Legacy data were not complete for either NFP or NASEM nutrient measures. In addition, phytonutrient measures in the 4 USDA Special Interest Databases were incomplete. To evaluate data FAIRness, a set of 175 food and nutrient data sources were collected from worldwide. Many opportunities were identified for improving data FAIRness, including creating persistent URLs, prioritizing usable data storage formats, providing Globally Unique Identifiers for all foods and nutrients, and implementing citation standards. This review demonstrates that despite important contributions from the USDA and others, food and nutrient databases in their current forms do not yet provide truly comprehensive food composition data. We propose that to enhance the quality and usage of food and nutrient composition data for research scientists and those fashioning various PN tools, the field of nutrition science must step out of its historical comfort zone and improve the foundational nutrient databases used in research by incorporating data science principles, the most central being data quality and data FAIRness.",

    "abstract": "Probiotic supplementation is a potential therapeutic for metabolic diseases, including obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and type 2 diabetes (T2D), but most studies deliver multiple species of bacteria in addition to prebiotics or oral pharmaceuticals. This may contribute to conflicting evidence in existing meta-analyses of probiotics in these populations and warrants a systematic review of the literature to assess the contribution of a single probiotic genus to better understand the contribution of individual probiotics to modulate blood glucose. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies and human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effects of Bifidobacterium (BF) probiotic supplementation on markers of glycemia. In a meta-analysis of 6 RCTs, BF supplementation had no effect on fasting blood glucose {FBG; mean difference [MD] = -1.99 mg/dL [95% confidence interval (CI): -4.84, 0.86], P = 0.13}, and there were no subgroup differences between subjects with elevated FBG concentrations and normoglycemia. However, BF supplementation reduced FBG concentrations in a meta-analysis comprised of studies utilizing animal models of obesity, MetS, or T2D [n = 16; MD = -36.11 mg/dL (CI: -49.04, -23.18), P < 0.0001]. Translational gaps from animal to human trials include paucity of research in female animals, BF supplementation in subjects that were normoglycemic, and lack of methodologic reporting regarding probiotic viability and stability. More research is necessary to assess the effects of BF supplementation in human subjects with elevated FBG concentrations. Overall, there was consistent evidence of the efficacy of BF probiotics to reduce elevated FBG concentrations in animal models but not clinical trials, suggesting that BF alone may have minimal effects on glycemic control, may be more effective when combined with multiple probiotic species, or may be more effective in conditions of hyperglycemia rather than elevated FBG concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Migraine is a highly prevalent neurologic disorder with prevalence rates ranging from 9% to 18% worldwide. Current pharmacologic prophylactic strategies for migraine have limited efficacy and acceptability, with relatively low response rates of 40% to 50% and limited safety profiles. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are considered promising therapeutic agents for migraine prophylaxis. The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to compare the efficacy and acceptability of various dosages of EPA/DHA and other current Food and Drug Administration–approved or guideline-recommended prophylactic pharmacologic interventions for migraine. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion if they enrolled participants with a diagnosis of either episodic or chronic migraine. All NMA procedures were conducted under the frequentist model. The primary outcomes assessed were 1) changes in migraine frequency and 2) acceptability (i.e., dropout for any reason). Secondary outcomes included response rates, changes in migraine severity, changes in the frequency of using rescue medications, and frequency of any adverse events. Forty RCTs were included (N = 6616; mean age = 35.0 y; 78.9% women). Our analysis showed that supplementation with high dosage EPA/DHA yields the highest decrease in migraine frequency [standardized mean difference (SMD): −1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): −2.32, −0.39 compared with placebo] and the largest decrease in migraine severity (SMD: −2.23; 95% CI: −3.17, −1.30 compared with placebo) in all studied interventions. Furthermore, supplementation with high dosage EPA/DHA showed the most favorable acceptability rates (odds ratio: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.06, 17.41 compared with placebo) of all examined prophylactic treatments. This study provides compelling evidence that high dosage EPA/DHA supplementation can be considered a first-choice treatment of migraine prophylaxis because this treatment displayed the highest efficacy and highest acceptability of all studied treatments.

Literature was searched to September 28, 2022, in 4 databases: Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Biological Science Index. Studies of any duration in humans were considered. Any genome-wide association study (GWAS) investigating genetic variant associations with circulating choline and/or choline-related metabolites and any Mendelian randomization (MR) study investigating the association of genetically predicted circulating choline and/or choline-related metabolites with any health outcome were considered. Qualitative evidence is presented in summary tables. From 1248 total reviewed articles, 53 were included (GWAS = 27; MR = 26). Forty-two circulating choline-related metabolites were tested in association with genetic variants in GWAS studies, primarily trimethylamine N-oxide, betaine, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylcholines. MR studies investigated associations between 52 total unique choline metabolites and 66 unique health outcomes. Of these, 47 significant associations were reported between 16 metabolites (primarily choline, lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, betaine, and sphingomyelins) and 27 health outcomes including cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic, bone, and brain-related outcomes. Some articles reported significant associations between multiple choline types and the same health outcome. Genetically predicted circulating choline and choline-related metabolite concentrations are associated with a wide variety of health outcomes. Further research is needed to assess how genetic variability influences choline metabolism and whether individuals with lower genetically predicted circulating choline and choline-related metabolite concentrations would benefit from a dietary intervention or supplementation.",

    "abstract": "The risk of depression and anxiety is higher in people with metabolic conditions, but whether dietary approaches, which are central to the management of metabolic conditions, can also improve depression and anxiety is uncertain. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of dietary interventions on depression and anxiety in adults with metabolic conditions. The secondary aim was to evaluate the effects of hypocaloric and isocaloric dietary interventions on these outcomes. Four databases (MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL) were searched from inception to March 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including dietary interventions in adults with metabolic conditions (type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and/or overweight/obesity) that assessed depression and/or anxiety as outcomes were included. Overall, 13 RCTs were included in the systematic review, ≤13 of which were included in the meta-analysis. Estimates were pooled using random-effect meta-analysis for dietary interventions compared with controls. Improvements in depression scores were found in meta-analytic models including all dietary interventions [pooled estimate for the standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.20 (95% CI: -0.35, -0.05); P = 0.007] and hypocaloric only diets [SMD = -0.27 (95% CI: -0.44, -0.10); P = 0.002]. There were no improvements in depression scores with isocaloric dietary interventions only [SMD = -0.14 (95% CI: -0.38, 0.10); P = 0.27]. In addition, there were no significant effects of any dietary interventions on anxiety scores. In adults with metabolic conditions, all dietary interventions and hypocaloric diets improved depression, but not anxiety. These findings suggest that dietary interventions including hypocaloric diets can play an important role in the management of depression in people with metabolic conditions. This systematic review and meta-analysis has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021252307).",

    "abstract": "Antioxidants are bioactive molecules that function to scavenge free radicals and balance oxidative stress. While all antioxidants can act as reactive oxygen species scavengers, their efficacy on eye health may vary. Moreover, the comparative effectiveness and potential additive effect among groups of antioxidants, hitherto, have not been systematically studied. A systematic review and network meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the comparative or additive effect of dietary antioxidant supplements on eye health. Four databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane) were searched and relevant randomized controlled trials were identified. Out of 60 articles selected for systematic review, 38 were included in the network meta-analysis, categorized into eight distinct antioxidant-supplemented groups and placebo. All groups significantly increased macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and contrast sensitivity at low spatial frequency while only the antioxidant mixture + lutein + fatty acid combination exhibited significant improvements for visual acuity (hazard ratio= -0.15; 95% Confidence Interval, CI: -0.28, -0.02) and lutein + zeaxanthin combination for photostress recovery time (hazard ratio = -5.75; 95% CI: -8.80, -1.70). Especially, the lutein + zeaxanthin + fatty acid combination was ranked best for MPOD (Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking, SUCRA: 99.3%) and second-best for contrast sensitivity at low spatial frequency (67.7%). However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to low quality of evidence, primarily influenced by indirectness and potential publication bias. Overall antioxidant supplementation was estimated to improve eye health parameters on average while different combinations of antioxidants may also have varying effects on improving visual health from multiple perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Dietary diversity is a crucial component of healthy eating patterns because it ensures nutritional adequacy. Yet, concerns have been raised about the potential risks of its increase, which may reflect excessive consumption of unhealthy foods and higher obesity or cardiometabolic risk, particularly in high-income countries. However, the links between dietary diversity and different health outcomes remain inconclusive because of methodological differences in assessing dietary diversity. Numerous studies, mostly cross-sectional, have assessed dietary diversity using different indicators usually based only on the number of foods or food groups consumed. In this perspective, we emphasize that dietary diversity is a multidimensional concept encompassing the number of foods in the diet (food coverage) but also their relative proportions (food evenness) and the nutritional dissimilarity of foods consumed over time (food complementarity). Consequently, a comprehensive assessment of dietary diversity reflecting all its dimensions, both between and within-food groups, is needed to determine the optimal level of complementarity between and within-food groups required to improve health and diet quality. Moreover, given the prevailing context of abundant highly processed and energy-dense foods in high-income countries, promoting dietary diversity should prioritize nutrient-dense food groups. Until recently, within-food group diversity has received limited attention in research and public health recommendations. Still, it may play a role in improving diet quality and long-term health. This perspective aims to clarify the concept of dietary diversity and suggest research avenues that should be explored to better understand its associations with nutritional adequacy and health among adults in high-income countries.",

    "abstract": "The importance of nutrition in the development of disease, and in the recovery from illness, is among the most fundamental tenets in human biology and optimal health. Nutrition was fundamental in many traditional forms of medicine until its role in medical care experienced a rapid decline over the last century. We believe a key cause of the decline in nutrition's essential role in healthcare and preventative medicine is the escalating crisis of inadequate nutrition education in medical training. Recent data show 75% of United States medical schools have no required clinical nutrition classes and only 14% of residency programs have a required nutrition curriculum. More troubling, only 14% of current healthcare providers feel comfortable discussing nutrition with their patients. The purpose of this paper is to present the evidence illustrating the distinct lack of nutrition education in medical training. Further, we present key examples of existing formal nutrition curricula to incorporate nutritional science into all healthcare providers' education and practices. We discuss existing nutrition fellowships and training programs, including the new Duke Online Clinical Nutrition Fellowship. We also cover a physician nutrition certification allowing physicians to pursue clinical nutrition as a career path. Finally, recent financial incentives and quality measures incentivizing healthcare provider nutrition education is discussed. Thus, in conclusion, we advocate the inclusion of nutrition education curricula as a priority in medical schools, graduate medical education, and continuing medical education. Formal clinical nutrition training should be a requirement for hospital leadership and administrators for all Parenteral Nutrition and Nutrition Team Physician Directors in hospitals worldwide, and this key clinical role must become an essential position in all hospitals. In addition, we immediately need to address the critical shortage of physician nutrition specialists who will serve as the next generation of leaders in clinical nutrition care and research.",

The effects of HFCS and sucrose in sugar-sweetened beverages, in particular, have generated intense scientific debate that has spilled over to the public. This controversy is related to well-known differences in metabolism between fructose and glucose in the liver. In addition, research studies have often been conducted comparing pure fructose and pure glucose even though neither is consumed to any appreciable degree in isolation in the human diet. Other evidence has been drawn from animal studies and epidemiologic or cohort studies. Few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared HFCS with sucrose (the 2 sugars most commonly consumed in the human diet) at dosage amounts within the normal human consumption range. This review compares results of recently concluded RCTs with other forms of evidence related to fructose, HFCS, and sucrose. We conclude that great caution must be used when suggesting adverse health effects of consuming these sugars in the normal way they are consumed and at the normal amounts in the human diet, because RCTs do not support adverse health consequences at these doses when employing these sugars.",

Because excess dietary phosphorus intake is common in the general population and plays a central role in disturbances in phosphorus homeostasis, these findings have fueled interest in restricting phosphorus intake as a potential therapy for improving cardiovascular outcomes. Although experimental and observational data support this possibility, current limitations in the assessment of dietary phosphorus consumption in free-living populations and the lack of reliable biomarkers of the effects of dietary phosphorus on cardiovascular health pose major barriers to the design and conduct of trials assessing the efficacy of phosphorus restriction in improving cardiovascular health. Fibroblast growth factor 23 and Klotho are novel mediators of phosphorus metabolism that are tightly linked to dietary phosphorus intake and show promise as integrated biomarkers of phosphorus excess and its long-term health consequences. Advances in the understanding of how these hormones are associated with diet and phosphorus metabolism will likely bolster future efforts to assess the true health consequences of excess phosphorus intake and whether restricting phosphorus intake has salutary effects on cardiovascular health.",

In this study, we performed a PubMed literature search to review the anticancer mechanisms and the preclinical and clinical studies that support the development of the bioactive vitamins A, C, D, E, and K in pancreatic cancer intervention. Preclinical studies have shown promising results for vitamin A in pancreatic cancer prevention, with clinical trials showing intriguing responses in combination with immunotherapy. For vitamin C, preclinical studies have shown slower tumor growth rates and/or increased survival when used alone or in combination with gemcitabine, with clinical trials with this combination revealing decreased primary tumor sizes and improved performance status. Preclinical studies with vitamin D analogues have shown potent antiproliferative effects and repression of migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, with a clinical trial showing increased time to progression when calciferol was added to docetaxel. For vitamin E, preclinical studies have shown that δ-tocotrienol and γ-tocotrienol inhibited tumor cell growth and survival and augmented gemcitabine activity. Early-phase clinical trials with δ-tocotrienol are ongoing. Vitamin K demonstrates activation of apoptosis and inhibition of cellular growth in pancreatic tumor cells; however, there are no clinical studies available for further evaluation. Although preclinical and clinical studies are encouraging, randomized controlled trials with endpoints based on insights gained from mechanistic and preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials are required to determine the efficacy of bioactive vitamin interventions in pancreatic cancer.",

Observational studies reporting data on the association between anthropometric measurements and periodontal diseases in 2–18-y-old participants were included. An initial search identified 4191 papers; 278 potentially effective studies (k = 0.82) and 16 effective studies (k = 0.83) were included after screening. The mean quality of evidence among the studies was 20.3, according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology checklist (k = 0.79). Meta-analyses showed that obesity (measured by body mass index) was significantly associated with visible plaque index (OR: 4.75; 95% CI: 2.42, 9.34), bleeding on probing (OR: 5.41; 95% CI: 2.75, 10.63), subgingival calculus (OR: 3.07; 95% CI: 1.10, 8.62), probing depth (OR: 14.15; 95% CI: 5.10, 39.25) and flow rate of salivary secretion (standardized mean difference: −0.89; 95% CI: −1.18, −0.61). However, various results were reported in the effective studies that were not included in meta-analyses. In conclusion, obesity is associated with some signs of periodontal disease in children and adolescents.

The dietary reference intake (DRI) process has been applied to nonessential nutrients, such as fiber, yet the majority of bioactive components await a recommended intake. Despite a plethora of new research over the past several years on the health effects of bioactives, it is possible that the field may never reach a point where the current DRI framework is suitable for these food components. If bioactives are to move toward dietary guidance, they will likely require an alternative path to get there.",

    "abstract": "A systematic review was used to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational epidemiologic studies (OBSs) that examined protein intake consistent with either the US RDA (0.8 g/kg or 10–15% of energy) or a higher protein intake (≥20% but <35% of energy or ≥10% higher than a comparison intake) and reported measures of kidney function. Studies (n = 26) of healthy, free-living adults (>18 y old) with or without metabolic disease risk factors were included. Studies of subjects with overt disease, such as chronic kidney, end-stage renal disease, cancer, or organ transplant, were excluded. The most commonly reported variable was glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with 13 RCTs comparing GFRs obtained with normal and higher protein intakes. Most (n = 8), but not all (n = 5), RCTs reported significantly higher GFRs in response to increased protein intake, and all rates were consistent with normal kidney function in healthy adults. The evidence from the current review is limited and inconsistent with regard to the role of protein intake and the risk of kidney stones. Increased protein intake had little or no effect on blood markers of kidney function. Evidence reported here suggests that protein intake above the US RDA has no adverse effect on blood pressure. All included studies were of moderate to high risk of bias and, with the exception of 2 included cohorts, were limited in duration (i.e. <6 mo). Data in the current review are insufficient to determine if increased protein intake from a particular source, i.e., plant or animal, influences kidney health outcomes. These data further indicate that, at least in the short term, higher protein intake within the range of recommended intakes for protein is consistent with normal kidney function in healthy individuals.",

    "abstract": "Cranberry has been used traditionally to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs), primarily among generally healthy women prone to recurrent UTIs. Results from a number of published clinical studies have supported this benefit; however, meta-analyses on cranberry and UTI prevention have reported conflicting conclusions. This article explores the methodological differences that contributed to these disparate findings. Despite similar research questions, the meta-analyses varied in the studies that were included, as well as the data that were extracted. In the 2 most comprehensive systematic reviews, heterogeneity was handled differently, leading to an I2 of 65% in one and 43% in the other. Most notably, the populations influencing the conclusions varied. In one analysis, populations with pathological/physiological conditions contributed 75.6% of the total weight to the summary risk estimate (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.04); another weighted the evidence relatively equally across UTI populations (RR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.80); and a third included only women with recurrent UTIs (RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.83). Because women with recurrent UTIs are the group to whom most recommendations regarding cranberry consumption is directed, inclusion of other groups in the efficacy assessment could influence clinical practice quality. Therefore, conclusions on cranberry and UTIs should consider differences in results across various populations studied when interpreting results from meta-analyses.",

Randomized and nonrandomized studies were included if participants were healthy (free of chronic disease), nonobese [BMI (kg/m2) <30], trained or untrained men or women consuming KD (<50 g carbohydrate/d or serum or whole-blood β-hydroxybutyrate >0.5 mmol/L) compared with CON (fat, 12–38% of total energy intake) diets for ≥14 d, followed by a physical performance test. Seventeen studies (10 parallel, 7 crossover) with 29 performance (13 endurance, 16 power or strength) outcomes were identified. Of the 13 endurance-type performance outcomes, 3 (1 time trial, 2 time-to-exhaustion) reported lower and 10 (4 time trials, 6 time-to-exhaustion) reported no difference in performance between the KD compared with CON. Of the 16 power or strength performance outcomes, 3 (1 power, 2 strength) reported lower, 11 (4 power, 7 strength) no difference, and 2 (power) enhanced performance in the KD compared with the CON. Risk of bias identified some concern of bias primarily due to studies allowing participants to self-select diet intervention groups and the inability to blind participants to the study intervention. Overall, the majority of null results across studies suggest that a KD does not have a positive or negative impact on physical performance compared with a CON diet. However, discordant results between studies may be due to multiple factors, such as the duration consuming study diets, training status, performance test, and sex differences, which will be discussed in this systematic review.",

    "abstract": "Insufficient intake of total fruits and vegetables is linked to an increased cancer risk, but the relation is not understood for dried fruits. Dried fruits are generally perceived, by both consumers and researchers, as a less attractive but shelf-stable equivalent to fresh fruits and constitute a small but significant proportion of modern diets. Chemical compositions of raw and dried fruits, however, may differ substantially. Several clinical and laboratory intervention studies have reported the protective effects of dehydrated fruits against the progression of some cancers and the modulating effects of dried fruits on common cancer risk factors. In this systematic review, we identified, summarized, and critically evaluated 9 prospective cohort and 7 case-control studies that examined the relations between traditional dried fruit (raisins, prunes, dates) consumption and cancer risk in humans. Prospective cohort studies determined that significant reductions in relative risk of precancerous colorectal polyps, incidence of prostate cancer, or mortality from pancreatic cancer, by, respectively, 24%, 49%, and 65%, were associated with 3–5 or more servings of dried fruits per week. Selected case-control studies revealed inverse associations between dried fruit intake and risk of cancer as well. The reported associations were comparable to or stronger than those observed for total or raw fruits. Although the small number and high heterogeneity impede meta-analysis of these studies, we conclude that currently available data provide some initial evidence that consumption of dried fruits may be associated with a lower cancer incidence or mortality in populations. The data suggest that higher intake of raisins and other dried fruits may be important in the prevention of cancers of the digestive system. Because only a limited number of health outcome and dried fruit intake relations have been evaluated in prospective studies to date, reanalyzing existing high-quality epidemiological data may expand the knowledge base.",

    "abstract": "The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) provide nutrition advice for Americans >2 y of age. The 2020-2025 DGA proposes a life stage approach, focusing on birth through older adulthood. Limited recommendations for beverages exist except for milk, 100% fruit juice, and alcohol. The goal of this article is to provide a better understanding of the role of beverages in the diet using current scientific evidence. A Medline search of observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses was undertaken using key beverage words. We highlight the role beverages can play as a part of the DGA and considered beverages not traditionally included, such as those that are phytonutrient dense. Our primary consideration for beverage consumption targeted healthy Americans aged ≥2 y. However, with the proposed expansion to the life span for the 2020-2025 DGA, we also reviewed evidence for infants and toddlers from birth to 24 mo. Examples are provided on how minor changes in beverage choices aid in meeting recommended intakes of certain nutrients. Guidance on beverage consumption may aid in development of better consumer products to meet broader dietary advice. For example, beverage products that are nutrient/phytonutrient dense and lower in sugar could be developed as alternatives to 100% juice to help meet the fruit and vegetable guidelines. Although beverages are not meant to replace foods, e.g., it is difficult to meet the requirements for vitamin E, dietary fiber, or essential fatty acids through beverages alone, beverages are important sources of nutrients and phytonutrients, phenolic acids and flavonoids in particular. When considering the micronutrients from diet alone, mean intakes of calcium (in women), potassium, and vitamins A, C, and D are below recommendations and sodium intakes are well above. Careful beverage choices could close these gaps and be considered a part of a healthy dietary pattern.",

    "abstract": "Cephalic phase responses (CPRs) are conditioned anticipatory physiological responses to food cues. They occur before nutrient absorption and are hypothesized to be important for satiation and glucose homeostasis. Cephalic phase insulin responses (CPIRs) and pancreatic polypeptide responses (CPPPRs) are found consistently in animals, but human literature is inconclusive. We performed a systematic review of human studies to determine the magnitude and onset time of these CPRs. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to develop a search strategy. The terms included in the search strategy were cephalic or hormone response or endocrine response combined with insulin and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). The following databases were searched: Scopus (Elsevier), Science Direct, PubMed, Google Scholar, and The Cochrane Library. Initially, 582 original research articles were found, 50 were included for analysis. An insulin increase (≥1μIU/mL) was observed in 41% of the treatments (total n = 119). In 22% of all treatments the increase was significant from baseline. The median (IQR) insulin increase was 2.5 (1.6-4.5) μIU/mL, 30% above baseline at 5± 3 min after food cue onset (based on study treatments that induced ≥1 μIU/mL insulin increase). A PP increase (>10 pg/mL) was found in 48% of the treatments (total n = 42). In 21% of the treatments, the increase was significant from baseline. The median (IQR) PP increase was 99 (26-156) pg/mL, 68% above baseline at 9± 4 min after food cue onset (based on study treatments that induced ≥1 μIU/mL insulin increase). In conclusion, CPIRs are small compared with spontaneous fluctuations. Although CPPPRs are of a larger magnitude, both show substantial variation in magnitude and onset time. We found little evidence for CPIR or CPPPR affecting functional outcomes, that is, satiation and glucose homeostasis. Therefore, CPRs do not seem to be biologically meaningful in daily life.",

    "abstract": "Anemia is a multifactorial condition arising from inadequate nutrition, infection, chronic disease, and genetic-related etiologies. Our aim was to assess the impact of nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions on hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations and anemia to inform the prioritization and scale-up of interventions to address the multiple causes of anemia. We performed a meta-review synthesis of information by searching multiple databases for reviews published between 1990 and 2017 and used standard methods for conducting a meta-review of reviews, including double independent screening, extraction, and quality assessment. Quantitative pooling and narrative syntheses were used to summarize information. Hb concentration and anemia outcomes were pooled in specific population groups (children aged <5 y, school-age children, and pregnant women). Methodological quality of the systematic reviews was assessed using Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) criteria. Of the 15,444 records screened, we identified 118 systematic reviews that met inclusion criteria. Reviews focused on nutrition-specific interventions (96%). Daily and intermittent iron supplementation, micronutrient powders, malaria treatment, use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), and delayed cord clamping were associated with increased Hb concentration in children aged <5 y. Among children older than 5 y, daily and intermittent iron supplementation and deworming, and in pregnant women, daily iron-folic acid supplementation, use of ITNs, and delayed cord clamping, were associated with increased Hb concentration. Similar results were obtained for the reduced risk of anemia outcome. This meta-review suggests the importance of nutrition-specific interventions for anemia and highlights the lack of evidence to understand the influence of nutrition-sensitive and multifaceted interventions on the condition.",

    "abstract": "Diets high in salt are a leading risk for death and disability globally. Taxing unhealthy food is an effective means of influencing what people eat and improving population health. Although there is a growing body of evidence on taxing products high in sugar, and unhealthy foods more broadly, there is limited knowledge or experience of using fiscal measures to reduce salt consumption. We searched peer-reviewed databases [MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews] and gray literature for studies published between January 2000 and October 2019. Studies were included if they provided information on the impact on salt consumption of: taxes on salt; taxes on foods high in salt, and taxes on unhealthy foods defined to include foods high in salt. Studies were excluded if their definition of unhealthy foods did not specify high salt or sodium. We found 18 relevant studies, including 15 studies reporting the effects of salt taxes through modeling (8), real-world evaluation (4), experimental design (2), or review of cost-effectiveness (1); 6 studies providing information relevant to country implementation of salt taxes; and 2 studies reporting stakeholder perceptions toward salt taxation. Although there is some evidence on the potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of salt taxation, especially from modeling studies, uptake of salt taxation is limited in practice. Some modeling studies suggested that food taxes can have unintended outcomes such as reduced consumption of healthy foods, or increased consumption of unhealthy, untaxed substitutes. In contrast, modeling studies that combined taxes for unhealthy foods with subsidies found that the benefits were increased. Modeling suggests that taxing all foods based on their salt content is likely to have more impact than taxing specific products high in salt given that salt is pervasive in the food chain. However, the limited experience we found suggests that policy-makers favor taxing specific products.",

This could be of particular importance in providing a means for preventing NTDs that are unresponsive to folic acid. This review highlights the characteristics of inositol and describes the role of myo-inositol in the prevention of NTDs in rodent studies and the evidence for its efficacy in reducing NTD risk in human pregnancy. The possible reduction in NTD risk by maternal myo-inositol implies functional and developmentally important maternal-embryonic inositol interrelationships and also suggests that embryonic uptake of myo-inositol is crucial for embryonic development. The establishment of active myo-inositol cellular uptake mechanisms in the embryonic stages of human pregnancy, when the neural tube is closing, is likely to be an important determinant of normal development. We draw attention to the generation of materno-fetal inositol concentration gradients and relationships, and outline a transport pathway by which myo-inositol may be delivered to the early developing human embryo. These considerations provide novel insights into the mechanisms that may underpin inositol's ability to confer embryonic developmental benefit.",

    "abstract": "Young people, whose brains are still developing, might entail a greater vulnerability to the effects of alcohol consumption on brain function and development. A committee of experts of the Health Council of the Netherlands evaluated the state of scientific knowledge regarding the question whether alcohol negatively influences brain development in young people. A systematic literature search for prospective studies was performed in PubMed and PsychINFO, for longitudinal studies of adolescents or young adults ranging between 12 and 24 y of age at baseline, investigating the relation between alcohol use and outcome measures of brain structure and activity, cognitive functioning, educational achievement, or alcohol use disorder (AUD), with measures at baseline and follow-up of the outcome of interest. Data were extracted from original articles and study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A total of 77 studies were included, 31 of which were of sufficient quality in relation to the study objectives. There were indications that the gray matter of the brain develops abnormally in young people who drink alcohol. In addition, the more often young people drink or the younger they start, the higher the risk of developing AUD later in life. The evidence on white matter volume or quality, brain activity, cognitive function, and educational achievement is still limited or unclear. The committee found indications that alcohol consumption can have a negative effect on brain development in adolescents and young adults and entails a risk of later AUD. The committee therefore considers it a wise choice for adolescents and young adults not to drink alcohol.",

    "abstract": "The recent Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization/United Nations University expert consultations on protein requirements and quality have emphasized the need for the new Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS), as a measure of protein quality. This requires human measurements of the true ileal digestibility of individual indispensable amino acids (IAAs) until the end of the small intestine. Digestibility is measured using standard oro-ileal balance methods, which can only be achieved by an invasive naso-ileal intubation in healthy participants or fistulation at the terminal ileum. Significant efforts have been made over the last 2 decades to develop noninvasive or minimally invasive methods to measure IAA digestibility in humans. The application of intrinsically labeled (with stable isotopes like 13C, 15N, and 2H) dietary proteins has helped in circumventing the invasive oro-ileal balance techniques and allowed the differentiation between endogenous and exogenous protein. The noninvasive indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique, which is routinely employed to measure IAA requirements, has been modified to estimate metabolic availability (a sum of digestibility and utilization) of IAA in foods, but provides an estimate for a single IAA at a time and is burdensome for participants. The recently developed minimally invasive dual isotope tracer method measures small intestinal digestibility of multiple amino acids at once and is suitable for use in vulnerable groups and disease conditions. However, it remains to be validated against standard oro-ileal balance techniques. This review critically evaluates and compares the currently available stable isotope-based protein quality evaluation methods with a focus on the digestibility and metabolic availability measurements in humans. In view of building a reliable DIAAS database of various protein sources and subsequently supporting protein content claims in food labeling, a re-evaluation and harmonization of the available methods are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Factors that influence the risk of neurocognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) may provide insight into therapies for both disease treatment and prevention. Although age is the most striking risk factor for AD, it is notable that the prevalence of AD is higher in women, representing two-thirds of cases. To explore potential underlying biological underpinnings of this observation, the intent of this article is to explore the interplay between cognitive aging and sex hormones, the cholinergic system, and novel hypotheses related to the essential nutrient choline. Mechanistic evidence points toward estrogen's neuroprotective effects being strongly dependent on its interactions with the cholinergic system, a modulator of attentional functioning, learning, and memory. Estrogen has been shown to attenuate anticholinergic-induced impairments in verbal memory and normalize patterns of frontal and occipital cortex activation, resulting in a more \"young adult\" phenotype. However, similar to estrogen replacement's effect in cardiovascular diseases, its putative protective effects may be restricted to early postmenopausal women only, a finding supportive of the \"critical window hypothesis.\" Estrogen's impact on the cholinergic system may act both locally in the brain but also through peripheral tissues. Estrogen is critical for inducing endogenous choline synthesis via the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) gene–mediated pathway of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis. PEMT is dramatically induced in response to estrogen, producing not only a PC molecule and source of choline for the brain but also a key source of the long-chain ω-3 fatty acid, DHA. Herein, we highlight novel hypotheses related to hormone replacement therapy and nutrient metabolism aimed at directing future preclinical and clinical investigation.",

    "abstract": "The nutritional status of reproductive-aged couples can have a significant impact on fertility status, but the effect of dietary patterns on pregnancy outcomes in people using assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) is currently unknown. This review aimed to synthesize the published research investigating the relation between preconception dietary patterns and clinical pregnancy or live birth in men and women of reproductive age undergoing ART. Six electronic databases were systematically searched for original research published between January 1978 and June 2021. Original research reporting on the effect of predefined dietary patterns on either clinical pregnancy and/or live birth rates following in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in men and women aged 18–49 y was eligible for inclusion. Studies were assessed for risk of bias according to the Cochrane guidelines. Included studies underwent qualitative and quantitative synthesis using random-effects model meta-analyses. Thirteen studies (12 cohort studies, 1 randomized controlled trial) reporting on 3638 participants (93% female) were included in the review. All studies had a moderate–high risk of bias. In individual studies, maternal adherence to 4 dietary patterns [Mediterranean diet (RR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.43), novel profertility diet (OR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.72), Iranian traditional medicine diet (OR: 3.9; 95% CI: 1.2, 12.8), Dutch national dietary recommendations diet (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.52)] was associated with increased likelihood of achieving a clinical pregnancy, while 2 dietary patterns [novel profertility diet (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.26, 1.85), Mediterranean diet (RR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.45)] were associated with increased probability of live birth. Meta-analyses showed an association between adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern and live birth across 2 studies (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.17, 3.35; I2 = 29%, n = 355), but no association with clinical pregnancy. As the relation between dietary patterns and ART outcomes is currently inconsistent, higher-quality nutrition research is required to further explore this emerging field of interest (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020188194).",

Enhancers of iron absorption are highly sought after to improve supplementation outcomes. Evidence from animal and human studies exists that prebiotics can enhance iron absorption. The purpose of this present narrative review of the literature is to summarize the existing evidence on the effects of prebiotics on human iron absorption. Relevant articles were identified from PUBMED, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to November 2021. Only human trials investigating the effect of prebiotics on iron absorption were included. Eleven articles were identified and included for review. There are promising findings supporting an enhancing effect of certain prebiotics, but inconsistencies between the studies and results exist. The most convincing evidence exists for the prebiotics galacto-oligosaccharides and fructo-oligosaccharides combined with the commonly used iron compound ferrous fumarate, from studies in adult women with low iron stores and in anemic infants. Many factors seem to play a role in the enhancing effect of prebiotics on iron absorption such as type of prebiotic, dose, acute (single-dose) or chronic (long-term) prebiotic consumption, iron compound, iron status, inflammatory status, and age of the population studied. More research investigating the optimal combination of prebiotic, iron compound, and dose as well as the effect of long-term application on iron status outcomes is needed.",

    "abstract": "Prescribing a ketogenic diet (KD) is a century-old dietary intervention mainly used in the context of intractable epilepsy. The classic KD and its variants regained popularity in recent decades, and they are considered potentially beneficial in a variety of neurological conditions other than epilepsy. Many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have attempted diet modification for better control of their disease, although evidence thus far remains insufficient to recommend a specific diet for these patients. The results of 3 pilot clinical trials of KD therapy for MS, as well as several related studies, have been reported in recent years. The preliminary findings suggest that KD is safe, feasible, and potentially neuroprotective and disease-modifying for patients with MS. Research on corresponding rodent models has also lent support to the efficacy of KD in the prevention and treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and toxin-induced inflammatory demyelinating conditions in the brain. Furthermore, the animal studies have yielded mechanistic insights into the molecular mechanisms of KD action in relevant situations, paving the way for precision nutrition. Herein we review and synthesize recent advances and also identify unresolved issues, such as the roles of adipokines and gut microbiota, in this field. Hopefully this panoramic view of current understanding can inform future research directions and clinical practice with regard to KD in MS and related conditions.",

    "abstract": "Fish provide essential nutrients for the critical window of growth and development in the first 1000 d of life and are thus an attractive option for inclusion in nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific programming. We conducted a systematic review of the evidence for fish and fish-based products for nutrition and health outcomes during the first 1000 d of life in low- and middle-income countries, searching the peer-reviewed and gray literature from 1999 to 2020. Databases included PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, ProQuest, and the Clinical Trials repository. Our search returned 1135 articles, 39 of which met the inclusion criteria. All studies were dual evaluated for risk of bias. Of the included studies, 18 measured maternal health and nutrition outcomes and 24 measured infant/child outcomes (3 measured both). Our search uncovered 10 impact evaluations, all of which measured consumption of fish or fish-based complementary food products in children aged 6-24 mo. We did not find strong evidence for fish consumption in children improving child growth from the impact evaluations; however, the studies were highly heterogeneous in their design and likely underpowered to detect an effect. Results from observational studies were mixed but provided evidence that adding fish to maternal and child diets is associated with improved nutrition outcomes, such as reducing the risk of anemia and improving vitamin D status. Given the nutrient richness of fish and the fact that production is often more environmentally friendly as compared with other animal source foods, more robust evidence is needed on the role of fish consumption in nutrition interventions to inform policy and programming recommendations in low- and middle-income countries.",

Interestingly, dietary guidelines and recommendations often refer to \"nuts and seeds\" collectively, even though they are not consistently examined together in nutrition research when determining associated health benefits.

This review provides justification for this proposal by summarizing current definitions for nuts and seeds and highlighting the similarities or dissimilarities in their nutrient compositions.

Current guidelines of upper limits (ULs) of zinc intake for young children are extrapolated from adult data. This systematic review (PROSPERO; registration no. CRD42020215187) aimed to determine the levels of zinc intake at which adverse effects are observed in young children. Studies reporting potential adverse effects of zinc intake in children aged 0-3 y were identified (from inception to August 2020) in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, with no limits on study design. Adverse clinical and physical effects of zinc intake were synthesized narratively, and meta-analyses of biochemical outcomes were conducted. Random effects models were used to generate forest plots to examine the evidence by age category, dose, dose duration, chemical formula of zinc, and zinc compared with placebo. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist, Cochrane Risk of Bias 2, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guideline were employed to assess risk of bias and to appraise the certainty of evidence. Fifty-eight studies assessed possible adverse effects of zinc doses ranging from 3 to 70 mg/d. Data from 39 studies contributed to meta-analyses. Zinc supplementation had an adverse effect on serum ferritin, plasma/serum copper concentration, serum transferrin receptor, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and the odds of anemia in ≥1 of the subgroups investigated. Lactulose:mannitol ratio was improved with zinc supplementation, and no significant effect was observed on C-reactive protein, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, zinc protoporphyrin, blood cholesterol, and iron deficiency anemia. The certainty of the evidence, as assessed using GRADE, was very low to moderate. Although possible adverse effects of zinc supplementation were observed in some subgroups, it is unclear whether these findings are clinically important. The synthesized data can be used to undertake a dose-response analysis to update current guidelines of ULs of zinc intake for young children.",

This nourishment is unique and changes constantly during lactation to adapt to the physiological needs of the developing infant. It is also recognized as a potential route of transmission of some viral pathogens although the presence of a virus in HM rarely leads to a disease in an infant. This intriguing paradox can be explained by considering the intrinsic antiviral properties of HM. In this comprehensive and schematically presented review, we have described what viruses have been detected in HM so far and what their potential transmission risk through breastfeeding is. We have provided a description of all the antiviral compounds of HM, along with an analysis of their demonstrated and hypothesized mechanisms of action. Finally, we have also analyzed the impact of HM pasteurization and storage methods on the detection and transmission of viruses, and on the antiviral compounds of HM. We have highlighted that there is currently a deep knowledge on the potential transmission of viral pathogens through breastfeeding and on the antiviral properties of HM. The current evidence suggests that, in most cases, it is unnecessarily to deprive an infant of this high-quality nourishment and that the continuation of breastfeeding is in the best interest of the infant and the mother.",

For trials of whole diets, dietary counseling are advantageous as they offer clinical translatability although can vary in the fidelity of the intended intervention from participant to participant and across studies. Feeding trials, in which most or all food is provided, offer high precision and can provide proof-of-concept evidence that a dietary intervention is efficacious and can also better evaluate the effect of known quantities of foods and nutrients on physiology. However, they come with additional methodological complexities. Feeding trials also call for a variety of unique methodological considerations, not least of which relate to the design and delivery of diets to participants. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of recommendations for design and conduct of feeding trials, encompassing domiciled and non-domiciled feeding trials. Several pertinent aspects of trial design and methodology are discussed, including defining the study population to maximize retention, safety and generalisability of findings, recommendations for design of control interventions and optimising blinding, and specific considerations for clinical populations. A detailed stepwise process for menu design, development, validation and delivery are also presented. These recommendations aim to facilitate methodologic consistency and execution of high quality feeding trials, ultimately facilitating improved understanding of the role of diet in treating disease and the underpinning mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and precise measurement of hemoglobin concentration is critical for reliable estimations of anemia prevalence at the population level. When systematic and/or random error are introduced in hemoglobin measurement, estimates of anemia prevalence might be significantly erroneous and, hence, limit their usefulness. For decades, single-drop capillary blood has been the most common blood source used for the measurement of hemoglobin concentration in surveys, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. In this study, we highlight historical and emerging evidence that single-drop capillary blood introduces a high degree of random error (variability) to hemoglobin estimates, leading to less reliable estimates of anemia prevalence at the population level. At present, the best practice is to collect and use venous blood for measurement of hemoglobin with an automated hematology analyzer, following standard operating procedures and quality assurance measures. Where use of an automated analyzer is not possible, the analysis of venous blood in a point-of-care hemoglobinometer by trained phlebotomists or specimen collectors should be considered. A forthcoming systematic review will provide additional evidence on the accuracy and precision of single-drop capillary blood for hemoglobin assessment. In the meantime, we raise caution when using single-drop capillary blood for hemoglobin measurement as it can result in inaccurate hemoglobin estimates and less reliable anemia prevalence estimates.",

    "abstract": "Within twenty years, the number of adults in the United States over age 65 is expected to more than double and the number over age 85 is expected to more than triple. The risk for most chronic diseases and disabilities increases with age, so this demographic shift carries significant implications for the individual, health care providers, and population health. Strategies that delay or prevent the onset of age-related diseases are becoming increasingly important. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the contribution of nutrition to healthy aging, it has become increasingly apparent that much remains to be learned, especially since the aging process is highly variable. Most federal nutrition programs and nutrition research studies define all adults over age 65 as 'older' and do not account for physiological and metabolic changes that occur throughout older adulthood that influence nutritional needs. Moreover, the older adult population is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse, so cultural preferences and other social determinants of health need to be considered. The Research Centers Collaborative Network (RCCN) sponsored a 1.5-day multi-disciplinary workshop that included sessions on Dietary Patterns in Health and Disease, Timing and Targeting Interventions, and Health Disparities and the Social Context of Diet and Food Choice. The agenda and presentations can be found at https://www.rccn-aging.org/nutrition-2023-rccn-workshop. Here we summarize the workshop's themes and discussions and highlight research gaps that if filled will considerably advance our understanding of the role of nutrition in healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are characterized by the progressive functional and structural denaturation of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Despite the wide range of genetic predispositions, the increased emergence of these disorders has been associated with a variety of modifiable risk factors, including lifestyle factors. Diet has been shown to influence cognitive alterations in the elderly population with age-related brain pathologies, and specific dietary interventions might, therefore, confer preservatory protection to neural structures. Although Mediterranean (MD) and ketogenic diets (KD) have been studied, no clear guidelines have been implemented for the prevention or treatment of ND in clinical practice. Murine models have shown that intermittent fasting (IF) and caloric restriction (CR) can counteract disease processes in various age-related disorders, including ND. The objective of this perspective is to provide a comprehensive, comparative overview of the available primary intervention studies on fasting and CR in humans with ND and to elucidate possible links between the mechanisms underlying the effects of fasting, CR, and the neuropathology of ND. We also included all currently available studies in older adults (with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), where the primary endpoint was cognitive function, to provide further insights into the feasibility and outcomes of such interventions. Overall, we conclude that nutritional intervention trials focusing on fasting and CR in humans with ND have been neglected, and more high-quality studies, including longitudinal clinical intervention trials, are urgently needed to elucidate the underlying immune-metabolic mechanisms in diet and ND. This perspective provides a pioneering synthesis of clinical intervention trials examining the effects of fasting and caloric restriction on individuals suffering from neurodegenerative diseases (ND), marking a comprehensive analysis on this topic.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widely recommended usage of partially or extensively hydrolyzed milk protein formula (PHF or EHF) for preventing allergic diseases (ADs), clinical studies have been inconclusive regarding their efficacy compared with cow's milk formula (CMF) or breast milk (BM). We aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of PHF or EHF versus CMF or BM on the risk of ADs (cow's milk allergy, allergic rhinitis, eczema, asthma, wheeze, food allergy, and sensitization) in children. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for clinical trials published from inception to October 21st, 2022. We utilized the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to grade the strength of evidence. Overall, 24 trials (10950 infants) were included, 17 of which specifically included high-risk infants. GRADE was low for the evidence that compared with CMF, infants early-fed with EHF had a lower risk of cow's milk allergy at age 0-2 years (Relative Risk [RR], 95%CI: 0.62,0.39-0.99). Moderate evidence supported that PHF and EHF reduced the risk of eczema in children under or over 2 years of age, respectively (RR: 0.71, 0.52-0.96 and 0.79, 0.67-0.94). We also identified moderate systematic evidence indicating that PHF reduced the risk of wheeze at age 0-2 years compared with CMF (RR: 0.50, 0.29-0.85), but PHF and EHF increased the risk compared with BM (RR: 1.61, 1.11-2.31 and 1.64, 1.26-2.14). Neither PHF nor EHF had significant effects on other ADs in children of any age. In conclusion, compared with CMF, PHF or EHF had different preventive effect on cow's milk allergy, eczema, and wheeze. Compared with BM, both PHF and EHF may increase the risk of wheeze, but not other ADs. Given that most trials included only high-risk infants, more research on non-high-risk infants is warranted before any generalization is attempted.

    "abstract": "The escalating threat of antimicrobial resistance underscores the imperative for innovative therapeutic strategies. Host defense peptides (HDPs), integral components of innate immunity, exhibit profound antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. Various dietary compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, sugars, amino acids, phytochemicals, bile acids, probiotics, and prebiotics have been identified to enhance the synthesis of endogenous HDPs without provoking inflammatory response or compromising barrier integrity. Additionally, different classes of these compounds synergize in augmenting HDP synthesis and disease resistance. Moreover, dietary supplementation of several HDP-inducing compounds or their combinations have demonstrated robust protection in rodents, rabbits, pigs, cattle, and chickens from experimental infections. However, the efficacy of these compounds in inducing HDP synthesis varies considerably among distinct compounds. Additionally, the regulation of HDP genes occurs in a gene-specific, cell type–specific, and species-specific manner. In this comprehensive review, we systematically summarized the modulation of HDP synthesis and the mechanism of action attributed to each major class of dietary compounds, including their synergistic combinations, across a spectrum of animal species including humans. We argue that the ability to enhance innate immunity and barrier function without triggering inflammation or microbial resistance positions the nutritional modulation of endogenous HDP synthesis as a promising host-directed approach for mitigating infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance. These HDP-inducing compounds, particularly in combinations, harbor substantial clinical potential for further exploration in antimicrobial therapies for both human and other animals.",

Many of these changes are coordinated by the placenta, a critical fetal endocrine organ and the site of maternal-fetal crosstalk. Dysregulation in maternal and placental metabolism during pregnancy has been linked to adverse outcomes, including altered neurodevelopment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder linked to metabolic alterations in both children and their mothers. Prenatal environmental exposures have been linked to risk of ASD through dysregulated maternal, placental, and fetal metabolism. In this review, we focus on recent studies investigating the associations between prenatal metabolism in the maternal-placental-fetal unit and the impact of prenatal environmental exposures to phthalates and micronutrients on ASD risk. By identifying the mechanisms through which phthalates and other ubiquitous endocrine disrupting chemicals influence development, and how nutritional interventions can impact those mechanisms, we can identify promising ways to prevent suboptimal neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive and independent interrelationships between different body composition components have been identified as crucial determinants of disease risk. Based on this concept, the load-capacity model of body composition, which utilizes measurements obtained through non-anthropometric techniques such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), was proposed. This model is typically operationalized as the ratio of metabolic load (adipose mass) to metabolic capacity (lean mass). In recent years, a series of load-capacity indices (LCIs) have been utilized to identify abnormal body composition phenotypes such as sarcopenic obesity (SO) and to predict the risk of metabolic, cardiovascular, and cognitive disorders. In this review, we comprehensively review the characteristics of different LCIs used in previous studies, with a specific focus on their applications, especially in identifying SO and predicting cardiometabolic outcomes. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Two meta-analyses were conducted to: (1) estimate the overall prevalence of SO mapped by LCIs, and (2) assess the association of LCIs with cardiometabolic outcomes. A total of 48 studies (all observational) were included, comprising 22 different LCIs. Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis of SO prevalence, yielding a pooled prevalence of 14.5% (95% CI: 9.4% to 21.6%). Seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis of the association between LCIs and adverse cardiometabolic outcomes, which showed a significant association between higher LCI values and increased risk (OR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.81 to 2.72) of cardiometabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes and metabolic syndrome [MetS]). These findings suggest that the load-capacity model of body composition could be particularly useful in the identification of SO cases and prediction of cardiometabolic risk. Future longitudinal studies are needed to validate the association of LCIs with chronic cardiometabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. This systematic review and meta-analysis has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024457750).",

This review examines the mechanistic pathways through which dietary fatty acids and sugars contribute the development of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, offering a nuanced understanding of their respective roles in MASLD progression. In terms of addressing potential therapeutic options, human intervention studies that investigate whether modifying the intake of dietary fats and carbohydrates affects MASLD progression are reviewed.

    "abstract": "The domestic and global diet, nutrition and health context is becoming increasingly complex. Our ability to effectively address the daunting challenges presented by malnutrition in all its forms - both clinically and from a public health perspective - is constrained by a number of issues that coalesce around our understanding of nutrition and the what, why, and how of its assessment. This complexity is further enhanced when screening, assessment, diagnosis, and care are often performed in different settings (hospital vs. school vs. home), across populations, and with a limited care team (e.g., certain care teams may only have a nurse or dietitian within a school district). In this perspective, we make the case that our ability to improve the precision of assessment, diagnosis, and intervention demands a view of nutrition as a biological variable: a complex system resulting from the interactions between our internal (biology, health status, developmental stage, genetics, etc.) and external (social determinants of health [SDOH], home, community, physical) environments, i.e., a nutrition ecology. We offer both: (i) a conceptual framework for more effectively integrating nutrition in medical assessment and etiology-based care; and (ii) suggest solutions to overcome some of the systematic challenges in the clinical care continuum. Leveraging the concept of nutrition as a biological variable which emphasizes the integration of both internal and external variables into an assessment within the Nutrition Care Process model allows for both the identification of the nutrition problem but also the root cause (etiology) of the problem. Suggestions are offered for how to integrate this approach from both a clinical and public health perspective.",

This review will focus on the relationship between vitamin D and infections, specifically on Tuberculosis (TB). The literature review was conducted on PubMed using the search terms \"Vitamin D\" and \"Tuberculosis\". As one of the most resilient infectious microorganisms on the planet, TB remains a public health concern due to the emergence of resistant strains, the burden and side effects of treatment. Vitamin D plays an important role in the innate immune system which is the first line of defense against TB infection. Although there appears to be pathophysiological interplay between vitamin D and TB, more research is necessary to determine with certainty the extent of this relationship. Social determinants of health including population density, income, poverty, public assistance, unemployment, and education also play a role in estimating the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and the burden of TB. This review explores the interplay between vitamin D and TB through factors including the immune system and social determinants of health.",

    "abstract": "Metabolomics is a post-genomic, systems-based discipline offering valuable applications in nutrition research, including the use of objective biomarkers to characterise dietary intake and metabolic responses more accurately. A scoping review identified the need for reporting guidance on dietary information in the form of a checklist to ensure reproducibility of human feeding studies that are measuring the diet-related metabolome. Here, we aimed to gain consensus on a core outcome set (COS) pertaining to diet-related item details (DID) and recommendations for reporting DIDs to inform development of a reporting checklist. The goal of this checklist is to guide researchers on the minimum level of content and detail required for reporting dietary information in human feeding studies measuring the metabolome. A two-stage online Delphi process encompassing five survey rounds with international experts in clinical trial design, feeding study intervention implementation, metabolomics, and/or human biospecimen analyses was conducted. A COS encompassing twenty-nine core DIDs and accompanying recommendations was developed across 5 domains: Dietary Intervention - Modelling (8 DIDs), Dietary Intervention - Implementation (3 DIDs), Dietary Assessment (9 DIDs), Adherence and Compliance Monitoring (4 DIDs), and Bias (5 DIDs). The reporting guideline (DID-METAB Checklist) was generated and accepted by the international expert working group in the final survey round. All experts agreed that relevant journals should include the checklist as a suggested reporting tool for relevant studies and/or used alongside existing reporting tools. This report provides examples, explanations and elaboration for each recommendation including examples from published literature and references. The DID-METAB Checklist will be a key tool to advance the standardised reporting for feeding studies assessing the metabolome. Implementation of this tool will enable the ability to better interpret data and ensure global utility of results for furthering the advancement of metabolomics in nutrition research and future precision and personalised nutrition strategies.",

    "abstract": "Food insecurity (FI) remains a significant crisis in the United States, disproportionately affecting college students at nearly 4 times the national household average. There are a multitude of competing factors that affect food security (FS) in college, thus making it difficult to design effective interventions. This scoping review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of recent research exploring the diverse factors that impact FS among college students. Using the Social Cognitive Theory as a guiding framework, this review aimed to identify key influences on FI, address gaps in the literature, and highlight effective interventions that can enhance FS among this vulnerable population. This review highlights how personal/cognitive factors, behaviors, and environmental components shape college students' experiences with FI. There is a need for targeted interventions, resources, and policy changes that can help address FS-related challenges effectively in higher education.",

    "abstract": "Environmental pollution, sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy dietary patterns have been hypothesized as the main modifiable factors of human semen quality decline. The study aimed to assess the associations between an a priori-defined Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) adherence and semen quality parameters or medically assisted reproductive (MAR) outcomes in males. A systematic review was conducted with studies from PubMed, Embase, or Scopus databases until October 2024. A priori-defined MedDiet adherence was considered as exposure and conventional semen quality parameters as the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included MAR outcomes, reproductive hormone concentrations, and sperm DNA fragmentation. A quality assessment was performed using the NHLBI tool. Meta-analysis was conducted following Cochrane guidelines. A subgroup analysis was done for healthy participants and those from fertility clinics separately. A sensitivity analysis was performed to check the influential studies. A qualitative analysis was performed on 11 eligible articles (n = 2558 individuals). Data from 9 observational studies showed a positive association between the adherence to MedDiet and semen volume (1/9), sperm concentration (5/9 studies), count (5/9), total motility (5/9), progressive motility (4/9), vitality (1/9), normal morphology (2/9), or follicular stimulating hormone (1/9). Among these, the links between MedDiet adherence and MAR outcomes were prospectively explored only in 1 study, which reported no association. A total of 8 studies were eligible for meta-analysis (n = 1835 individuals). Total MedDiet adherence showed a significant positive association with sperm count (24.37 M spz.; 1.30-47.44; I2 = 89%), total motility (8.81%; 2.26-15.37; I2 = 88%), progressive motility (7.49%; 1.47-13.50; I2 = 86%), and normal morphology (1.02%; 0.21-1.82; I2 = 77%). Evidence from 2 randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of MedDiet on semen parameters aligns with the primary results. Evidence from observational studies and clinical trials shows potential benefit of adhering to a MedDiet in terms of seminal quality parameters, but not fertility outcomes. This study was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42024584003.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular concerns exist about the effect of red meat on circulating concentrations of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), an emerging cardiovascular risk factor. The aim was to conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of higher red meat intake, compared to lower intake, on circulating, urinary and fecal TMAO concentrations in generally healthy adults and/or adults with stable chronic diseases. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Collaboration Library, and Web of Science. RCTs examining the effect of a ≥7-day dietary intervention featuring red meat on urinary, fecal and/or circulating (plasma or serum) concentration of TMAO in adults (≥18 years) were included. Eligible trials had a comparator group/condition that was exposed to a dietary intervention for ≥ 7 days lower in red meat and featuring white meat, fish, eggs, dairy, or plant-based protein sources. In total, 375 publications were identified. Fifteen publications reporting the results of 13 RCTs (n=553; median duration 28 days), including 15 diet comparisons, were eligible. In six comparisons, higher circulating or urinary TMAO concentrations were observed following higher red meat intake (∼71-420 g/day) compared to comparator conditions lower in red meat. In seven comparisons, no differences in serum/plasma TMAO concentrations were observed with higher red meat-containing diets (∼60-156 g/day) compared to diets lower in red meat. Two comparisons showed that consuming higher red meat diets lowered TMAO concentrations after 28 days compared to lower red meat diets containing seafood. In short-term studies (median duration of 28 days), higher red meat intake had inconsistent effects on circulating and urinary TMAO concentrations. Further high-quality research on red meat-related TMAO modulation, including effect magnitude and clinical relevance, is needed. REGISTRY AND REGISTRY NUMBER FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OR META-ANALYSES: Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) registration number: CRD42023396799 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This systematic review summarizes evidence on the effect of higher red meat intake, compared to lower intake of red meat, on circulating, urinary, and fecal concentrations of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in generally healthy adults and/or adults with stable chronic diseases. Higher red meat intake had inconsistent effects on TMAO concentrations, which may be partly related to differences in clinical trial methodology, inter-individual variability in diet-related TMAO modulation, and/or the overall healthfulness of the red meat-containing diet.",

    "abstract": "Multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS) in pregnancy reduces risk of infant low birthweight (LBW) and improves other maternal and infant outcomes compared with iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements alone. However, the impact of timing of initiation and adherence on the MMS effectiveness in real-world programs remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a 2-stage individual participant data meta-analysis that included 15 randomized trials (61,204 pregnant women) and assessed whether the relative effect of MMS differed by the following: adherence alone; adherence in combination with gestational age at initiation; and the total number of tablets taken. We also evaluated the observational association of these factors with outcomes among participants who received MMS. Compared with IFA supplements, the relative effect of MMS on the primary outcome of continuous birthweight was greater with higher adherence (P-interaction < 0.05). Among women who took ≥90% of supplements, MMS increased birthweight by 56 g (95% CI: 45, 67 g), whereas among women who took <60% of supplements, there was no difference in birthweight between MMS and IFA supplements [mean difference (MD): 9 g; 95% CI: -17, 35 g). Higher adherence was also associated with greater effect of MMS on LBW and birthweight-for-gestational age centile and women who took more supplements experienced a greater relative impact of MMS on birthweight-for-gestational age centile and small-for-gestational age births (SGA) as compared with IFA supplements. Observational analyses among participants who received MMS showed that ≥90% adherence was associated with increased birthweight (MD: 44 g; 95% CI: 31, 56 g) and lower risk of LBW [relative risk (RR): 0.93 g; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.98 g] and small-for-gestational age (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.98), whereas <75% adherence was associated with greater risk of stillbirth (RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.83) and maternal anemia (RR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.43) than 75%-90% adherence. Programs should invest in strategies that promote early initiation and high adherence to MMS. This trial was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42022319207.",

    "abstract": "The reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes associated with nut consumption may occur via modulation of the gut microbiota, although this has not been comprehensively assessed. This systematic review of clinical trials aims to assess the effects of nuts on gut microbiota composition and metabolites in adults. Further, it examines the effects of nuts on gut function and symptoms in adults. The systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023451282). Outcomes included microbiota diversity, specific bacterial abundances, gastrointestinal symptoms, intestinal permeability, faecal pH, faecal moisture, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) concentrations. We performed meta-analyses to assess the overall effect of nuts on faecal moisture, pH, intestinal permeability and SCFA concentrations. Amongst the 28 intervention trials included in this review, almonds were the most commonly studied (12 trials), while other nuts, such as walnuts, peanuts, pistachios and Brazil nuts, were also examined. Nineteen articles reported the effects of almond, walnut, peanut or mixed nuts on the microbiota composition. Additionally, 6 trials used interventions involving a mixture of different nuts. A total of 19 trials assessed the community structure of the gut microbiota through the assessment of α-and β-diversity metrics, with most finding no significant differences following nut intervention. Regarding taxonomic changes, the majority of studies reported no significant changes across nut interventions. However, several studies noted increases in Clostridium and Roseburia, with mixed results for Bifidobacterium abundance following almond or walnut intervention. Five studies assessed faecal SCFA concentrations, with positive effects of nut interventions on propionate. There were no effects of nut interventions on faecal pH and intestinal permeability, with an unfavourable effect on faecal moisture. In summary, the available evidence indicates that nuts have modest effects on gut health, but the substantial heterogeneity between studies may hinder further conclusions.

This scoping review was commissioned by the WHO for the development of a new guideline on optimal intake of animal-source foods and aimed to collect and describe the evidence available on animal-source foods and health outcomes. A systematic search of Embase, Medline, and PubMed, complemented with a search of recent nutrition guidelines, was conducted to identify systematic, scoping, and umbrella reviews published between 2019 and 2024. Reviews of prospective observational and interventional studies with participants ≥2 y from the general population, including pregnant women, assessing the effects of animal-source foods (red meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy) and as comparators selected protein-rich plant-source foods on any health outcome were included. Using a mining approach, prospective observational and interventional primary studies identified in the reviews were extracted. Research availability and gaps were depicted using evidence maps. From the 7458 records identified, a total of 652 reviews were included, encompassing 1626 eligible publications from 488 unique cohorts in 65 countries and 480 eligible publications from 387 unique trials in 37 countries. Single health outcomes were grouped together into 29 groups. The most often researched outcome groups were cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, body weight and composition, and all-cause mortality. Evidence gaps were identified in older adults, children, and pregnant women, in food-insecure settings, in Sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South East Asia. This scoping review offers a comprehensive overview of existing evidence on animal-source foods and health outcomes and identifies key research gaps to support the development of new nutrition guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Wine has long been studied for its cardioprotective effects, exemplified by the French Paradox-the observation of relatively lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) rates in the French population despite high dietary cholesterol and saturated fat intake, historically attributed to resveratrol and other bioactive factors from wine consumption. Recent findings suggest that the moderate consumption of wine could impact health well beyond CVD risk, including effects on intestinal physiology and gut microbial diversity and function. For example, wine contains a rich array of polyphenols, organic acids, and oligosaccharides, which may interact with the gut microbiota to alter microbial communities and to promote metabolism of wine-derived compounds into a diverse range of xenometabolites (microbe-produced metabolites) with local and systemic effects on the host. This interplay underscores the potential mechanisms by which moderate wine consumption impacts gut and systemic health. Furthermore, since wine is often consumed with meals, there is a critical need to understand how specific foods intersect with wine's chemical complexity to influence physiology in the gut and body-wide. This review explores how advancements in multi-omics technologies can be leveraged to characterize wine's \"dark matter\" and to consider interactions of wine components with complex food matrices to influence gut health. This framework holds potential to enhance our understanding of how moderate consumption of wine influences health and to inform the development of functional food innovations derived from wine's molecular components.",

Using a combination of quantitative analyses of longitudinal and cross-sectional data and a review of the literature, we investigated whether the GMP platform could improve ECD by identifying children at risk of poor development and delivering responsive parenting education to caregivers of young children. Cross-sectional and lagged regression analyses and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that growth indices were not accurate predictors of concurrent and later child development. Rather, validated tools, such as the Ages and Stages Questionnaire or the Survey of Well-being of Young Children, could be utilized during GMP visits to screen individual children for suboptimal development. Through a review of published literature on ECD interventions, we identified 10 light-touch ECD interventions that could feasibly be implemented during GMP visits, but only half have been evaluated for their effectiveness. Our findings demonstrate that, although growth indices cannot accurately identify children at risk of suboptimal development, the GMP platform could offer an opportunity to screen children for suboptimal development and to deliver ECD interventions. Further evidence on the implementation and effectiveness of light-touch parenting programs, however, is required.",

Iron supplementation has been shown to increase malaria risk in these groups in numerous studies, although this effect is likely diminished by factors such as host immunity, host iron status, and effective malaria surveillance and control. Conversely, the risk of anemia is increased by malaria infections and preventive measures against malaria decrease anemia prevalence in susceptible populations without iron supplementation. Studies have shown that subjects with malaria experience diminished absorption of orally administered iron, so that as a consequence, iron supplementation may have generally reduced efficacy in malarious populations. A possible mechanistic link between malaria, poor absorption of iron, and anemia is provided by recent research on hepcidin, the human iron control hormone. Our improved understanding of iron metabolism may contribute to the control of malaria and the treatment of anemia. Malaria surveillance and control are necessary components of programs to control iron deficiency and may enhance the efficacy of iron supplementation.",

    "abstract": "Reported values for concentrations of micronutrients in human milk form the basis of the majority of micronutrient intake recommendations for infants and the additional maternal requirements for lactation. The infant recommendations may also be extrapolated to provide estimates for young children. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the adequacy of the milk micronutrient concentration data used by the Institute of Medicine to set recommendations for the United States and Canada, by FAO/WHO, the United Kingdom, and the European Food Safety Authority. The concentrations accepted by each agency are presented for each micronutrient accompanied by the source of information and comments on the number, location, status, and stage of lactation of the sample population, where known. These summaries show the small number of participants from which samples were collected in most studies, the wide range of concentrations within studies, the lack of longitudinal data, and the variability in collection methods. These factors contribute to the variability in nutrient intake recommendations among committees, although this variability is reduced by some committees that accept milk-composition values proposed by others. Values are also summarized from milk collected in studies in which mothers or infants were known to be deficient on the basis of clinical symptoms, biomarkers of inadequacy, or both, to show the extent to which milk micronutrients can be reduced by poor maternal nutritional status. We conclude that a new, multicenter study is needed to establish reference values for milk constituents across lactation.",

    "abstract": "Dietary surveys in low-income countries (LICs) are hindered by low investment in the necessary research infrastructure, including a lack of basic technology for data collection, links to food composition information, and data processing. The result has been a dearth of dietary data in many LICs because of the high cost and time burden associated with dietary surveys, which are typically carried out by interviewers using pencil and paper. This study reviewed innovative dietary assessment technologies and gauged their suitability to improve the quality and time required to collect dietary data in LICs. Predefined search terms were used to identify technologies from peer-reviewed and gray literature. A total of 78 technologies were identified and grouped into 6 categories: 1) computer- and tablet-based, 2) mobile-based, 3) camera-enabled, 4) scale-based, 5) wearable, and 6) handheld spectrometers. For each technology, information was extracted on a number of overarching factors, including the primary purpose, mode of administration, and data processing capabilities. Each technology was then assessed against predetermined criteria, including requirements for respondent literacy, battery life, requirements for connectivity, ability to measure macro- and micronutrients, and overall appropriateness for use in LICs. Few technologies reviewed met all the criteria, exhibiting both practical constraints and a lack of demonstrated feasibility for use in LICs, particularly for large-scale, population-based surveys. To increase collection of dietary data in LICs, development of a contextually adaptable, interviewer-administered dietary assessment platform is recommended. Additional investments in the research infrastructure are equally important to ensure time and cost savings for the user.",

    "abstract": "The WHO has proposed that health be promoted and protected through the development of an environment that enables sustainable actions at individual, community, national, and global levels. Indeed, food-based dietary guidelines, i.e., food pyramids, have been developed in numerous countries to disseminate nutritional information to the general population. However, wider recommendations are needed, with information on an active healthy lifestyle, not just healthy eating. The objective of the present work is to propose a three-dimensional pyramid as a new strategy for promoting adequate nutrition and active healthy lifestyles in a sustainable way. Indeed, the Iberoamerican Nutrition Foundation (FINUT) pyramid of healthy lifestyles has been designed as a tetrahedron, with its 3 lateral faces corresponding to the facets of food and nutrition, physical activity and rest, and education and hygiene. Each lateral face is divided into 2 triangles. These faces show the following: 1) food-based guidelines and healthy eating habits as related to a sustainable environment; 2) recommendations for rest and physical activity and educational, social, and cultural issues; and 3) selected hygiene and educational guidelines that, in conjunction with the other 2 faces, would contribute to better health for people in a sustainable planet. The new FINUT pyramid is addressed to the general population of all ages and should serve as a guide for living a healthy lifestyle within a defined social and cultural context. It includes an environmental and sustainability dimension providing measures that should contribute to the prevention of noncommunicable chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Assessing outcomes and the impact from behavioral nutrition interventions has remained challenging because of the lack of methods available beyond traditional nutrition assessment tools and techniques. With the current high global obesity and related chronic disease rates, novel methods to evaluate the impact of behavioral nutrition-based interventions are much needed. The objective of this narrative review is to describe and review the current status of knowledge as it relates to 4 different innovative methods or tools to assess behavioral nutrition interventions. Methods reviewed include 1) the assessment of stress and stress responsiveness to enhance the evaluation of nutrition interventions, 2) eye-tracking technology in nutritional interventions, 3) smartphone biosensors to assess nutrition and health-related outcomes, and 4) skin carotenoid measurements to assess fruit and vegetable intake. Specifically, the novel use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, by characterizing the brain's responsiveness to an intervention, can help researchers develop programs with greater efficacy. Similarly, if eye-tracking technology can enable researchers to get a better sense as to how participants view materials, the materials may be better tailored to create an optimal impact. The latter 2 techniques reviewed, smartphone biosensors and methods to detect skin carotenoids, can provide the research community with portable, effective, nonbiased ways to assess dietary intake and quality and more in the field. The information gained from using these types of methodologies can improve the efficacy and assessment of behavior-based nutrition interventions.",

    "abstract": "A better understanding of the genetic underpinning of total energy, carbohydrate, and fat intake is a prerequisite to develop personalized dietary recommendations. For this purpose, we systematically reviewed associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and total energy, carbohydrate, and fat intakes. Four databases were searched for studies that assessed an association between SNPs and total energy, carbohydrate, and fat intakes. Screening of articles and data extraction was performed independently by 2 reviewers. Articles in English or German language, published between 1994 and September 2017, on human studies in adults and without specific populations were considered for the review. In total, 39 articles, including 86 independent loci, met the inclusion criteria. The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene as well as the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) locus were most frequently studied. Limited significant evidence of an association between the FTO SNP rs9939609 and lower total energy intake and between the MC4R SNP rs17782313 and higher total energy intake was reported. Most of the other identified loci showed inconsistent results. In conclusion, there is no consistent evidence that the investigated SNPs are associated with and predictive for total energy, carbohydrate, and fat intakes.",

    "abstract": "Improving nutritional status during adolescence is an opportunity to improve the lives of this generation and the next. Estimating the burden of malnutrition at a population level is fundamental to targeting interventions and measuring progress over time, and for adolescents, we usually depend on survey data and the 2007 WHO Growth Reference to do so. There is substantial risk of misguided conclusions regarding adolescent prevalence estimates, however, when underlying methodological limitations of the indicators and reference are not adequately considered. We use national prevalence estimates among girls and young women 10-22 y of age from the 2014 State of Food Security and Nutrition in Bangladesh report as an example to demonstrate that determining the true prevalence of undernutrition, overweight, and obesity is complicated by racial/ethnic variation across populations in timing of the adolescent growth spurt, growth potential, and body build. Further challenging the task are inherent limitations of the body mass index as an indicator of thinness and adiposity, and cutoffs that poorly distinguish a well-nourished population from a malnourished one. We provide recommendations for adolescent nutrition policy and program decision-making, emphasizing the importance of 1) critically interpreting indicators and distributions by age when using the 2007 WHO Growth Reference; 2) examining what is happening before and after adolescence, when interpretation of anthropometry is more straightforward, as well as trends over time; and 3) complementing anthropometry with other information, particularly dietary intake. Finally, we advocate that nutrition researchers prioritize exploration of better methods to predict peak height velocity, for development of standardized indicators to measure dietary quality among adolescents, and for studies that will illuminate causal paths so that we can effectively improve adolescent dietary intake and nutritional status.",

    "abstract": "Weekly iron and folic acid supplementation (WIFAS) is among the 8 key effective actions for improving adolescent nutrition included by the WHO in the 2018 guidelines. However, at present WIFAS in the WHO-recommended formulation is not included in the Model Essential Medicines List (MEML), limiting the potential for countries to import, produce, and prioritize this formulation as part of their national supply management and procurement plans for medicines. The WHO WIFAS guideline presents evidence that the formulation reduces anemia, but not that folic acid reduces neural tube defects (NTDs), because sufficient evidence was unavailable at the time of the last review. Recently, a 3-arm, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled folic acid efficacy trial on WIFAS was conducted to address this evidence gap. The study population included 331 women (18-45 y old), randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups, including a supplement with 60 mg Fe as ferrous fumarate and either 0 mg, 0.4 mg, or 2.8 mg of folic acid, to be consumed once weekly for 16 wk, followed by a 4-wk washout period. In this article we critically review how the outcomes of this folic acid efficacy trial, and how the evidence generated, could potentially be used to inform WHO WIFAS guidelines for the potential inclusion of this formulation on the MEML, and how this, in turn, may affect product availability. If the new evidence on weekly folic acid is assessed as adequately reducing the risk of NTDs, a guideline revision could be warranted and WIFAS could be presented to the MEML for the dual benefits of anemia reduction and NTD prevention. This inclusion could enable acceleration of implementing policies and programs to contribute to global anemia and NTD reduction efforts.",

    "abstract": "Healthy eating patterns, as described by dietary guidelines, typically favor whole grains, low-fat dairy, vegetables, fruit, legumes, and nuts and seeds. Nutrient-profiling (NP) models capture nutrient density of individual foods and can inform healthier food choices. Although whole grains are prominently featured in most dietary guidelines, they are not included in most NP models. Healthy foods, as identified by most NP models, are those that contain limited amounts of energy, saturated fat, total or added sugar, and sodium. As global dietary guidance turns to foods and food groups as opposed to individual nutrients, future nutrient-density metrics may need to do the same. Potential methods to incorporate whole grains into the overall concept of nutrient density and into selected NP models are outlined in this review. Incorporating whole grains into the Nutri-Score, Health Star Rating, or the Nutrient Rich Food index will require further analyses of dietary nutrient density in relation to health outcomes across diverse population subgroups. We present the rationale for how the inclusion of whole grains in NP models can assist in the implementation of dietary guidance.",

    "abstract": "Infants are vulnerable consumers and highly depend on dietary proteins for growth and development during their first months of life. Infant formula (IF) and follow-on formula (FOF) have been developed to meet these requirements, although few protein sources are currently allowed to be used. At the same time, allergies to these available protein sources are becoming more frequent. There is thus a need to explore alternative protein sources for infant nutrition. One alternative could be quinoa, which is a pseudocereal that is naturally free from gluten and has a high protein content and quality. This review assessed the composition, nutritional properties, and applicability of quinoa proteins for IF and FOF as well as the legal framework for their use in the European Union (EU). The protein quality of isolated quinoa proteins (IQPs) is relatively high compared with other plant-based proteins like rice. Besides, during the protein isolation process, unfavorable compounds are mostly removed, ensuring that the final product can comply with the maximum residue concentrations allowed. Overall, IF and FOF are strictly regulated under the Foods for Specific Groups (FSG) Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 and more research is needed before the introduction of IQP in such products is considered, but this review shows it has several promising features that warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that supplementation with carnosine, or its rate-limiting precursor β-alanine, can ameliorate aspects of metabolic dysregulation that occur in diabetes and its related conditions. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of carnosine or β-alanine supplementation on markers of glycemic control and insulin resistance in humans and animals. We performed a systematic search of 6 electronic databases up to 31 December 2020. Primary outcomes were changes in 1) fasting glucose, 2) glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and 3) 2-h glucose following a glucose-tolerance test. A set of additional outcomes included fasting insulin and homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 2.0 (human studies) and the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) RoB (animal studies) tools; and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess certainty. We used Bayesian hierarchical random-effects models, with informative priors for human data and noninformative priors for animal data. Inferences were made on posterior samples generated by Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo using 90% credible intervals (90% CrI) and calculated probabilities. Twenty studies (n = 4 human, n = 16 rodent) were included, providing data for 2 primary outcomes (fasting glucose and HbA1c) and 3 additional outcomes (fasting insulin, HOMA-β, and HOMA-IR). The model provides evidence that supplementation decreases fasting glucose [humans: mean difference (MD)0.5 = -0.95 mmol · L-1 (90% CrI: -2.1, 0.08); rodent: MD0.5 = -2.26 mmol · L-1 (90% CrI: -4.03, -0.44)], HbA1c [humans: MD0.5 = -0.91% (90% CrI: -1.46, -0.39); rodents: MD0.5 = -1.05% (90% CrI: -1.64, -0.52)], HOMA-IR [humans: standardized mean difference (SMD)0.5 = -0.41 (90% CrI: -0.82, -0.07); rodents: SMD0.5 = -0.63 (90% CrI: -1.98, 0.65)], and fasting insulin [humans: SMD0.5 = -0.41 (90% CrI: -0.77, -0.07)]. GRADE assessment showed our certainty in the effect estimate of each outcome to be moderate (human outcomes) or very low (rodent outcomes). Supplementation with carnosine or β-alanine may reduce fasting glucose, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR in humans and rodents, and fasting insulin in humans; both compounds show potential as therapeutics to improve glycemic control and insulin resistance.

    "abstract": "Whether older adults need more protein than younger adults is debated. The population reference intake for adults set by the European Food Safety Authority is 0.83 g/kg body weight (BW)/d based primarily on nitrogen balance studies, but the underlying data on health outcomes are outdated. An expert committee of the Health Council of the Netherlands conducted a systematic review (SR) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effect of increased protein intake on health outcomes in older adults from the general population with an average habitual protein intake ≥0.8 g/(kg BW · d). Exposures were the following: 1) extra protein compared with no protein and 2) extra protein and physical exercise compared with physical exercise. Outcomes included lean body mass, muscle strength, physical performance, bone health, blood pressure, serum glucose and insulin, serum lipids, kidney function, and cognition. Data of >1300 subjects from 18 RCTs were used. Risk of bias was judged as high (n = 9) or \"some concerns\" (n = 9). In 7 of 18 RCTs, increased protein intake beneficially affected ≥1 of the tested outcome measures of lean body mass. For muscle strength, this applied to 3 of 8 RCTs in the context of physical exercise and in 1 of 7 RCTs without physical exercise. For the other outcomes, <30% (0-29%) of RCTs showed a statistically significant effect. The committee concluded that increased protein intake has a possible beneficial effect on lean body mass and, when combined with physical exercise, muscle strength; likely no effect on muscle strength when not combined with physical exercise, or on physical performance and bone health; an ambiguous effect on serum lipids; and that too few RCTs were available to allow for conclusions on the other outcomes. This SR provides insufficiently convincing data that increasing protein in older adults with a protein intake ≥0.8 g/(kg BW · d) elicits health benefits.",

If conclusive data on quantitative nutrient requirements are not available, the composition of human milk (HM) can provide some initial guidance on the infant formula composition. This paper provides a narrative review of the current knowledge, unresolved questions, and future research needs in the area of HM fatty acid (FA) composition, with a particular focus on exploring appropriate intake levels of the essential FA linoleic acid (LA) in infant formula. The paper highlights a clear gap in clinical evidence as to the impact of LA levels in HM or formula on infant outcomes, such as growth, development, and long-term health. The available preclinical information suggests potential disadvantages of high LA intake in the early postnatal period. We recommend performing well-designed clinical intervention trials to create clarity on optimal levels of LA to achieve positive impacts on both short-term growth and development and long-term functional health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Bread is a major source of grain-derived carbohydrates worldwide. High intakes of refined grains, low in dietary fiber and high in glycemic index, are linked with increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other chronic diseases. Hence, improvements in the composition of bread could influence population health. This systematic review evaluated the effect of regular consumption of reformulated breads on glycemic control among healthy adults, adults at cardiometabolic risk or with manifest T2DM. A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Eligible studies employed a bread intervention (≥2 wk) in adults (healthy, at cardiometabolic risk or manifest T2DM) and reported glycemic outcomes (fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1c, and postprandial glucose responses). Data were pooled using generic inverse variance with random-effects model and presented as mean difference (MD) or standardized MD between treatments with 95% CIs. Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 1037 participants). Compared with \"regular\" or comparator bread, consumption of reformulated intervention breads yielded lower fasting blood glucose concentrations (MD: −0.21 mmol/L; 95% CI: −0.38, −0.03; I2 = 88%, moderate certainty of evidence), yet no differences in fasting insulin (MD: −1.59 pmol/L; 95% CI: −5.78, 2.59; I2 = 38%, moderate certainty of evidence), HOMA-IR (MD: −0.09; 95% CI: −0.35, 0.23; I2 = 60%, moderate certainty of evidence), HbA1c (MD: −0.14; 95% CI: −0.39, 0.10; I2 = 56%, very low certainty of evidence), or postprandial glucose response (SMD: −0.46; 95% CI: −1.28, 0.36; I2 = 74%, low certainty of evidence). Subgroup analyses revealed a beneficial effect for fasting blood glucose only among people with T2DM (low certainty of evidence). Our findings suggest a beneficial effect of reformulated breads high in dietary fiber, whole grains, and/or functional ingredients on fasting blood glucose concentrations in adults, primarily among those with T2DM.

    "abstract": "Determining calcium requirements for infants and children is vital due to high calcium needs for growth. Balance studies enable comprehensive measurement of calcium metabolism and can support nutrient requirement development. This systematic review summarizes evidence from mass balance and isotopic studies in children aged 0-4 y to address key questions on calcium loss and absorption/retention identified by an expert group developing calcium requirements. Literature searches were implemented in multiple electronic databases to June 2020. Balance studies assessing calcium intake, loss, absorption, or retention in healthy children were eligible. A newly developed risk-of-bias assessment tool was used for balance studies, and a modified Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach determined strength of evidence. Altogether, 23 studies (15 mass balance; 8 isotope) with 485 total participants were included. Only 3 studies were of children >6 mo. Mass balance studies suggested infant feed components may influence calcium balance. The random-effects model meta-regression on 42 mass balance study arms showed an average net calcium retention of 40.4% among infants aged 0-6 mo (β = 0.404 [95% CI: 0.302, 0.506]). Isotope studies suggested calcium intake of 240 to 400 mg/d may promote optimal calcium absorption with minimal loss, and intake from human milk may lead to greater absorption and retention efficacy than formula or solid foods. Most studies had low risk of bias. Strength of evidence was low due to variability in infant feedings, limited endogenous and dermal calcium loss measures, and few studies isolating calcium effects. To improve certainty of the body of evidence, more balance studies isolating effects of calcium intake in this age group are needed. Future work on calcium needs should incorporate both balance measures and biological endpoints of importance (e.g. bone mineral density or content) to determine adequate calcium intake for growth in infants and children.",

This review aimed to comprehensively describe, and explore characteristics of, national strategies to reduce sodium concentrations in packaged foods, and assess progress toward achieving national goals. A secondary aim was to understand the number, type, and variation of food category sodium targets set by countries compared with WHO global sodium benchmarks. National sodium reduction reformulation strategies were identified from a search of peer-reviewed and gray literature up to December 2019 supplemented by verified information from key contacts and experts up to December 2020. Key characteristics of countries' strategies were extracted, synthesized, and descriptively analyzed, including details of reformulation strategies and evaluation data. Country targets were mapped to the WHO global sodium benchmarks, and the number and variation of country sodium targets by WHO food categories were determined. Sixty-two countries had reformulation strategies to reduce sodium in packaged foods, and 19 countries had evaluated their reformulation strategies. Forty-three countries had sodium targets, which varied in type of targets (maximum sodium concentration: n = 26; maximum concentration plus relative reduction/average/sales-weighted average: n = 8; relative reduction: n = 7; average: n = 2), number of food category targets (range: n = 1 to 150), and regulatory approach (voluntary: n = 28; mandatory: n = 9; both: n = 6). Eight of 34 countries mapped to the WHO benchmarks had targets for just 1 specified food category (bread products). One-third of all countries were implementing national strategies to reduce sodium concentrations in packaged foods including establishing targets and/or processes for industry engagement. This review determined that there is scope to improve most countries' strategies. There has been limited progress in implementing and evaluating strategies between 2014 and 2019, and regional and income-level disparities persist. The WHO global sodium benchmarks present an important opportunity to accelerate reformulation action globally.",

This review aimed to synthesize the contribution of biological age-predictive biomarkers to nutrition research and highlight the implications for future research and clinical practice. MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL were systematically searched on 30 September 2021 for randomized controlled trials and cross-sectional studies examining the association between nutrition and biological age in older adults reporting on genetic, clinical, or molecular biomarkers of biological aging. Cochrane's ROB 2 and ROBINS-I were used to assess the quality of included studies. Synthesis was undertaken narratively. Of 1245 records identified from the search, 13 studies from 8 countries and territories, involving 5043 participants, were included. Seven studies assessed associations between nutrient food intake and telomere attrition, reporting protective effects for branched-chain amino acids, calcium and vitamin D, and a diet of a lower inflammatory index; whereas they found shorter telomeres in people consuming more processed foods and arachidonic acid and other proinflammatory compounds. Five studies examined the associations between plasma nutrition biomarkers and cognitive function, and found a protective effect for HDL cholesterol, lycopene, carotenoids, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids, and vitamins B, C, D, and E; whereas trans fatty acids and fibrinogen correlated with a decline in cognitive function. One study used Horvath's clock and reported the epigenetic rejuvenation effect of a Mediterranean diet. In conclusion, biological aging was negatively associated with an anti-inflammatory diet. However, a few studies did not control for the confounding effect of other lifestyle factors. Future research should address this and also assess the synergistic effect of different nutrients, their combinations, and evaluate their dose-response relations. Nutrition practice can incorporate updated screening procedures for older people that include relevant biological aging nutrition markers, leading to anti-aging precision nutrition therapy. The methodology of this systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021288122).",

A systematic search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases up to June 2021 to find eligible studies. Review articles or commentaries, clinical trials, cross-sectional studies, studies on gestational or type 1 diabetes patients, animal studies, articles with no access to full-texts, articles published in non-English languages, and articles with missing critical data needed for the systematic review were excluded from the meta-analysis. A random-effects model was used to combine study-specific results. Thirteen cohort studies with 361,686 participants and 11,865 T2DM events were included. Dietary total SFA intake, as well as dietary palmitic acid (PA) or stearic acid (SA) were not associated with risk of T2DM when the highest was compared with the lowest intake category (HR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.09; n = 13 for total SFAs; HR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.15; n = 4 for PA; and HR = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.49; n = 4 for SA). However, the risk of T2DM decreased by 11% in the highest compared with the lowest category of dietary lauric acid (HR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.97; n = 2), and by 17% in the highest compared with lowest category of dietary myristic acid (MA) (HR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.92; n = 3). There was evidence of publication bias among studies on dietary total SFAs and T2DM. Our results indicated no significant association between dietary total SFA and risk of T2DM. However, dietary intake of MA was negatively associated with developing T2DM.",

    "abstract": "There is emerging evidence of associations between intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), those that include various forms of added sugar, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but whether consumption of other dietary sources of fructose affects CVD is unclear. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine potential dose-response relationships between such foods and CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke morbidity and mortality. We systematically searched the literature indexed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from the inception of each database to February 10, 2022. We included prospective cohort studies analyzing the association between at least 1 dietary source of fructose and CVD, CHD, and stroke. Based on data from 64 included studies, summary HRs and 95% CIs were calculated for the highest intake category compared with the lowest, and dose-response analyses were performed. Of all fructose sources examined, only SSB intakes showed positive associations with CVD, giving summary HRs per 250 mL/d increase of 1.10 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.17) for CVD, 1.11 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.17) for CHD, 1.08 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.13) for stroke morbidity, and 1.06 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.10) for CVD mortality. Conversely, 3 dietary sources showed protective associations: between fruits and CVD morbidity (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96, 0.98), fruits and CVD mortality (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.97), yogurt and CVD mortality (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.99), and breakfast cereals and CVD mortality (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.90). All these relationships were linear except for fruit, which was J-shaped: CVD morbidity was the lowest at 200 g/d and there was no protective association above 400 g/d. These findings indicate that the adverse associations between SSBs and CVD, CHD, and stroke morbidity and mortality do not extend to other dietary sources of fructose. The food matrix seemed to modify the association between fructose and cardiovascular outcomes.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to summarize the current data on the effects of zinc supplementation on lipid profiles in patients with T2DM. Three online databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched to find relevant studies published until September 2022. The exposure was zinc supplementation, and the outcomes were low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC). Fourteen randomized clinical trials consisting of 1067 patients were included in the statistical analysis. Significant improvement was observed in all 4 lipid profile components. Following zinc supplementation, a significant decrease was observed in TC (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -16.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -26.43, -5.89; P = 0.002), LDL (WMD: -6.18; 95% CI: -9.35, -3.02; P < 0.001), and TG (WMD: -13.08; 95% CI: -21.83, -4.34; P = 0.003). After analyzing 13 studies reporting HDL, a significant increase was seen (WMD: 3.76; 95% CI: 1.30, 6.22; P = 0.003). In a nonlinear dose-response analysis, a significant inverse association was observed between <12 wk zinc supplementation and TC, LDL, and TG (TC: WMD: -5, Pnonlinearity < 0.001; LDL: WMD: -5, Pnonlinearity = 0.07, TG: WMD: -16.5, Pnonlinearity = 0.006). Nonlinear dose-response analysis shows that the optimum elemental zinc dosage for the best response to the supplementation for TC, LDL, and TG are 120, 100, and 140 mg/d, respectively (TC: WMD: -5, Pnonlinearity < 0.001; LDL: WMD: -10, Pnonlinearity = 0.006, TG: WMD: -50, Pnonlinearity = 0.031). In conclusion, we found significant changes in all 4 components of the lipid profile through zinc supplementation in T2DM patients. Based on our findings, zinc supplementation may have profound favorable consequences on the lipid profile of T2DM patients, especially in the zinc-deficient group.",

Further investigation is necessary to determine the potential benefits of isoflavone therapy in managing cardiovascular health in this population. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of isoflavones on blood lipid concentrations in postmenopausal women. A comprehensive search was conducted in major databases for randomized controlled trials published between 2000 and 2023. 18 studies were included in the analysis, which examined the impact of isoflavone intake on blood lipids in postmenopausal women. Isoflavone consumption resulted in a significant reduction in triacylglycerol (TG) levels (-12.50 mg/dL, 95% CI: -23.09, -1.91) and a modest increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (1.83 mg/dL, 95% CI: 0.03, 3.64). Subgroup analysis showed that isoflavones significantly decreased TG (-15.79 mg/dL, 95% CI: -28.36, -3.22) and increased HDL-C (2.49 mg/dL, 95% CI: 1.80, 3.19) in postmenopausal women under 65 years old. No significant effects were observed in women over 65 years old. Both low (≤80 mg/day) and high (>80 mg/day) doses of isoflavones exhibited TG-lowering effects, while only the high dose increased HDL-C. Longer treatment duration (≥24 weeks) was associated with a significant reduction in TG, while HDL-C improvement occurred during the early period (<24 weeks) of supplementation. The consumption of isoflavones resulted in a significant reduction in TG levels and an increase in HDL-C levels among postmenopausal women under 65 years of age.",

    "abstract": "Poor sleep quality and insufficient sleep affect a large portion of the population. This is concerning given increasing evidence that poor sleep health is a behavioral risk factor for the development of cardiometabolic diseases. A healthy diet is associated with a plethora of favorable health outcomes, and emerging research now highlights diet as a potential determinant of sleep health that could be leveraged to improve sleep quality. Dairy products are notably rich in tryptophan (Trp), a key substrate for serotonin and melatonin production, which are instrumental for initiating and maintaining sleep. Furthermore, dairy products provide a range of micronutrients that serve as cofactors in the synthesis of melatonin from Trp, which could contribute to sleep-promoting effects. In this review, we evaluate population studies and clinical trials to examine a possible link between dairy consumption and sleep. Available epidemiologic studies illustrate positive associations between dairy intake and sleep outcomes. Moreover, some intervention studies support a causal effect of dairy intake on sleep. Given these data, we discuss potential mechanisms, invite additional clinical research on this topic, and provide insights on how limitations of current studies can be addressed in future trials.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the effects of prophylactic use of orally ingested probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics on GTI incidence, duration, and severity in nonelderly, nonhospitalized adults. CENTRAL, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched through January 2022. English-language, peer-reviewed publications of randomized, placebo-controlled studies testing an orally ingested probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic intervention of any dose for ≥1 wk in adults who were not hospitalized, immunosuppressed, or taking antibiotics were included. Results were analyzed using random-effects meta-analyses of intention-to-treat (ITT) and complete case (CC) cohorts. Heterogeneity was explored by subgroup meta-analysis and meta-regression. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias 2 tool. Seventeen publications reporting 20 studies of probiotics (n = 16), prebiotics (n = 3), and synbiotics (n = 1) were identified (n > 6994 subjects). In CC and ITT analyses, risk of experiencing ≥1 GTI was reduced with probiotics (CC analysis—risk ratio: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.01) and prebiotics (risk ratio: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.98). No effects on GTI duration or severity were observed. Sources of heterogeneity included the study population and number of probiotic strains administered but were often unexplained, and a high risk of bias was observed for most studies. The specific effects of individual probiotic strains and prebiotic types could not be assessed owing to a lack of confirmatory studies. Findings indicated that both orally ingested probiotics and prebiotics, relative to placebo, demonstrated modest benefit for reducing GTI risk in nonelderly adults. However, results should be interpreted cautiously owing to the low number of studies, high risk of bias, and unexplained heterogeneity that may include probiotic strain-specific or prebiotic-specific effects.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) poses an important burden of disease, which probably could be reduced by adopting healthy lifestyles like healthy body weight, healthy diet, and physical activity, among others. Many studies have reported that adherence to healthy lifestyles may decrease BC risk. The main objective of this study was to estimate a summary association of studies evaluating a healthy lifestyle index and BC risk. A systematic review and meta-analysis following the Cochrane methodology were carried out. Observational studies, including healthy lifestyle indices and their association with BC, were searched from 4 databases. For the meta-analysis, random-effects model was used to evaluate overall BC risk, BC by molecular subtype and menopausal status. Thirty-one studies were included in the systematic review, and 29 studies in the meta-analysis. When the highest vs. the lowest category to a healthy lifestyle index were compared, the study identified a 20% risk reduction for BC in prospective studies (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80 95% CI: 0.78, 0.83) and an odds ratio (OR) of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.86) for retrospective studies. The inverse association remained statistically significant when stratified by menopausal status, except for premenopausal BC in prospective studies. Furthermore, an inverse association was found for molecular subtypes estrogen receptor (ER+)/progesterone receptor (PR+): HR = 0.68 (95%CI: 0.63, 0.73), ER+/PR-: HR = 0.78 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.90) and ER-/PR-: HR = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.92). Most studies scored at a low risk of bias and a moderate score for the certainty of the evidence. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle reduces the risk of BC, regardless of its molecular subtypes, which should be considered a priority to generate recommendations for BC prevention at a population level.

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent worldwide and are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including systematic inflammation, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is a plant-based essential polyunsaturated fatty acid associated with reduced CVD risks. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of supplementation with ALA compared with the placebo on CVD risk factors in people with obesity or overweight (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews Registration No. CRD42023429563). This review included studies with adults using oral supplementation or food or combined interventions containing vegetable sources of ALA. All studies were randomly assigned trials with parallel or crossover designs. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used for assessing the risk of bias (Version 1). PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were searched from inception to April 2023. Nineteen eligible randomized controlled trials, including 1183 participants, were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, dietary ALA supplementation significantly reduced C-reactive protein concentration (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.38 mg/L; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.72, -0.04), tumor necrosis factor-α concentration (SMD = -0.45 pg/mL; 95% CI: -0.73, -0.17), triglyceride in serum (SMD = -4.41 mg/dL; 95% CI: -5.99, -2.82), and systolic blood pressure (SMD = -0.37 mm Hg; 95% CI: -0.66, -0.08); but led to a significant increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (SMD = 1.32 mg/dL; 95% CI: 0.05, 2.59). ALA supplementation had no significant effect on interleukin-6, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P ≥ 0.05). Subgroup analysis revealed that ALA supplementation at a dose of ≥3 g/d from flaxseed and flaxseed oil had a more prominent effect on improving CVD risk profiles, particularly where the intervention duration was ≥12 wk and where the baseline CVD profile was poor.",

    "abstract": "Zinc (Zn) is a trace element involved in numerous physiological processes, including enzyme function, gene transcription, and cell signaling. Its importance is especially pronounced in preterm infants, who are at high risk of Zn deficiency due to disrupted transplacental transfer, high nutrient demands, and medical complications. The inherent risk of Zn deficiency in this population is further increased by poor Zn dietary intake. Human milk from preterm mothers contains low concentrations of Zn, although it is highly bioavailable. Additionally, the Zn content steadily declines from colostrum (first few days postpartum) to mature milk (>10-14 d postpartum). Formula milk contains higher Zn concentrations to compensate for nutrient losses during production and storage, and lower bioavailability compared with human milk, which is further decreased in case of high phytate content, such as in soy milk-based formulas. Zn supplements may prove useful in meeting the preterm infant's needs, although caution is warranted regarding potential interactions with other nutrients within multinutrient supplements. Early detection of Zn deficiency is challenging due to the lack of reliable Zn status biomarkers, necessitating a high index of suspicion. Clinical signs of Zn deficiency can range from mild, nonspecific symptoms to severe, multisystem involvement. Chronic deficiency may lead to failure to thrive. Zn supplementation can support growth and mitigate comorbidities in preterm infants, although variability across studies complicates efforts to establish optimal dosing, and define safety and long-term effects. Although rare, Zn toxicity in preterm infants should not be overlooked, especially in infants on long-term parenteral nutrition. This narrative review aimed to consolidate existing knowledge and identify research gaps, highlighting the critical role of Zn in supporting preterm infants' health. Further research is needed to establish evidence-based practices to improve health outcomes in this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "Breakfast is purported to confer a number of benefits on diet quality, health, appetite regulation, and cognitive performance. However, new evidence has challenged the long-held belief that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. This review aims to provide a comprehensive discussion of the key methodological challenges and considerations in studies assessing the effect of breakfast on cognitive performance and appetite control, along with recommendations for future research. This review focuses on the myriad challenges involved in studying children and adolescents specifically. Key methodological challenges and considerations include study design and location, sampling and sample section, choice of objective cognitive tests, choice of objective and subjective appetite measures, merits of providing a fixed breakfast compared with ad libitum, assessment and definition of habitual breakfast consumption, transparency of treatment condition, difficulty of isolating the direct effects of breakfast consumption, untangling acute and chronic effects, and influence of confounding variables. These methodological challenges have hampered a clear substantiation of the potential positive effects of breakfast on cognition and appetite control and contributed to the debate questioning the notion that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.",

    "abstract": "The diets of most US children and adults are poor, as reflected by low diet quality scores, when compared with the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs). Contributing to these low scores is that most Americans overconsume solid fats, which may contain saturated fatty acids and added sugars; although alcohol consumption was generally modest, it provided few nutrients. Thus, the 2005 DGAs generated a new recommendation: to reduce intakes of solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars (SoFAAS). What precipitated the emergence of the new SoFAAS terminology was the concept of discretionary calories (a \"calorie\" is defined as the amount of energy needed to increase the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1°C), which were defined as calories consumed after an individual had met his or her recommended nutrient intakes while consuming fewer calories than the daily recommendation. A limitation with this concept was that additional amounts of nutrient-dense foods consumed beyond the recommended amount were also considered discretionary calories. The rationale for this was that if nutrient-dense foods were consumed beyond recommended amounts, after total energy intake was met then this constituted excess energy intake. In the 2010 DGAs, the terminology was changed to solid fats and added sugars (SoFAS); thus, alcohol was excluded because it made a minor contribution to overall intake and did not apply to children. The SoFAS terminology also negated nutrient-dense foods that were consumed in amounts above the recommendations for the specific food groups in the food patterns. The ambiguous SoFAS terminology was later changed to \"empty calories\" to reflect only those calories from solid fats and added sugars (and alcohol if consumed beyond moderate amounts). The purpose of this review is to provide an historical perspective on how the dietary recommendations went from SoFAAS to SoFAS and how discretionary calories went to empty calories between the 2005 and 2010 DGAs. This information will provide practitioners, as well as the public, with valuable information to better understand the evolution of SoFAS over time.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, so-called baby food pouches and other novel packaging and devices have been marketed for complementary feeding. To date, no experimental studies have been conducted to determine health and nutrition effects or the safety of baby food pouches and related feeding devices. Yet, these products hold the potential to fundamentally change the ways in which infants and children consume solid foods in infancy and early childhood. In this review, a selection of complementary feeding devices and their potential effects on breastfeeding, formula-feeding, safe and appropriate complementary feeding, and the timely transition to family foods are explored. Because manufacturers have innovated older designs of traditional feeding bottles and pacifiers for complementary feeding, perspectives on potential health effects and the safety of devices are drawn from research on feeding bottles and pacifiers. Recommendations include scaling up research on the safety, nutrition, and health impacts of commercial packaging and devices. In addition, manufacturers should ensure that devices conform to consumer product safety commission specifications and that instructions for use are in line with policies protecting pediatric dental health. Marketing of commercial devices and packaging should conform to the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes.",

    "abstract": "The consumption of sugar and its relation to various potential adverse health consequences are the subjects of considerable debate and controversy. This supplement to Advances in Nutrition provides an expanded summary of a symposium held on 26 April 2014 entitled \"Sugars and Health Controversies: What Does the Science Say?\" as part of the ASN Scientific Sessions and Annual Meeting at Experimental Biology 2014. The articles in the supplement discuss results of current systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as randomized controlled trials and draw implications for public policy considerations. In addition, future research gaps are identified. Current research trials conducted with commonly consumed sugars [e.g., sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)] do not support a unique relation to obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, risk factors for heart disease, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Neurologic differences in response to studies that used pure fructose compared with pure glucose have not been confirmed using typical sugars that are consumed (i.e., sucrose and HFCS), which contain ∼50% glucose and fructose. We conclude that added sugars consumed in the normal forms in which humans consume them, at amounts typical of the human diet and for the time period studied in randomized controlled trials, do not result in adverse health consequences. Although more research trials are needed in many areas of sugar consumption and health, there is little scientific justification for recommending restricting sugar consumption below the reasonable upper limit recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 of no more than 25% of calories.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence is increasing worldwide, driven by a rapidly changing environment and lifestyle and increasing rates of overweight and obesity. Prevention of diabetes is key and is most likely achieved through prevention of weight gain and/or successful long-term weight loss maintenance. Weight loss is readily achievable but there is considerable challenge in maintaining that weight loss over the long term. Lower-fat carbohydrate-based diets are widely used for T2D prevention. This is supported primarily by 3 successful long-term interventions, the US Diabetes Prevention Program, the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study, and the Chinese Da Qing Study, but evidence is building in support of novel higher-protein (>20% of energy) diets for successful weight loss maintenance and prevention of T2D. Higher-protein diets have the advantage of having relatively low energy density, aiding longer-term appetite suppression, and preserving lean body mass, all central to successful weight loss and prevention of weight regain. Here, we review the carbohydrate-based intervention trials and present mechanistic evidence in support of increased dietary protein for weight loss maintenance and a possible novel role in prevention of dysglycemia and T2D.",

    "abstract": "Dietary bioactives are food substances that promote health but are not essential to prevent typical deficiency conditions. Examples include lutein and zeaxanthin, omega-3 fatty acids, and flavonoids. When quality evidence is available, quantified intake recommendations linking dietary bioactives with specific health benefits will enable health professionals to provide evidence-based information to consumers. Without evidence-based recommendations, consumers use information from available sources that often lack standards and rigor. This article describes a framework to develop guidance based on quality evidence fully vetted for efficacy and safety by qualified experts, and designed to communicate the amounts of specific dietary bioactive compounds with identified health benefits. The 4-step Framework described here can be adapted by credible health organizations to work within their guideline development process. Standards of practice used in clinical guidelines are adapted to quantify dietary bioactive intake recommendations from foods consumed by the general public, by taking into account that side effects and trade-offs are often needed for medical treatments but are not acceptable for dietary bioactives. In quantifying dietary bioactive recommendations, this Framework establishes 4 decision-making steps: 1) characterize the bioactive, determine amounts in specific food sources, and quantify intakes; 2) evaluate safety; 3) quantify the causal relation between the specific bioactive and accepted markers of health or normal function via systematic evidence reviews; and 4) translate the evidence into a quantified bioactive intake statement. This Framework provides a working model that can be updated as new approaches are advanced.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone produced in the intestine that is secreted in response to nutrient exposure. GLP-1 potentiates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the pancreatic β cells and promotes satiety. These important actions on glucose metabolism and appetite have led to widespread interest in GLP-1 receptor agonism. Typically, this involves pharmacological GLP-1 mimetics or targeted inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV, the enzyme responsible for GLP-1 degradation. However, nutritional strategies provide a widely available, cost-effective alternative to pharmacological strategies for enhancing hormone release. Recent advances in nutritional research have implicated the combined ingestion of protein and calcium with enhanced endogenous GLP-1 release, which is likely due to activation of receptors with high affinity and/or sensitivity for amino acids and calcium. Specifically targeting these receptors could enhance gut hormone secretion, thus providing a new therapeutic option. This narrative review provides an overview of the latest research on protein- and calcium-mediated GLP-1 release with an emphasis on human data, and a perspective on potential mechanisms that link potent GLP-1 release to the co-ingestion of protein and calcium. In light of these recent findings, potential future research directions are also presented.",

    "abstract": "Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) containing less dairy may be a lower-cost treatment option for severe acute malnutrition (SAM). The objective was to understand the effectiveness of RUTF containing alternative sources of protein (nondairy), or <50% of protein from dairy products, compared with standard RUTF in children with SAM. The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched using terms relating to RUTF. Studies were eligible if they included children with SAM and evaluated RUTF with <50% of protein from dairy products compared with standard RUTF. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were completed to assess the effectiveness of intervention RUTF on a range of child outcomes. The quality of the evidence across outcomes was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. A total of 5868 studies were identified, of which 8 articles of 6 studies met the inclusion criteria evaluating 7 different intervention RUTF recipes. Nondairy or lower-dairy RUTF showed less weight gain (standardized mean difference: -0.20; 95% CI: -0.26, -0.15; P < 0.001), lower recovery (relative risk ratio: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87, 1.00; P = 0.046), and lower weight-for-age z scores (WAZ) near program discharge (mean difference: -0.10; 95% CI: -0.20, 0.0; P = 0.047). Mortality, time to recovery, default (consecutive absences from outpatient therapeutic feeding program visits), nonresponse, and other anthropometric measures did not differ between groups. The certainty of evidence was high for weight gain and ranged from very low to moderate for other outcomes. RUTF with lower protein from dairy or dairy-free RUTF may not be as effective as standard RUTF for treatment of children with SAM based on weight gain, recovery, and WAZ evaluated using meta-analysis, although further research is required to explore the potential of alternative formulations.

    "abstract": "Conflicting findings have been reported regarding the effects of almond consumption on inflammatory markers. This study aimed to summarize the current literature to determine whether almonds can affect inflammatory markers. A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science up to March 2021. Randomized clinical trials that compared almond with no almond consumption were included. The outcomes of interest were changes in circulating C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, TNF-α, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) concentrations. The random-effects model was used to find the mean differences. In total, 18 trials with 847 participants were eligible for the current analysis. Participants' ages ranged from 26.3 to 69.6 y. Combining 16 studies, almond consumption significantly reduced serum concentrations of CRP [weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.25 mg/L; 95% CI: -0.43, -0.06 mg/L; I2 = 0.0%; P-heterogeneity = 0.633]. However, the beneficial effect of almond intake only occurred at doses <60 g/d. Pooling 11 effect sizes, almond interventions significantly decreased circulating IL-6 concentrations (WMD: -0.11 pg/mL; 95% CI: -0.21, -0.01 pg/mL; I2 = 19.9%; P-heterogeneity = 0.254). In subgroup analyses, effects on CRP and IL-6 were nonsignificant in unhealthy participants or those with obesity. In addition, almond consumption had no significant effect on TNF-α (WMD: -0.05 pg/mL; 95% CI: -0.11, 0.01 pg/mL; I2 = 0.0%; P-heterogeneity = 0.893; n = 6), ICAM-1 (WMD: 6.39 ng/mL; 95% CI: -9.44, 22.22 ng/mL; I2 = 66.6%; P-heterogeneity = 0.006; n = 7), or VCAM-1 (WMD: -8.31 ng/mL; 95% CI: -35.32, 18.71 ng/mL; I2 = 58.8%; P-heterogeneity = 0.033; n = 6). In conclusion, almond consumption beneficially affects CRP and IL-6 concentrations in adults. However, it has no beneficial effect on TNF-α, ICAM-1, or VCAM-1. More trials are needed to determine the effects of almonds on inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The study of food consumption, diet, and related concepts is motivated by diverse goals, including understanding why food consumption impacts our health, and why we eat the foods we do. These varied motivations can make it challenging to define and measure consumption, as it can be specified across nearly infinite dimensions—from micronutrients to carbon footprint to food preparation. This challenge is amplified by the dynamic nature of food consumption processes, with the underlying phenomena of interest often based on the nature of repeated interactions with food occurring over time. This complexity underscores a need to not only improve how we measure food consumption but is also a call to support theoreticians in better specifying what, how, and why food consumption occurs as part of processes, as a prerequisite step to rigorous measurement. The purpose of this Perspective article is to offer a framework, the consumption process framework, as a tool that researchers in a theoretician role can use to support these more robust definitions of consumption processes. In doing so, the framework invites theoreticians to be a bridge between practitioners who wish to measure various aspects of food consumption and methodologists who can develop measurement protocols and technologies that can support measurement when consumption processes are clearly defined. In the paper we justify the need for such a framework, introduce the consumption process framework, illustrate the framework via a use case, and discuss existing technologies that enable the use of this framework and, by extension, more rigorous study of consumption. This consumption process framework demonstrates how theoreticians could fundamentally shift how food consumption is defined and measured towards more rigorous study of what, how, and why food is eaten as part of dynamic processes and a deeper understanding of linkages between behavior, food, and health.",

    "abstract": "Human intestinal enzymes do not hydrolyze nondigestible carbohydrates (NDCs), and thus, they are not digested and absorbed in the small intestine. Instead, NDCs are partially to completely fermented by the intestinal microbiota. Select NDCs are associated with health benefits such as laxation and lowering of blood cholesterol and glucose. NDCs provide functional attributes to processed foods, including sugar or fat replacers, thickening agents, and bulking agents. Additionally, NDCs are incorporated into processed foods to increase their fiber content. Although consumption of NDCs can benefit health and contribute functional characteristics to foods, they can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, such as flatulence and bloating. As gastrointestinal symptoms negatively affect consumer well-being and their acceptance of foods containing NDC ingredients, it is crucial to consider tolerance when designing food products and testing their physiological health benefits in clinical trials. This perspective provides recommendations for the approach to assess gastrointestinal tolerance to NDCs, with a focus on study design, population criteria, intervention, comparator, and outcome. Special issues related to studies in children and implications for stakeholders are also discussed. It is recommended that the evaluation of gastrointestinal tolerance to NDCs be conducted in randomized, blinded, controlled crossover studies using standard gastrointestinal questionnaires, with attention to study participant background diets, health status, lifestyle, and medications.",

    "abstract": "Food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) need to be evidence-based. As part of the development of Ethiopian FBDG, we conducted an umbrella review to develop dietary recommendations. Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM), deficiencies of vitamin A, zinc, calcium, or folate, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were selected as a priority. Systematic reviews were eligible if they investigated the impact of foods, food groups, diet, or dietary patterns on priority diseases. After a search, 1513 articles were identified in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar published from January 2014 to December 2021. The results showed that 19 out of 164 systematic reviews reported the impact of diet on PEM or micronutrient deficiencies. Daily 30-90 g whole-grain consumption reduces risk of CVD and T2DM. Pulses improve protein status, and consuming 50-150 g/d is associated with a reduced incidence of CVD and T2DM. Nuts are a good source of minerals, and consuming 15-35 g/d improves antioxidant status and is inversely associated with CVD risk. A daily intake of 200-300 mL of milk and dairy foods is a good source of calcium and contributes to bone mineral density. Limiting processed meat intake to <50 g/d reduces CVD risk. Fruits and vegetables are good sources of vitamins A and C. CVD and T2DM risks are reduced by consuming 200-300 g of vegetables plus fruits daily. Daily sugar consumption should be below 10% of total energy to lower risk of obesity, CVD, and T2DM. Plant-based fat has favorable nutrient profiles and modest saturated fat content. The association of saturated fatty acids with CVD and T2DM is inconclusive, but intake should be limited because of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-raising effect. Plant-based diets lower risk of CVD and T2DM but reduce micronutrient bioavailability. The review concludes with 9 key dietary recommendations proposed to be implemented in the Ethiopian FBDG. This review was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42019125490).",

    "abstract": "Within the organism, the liver is the main organ responsible for metabolic homeostasis and xenobiotic transformation. To maintain an adequate liver weight-to-bodyweight ratio, this organ has an extraordinary regenerative capacity and is able to respond to an acute insult or partial hepatectomy. Maintenance of hepatic homeostasis is crucial for the proper functioning of the liver, and in this context, adequate nutrition with macro- and micronutrient intake is mandatory. Among all known macro-minerals, magnesium has a key role in energy metabolism and in metabolic and signaling pathways that maintain liver function and physiology throughout its life span. In the present review, the cation is reported as a potential key molecule during embryogenesis, liver regeneration, and aging. The exact role of the cation during liver formation and regeneration is not fully understood due to its unclear role in the activation and inhibition of those processes, and further research in a developmental context is needed. As individuals age, they may develop hypomagnesemia, a condition that aggravates the characteristic alterations. Additionally, risk of developing liver pathologies increases with age, and hypomagnesemia may be a contributing factor. Therefore, magnesium loss must be prevented by adequate intake of magnesium-rich foods such as seeds, nuts, spinach, or rice to prevent age-related hepatic alterations and contribute to the maintenance of hepatic homeostasis. Since magnesium-rich sources include a variety of foods, a varied and balanced diet can meet both macronutrient and micronutrient needs.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of healthy diets in the management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19. Evidence suggests the influence of diet and dietary patterns during post-COVID-19, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dietary habits and quality. However, limited evidence lies on the association between a healthy diet, and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of observational studies to examine the association between diet quality, and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 among adult populations. 6158 research articles from Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases were identified for eligibility. Only observational studies were included. Study quality was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Thirteen studies were included (4 with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 9 with COVID-19 as the outcome); 3 were case-control, 3 were cross-sectional, and 7 were prospective studies. Adherence to Mediterranean diet was examined as exposure in 7 studies, and was associated with decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2 studies, with estimates varying from 12% to 22%, while COVID-19 risk or severity was found to be reduced in 3 studies with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 36% to 77%. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet was inversely associated with COVID-19 hospitalization (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.55), whereas a healthy plant-based diet had an inverse association with both COVID-19 infection (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.94) and severity (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.74). Studies examining individual food groups generally found lower risk of infection or COVID-19 in association with larger dietary intakes of fruits, vegetables, and fiber. The overall findings of the observational studies in this review support the concept that nutritious diets might lower the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. This study was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42023397371.",

    "abstract": "Characterization of the nutrients in human milk is important to understand the dietary and developmental requirements of infants. The objective of this review was to summarize the state-of-the-science on the nutrient composition of human milk in the United States and Canada published from 2017 to 2022. Four databases were searched for randomized controlled studies and others given the scoping nature of this review. We limited type to mature milk collected 21 d postpartum and beyond from lactating individuals in the United States and Canada who gave birth at 37-wk gestation or later (full-term). Outcomes of interest included traditional macro- and micronutrients, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), and milk volume. The publication date range was selected as January 1, 2017, to the day the literature search was performed. A total of 32 articles were included in the scoping review from primarily longitudinal cohort or cross-sectional designs. The most prevalent sample collection method was full-breast expression (n = 20) with most studies (n = 26) collecting samples from a single timepoint. Carbohydrates (HMOs [n = 12], glucose [n = 8], and lactose [n = 6]) and protein (n = 5) were the most frequently assessed nutrients in this body of work, with consensus among studies that glucose is present in limited concentrations compared to lactose (24-64 mg/dL compared with 6-7 g/dL) and that HMOs are influenced by temporality and secretor status. Included studies displayed an overall level of heterogeneity and sparsity paralleling previous reports and nutrient data in the USDA FoodData Central system. Much of the data extracted from retained articles generally provided analysis of a specific nutrient or group of nutrients. Moreover, many studies did not use the preferred analytical methods as outlined by the Human Milk Composition Initiative to increase measurement confidence. Up-to-date nutrient composition data of human milk is still greatly needed as it is paramount for the management of infant feeding, assessment of infant and maternal nutritional and health needs, and as a reference for infant formula development.",

    "abstract": "A meta-analysis published in 2018 indicated a significant association between the dietary inflammatory index (DII) and risk of urologic cancers (UC). The number of included studies was limited, and more research has been published on this topic since then. The current study aimed to find a more precise estimate of the association between dietary inflammatory potential and risk of UC by updating the previous meta-analysis. The PubMed and Embase databases were searched between January 2015 and April 2023 to identify eligible articles. Combined relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by random-effects model to assess the association between dietary inflammatory potential and risk of UC by comparison of the highest versus the lowest category of the DII/empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) or by using the continuous DII/EDIP score. The analysis, including 23 studies with 557,576 subjects, showed different results for UC. There was a significant association for prostate cancer among case-control studies (RR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.34-2.28), whereas among cohort studies a null association was found (RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.96-1.08). For bladder cancer, a nonsignificant association was observed in both case-control (RR = 1.59, 95% CI: 0.95-2.64) and cohort studies (RR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.86-1.24). Pooled RR from 3 case-control studies displayed a statistically significant association between the DII and risk of kidney cancer (RR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.03-1.56). Although DII was positively associated with all types of UC, no association was found for EDIP. The present meta-analysis confirmed that an inflammatory diet has a direct effect on the development of prostate cancer and kidney cancer. Large-scale studies are needed to demonstrate the association between dietary inflammatory potential and risk of UC and provide effective nutritional advice for UC prevention. The protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023391204).",

    "abstract": "Sodium is an essential dietary component, but excess sodium intake can lead to high blood pressure and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Many national and international bodies, including the World Health Organization, have advocated for population-wide sodium reduction interventions. Most have been unsuccessful due to inadequate sodium reduction by food industry and difficulties in persuading consumers to add less salt to food. Recent research highlights potassium-enriched salt as a new, feasible, acceptable and scalable approach to reducing the harms caused by excess sodium and inadequate potassium consumption. Modelling shows that a global switch from regular salt to potassium-enriched salt has the potential to avert millions of strokes, heart attacks and premature deaths across the globe each year. There will be many challenges to switching the world's salt supply to potassium-enriched salt, but the success of universal salt iodization shows that making a global change to the manufacture and use of salt is a tractable proposition. This in-depth review of universal salt iodization identified the importance of a multi-sectoral effort with strong global leadership, the support of multilateral organizations, engagement with the salt industry, empowered in-country teams, strong participation of national governments, understanding the salt supply chain, and a strategic advocacy and communication plan. Key challenges to the implementation of the iodization program were costs to government, industry and consumers, industry concerns about consumer acceptability, variance in the size and capabilities of salt producers, inconsistent quality control, ineffective regulation, and trade-related regulatory issues. Many of the opportunities and challenges to universal salt iodization will likely also be applicable to switching the global salt supply to iodized and potassium-enriched salt.",

It plays a crucial role in nutrient absorption and immune regulation and also acts as a protective barrier, separating underlying tissues from the gut lumen content. Disruptions in the delicate balance of the gut epithelium trigger inflammatory responses, aggravate conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, and potentially lead to more severe complications such as colorectal cancer. Maintaining intestinal epithelial homeostasis is vital for overall health, and there is growing interest in identifying nutraceuticals that can strengthen the intestinal epithelium. α-Ketoglutarate, a metabolite of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, displays a variety of bioactive effects, including functioning as an antioxidant, a necessary cofactor for epigenetic modification, and exerting anti-inflammatory effects. This article presents a comprehensive overview of studies investigating the potential of α-ketoglutarate supplementation in preventing dysfunction of the intestinal epithelium.",

Given the vast number of miRNA and that modulations in miRNA happen in response to a variety of stimuli, a comprehensive registry of miRNA impacted by diet and the food items that modulate them, would have utility in the identification of miRNA complements for analysis of diet interventions and in helping to establish linkages between the specific impacts of diet components. A scoping literature search of online databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, Web of Science) was performed. Only studies in human populations, that utilized a diet intervention or meal challenge, that measured microRNA profiles in the same subject at multiple time points were included. Of the 6167 studies screened, only 25 met the study criteria and were included in the review. Seven studies examined miRNA following a meal challenge, while 18 investigated miRNA following a sustained diet intervention. The results demonstrate miRNA are modulated following a variety of diet interventions and that intensity of miRNA response is greater in metabolically healthy subjects. Heterogeneity in the intensity and length of the diet intervention, the study populations being observed, and the methodology through which target miRNA are identified contribute to a lack of comparability across studies. The findings of this review highlight the need for more study of miRNA responsiveness to intake and provide recommendations for future research.",

    "abstract": "Scientific research linking climate change to food systems, nutrition, and nutrition-related health (FSNH) has proliferated, showing bidirectional and compounding dependencies that create cascading risks for human and planetary health. Within this proliferation, it is unclear which evidence to prioritize for action and which research gaps, if filled, would catalyze the most impact. We systematically searched for synthesis literature (i.e., reviews) related to FSNH published after 1 January, 2018. We screened and extracted characteristics of these reviews and mapped them in an interactive Evidence and Gap Map (EGM) supplemented by expert consultation. Eight hundred forty-four synthesis reports met inclusion criteria (from 2739 records) and were included in the EGM. The largest clusters of reports were those describing climate impacts on crop and animal-source food production and emissions from such (86%). Comparatively few reports assessed climate change impacts on nutrition-related health or food manufacture, processing, storage, and transportation. Reports focused on strategies of climate adaptation (40%), mitigation (29%), both (19%), or none (12%). Only 1 quarter of reports critically evaluated equity (25%), and fewer reports suggested that changes to equity and equitable practices would alter climate-FSNH dynamics (6%). The expert consultation mirrored the results of the EGM and contextualized findings further. This novel map describes a wide research landscape linking climate change to FSNH. We identified 4 key research gaps: 1) research on whole food systems or postharvest elements; 2) research evaluating relationships between climate change and nutrition-related health outcomes, especially among vulnerable populations; 3) promising methods (and additional data required) that can i) identify inflection points or levers for intervention, ii) incorporate complex dynamics and characterize trade-offs, iii) be understood and applied in context-specific, localized ways for decision making; and 4) research undertaken through interdisciplinary collaborations that enables producing and translating evidence to action, especially those that inherently consider coproduction and fairness.",

    "abstract": "Objective biomarkers of dietary intake are needed to advance nutrition research. The carbon isotope ratio (C13/C12; CIR) holds promise as an objective biomarker of added sugar (AS) and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake. This systematic scoping review presents the current evidence on CIRs from human studies. Search results (through April 12, 2024) yielded 6297 studies and 24 final articles. Studies were observational (n = 12), controlled feeding (n = 10), or dietary interventions (n = 2). CIRs were sampled from blood (n = 23), hair (n = 5), breath (n = 2), and/or adipose tissue (n = 1). Most (n = 17) conducted whole tissue (that is, bulk) analysis, 8 used compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA), and/or 2 studies used methods appropriate for analyzing breath. Studies were conducted in 3 concentrated geographic regions of the United States (n = 7 Virginia; n = 5 Arizona; n = 4 Alaska), with only 2 studies conducted in other countries. Studies that used CSIA to examine the CIR from the amino acid alanine (CIR-Ala; n = 4) and CIR analyzed from breath (n = 2) provided the most robust evidence for CIR as an objective biomarker of AS and SSBs (R2 range 0.36-0.91). Studies using bulk analysis of hair or blood showed positive, but modest and more variable associations with AS and SSBs (R2 range 0.05-0.48). Few studies showed no association, particularly in non-United States populations and those with low AS and SSB intakes. Two studies provided evidence for CIR to detect changes in SSB intake in response to dietary interventions. Overall, the most compelling evidence supports CIR-Ala as an objective indicator of AS intake and breath CIR as an indicator of short-term AS intake. Considering how to adjust for underlying dietary patterns remains an important area of future work and emerging methods using breath and CSIA warrant additional investigation. More evidence is needed to refine the utility and specificity of CIRs to measure AS and SSB intake.",

    "abstract": "Bioactive food components have shown potential health benefits for more than a decade. Currently there are no recommended levels of intake [i.e., Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)] as there are for nutrients and fiber. DRIs for essential nutrients were based on requirements for each specific nutrient to maintain normal physiologic or biochemical function and to prevent signs of deficiency and adverse clinical effects. They were later expanded to include criteria for reducing the risk of chronic degenerative diseases for some nutrients. There are many challenges for establishing recommendations for intakes of nonessential food components. Although some nonessential food components have shown health benefits and are safe, validated biomarkers of disease risk reduction are lacking for many. Biomarkers of intake (exposure) are limited in number, especially because the bioactive compounds responsible for beneficial effects have not yet been identified or are unknown. Furthermore, given this lack of characterization of composition in a variety of foods, it is difficult to ascertain intakes of nonessential food components, especially with the use of food-frequency questionnaires designed for estimating intakes of nutrients. Various intermediary markers that may predict disease outcome have been used as functional criteria in the DRI process. However, few validated surrogate endpoints of chronic disease risk exist. Nonvalidated intermediary biomarkers of risk may possibly predict clinical outcomes, but more research is needed to confirm the associations between cause and effect. One criterion for establishing acceptable intermediary outcome indicators may be the maintenance of normal physiologic function throughout adulthood, which presumably would lead to reduced chronic disease risk. Multiple biomarkers of outcomes that demonstrate the same health benefit may also be helpful. It would be beneficial to continue to refine the process of setting DRIs by convening a workshop on establishing a framework for nonessential food components that would take into consideration intermediary biomarkers indicative of optimal health.",

    "abstract": "Diet is a modifiable factor that can affect bone strength and integrity, and the risk of fractures. Currently, a hierarchy of scientific evidence contributes to our understanding of the role of diet on bone health and fracture risk. The strength of evidence is generally based on the type of study conducted, the quality of the methodology employed, the rigor and integrity of the data collected and analysis plan, and the transparency and completeness of the results. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered to be the gold standard from a clinical research paradigm, but there is a dearth of high-quality diet-related intervention trials with bone as the primary outcome, forcing the use of observational research to inform research and clinical practices. However, for observational research to be of the most utility, standardization and optimization of the study design, accurate and reliable measurement of key variables, and appropriate data analysis and data reporting are paramount. Although there have been recommendations made in relation to RCTs in the field of nutrition, no clear rubric exists for best practices in conducting observational research with regard to nutrition and bone health. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to describe the best practices and considerations for designing, conducting, analyzing, interpreting, and reporting observational research specifically for understanding the role of nutrition in bone health, amassed by a global panel of scientific experts with strengths in bone, nutrition epidemiology, physical activity, public health, clinical and translational trials, and observational study methods. The global panel of scientific experts represents the leadership and selected participants from the 10th annual International Symposium for the Nutritional Aspects of Osteoporosis. The topics selected and best practices presented reflect expert opinion and areas of scientific expertise of the authors rather than a systematic or comprehensive literature review or professional reporting guidelines.",

Today, >25% of prenatal supplements contain folate as synthetic salts of L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), but recommendations do not include this form of the vitamin.

    "abstract": "Understanding the health effects of protein intake is bedeviled by a number of factors, including protein quality and source. In addition, different units, including grams, grams per kilogram body weight (g/kg BW), and percent energy, may contribute to confusion about protein's effects on health, especially BW-based units in increasingly obese populations. We aimed to review the literature and to conduct a modeling demonstration of various units of protein intake in relation to markers of cardiometabolic health. Data from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring (n = 1847; 60.3 y; 62.5% women) and Third Generation (n = 2548; 46.2 y; 55.3% women) cohorts and the NHANES 2003–04 (n = 1625; 46.2 y; 49.7% women) and 2005–06 (n = 1347; 43.7 y; 49.5% women) cycles were used to model cross-sectional associations between 7 protein units (grams, percent energy, g/kg ideal BW, g/kg actual BW, BW-adjusted g/kg actual BW, g/kg lean BW, and g/kg fat-free BW) and 9 cardiometabolic outcomes (fasting glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, BMI, waist circumference, and estimated glomerular filtration rate). The literature review indicated the use of myriad units of protein intake, with differential results on cardiometabolic outcomes. The modeling demonstration showed units expressed in BW were confounded by BW, irrespective of outcome. Units expressed in grams, percent energy, and ideal BW showed similar results, with or without adjustment for body size. After adjusting for BW, results of units expressed in BW aligned with results of grams, percent energy, and ideal BW. In conclusion, protein intake in cardiometabolic health appears to depend on protein's unit of expression. Authors should be specific about the use of WHO (g/kg ideal BW) compared with US (g/kg actual BW) units, and ideally use gram or percent energy in observational studies. In populations where overweight/obesity are prevalent, intake based on actual BW should be reevaluated.",

Thirty-five crossover studies were eligible for inclusion, representing 116 comparisons (41, isocaloric; 41, isosweet; and 34, neither isosweet nor isocaloric). References of existing reviews and literature from 4 databases were searched. The calculated raw mean differences in ad libitum and total energy intakes were pooled in meta-analyses using a random-effects model and the inverse of the variance as the weighting factor. Energy intakes at an ad libitum meal were significantly lower for low-/no-calorie sweetener (LNCS)-sweetened compared with unsweetened preloads in the isocaloric comparison (-55.5 kcal; 95% CI: -82.9, -28.0 kcal; P < 0.001); however, the difference in energy intake was not significant in additional sensitivity analyses (i.e., removal of comparisons where the matrix was a capsule and when xylitol was the LNCS). For the isosweet comparison, although the pooled energy intake at the ad libitum meal was significantly greater with the LNCS-sweetened preload compared with the caloric sweetener (CS)-sweetened preload (58.5 kcal; 95% CI: 35.4, 81.7 kcal; P < 0.001), the pattern was reversed when total energy intake was considered (-132.4 kcal; 95% CI: -163.2, -101.6 kcal; P < 0.001), explained by only partial compensation from the CS-sweetened preload. The results were similar when assessing ad libitum and total energy intakes when unsweetened compared with CS-sweetened preloads were consumed. Unsweetened or LNCS-sweetened preloads appear to have similar effects on intakes when compared with one another or with CS-sweetened preloads. These findings suggest that LNCS-sweetened foods and beverages are viable alternatives to CS-sweetened foods and beverages to manage short-term energy intake.",

    "abstract": "One hundred percent orange juice (OJ) has no added sugar, naturally contains flavonoids and ascorbic acid, and can modulate the body's oxidative and inflammatory systems. This scoping review, systematic review, and meta-analysis investigated associations between 100% OJ and markers of inflammation or oxidation in healthy adults and those at risk for chronic diseases. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and scoping review extension. Literature in English was searched to July 2021 in Embase and 4 Ovid platform databases. Clinical and observational studies of any duration were eligible. Cochrane Collaboration tools were used to assess the risk of bias in controlled trials. Strength of evidence was determined using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The scoping review presents a qualitative synthesis of evidence in summary and results tables. Twenty-one interventional studies (16 controlled trials and 5 before-after studies) conducted in 307 healthy and 327 at-risk participants were included. Six common markers [C-reactive protein (CRP) or high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), IL-6, TNF-α, malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized LDL (oxLDL), and antioxidant capacity] measured across 16 studies were systematically reviewed, and results were synthesized narratively. Random-effects model meta-analyses were conducted on 10 studies reporting hs-CRP, IL-6, and/or MDA. After consuming 100% OJ, healthy and at-risk participants showed significantly lower IL-6 concentrations (pooled net difference: -1.51 pg/mL; 95% CI: -2.31, -0.70) and lower, but nonsignificant, hs-CRP (pooled net change: -0.58 mg/L; 95% CI: -1.22, 0.05) and MDA (crossover trials pooled net difference: -0.06 μmol/L; 95% CI: -0.19, 0.08). Findings suggest that 100% OJ may reduce inflammation, but results should be interpreted with caution due to moderate risk of bias, very low strength of evidence, and the low number of subjects. This study was registered on PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) as CRD42021235438.",

    "abstract": "Antioxidant supplementation has been identified as an important intervention for subfertile men. However, the effectiveness of different antioxidants in improving sperm quality remains unclear. In this study, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was designed to evaluate the effects of different antioxidants on sperm quality parameters in subfertile men. Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antioxidants in subfertile men were searched in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to 31 January, 2021. Eight antioxidants (folic acid, zinc, vitamin E, carnitine, selenium, coenzyme q10 [CoQ10], N-acetylcysteine, and vitamin C) and a placebo (control) were included in our study. A Bayesian NMA with random effects was performed for each outcome (sperm concentration, sperm motility, and sperm morphology); the surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRAs) for the effectiveness of each intervention was applied to identify the optimal intervention. Eighteen studies with 1790 subfertile men were included in the study. CoQ10 elicited a significant increase in sperm concentration (mean difference [MD] = 5.95; 95% CI: 0.05, 10.79) compared with the placebo; it achieved the highest rank in efficacy among all the antioxidants (SUCRA: 79.4%). With regard to sperm motility, carnitine (MD = 12.43; 95% CI: 4.07, 20.26) and CoQ10 (MD = 7.33; 95% CI: 0.35, 14.17) showed significant beneficial effects compared with the placebo; the efficacy of carnitine was the highest among all the antioxidants (SUCRA: 88.7%). With regard to sperm morphology, the efficacy of vitamin C tended to be the highest (SUCRA: 93.6%), although it did not show a significant beneficial effect (MD = 7.73; 95% CI: –0.94, 16.33) compared with the placebo. Overall, for subfertile men, CoQ10 and carnitine interventions showed better effectiveness in increasing sperm concentration and sperm motility, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Gastroparesis (Gp) is a delay in gastric emptying in the absence of a mechanical obstruction and has the capacity to cause symptoms that significantly impact a patient's quality of life. Dietary interventions are the first-line treatment in Gp, but the efficacy of different diets is unclear. This systematic review seeks to determine the effectiveness of dietary interventions on clinical outcomes in Gp. A literature search of MEDLINE Ovid from 1 March 2008 to 1 October 2021 was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies that reported dietary interventions in Gp. From the initial search, 2789 studies resulted. These were assessed by 2 independent reviewers and selected based on the primary outcomes of interest: changes in symptom-specific patient-reported outcomes and changes in gastric emptying time. A third reviewer resolved any discrepancies. Six adult studies (185 subjects) met the inclusion criteria, whereas no pediatric study did. Five of the included studies were randomized controlled trials and one was an observational study. The systematic review suggested low-fat diets, small-particle diets, diets with isoflavones, and foods considered bland, starchy, sweet, and salty did not exacerbate Gp symptoms. Small-particle diets and diets with isoflavones were found to improve gastric emptying time in patients. Additionally, small-particle diets were shown to reduce anxiety in comparison to large-particle diets. Of the randomized controlled trials, 80% were low risk of bias and 20% were fair risk of bias. The observational study was considered fair quality. The data presented in this review suggest specific dietary interventions could potentially improve Gp symptoms and gastric emptying in adult patients, particularly low-fat and small-particle diets. For pediatric Gp, data are lacking. The limited data available highlights a critical gap in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The brain and peripheral nervous system provide oversight to muscle physiology and metabolism. Muscle is the largest organ in the body and critical for glucose sensitivity, prevention of diabetes, and control of obesity. The central nervous system produces endocannabinoids (eCBs) that play a role in brain neurobiology, such as inflammation and pain. Interestingly, studies in humans and rodents show that a moderate duration of exercise increases eCBs in the brain and blood and influences cannabinoid receptors. Cannabinoid actions in the nervous system have advanced our understanding of pain, well-being, and disease. Nutrition is an important aspect of brain and eCB physiology because eCBs are biosynthesized from PUFAs. The primary eCB metabolites are derived from arachidonic acid, a 20:4n-6 (ω-6) PUFA, and the n-3 (ω-3) PUFAs, EPA and DHA. The eCBs bind to cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 to exert a wide range of activities, such as stimulating appetite, influencing energy metabolism, supporting the immune system, and facilitating neuroplasticity. A diet containing different essential n-6 and n-3 PUFAs will dominate the formation of specific eCBs, and subsequently their actions as ligands for CB1 and CB2. The eCBs also function as substrates for cyclooxygenase enzymes, including potential substrates for the oxylipins (OxLs), which can be proinflammatory. Together, the eCBs and OxLs act as modulators of neuroinflammation. Thus, dietary PUFAs have implications for exercise responses via synthesis of eCBs and their effects on neuroinflammation. Neurotrophins also participate in interactions between diet and the eCBs, specifically brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF supports neuroplasticity in cooperation with the endocannabinoid system (ECS). This review will describe the role of PUFAs in eCB biosynthesis, discuss the ECS and OxLs in neuroinflammation, highlight the evidence for exercise effects on eCBs, and describe eCB and BDNF actions on neuroplasticity.",

    "abstract": "Recent observational studies have documented inverse associations of circulating very long-chain saturated fatty acids (VLCSFAs), namely arachidic acid (20:0), behenic acid (22:0), and lignoceric acid (24:0), with cardiometabolic outcomes. In addition to their endogenous production, it has been suggested that dietary intake or an overall healthier lifestyle may influence VLCSFA concentrations; however, a systematic review of the modifiable lifestyle contributors to circulating VLCSFAs is lacking. Therefore, this review aimed to systematically assess the effects of diet, physical activity, and smoking on circulating VLCSFAs. Following registration on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) (ID: CRD42021233550), a systematic search of observational studies was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane databases up to February 2022. A total of 12 studies consisting of mostly cross-sectional analyses were included in this review. The majority of the studies documented the associations of dietary intake with total plasma or red blood cell VLCSFAs, in which a range of macronutrients and food groups were examined. Two cross-sectional analyses showed a consistent positive association between total fat and peanut intake with 22:0 and 24:0 and an inverse association between alcohol intake and 20:0 and 22:0. Furthermore, a moderate positive association between physical activity and 22:0 and 24:0 was observed. Lastly, there were conflicting results on the effects of smoking on VLCSFA. Although most studies had a low risk of bias; the findings of this review are limited by the bi-variate analyses presented in the majority of the included studies, therefore, the impact of confounding is unclear. In conclusion, although the current observational literature examining lifestyle determinants of VLCSFAs is limited, existing evidence suggests that circulating 22:0 and 24:0 may be influenced by higher total and saturated fat consumption and nut intake.",

During clinical intervention trials using kiwifruit to improve constipation, upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as abdominal discomfort and pain, indigestion, and reflux were also alleviated. We aimed to evaluate the evidence for upper GI symptom relief by kiwifruit in clinical trials on participants with functional constipation (FC), irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C), and healthy participants, and to elucidate which symptoms may be relieved and whether a difference exists between the effects of gold and green kiwifruit. We executed a systematic scoping review of 3 electronic databases from 1947 through January 2021 to identify clinical trials that reported effects of green or gold kiwifruit or kiwifruit compounds on upper GI symptoms as secondary outcomes in healthy participants or participants with FC or IBS-C. Studies were divided into those using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and those using alternative measurement tools. GSRS outcomes were pooled and statistically analyzed; non-GSRS outcomes were summarized. We identified 12 clinical trials with a total of 661 participants (124 controls, 537 receiving intervention) providing evidence for symptom relief of upper GI symptoms by kiwifruit intake. Only 5 of the 12 clinical trials used the GSRS to assess upper GI symptom relief. We found good evidence that green kiwifruit may reduce abdominal discomfort and pain, and some evidence that kiwifruit consumption may attenuate indigestion. Pooled GSRS outcome analysis indicates an average reduction of -0.85 (95% CI: -1.1, -0.57; Z = 6.1) in abdominal pain scores and -0.33 (95% CI: -0.52, -0.15; Z = -3.5) in indigestion scores with habitual kiwifruit consumption. While the number of studies reporting on upper GI symptom relief with a comparable measurement is limited, there is consistent evidence for the efficacy of kiwifruit on upper GI symptom relief. More research to strengthen the evidence is recommended.",

Despite Asp/Ace-K blends having negligible calories, their effects on appetite have not been reviewed systematically. We therefore undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the metabolic effects of Asp/Ace-K blends on energy intake (EI), subjective appetite scores, blood glucose, and the incretin hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases (Embase, PubMed, and CINAHL) were searched (May 2021) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Human RCTs using Asp/Ace-K blends compared with sugar and water controls were included, whereas isolated cell and animal studies were excluded. An overall 4829 publications were identified and 8 studies, including 274 participants, were retrieved for review. The Asp/Ace-K group's EI was significantly reduced compared with sugar [mean difference (MD): -196.56 kcal/meal; 95% CI: -332.01, -61.11 kcal/meal; P = 0.004] and water (MD: -213.42 kcal/meal; 95% CI: -345.4, -81.44 kcal/meal; P = 0.002). Meta-analysis of subjective appetite scores and incretins could not be undertaken due to inconsistencies in data reporting and insufficient data, respectively, but of the 4 studies identified, no differences were observed between Asp/Ace-K blends and controls. The Asp/Ace-K group's blood glucose was nonsignificantly reduced compared with sugar (MD: -1.48 mmol/L; 95% CI: -3.26, 0.3 mmol/L; P = 0.1) and water (MD: -0.08 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.62, 0.47 mmol/L; P = 0.78). Lower EI in participants who were predominantly healthy and assigned to Asp/Ace-K blends could not be reliably attributed to changes in subjective appetite scores. Blood glucose and incretins were also generally not affected by Asp/Ace-K blends when compared with controls. Additional short- and long-term RCTs using NNSs and sugars at dietarily relevant levels are needed. This trial was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42017061015).",

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tree nut and peanut consumption on energy intake, compensation, and expenditure. PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2, 2021. Human studies with adults aged ≥18 y older were included. Energy intake and compensation studies were restricted to acute effects (intervention duration of ≤24 h), whereas intervention duration was not limited for EE studies. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to explore weighted mean differences in REE. Twenty-eight articles from 27 studies (16 energy intake studies, 10 EE studies, and 1 study investigating both) with 1121 participants were included in this review, with a variety of nut types addressed (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, chestnuts, hazelnuts, peanuts, pistachios, walnuts, and mixed nuts). Energy compensation occurred after nut-containing loads (range: -280.5% to +176.4%) and the degree of compensation varied depending on the form (whole and chopped) and how they were consumed (alone and within a meal). The meta-analyses identified a nonsignificant increase in REE associated with nut consumption (weighted mean difference: 28.6 kcal/d; 95% CI: -10.7, 67.8 kcal/d). This study provided support for energy compensation as a potential mechanism for a lack of association between nut consumption and body weight, whereas no evidence was found for EE as an energy-regulating mechanism of nuts.

    "abstract": "The effects of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) supplementation on skeletal muscle are currently unclear. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize all available evidence regarding the influence of n-3PUFA supplementation on muscle mass, strength, and function in healthy young and older adults. Four databases were searched (Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and SportDiscus). Predefined eligibility criteria were determined according to Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, and Study Design. Only peer-reviewed studies were included. The Cochrane RoB2 Tool and the NutriGrade approach were used to access risk of bias and certainty in evidence. Effect sizes were calculated using pre-post scores and analyzed using a three-level, random-effects meta-analysis. When sufficient studies were available, subanalyses were performed in the muscle mass, strength, and function outcomes according to participant's age (<60 or ≥60 years), supplementation dosage (<2 or ≥2 g/day), and training intervention (\"resistance training\" vs. \"none or other\"). Overall, 14 individual studies were included, total 1443 participants (913 females; 520 males) and 52 outcomes measures. Studies had high overall risk of bias and consideration of all NutriGrade elements resulted in a certainty assessment of moderate meta-evidence for all outcomes. n-3PUFA supplementation had no significant effect on muscle mass (standard mean difference [SMD] = 0.07 [95% CI: -0.02, 0.17], P = 0.11) and muscle function (SMD = 0.03 [95% CI: -0.09, 0.15], P = 0.58), but it showed a very small albeit significant positive effect on muscle strength (SMD = 0.12 [95% CI: 0.006, 0.24], P = 0.04) in participants when compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses showed that age, supplementation dose, or cosupplementation alongside resistance training did not influence these responses. In conclusion, our analyses indicated that n-3PUFA supplementation may lead to very small increases in muscle strength but did not impact muscle mass and function in healthy young and older adults. To our knowledge, this is the first review and meta-analysis investigating whether n-3PUFA supplementation can lead to increases in muscle strength, mass, and function in healthy adults.

PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for articles published from January 2014 to November 2021 using a search strategy following PRISMA guidelines. Experimental studies conducted with human participants were included. A random-effects inverse-variance meta-analysis was performed on standardized mean differences (SMD) of food intake (behavioral outcome) between the food advertisement and nonfood advertisement conditions of each study. Subgroup analyses were performed by age, BMI group, study design, and advertising media type. A seed-based d mapping meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies was performed to evaluate neural activity between experimental conditions. Nineteen articles were eligible for inclusion, 13 for food intake (n = 1303) and 6 for neural activity (n = 303). The pooled analysis of food intake revealed small, but statistically significant, effects of increased intake after viewing food advertising compared with the control condition among adults and children (adult SMD: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.28; P = 0.01; I2 = 0; 95% CI: 0, 95.0%; Children SMD: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.37; P < 0.0001; I2 = 60.4%; 95% CI: 25.6%, 79.0%). The neuroimaging studies involved children only, and the pooled analysis corrected for multiple comparisons identified one significant cluster, the middle occipital gyrus, with increased activity after food advertising exposure compared with the control condition (peak coordinates: 30, −86, 12; z-value: 6.301, size: 226 voxels; P < 0.001). These findings suggest that acute exposure to food advertising increases food intake among children and adults and that the middle occipital gyrus is an implicated brain region among children.

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of disease from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, with inflammatory cytokines and adipokines identified as drivers of disease progression. Poor dietary patterns are known to promote an inflammatory milieu, although the effects of specific diets remain largely unknown. This review aimed to gather and summarize new and existing evidence on the effect of dietary intervention on inflammatory markers in patients with NAFLD. The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane were searched for clinical trials which investigated outcomes of inflammatory cytokines and adipokines. Eligible studies included adults >18 y with NAFLD, which compared a dietary intervention with an alternative diet or control (no intervention) group or were accompanied by supplementation or other lifestyle interventions. Outcomes for inflammatory markers were grouped and pooled for meta-analysis where heterogeneity was allowed. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Criteria. Overall, 44 studies with a total of 2579 participants were included. Meta-analyses indicated intervention with an isocaloric diet plus supplement was more effective in reducing C-reactive protein (CRP) [standard mean difference (SMD): 0.44; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.68; P = 0.0003] and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (SMD: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.02, 1.46; P = 0.03) than an isocaloric diet alone. No significant weighting was shown between a hypocaloric diet with or without supplementation for CRP (SMD: 0.30; 95% CI: -0.84, 1.44; P = 0.60) and TNF-α (SMD: 0.01; 95% CI: -0.43, 0.45; P = 0.97). In conclusion, hypocaloric and energy-restricted diets alone or with supplementation, and isocaloric diets with supplementation were shown to be most effective in improving the inflammatory profile of patients with NAFLD. To better determine the effectiveness of dietary intervention alone on a NAFLD population, further investigations of longer durations, with larger sample sizes are required.",

    "abstract": "Timing of eating (TOE) and energy intake (TOEI) has important implications for chronic disease risk beyond diet quality. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended developing consistent terminology to address the lack of TOE/TOEI standardization. The primary objective of this methodological systematic review was to characterize the conceptualization and assessment of TOE/TOEI within the chronic disease literature (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews registration number: CRD42021236621). Literature searches in Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus were limited to English language publications from 2000 to August 2022. Eligible studies reported the association between TOE/TOEI and obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, or a related clinical risk factor among adults (≥19 y) in observational and intervention studies. A qualitative synthesis described and compared TOE/TOEI conceptualization, definitions, and assessment methods across studies. Of the 7579 unique publications identified, 259 studies (observational [51.4 %], intervention [47.5 %], or both [1.2 %]) were eligible for inclusion. Key findings indicated that most studies (49.6 %) were conducted in the context of obesity and body weight. TOE/TOEI variables or assigned conditions conceptualized interrelated aspects of time and eating or energy intake in varying ways. Common TOE/TOEI conceptualizations included the following: 1) timepoint (specific time to represent when intake occurs, such as time of breakfast [74.8 %]); 2) duration (length of time or interval when intake does/does not occur, such as \"eating window\" [56.5 %]); 3) distribution (proportion of daily intake at a given time interval, such as \"percentage of energy before noon\" [29.8 %]); and 4) cluster (grouping individuals based on temporal ingestive characteristics [5.0 %]). Assessment, definition, and operationalization of 24-h TOE/TOEI variables varied widely across studies. Observational studies most often used surveys or questionnaires (28.9 %), whereas interventions used virtual or in-person meetings (23.8 %) to assess TOE/TOEI adherence. Overall, the diversity of terminology and methods solidifies the need for standardization to guide future research in chrononutrition and to facilitate inter-study comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the prevalence of double burden of malnutrition (DBM) is challenging in the Latin American and Caribbean region (LAC) where various DBM typologies (e.g., obesity and stunting) are heterogeneous and estimates are scattered across literature. We aimed to assess the prevalence of DBM typologies in LAC. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify studies on the prevalence of DBM published between 1/1/2000-23/1/2023. Outcomes were the prevalence of the identified DBM typologies at the household, individual, or across life course levels. Random effect meta-analyses of proportions were used to estimate pooled period prevalence for all outcomes. Heterogeneity was explored using meta-regressions. PROSPERO-CRD42023406755. From 754 records identified, 60 (8%) studies were eligible, with a median of 4 379 individuals. Studies reported data from 27 LAC countries collected between 1988 and 2017. Most studies used nationally representative surveys (68%) and scored as low risk of bias (70%). We identified 17 DBM typologies for which 360 estimates were analyzed. The prevalence of the identified DBM typologies ranged between 0%-24%, with the DBM typology of 'adult with overweight and child with anemia' having the highest prevalence (24.3% [95%CI 18.8-30.2]). The most frequently reported DBM typology was 'adult with overweight and child with stunting', with a prevalence of 8.5% [7.7-9.3]. All prevalences carried large heterogeneity (I2>90%), modestly explained by sub-regions and countries. DBM across the life course could not be estimated due to insufficient estimates. Using available data, our study suggests that the burden of DBM in LAC ranges between 0 and 24%. In the most frequent DBM typologies, overweight was a common contributor. Substantial progress can be made in curbing the burden of DBM in LAC through strategies addressing excess weight within these population groups.",

    "abstract": "Maternal adiposity impacts lactation performance, but the pathways are unclear. We conducted a systematic review to understand whether maternal adiposity (body mass index [BMI] or percentage fat mass) is associated with onset of lactogenesis II (copious milk; hours), human milk production (expressed volume/24 h), and infant consumption of mother's own milk (volume/24 h). We used random-effects standard meta-analyses to compare the relative risk (RR) of delayed lactogenesis II (>72 h) between mothers classified as underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), healthy weight (BMI, 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), and overweight/obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) and random-effects meta-regressions to examine associations with hours to lactogenesis II and infant milk consumption. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. We included 122 articles. Mothers with underweight (RR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.83; I2 = 39.48%; 8 articles/data points) or healthy weight status (RR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.79; I2 = 70.91%; 15 articles/data points) were less likely to experience delayed lactogenesis II than mothers with overweight/obesity. We found no association between maternal BMI and time to onset of lactogenesis II (β: 1.45 h; 95% CI: -3.19, 6.09 h; P = 0.52, I2 = 0.00%; 8 articles, 17 data points). Due to limited data, we narratively reviewed articles examining BMI or percentage fat mass and milk production (n = 6); half reported an inverse association and half no association. We found no association between maternal BMI (β: 6.23 mL; 95% CI: -11.26, 23.72 mL; P = 0.48, I2 = 47.23%; 58 articles, 75 data points) or percentage fat mass (β: 7.82 mL; 95% CI: -1.66, 17.29 mL; P = 0.10, I2 = 28.55%; 30 articles, 41 data points) and infant milk consumption. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low. In conclusion, mothers with overweight/obesity may be at risk of delayed lactogenesis II. The available data do not support an association with infant milk consumption, but the included studies do not adequately represent mothers with obesity.

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis, spanning studies published between 1995 and 2021, investigates various aspects of lunches brought from home (LBFH) to school by children. These meals, in contrast to those provided by the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), lack strict nutritional standards. Despite the availability of NSLP lunches, ∼40% of US children opt for LBFH. This review aims to assess the food content and nutritional quality of LBFH, their adherence to NSLP standards in terms of nutrition and cost, effectiveness of intervention programs designed to enhance their nutritional quality and parental and student perceptions of LBFH. The comprehensive literature search yielded 28 eligible papers, with 16 included in meta-analysis. LBFH commonly include fruits (50%), yet vegetables (17%) and dairy (25%) are less prevalent. They frequently contain snacks (50%), sweets (48%), and sugar-sweetened beverages (31%). Compared with school lunches, LBFH exhibit lower levels of calcium, protein, iron, fiber, and vitamin A, and higher levels of carbohydrates and saturated fat. Intervention programs had no effect on quality of LBFH. On average, LBFH ($1.81) cost slightly less than lunches served at school ($1.98), without accounting for free/reduced-price meals in the calculation. The cost of school lunch for pre-k and kindergarten children became $11.32, nearly 4 times higher than that of LBFH ($2.92), after replicating the meal at home and accounting for meal preparation time. Parents preferred LBFH over school lunches because of concerns related to the quality of school meals served. This study concludes that LBFH are generally less nutritious compared with lunches provided by NSLP. Future research needs to further explore ways to improve parent perception of NSLP. Especially with many states making free meals available to all children, identifying effective ways in promoting and increasing NSLP participation can ensure more children have access to nutritionally balanced and affordable lunches.",

As such, the World Health Organization and other public health organizations encourage policies that restrict children's access and exposure to foods and beverages that do not build health in and around schools. This global scoping review explores the presence and characteristics of policies that restrict competitive food sales and marketing for unhealthy foods across 193 countries using evidence from policy databases, gray literature, peer-reviewed literature, and primary policy documents. Policies were included if they were nationally mandated and regulated marketing and/or competitive foods in the school environments. Worldwide, only 28% of countries were found to have any national-level policy restricting food marketing or competitive food sales in schools: 16% of countries restrict marketing, 25% restrict competitive foods, and 12% restrict both. Over half of policies were found in high-income countries. No low-income countries had either policy type. Eight marketing policies (27%) and 14 competitive foods policies (29%) lacked explicit guidelines for either policy monitoring or enforcement. Future research is needed to assess the prevalence of policies aimed at improving other key aspects of the school food environment, such as dietary quality of school meals or food procurement, as well as assess the implementation and efficacy of existing policies.",

    "abstract": "Despite the well-documented adverse outcomes associated with obesity during pregnancy, this condition remains a promising modifiable risk factor. The aim of this study was to ascertain the most effective treatment modalities for gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnant women classified as overweight or obese. A systematic search was conducted across 4 electronic databases: Embase, EBSCOhost, PubMed, and Web of Science. To assess the quality of evidence, the Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) approach, grounded in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework, was employed. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the comparative effectiveness of treatment modalities based on GWG outcomes. The analysis incorporated 60 randomized controlled trials, encompassing 16,615 participants. Modes of intervention administration were classified as remote (R: eHealth [e] and mHealth [m]), in-person (I), and a combination of both (I+R). The interventions comprised 5 categories: education (E), physical activity (PA), dietary (D), behavior modification (B), and combinations thereof. The quality of the evidence, as evaluated by CINeMA, ranged from very low to high. Compared to the control group, the I-D intervention (mean difference [MD]: -1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.23, -0.32), I-PADB (MD: -0.60, 95% CI: -1.19, -0.00), and I-B (MD: -0.34, 95% CI: -0.57, -0.10) interventions showed significant efficacy in reducing GWG. Preliminary findings suggest that the I-D intervention is the most efficacious in managing GWG among pregnant women who are overweight or obese, followed by I-PADB and I-B+R-B(m) treatments. These conclusions are drawn from evidence of limited quality and directness, including insufficient data on PA components used in the interventions. Owing to the absence of robust, direct evidence delineating significant differences among various GWG management strategies, it is tentatively proposed that the I-D intervention is likely the most effective approach.

    "abstract": "An increasing number of cross-sectional studies suggests that diet may impact memory and cognition in healthy older adults. However, randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of whole-diet interventions on memory and cognition in healthy older adults are rather rare, and conflicting results are often reported. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to compile the current evidence regarding the potential effects of whole-diet interventions on 1) memory and 2) other cognitive outcomes in older adults. Studies that reported on randomized controlled trials with dietary interventions in healthy older adults (≥60 y) were included. Studies utilizing supplements, single food items, or trials in specific patient groups (i.e., neurodegenerative diagnoses) were excluded. For the 23 included articles, the main outcomes examined fell into 1 or more of the following categories: cognitive task-based outcomes related to memory, other cognitive task-based outcomes, and additional outcomes related to cognitive function or disease risk. Three of the studies that investigated dietary interventions alone and 2 multidomain studies showed positive effects on memory function, whereas 5 multidomain interventions and 1 intervention that focused on diet alone showed positive effects on other cognitive outcomes. The effect of randomized, controlled whole-diet interventions on memory and cognitive function in healthy older adults is modest and inconclusive, highlighting the need for more well-designed, sufficiently powered studies. Furthermore, the potential mechanisms by which diet impacts cognition in healthy aging need to be elucidated. This systematic review is registered in PROSPERO as CRD42022329759.",

Adequate nutrition and an active lifestyle are key factors during childhood, because food habits track into adulthood. Children spend more time in school than in any other environment away from home. Studying the diet factors and patterns of PA that affect obesity risk in children during school hours and the complete school day can help identify opportunities to lower this risk. We directly measured the time children spent performing moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) at school, compared the amount and intensity of PA during school hours with after-school hours, and tried to determine if diet behaviors and PA or inactivity were associated with excess weight and body fat. This cross-sectional study included 143 normal-weight (NLW) and 48 obese children aged 8–10 y. Diet data were obtained from two 24-h recalls. Body composition was measured by bioimpedance. Screen time and sports participation data were self-reported. NLW children drank/ate more dairy servings than the obese children, who consumed more fruit-flavored water than the NLW group. Consumption of soft drinks, sugar-added juices, and fresh juices was low in both groups. Children were less active during school hours than after school. MVPA was lower during school hours in the obese group than in the NLW group. Schools, parents, and authorities should be more involved in promoting strategies to improve the dietary habits and PA levels of school-aged children, because this group is not achieving the recommended level of daily MVPA.",

Unfortunately, theoretical considerations and empirical evidence indicate that a large percentage of science-based claims rely on studies that fail to replicate. The session \"Strategies to Optimize the Impact of Nutrition Surveys and Epidemiological Studies\" focused on the elements of design, interpretation, and communication of nutritional surveys and epidemiological studies to enhance and encourage the production of reliable, objective evidence for use in developing dietary guidance for the public. The speakers called for more transparency of research, raw data, consistent data-staging techniques, and improved data analysis. New approaches to collecting data are urgently needed to increase the credibility and utility of findings from nutrition epidemiological studies. Such studies are critical for furthering our knowledge and understanding of the effects of diet on health.",

The most important features of these projects are the prescriptive approach used for subject selection and the rigorous testing of the assertion that growth is very similar among geographically and ethnically diverse nonisolated populations when health, nutrition, and other care needs are met and the environment imposes minimal constraints on growth. Both studies documented that with adequate controls, the principal source of variability in growth during gestation and early childhood resides among individuals. Study sites contributed much less to observed variability. The agreement between anthropometric measurements common to both studies also is noteworthy. Jointly, these studies provide for the first time, to my knowledge, a conceptually consistent basis for worldwide and localized assessments and comparisons of growth performance in early life. This is an important contribution to improving the health care of children across key periods of growth and development, especially given the appropriate interest in pursuing \"optimal\" health in the \"first 1000 d,\" i.e., the period covering fertilization/implantation, gestation, and postnatal life to 2 y of age.",

    "abstract": "The ability of nutrition scientists to measure the status, bioavailability, and bioefficacy of micronutrients is affected by lack of access to the parts of the body through which a nutrient may travel before appearing in accessible body compartments (typically blood or urine). Stable isotope-labeled tracers function as safe, nonradioactive tools to follow micronutrients in a quantitative manner because the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the tracer are assumed to be similar to the unlabeled vitamin or mineral. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) supports research on the safe use of stable isotopes in global health and nutrition. This review focuses on IAEA's contributions to vitamin A, iron, and zinc research. These micronutrients are specifically targeted by the WHO because of their importance in health and worldwide prevalence of deficiency. These 3 micronutrients are included in food fortification and biofortification efforts in low- and middle-income regions of the world. Vitamin A isotopic techniques can be used to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions. For example, total body retinol stores were estimated by using 13C2-retinol isotope dilution before and after feeding Zambian children maize biofortified with β-carotene to determine if vitamin A reserves were improved by the intervention. Stable isotopes of iron and zinc have been used to determine mineral bioavailability. In Thailand, ferrous sulfate was better absorbed from fish sauce than was ferrous lactate or ferric ammonium citrate, determined with the use of different iron isotopes in each compound. Comparisons of one zinc isotope injected intravenously with another isotope taken orally from a micronutrient powder proved that the powder increased total absorbed zinc from a meal in Pakistani infants. Capacity building by the IAEA with appropriate collaborations in low- and middle-income countries to use stable isotopes has resulted in many advancements in human nutrition.",

    "abstract": "A pandemic of diabetes and obesity has been developing worldwide in close association with excessive nutrient intake and a sedentary lifestyle. Variations in the protein content of the diet have a direct impact on glucose homeostasis because amino acids (AAs) are powerful modulators of insulin action. In this work we review our recent findings on how elevations in the concentration of the circulating AAs leucine and proline activate a metabolic mechanism located in the mediobasal hypothalamus of the brain that sends a signal to the liver via the vagus nerve, which curtails glucose output. This neurogenic signal is strictly dependent on the metabolism of leucine and proline to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and the subsequent production of malonyl-CoA; the signal also requires functional neuronal ATP-sensitive potassium channels. The liver then responds by lowering the rate of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, ultimately leading to a net decrease in glucose production and in concentrations of circulating glucose. Furthermore, we review here how our work with proline suggests a new role of astrocytes in the central regulation of glycemia. Last, we outline how factors such as the consumption of fat-rich diets can interfere with glucoregulatory mechanisms and, in the long term, may contribute to the development of hyperglycemia, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes.",

Although environmental factors have been the overwhelming focus of research on the causative factors of obesity, research focusing on the physiologic control of appetite in children and adolescents is a neglected area of research. To present this message, a review of FI regulation and the role of food and food components in signaling processes are followed by an examination of the role of hormones during puberty in intake regulation. To examine the interaction of environment and physiology on FI regulation, the effects of exercise, television programs, and food advertisements are discussed. In conclusion, although limited, this literature review supports a need for children and adolescents to be a greater focus of research that would lead to sound nutrition policies and actions to reduce chronic disease. A focus on the environment must be balanced with an understanding of physiologic and behavioral changes associated with this age group.",

    "abstract": "The field of nutrition has been investing in the development of many nutrition-specific and -sensitive policies and programs aimed at improving population-level malnutrition in all its forms. When there is a need to learn about a new system, programmatic context, or target population to understand how to effectively deploy an intervention to help improve nutrition, it is important to be able to ask a broad range of questions, both in topic and in scope. Our aim is to provide a simple and conceptually clear definition and principles to elaborate the science of implementation for nutrition to distinguish it from other ways of knowing and learning and to serve as a guide to the articulation of implementation science questions and methods. Implementation science is a body of systematized knowledge about how to improve implementation that 1) is distinguished by its aims to learn about the process of implementation, 2) uses methods that derive from and fit with the aims, and 3) is built with tacit (as well as expert) knowledge and experiential learning. Implementation science aims to generate the learning needed to improve implementation through facilitating collaboration among stakeholders to articulate and pursue the aims; capturing and using tacit knowledge and experiential learning from stakeholders, systems, providers, and recipients; and applying a mix of methods suited to the aims. This elaboration of the science provides a simple way to help those who already do, or want to do, implementation science understand and communicate how this science is unique and the value that it adds to the current landscape of nutrition priorities, innovations, and the attendant complex learning needs that follow. Implementation science encompasses both discovery- and mission-oriented research, and centers implementation as the object of study for the purposes of broad-based learning.",

Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were included if published after 1999, reported both effect estimates and CIs, and presented results adjusted for confounding variables. Data of the highest coffee consumption level in each study, as well as those of medium consumption levels in studies with ≥3 consumption categories, were pooled using random-effect models, with sex-stratified and sex-adjusted results being analyzed separately. Results were obtained based on data from 13 cross-sectional studies involving 280,803 participants and 2 longitudinal studies involving 17,014 participants. The overall sex-adjusted association of the highest consumption level was not significant (n = 9 studies; OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.10; I2: 91.5%) and the 2 longitudinal studies both yielded no association. Subgroup analysis revealed inverse associations in both males and females, as well as in Caucasians with medium coffee consumption (n = 4 studies, OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.93; I2: 0%). Although residual confounding could affect the results of this meta-analysis, our findings suggested with a low certainty that coffee consumption may not be associated with metabolic syndrome, a finding that is different from those of previous meta-analyses and could be due to variation in characteristics of study participants. More longitudinal studies are also needed to further assess the temporal association between coffee consumption and metabolic syndrome. This meta-analysis was registered at https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero as CRD42018110650.",

    "abstract": "Training to ensure good documentation practices and adherence to regulatory requirements in human nutrition randomized controlled trials has not been given sufficient attention. Furthermore, it is difficult to find this information conveniently organized or in a form relevant to nutrition protocols. Current gaps in training and research surveillance exist in clinical nutrition research because training modules emphasize drugs and devices, promote reliance on monitoring boards, and lack nutrition expertise on human nutrition research teams. Additionally, because eating is essential, ongoing, and highly individualized, it is difficult to distinguish risks associated with interventions from eating under free-living conditions. Controlled-feeding trials provide an option to gain more experimental control over food consumed, but at a price of less external validity, and may pose human behavior issues that are unrelated to the intervention. This paper covers many of the expected practices for documentation and regulation that may be encountered in planning and conducting nutrition intervention trials with examples and references that should be useful to clinical nutrition researchers, funders of research, and research institutions. Included are definitions and guidance on clinical nutrition research oversight (institutional review boards, data safety and monitoring boards, US FDA); participant safety; standard operating procedures; training of investigators, staff, and students; and local culture and reporting requirements relevant to diet-related clinical research conduct and documentation.",

    "abstract": "Sweetness is a sensation that contributes to the palatability of foods, which is the primary driver of food choice. Thus, understanding how to measure the appeal (hedonics) of sweetness and how to modify it are key to effecting dietary change for health. Sweet hedonics is multidimensional so can only be captured by multiple approaches including assessment of elements such as liking, preference, and consumption intent. There are both innate and learned components to the appeal of sweet foods and beverages. These are responsive to various behavioral and biological factors, suggesting the opportunity to modify intake. Given the high amount of added sugar intake in the United States and recommendations from many groups to reduce this, further exploration of current hypothesized approaches to moderate sugar intake (e.g., induced hedonic shift, use of low-calorie sweeteners) is warranted.",

    "abstract": "The release of the 2020-2030 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research (SPNR) and its emphasis on precision nutrition has provided an opportunity to identify future nutrition research that addresses individual variability in response to diet and nutrition across the life span-including those relevant to the Strategic Vision of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The SPNR and the NHLBI's Strategic Vision were developed with extensive input from the extramural research community, and both have 4 overarching strategic goals within which are embedded several objectives for research. For the SPNR, these include 1) spur discovery science and normal biological functions (e.g., role of the microbiome in health and disease), 2) population science to understand individual differences (e.g., biomarkers including 'omics that predict disease status), 3) emerging scientific areas of investigation and their application (e.g., data science, artificial intelligence), and 4) cross-cutting themes (e.g., training the scientific workforce and minority health and health disparities). These strategic goals and objectives serve as blueprints for research and training. Nutrition remains important in the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders and diseases, and the NHLBI has played a pivotal role in supporting nutrition research. In this paper, we report important gaps in the scientific literature related to precision nutrition in HLBS diseases. Research opportunities that could stimulate precision nutrition and their alignment with the SPNR and the NHLBI Strategic Vision Objectives are provided. These opportunities include 1) exploring individual differences in response to varying dietary patterns and nutrients; 2) investigating genetic/epigenetic, biological (e.g., microbiome, biomarkers), social, psychosocial, and environmental underpinnings of individual variability in diet; 3) elucidating the role of circadian rhythm and chrononutrition; and 4) applying implementation science research methods in precision nutrition interventions relevant to HLBS diseases.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of glucose metabolism in response to diet-induced obesity contributes toward numerous complications, such as insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Therefore, there is a need to develop effective strategies to improve glucose homeostasis. In this review, we first discuss emerging evidence from epidemiological studies and rodent experiments that increased consumption of EPA (either as oily fish, or dietary/pharmacological supplements) may have a role in preventing impairments in insulin and glucose homeostasis. We then review the current evidence on how EPA-derived metabolites known as hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids (HEPEs) may be a major mode of action by which EPA exerts its beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Notably, cell culture and rodent studies show that HEPEs prevent fat accumulation in metabolic tissues through peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-mediated mechanisms. In addition, activation of the resolvin E1 pathway, either by administration of EPA in the diet or via intraperitoneal administration of resolvin E1, improves hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and liver steatosis through multiple mechanisms. These mechanisms include shifting immune cell phenotypes toward resolution of inflammation and preventing dysbiosis of the gut microbiome. Finally, we present the next steps for this line of research that will drive future precision randomized clinical trials with EPA and its downstream metabolites. These include dissecting the variables that drive heterogeneity in the response to EPA, such as the baseline microbiome profile and fatty acid status, circadian rhythm, genetic variation, sex, and age. In addition, there is a critical need to further investigate mechanisms of action for HEPEs and to establish the concentration of HEPEs in differing tissues, particularly in response to consumption of oily fish and EPA-enriched supplements.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effects of orally ingested probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics compared with placebo on RTI incidence, duration, and severity in nonelderly adults, and to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. Studies were identified by searching CENTRAL, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to December 2021. English-language, peer-reviewed publications of randomized, placebo-controlled studies that tested an orally ingested probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic intervention of any dose for ≥1 wk in adults aged 18-65 y were included. Results were synthesized using intention-to-treat and per-protocol random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored by subgroup meta-analysis and meta-regression. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool for randomized trials version 2 (RoB2). Forty-two manuscripts reporting effects of probiotics (n = 38), prebiotics (n = 2), synbiotics (n = 1) or multiple -biotic types (n = 1) were identified (n = 9179 subjects). Probiotics reduced the risk of experiencing ≥1 RTI (relative risk = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.98; P = 0.01), and total days (rate ratio = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.83; P < 0.001), duration (Hedges' g = -0.23; 95% CI: -0.39, -0.08; P = 0.004), and severity (Hedges' g = -0.16; 95% CI: -0.29, -0.03; P = 0.02) of RTIs. Effects were relatively consistent across different strain combinations, doses, and durations, although reductions in RTI duration were larger with fermented dairy as the delivery matrix, and beneficial effects of probiotics were not observed in physically active populations. Overall risk of bias was rated as \"some concerns\" for most studies. In conclusion, orally ingested probiotics, relative to placebo, modestly reduce the incidence, duration, and severity of RTIs in nonelderly adults. Physical activity and delivery matrix may moderate some of these effects. Whether prebiotic and synbiotic interventions confer similar protection remains unclear due to few relevant studies.

    "abstract": "When there is an inadequate supply of mother's milk, pasteurized donor human milk is preferred over formula to supplement feeds for preterm infants. Although providing donor milk helps to improve feeding tolerance and reduce necrotizing enterocolitis, changes to its composition and reductions in bioactivity during processing, are thought to contribute to the slower growth often exhibited by these infants. To improve the clinical outcomes of recipient infants by maximizing the quality of donor milk, research is currently investigating strategies to optimize all aspects of processing, including pooling, pasteurization, and freezing; however, reviews of this literature typically only summarize the impact of a processing technique on composition or bioactivity. Reviews of published research investigating the impact of donor milk processing on infant digestion/absorption are lacking and thus, was the objective for this systematic scoping review, Open Science Framework (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/PJTMW). Databases were searched for primary research studies evaluating donor milk processing for pathogen inactivation or other rationale and subsequent effect on infant digestion/absorption. Non-human milk studies or those assessing other outcomes were excluded. Overall, 24 articles from 12,985 records screened were included. Most studied thermal methods to inactivate pathogens, predominantly Holder pasteurization (HoP) (62.5°C, 30 min) and high-temperature short-time. Heating consistently decreased lipolysis and increased proteolysis of lactoferrin and caseins; however, protein hydrolysis was unaffected from in vitro studies. The abundance and diversity of released peptides remain unclear and should be further explored. Greater investigation into less-harsh methods for pasteurization, such as high-pressure processing, is warranted. Only 1 study assessed the impact of this technique and found minimal impact on digestion outcomes compared with HoP. Fat homogenization appeared to positively impact fat digestion (n = 3 studies), and only 1 eligible study investigated freeze-thawing. Identified knowledge gaps regarding optimal methods of processing should be further explored to improve the quality and nutrition of donor milk.",

An expert group was convened in March 2022 to discuss the current issues surrounding cognitive task selection in nutrition research, with a focus on solutions toward informing dietary guidance for cognitive health, to address a gap identified in the 2020 United States Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee report, specifically the \"considerable variation in testing methods used, [and] inconsistent validity and reliability of cognitive testing methods.\" To address this issue, we first undertook an umbrella review of relevant reviews already undertaken; these indicate agreement on some of the issues that affect heterogeneity in task selection, and on many of the fundamental principles underlying the selection of cognitive outcome measures. However, resolving the points of disagreement is critical to ensuring a meaningful impact on the issue of heterogeneity in task selection; these issues hamper the evaluation of existing data for informing dietary guidance. This summary of the literature is therefore followed by the expert group's perspective in the form of a discussion of potential solutions to these challenges, with the aim of building on the work of previous reviews in the area and advancing dietary guidance for cognitive health.

    "abstract": "Achieving optimal health is an aspirational goal for the population, yet the definition of health remains unclear. The role of nutrition in health has evolved beyond correcting malnutrition and specific deficiencies and has begun to focus more on achieving and maintaining 'optimal' health through nutrition. As such, the Council for Responsible Nutrition held its October 2022 Science in Session conference to advance this concept. Here, we summarize and discuss the findings of their Optimizing Health through Nutrition – Opportunities and Challenges workshop, including several gaps that need to be addressed to advance progress in the field. Defining and evaluating various indices of optimal health will require overcoming these key gaps. For example, there is a strong need to develop better biomarkers of nutrient status, including more accurate markers of food intake, as well as biomarkers of optimal health that account for maintaining resilience—the ability to recover from or respond to stressors without loss to physical and cognitive performance. In addition, there is a need to identify factors that drive individualized responses to nutrition, including genotype, metabotypes, and the gut microbiome, and to realize the opportunity of precision nutrition for optimal health. This review outlines hallmarks of resilience, provides current examples of nutritional factors to optimize cognitive and performance resilience, and gives an overview of various genetic, metabolic, and microbiome determinants of individualized responses.",

    "abstract": "The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend two-and-a-half cup equivalents of low-fat and fat-free dairy foods per day for children 4-8 y and 3 cup equivalents per day for adolescents aged 9-18 and adults. Currently, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recognizes 4 nutrients as being of public concern because of suboptimal levels in the diet. These include calcium, dietary fiber, potassium, and vitamin D. In the American diet, dairy foods are leading contributors of calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. Milk, because of its unique nutrient package that provides shortfall nutrients to the diets of children and adolescents, remains an underpinning of dietary recommendations and is included with school meals. Despite this, milk consumption is declining, and >80% of Americans do not meet recommendations for dairy. Data indicate that children and adolescents who consume flavored milk are more likely to consume more dairy and adhere to healthier overall dietary patterns. Flavored milk, however, receives more scrutiny than plain milk because of its contribution of added sugar and calories to the diet and concerns over childhood obesity. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative review is to describe trends in beverage consumption in children and adolescents aged 5-18 y and highlight the science that has examined the impact of including flavored milk in overall healthy dietary patterns within this population.",

    "abstract": "Sexual and gender minorities have a higher risk for health and nutrition-related disparities across the life course compared to the heterosexual or cisgender population. Experiences of stigmatization and discrimination are associated with diminished mental health quality and psychological distress, which are risk factors for developing various eating disorders. Other nutrition disparities include increased risk for food insecurity, body dissatisfaction, and weight complications, such as those experienced by the transgender population in association with gender-affirming hormone therapies. Despite the need for tailored nutrition recommendations that address the unique needs of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning (LGBTQ+) community, there are currently no such guidelines in North America. The purpose of this review is to summarize major LGBTQ+ nutrition disparities and highlight the need for tailored recommendations. We examine the evidence on mental health and social disparities in this group, including vulnerabilities to disordered eating, food insecurity, and healthcare provider discrimination. Importantly, we identify a scarcity of literature on dietary concerns and nutrition care guidelines for LGBTQ+ groups, including studies that address intersectionality and differences among specific gender and sexual orientations. These gaps underline the urgency of prioritizing nutrition for LGBTQ+ health needs and for developing tailored public health nutrition recommendations for this underserved population. Our review suggests that future LGBTQ+ health and nutrition research agendas should include personalized and precision nutrition, social determinants of health, diet quality, body image, and healthcare provider cultural competency and responsiveness. Moreover, the current evidence on LGBTQ+ nutrition and health will be strengthened when research studies (including clinical trials) with robust methodologies amplify inclusion and representation of this community to elucidate health and nutrition disparities in sexual and gender minorities.",

    "abstract": "Potatoes have long been a staple food in many cultures and cuisines, but they have gained a reputation as a low-quality carbohydrate source that should be avoided in the diet. Historically, this view has been justified by citing the glycemic index of potatoes as the main indicator of their quality. However, their nutrient composition should also be considered. The association of potatoes with energy-dense Western dietary patterns has also contributed to a perception that potatoes are inherently unhealthy. Although some studies have suggested an association between potato consumption and increased risk of health problems, such as type 2 diabetes, these associations may be confounded by fried potato intake and are strongest at intake levels higher than average consumption rates. Epidemiologic data suggest total potato intake is not a health risk in Eastern populations and can be consumed as part of a healthy diet. Furthermore, clinical trial data demonstrate that potatoes' health impact, irrespective of preparation, is similar to legumes and comparable with refined grains, with few deleterious effects found. These findings highlight the importance of moving beyond the glycemic index and adopting a more nuanced evaluation of the epidemiologic data to better understand the health impact of potato intake. Ultimately, the negative reputation of potatoes stems from an overinterpretation of their glycemic index and association with unhealthy Western dietary patterns, as well as oversimplification of the epidemiologic data. By considering carbohydrate quality, it becomes clear that potatoes can be part of a healthy diet given the proper consideration.",

    "abstract": "The resurgence in interest and concern regarding the potentially malign interactions between iron administration and malaria infections, especially in young children and pregnant women, has generated a research agenda that is both broad and deep. This paper highlights some of the key questions under 5 headings: basic science; clinical science and epidemiology; technological developments; country level planning; and global policy. At a time of unparalleled progress in basic science, which is illuminating the mechanisms by which iron interacts with infectious organisms, it is concluded that there are good medium-term prospects for achieving policy breakthroughs based on a secure foundation of disease-nutrient interactions. However, it is also stressed that there is much that can be done in the interim, especially in relation to health systems and implementation research that can empower systems to integrate iron interventions with programs for malaria prevention, surveillance, and treatment.",

    "abstract": "High among the challenges facing mankind as the world population rapidly expands toward 9 billion people by 2050 is the technological development and implementation of sustainable agriculture and food systems to supply abundant and wholesome nutrition. In many low-income societies, women and children are the most vulnerable to food insecurity, and it is unequivocal that quality nutrition during the first 1000 d of life postconception can be transformative in establishing a robust, lifelong developmental trajectory. With the desire to catalyze disruptive advancements in global maternal and child health, this landscape review was commissioned by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to examine the nutritional and managerial practices used within the food-animal agricultural system that may have relevance to the challenges faced by global human health. The landscape was categorized into a framework spanning 1) preconception, 2) gestation and pregnancy, 3) lactation and suckling, and 4) postweaning and toddler phases. Twelve key findings are outlined, wherein research within the discipline of animal sciences stands to inform the global health community and in some cases identifies gaps in knowledge in which further research is merited. Notable among the findings were 1) the quantitative importance of essential fatty acid and amino acid nutrition in reproductive health, 2) the suggested application of the ideal protein concept for improving the amino acid nutrition of mothers and children, 3) the prospect of using dietary phytase to improve the bioavailability of trace minerals in plant and vegetable-based diets, and 4) nutritional interventions to mitigate environmental enteropathy. The desired outcome of this review was to identify potential interventions that may be worthy of consideration. Better appreciation of the close linkage between human health, medicine, and agriculture will identify opportunities that will enable faster and more efficient innovations in global maternal and child health.",

Since this time, there has been much debate and little agreement among the nutrition research community on how to move forward, and country policy and program decision makers have been left with incomplete guidance on how to address young child iron deficiency and anemia in their countries. The focus of a recent symposium during the American Society for Nutrition annual meeting, held in Washington, DC, in April 2011, was on exploring options for addressing iron deficiency and anemia among infants and young children in malaria-endemic areas, now, with safe, effective, and feasible interventions that provide iron. Papers based on the invited presentations are included in this supplement. The first paper is a review of the relationship between iron and malaria. The second is an analysis of theoretical and practical considerations regarding the targeted approach of providing iron and includes results from field testing noninvasive screening devices. This is followed by a review of the safety of universal provision of iron through home-fortification products in malaria-endemic areas. The final papers provide a call to action by highlighting pending research issues (fourth paper) and feasible strategies to move programs forward (fifth paper).",

However, average intakes of potassium, DF, and vitamin D were 67%, 55%, and 49% of DRIs, respectively. Mean total vegetable intake was less than the recommendation of 1 cup/d. Boys and girls aged 1–3 y consumed an average of 0.58 cup equivalents of total vegetables on the day of the survey, which included 0.16 cups of WPs. Average vegetable consumption and mean intakes of potassium, DF, and vitamin D were far below recommendations. The consumption of all vegetables, particularly those that are excellent sources of potassium and DF, such as potatoes, should be encouraged.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor:\r\n\r\nWe thank Freedman et al. (1) for their reply to our letter entitled, “Implausible Data, False Memories, and the Status Quo in Dietary Assessment” (2), and appreciate the continuance of the scientific discourse our previous work (3) engendered. Herein we address the claims from Freedman et al. that post hoc data manipulations that improve correlations between biomarkers and physiologically implausible data establish the scientific utility of those improbable data, and that additional 24-h recalls (24HRs) “improve the quality of self-report dietary data.”\r\n\r\nScience is the pursuit of lawful relations between natural phenomena (i.e., knowledge of objective reality), and not mere statistical correlations between numbers (i.e., simple abstractions). It is an oft ignored fact that mathematical and/or statistical representations of natural phenomena per se do not demonstrate the validity of the allied data collection protocols or the representations themselves. As such, numeric representations often mislead those who lack a fundamental understanding of the phenomena under examination. For example, well over 100 y ago Pearson demonstrated that ratios such as those used by Freedman et al. often produce correlations that are a function of the “arithmetic” (i.e., spurious) and are not necessarily indicative of an “organic relation” (4). Given this fact and our previous work (3), we think no amount of mathematical or statistical machinations can establish lawful relations between objective reality and numbers generated by data collection protocols demonstrated to lack validity (i.e., 24HRs and FFQs) (3).\r\n\r\nIt is well established that nutrients, specific foods, beverages, and food groups (e.g., protein, fat, carbohydrate, sugar, alcohol, and vegetables) are subject to differential misreporting that significantly affects subsequent estimates of energy intake (EI) (5–8). For example, dietary composition is significantly altered in under-reporters, with reported fat and/or carbohydrate consumption lower, and reported protein, fruit, and vegetable intake higher (6, 7).Therefore, patterns of dietary consumption will inevitably be differentially and unpredictably misreported when total reported EI is misreported, and this phenomenon will be exacerbated as reported EI becomes increasingly physiologically implausible. The differential misreporting occurs because participants qualitatively and quantitatively misreport dietary composition (e.g., type and amount of foods and beverages) because of intentional and nonintentional factors (e.g., misleading statements because of health-related perceptions, forgetting, and false memories) (7, 8). The nonuniformity of misreporting leads to macro- and micronutrient-specific errors that alter nutrient-to-energy intake ratios in an unpredictable and nonquantifiable manner (8). Stated more simply, it is impossible to discern and quantify the type or amount of dietary components that led to the misreported energy. Thus, the nonquantifiable nature of altered nutrient-to-energy intake ratios via misreporting renders energy adjustments fallacious (5) and demonstrates that data derived from 24HRs and FFQs cannot be used to examine patterns of diet or dietary composition.\r\n\r\nFinally, the statement from Freedman et al. that additional 24HRs “improve the quality of self-report dietary data” is contrary to empirical evidence. The studies examined in their article (9) exhibit greater misreporting of energy and macronutrients with additional administrations of 24HRs. For example, the Energetics Study demonstrated a statistically significant decreasing trend over 8 24HRs for energy (−535 kcal/d) that varied by macronutrient (protein: −22g/d and −88 kcal/d; fat: −27g/d and −243 kcal/d; and carbohydrate: −54g/d and −216 kcal/d) (10). Given these results, Freedman et al. are proposing the paradoxical argument that improved correlations coupled with decreasing nutrient-specific validity demonstrate that multiple 24HRs “improve the quality of self-report data.” We find their position to be contrary to extant evidence and therefore not logically valid.\r\n\r\nIf the essence of science is the ability to discern fact from fiction (i.e., falsifiability), and it is impossible to quantify what percentage of the recalled foods and beverages are completely false reports (e.g., misleading statements and/or false memories), grossly inaccurate (e.g., misestimation), or somewhat congruent with actual consumption, then dietary recall data constitute unscientific evidence (8). As such, we think statistical machinations and the demonstrated lack of validity of 24HRs and FFQs are driving the contradictory nature of recent dietary guidelines (8).",

    "abstract": "The ability of certain foods to impair or augment the absorption of various vitamins and minerals has been recognized for many years. However, the contribution of botanical dietary supplements (BDSs) to altered micronutrient disposition has received little attention. Almost half of the US population uses some type of dietary supplement on a regular basis, with vitamin and mineral supplements constituting the majority of these products. BDS usage has also risen considerably over the last 2 decades, and a number of clinically relevant herb-drug interactions have been identified during this time. BDSs are formulated as concentrated plant extracts containing a plethora of unique phytochemicals not commonly found in the normal diet. Many of these uncommon phytochemicals can modulate various xenobiotic enzymes and transporters present in both the intestine and liver. Therefore, it is likely that the mechanisms underlying many herb-drug interactions can also affect micronutrient absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. To date, very few prospective studies have attempted to characterize the prevalence and clinical relevance of herb-micronutrient interactions. Current research indicates that certain BDSs can reduce iron, folate, and ascorbate absorption, and others contribute to heavy metal intoxication. Researchers in the field of nutrition may not appreciate many of the idiosyncrasies of BDSs regarding product quality and dosage form performance. Failure to account for these eccentricities can adversely affect the outcome and interpretation of any prospective herb-micronutrient interaction study. This review highlights several clinically relevant herb-micronutrient interactions and describes several common pitfalls that often beset clinical research with BDSs.",

    "abstract": "Animal husbandry and capture (AHC) may mitigate anemia among women and children by supplying a source of micronutrient-rich animal source foods (ASF), yet may concurrently increase exposure to anemia-inducing pathogens such as Plasmodium spp., helminths, and enteropathogens. We conducted a systematic literature review to assess the relation between AHC and anemia among women of reproductive age, school-aged children, and children aged <5 y in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We used a 2-stage screening process, in which 1 reviewer searched 4 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Global Health) with predetermined search terms for relevant articles. Two reviewers then independently screened studies using a priori exclusion criteria, yielding a total of 23 articles included in the final review. We evaluated evidence from observational studies assessing animal-dependent livelihoods and livestock ownership, and interventions that promoted livestock and fish production. We found little consistency in anemia outcomes across the several AHC exposures and population groups. Poultry production interventions had modest benefits on anemia among women and children, although whether these improvements were a result of increased ASF consumption, or a result of the combined treatment study design could not be determined. Observational studies identified chicken ownership, and no other livestock species, as a risk factor for anemia among young children. However, there was limited evidence to evaluate pathways underlying these associations. Studies tended to rely on self-reported fever and diarrhea to assess illness, and no study directly assessed linkages between AHC, pathogen burden, and anemia. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether AHC improves or worsens anemia among women and children in LMICs. Given the current interest in promoting animal production among low-income households, future studies with robust measures of livestock ownership, ASF consumption, pathogen burden, and anemia status are needed to understand the nuances of this complex and potentially contradictory relation.",

    "abstract": "Determining the proportion of a population at risk of inadequate or excessive nutrient intake is a crucial step in planning and managing nutrition intervention programs. Multiple days of 24-h dietary intake data per subject allow for adjustment of modeled usual nutrient intake distributions for the proportion of total variance in intake attributable to within-individual variation (WIV:total). When only single-day dietary data are available, an external adjustment factor can be used; however, WIV:total may vary by population, and use of incorrect WIV:total ratios may influence the accuracy of prevalence estimates and subsequent program impacts. WIV:total values were compiled from publications and from reanalyses of existing datasets to describe variation in WIV:total across populations and settings. The potential impact of variation in external WIV:total on estimates of prevalence of inadequacy was assessed through simulation analyses using the National Cancer Institute 1-d method. WIV:total values were extracted from 40 publications from 24 countries, and additional values were calculated from 15 datasets from 12 nations. Wide variation in WIV:total (from 0.02 to 1.00) was observed in publications and reanalyses. Few patterns by population characteristics were apparent, but WIV:total varied by age in children (< vs. >1 y) and between rural and urban settings. Simulation analyses indicated that estimates of the prevalence of inadequate intake are sensitive to the selected ratio in some cases. Selection of an external WIV:total estimate should consider comparability between the reference and primary studies with regard to population characteristics, study design, and statistical methods. Given wide variation in observed ratios with few discernible patterns, the collection of ≥2 days of intake data in at least a representative subsample in population dietary studies is strongly encouraged. In the case of single-day dietary studies, sensitivity analyses are recommended to determine the robustness of prevalence estimates to changes in the variance ratio.",

Among them, edible fruits, grains, and vegetables represent most of the human diet. Because of an important dietary dependence, the comprehensive metabolomic analysis of dietary NPs, performed holistically via the assessment of as many metabolites as possible, constitutes a fundamental building block for understanding the human diet. Both mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are important complementary analytic techniques, covering a wide range of metabolites at different concentrations. Particularly, 1-dimensional 1H-NMR offers an unbiased overview of all metabolites present in a sample without prior knowledge of its composition, thereby leading to an untargeted analysis. In the past decade, NMR-based metabolomics in plant and food analyses has evolved considerably. The scope of the present review, covering literature of the past 5 y, is to address the relevance of 1H-NMR–based metabolomics in food plant studies, including a comparison with MS-based techniques. Major applications of NMR-based metabolomics for the quality control of dietary NPs and assessment of their nutritional values are presented.",

    "abstract": "The field of nutrition has evolved from one focused primarily on discovery of the identities, metabolic functions, and requirements for essential nutrients to one focused on the application of that knowledge to the development and implementation of dietary recommendations to promote health and prevent disease. This evolution has produced a deeper appreciation of not only the roles of nutrients, but also factors affecting their functions in increasingly complex global health contexts. The intersection of nutrition with an increasingly more complex global health context necessitates a view of nutritional status as a biological variable (NABV), the study of which includes an appreciation that nutritional status is: 1) not limited to dietary exposure; 2) intimately and inextricably involved in all aspects of human health promotion, disease prevention, and treatment; and 3) both an input and an outcome of health and disease. This expanded view of nutrition will inform future research by facilitating considerations of the contexts and variability associated with the many interacting factors affecting and affected by nutritional status. It will also demand new tools to study multifactorial relations to the end of increasing precision and the development of evidence-based, safe, and effective standards of health care, dietary interventions, and public health programs.",

    "abstract": "Temporary foreign farm workers (TFWs) are among the most vulnerable and exploitable groups. Recent research shows alarming rates of food insecurity among them. This review explores research focussing on food security of TFWs in Canada and the United States, summarizes findings, and identifies research gaps. Online databases, including MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and government and nongovernment websites, and websites of migrant worker-supporting organizations were searched for peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed papers and reports published between 1966 and 2020 regarding food security of TFWs. Articles reviewed were analyzed to determine publication type, country, year, target population, and main findings. Content analysis was performed to identify major themes. Of 291 sources identified, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Most articles (n = 10) were based on studies conducted in the United States. The prevalence of food insecurity among TFWs ranged between 28% and 87%. From the content analysis, we formulated 9 themes, representing a diversity of perspectives, including access to resources, income, housing and related facilities, food access, dietary pattern and healthy food choices, and migrant's legal status. Instruments reported for the measurement of food security include USDA Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM; n = 8, 72.7%), the modified version of the USDA HFSSM (n = 1, 9%), hunger measure (n = 1, 9%), the modified CDC's NHANES (n = 1, 9%), and 24-h recall, diet history, and/or food-frequency questionnaire (n = 3, 27.3%). Factors impacting food security of TFWs working under the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Programs (SAWPs) in North America are understudied. There is a need to advance research looking particularly at policies and regulatory and administrative aspects of the SAWPs to improve the food security of this cohort. There is also a need for qualitative studies that explore lived experiences and perspectives of TFWs and key informants. Longitudinal studies may be useful to examine various factors, including policy-related, contributing to food insecurity of TFWs over time.",

    "abstract": "The high cost of healthy foods makes maintaining a healthy dietary pattern challenging, particularly among people with diabetes who are experiencing food insecurity. The objectives of this study were to: 1) review evidence on the impact of providing material benefits (e.g., food coupons/vouchers, free food, or financial subsidies/incentives) to improve access to food on clinical parameters, dietary intake, and household food insecurity in people with diabetes, and 2) review relevant economic evidence. Six databases were searched from inception to March 2023 for longitudinal studies with quantitative outcomes. Twenty-one studies were included in the primary review and 2 in the economic analysis. Risk of bias was high in 20 studies and moderate in 1 study. The number of randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies reporting statistically significant improvement, alongside Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) certainty of the evidence was: HbA1c: 1/6 and 4/12 (very low), systolic blood pressure: 0/3 and 1/8 (very low), diastolic blood pressure: 0/3 and 1/7 (very low), BMI: 0/5 and 2/8 (very low), body weight: 0/0 and 1/3 (very low), hypoglycemia: 1/2 and 1/2 (very low), daily intake of fruits and vegetables: 1/1 and 1/3 (very low), daily intake of whole grains: 0/0 and 0/2 (very low), overall diet quality: 2/2 and 1/1 (low), and household food insecurity: 2/3 and 0/0 (very low). The 2 studies included in the economic analysis showed no difference in Medicare spending from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participation and cost-savings from medically tailored meals in an economic simulation. Overall, providing material benefits to improve access to food for people with diabetes may improve household food insecurity, fruit and vegetable intake, and overall diet quality, but effects on clinical parameters and whole grain intake are unclear. The certainty of evidence was very low to low by GRADE. PROSPERO (CRD42021212951)",

    "abstract": "Consumption of nuts and berries are considered part of a healthy eating pattern. Nuts and berries contain a complex nutrient profile consisting of essential vitamins and minerals, fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and phenolics in quantities that improve physiological outcomes. The spectrum of health outcomes that may be impacted by the consumptions of nuts and berries includes cardiovascular, gut microbiome, and cognitive, among others. Recently, new insights regarding the bioactive compounds found in both nuts and berries have reinforced their role for use in precision nutrition efforts. However, challenges exist that can affect the generalizability of outcomes from clinical studies, including inconsistency in study designs, homogeneity of test populations, variability in test products and control foods, and assessing realistic portion sizes. Future research centered on precision nutrition and multi-omics technologies will yield new insights. These and other topics such as funding streams and perceived risk-of-bias were explored at an international nutrition conference focused on the role of nuts and berries in clinical nutrition. Successes, challenges, and future directions with these foods are presented here.",

    "abstract": "Malnutrition is prevalent in people with upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancers and is associated with shorter survival and poor quality of life. In order to effectively prevent or treat malnutrition, nutrition interventions must ensure appropriate energy provision to meet daily metabolic demands. In practice, the energy needs of people with cancer are frequently estimated from predictive equations which are not cancer-specific and are demonstrated to be inaccurate in this population. The purpose of this scoping review was to synthesize the existing evidence regarding energy expenditure in people with upper GI cancer. Three databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase via Ovid, CINAHL plus) were systematically searched to identify studies reporting on resting energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry and total energy expenditure using doubly labeled water (DLW) in adults with any stage of upper GI cancer at any point from diagnosis. A total of 57 original research studies involving 2,125 individuals with cancer of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, biliary tract, or liver were eligible for inclusion. All studies used indirect calorimetry, and one study used DLW to measure energy expenditure, which was reported unadjusted in 42 studies, adjusted for body weight in 32 studies, and adjusted for fat-free mass in 13 studies. Energy expenditure in upper GI cancer was compared with noncancer controls in 19 studies and measured compared with predicted energy expenditure reported in 31 studies. There was heterogeneity in study design and in reporting of important clinical characteristics between studies. There was also substantial variation in energy expenditure between studies and within and between cancer types. Given this heterogeneity and known inaccuracies of predictive equations in patients with cancer, energy expenditure should be measured in practice wherever feasible. Additional research in cohorts defined by cancer type, stage, and treatment is needed to further characterize energy expenditure in upper GI cancer.",

    "abstract": "Micronutrient deficiencies result in a broad range of adverse health and functional consequences, but the true prevalence of specific deficiencies remains uncertain because limited information is available from nationally representative surveys using recommended biomarkers. The present review compares various reported national deficiency prevalence estimates for nutrients and years where the estimates overlap for individual countries that conducted nationally representative surveys and explores possible reasons for any discrepancies discovered. Nationally representative micronutrient status surveys that were conducted since 2000 among preschool-aged children or women of reproductive age and included assessment of iron, vitamin A, or zinc status based on recognized biomarkers were considered eligible for inclusion, along with any modeled deficiency prevalence estimates for these same countries and years. There was considerable variation across different published prevalence estimates, with larger inconsistencies when the prevalence estimate was based on proxies, such as hemoglobin for iron deficiency and dietary zinc availability for zinc deficiency. Numerous additional methodological issues affected the prevalence estimates, such as which biomarker and what cutoff was used to define deficiency, whether the biomarker was adjusted for inflammation, and what adjustment method was used. For some country-years, the various approaches resulted in fairly consistent prevalence estimates. For other country-years, however, the results differed markedly and changed the conclusions regarding the existence and severity of the micronutrient deficiency as a public health concern. In conclusion, to determine micronutrient status, we consider the assessment of one of the recommended biomarkers in a population representative survey as the best available information. If indicated, results should be adjusted for inflammation and generally acceptable cutoffs should be applied to facilitate comparisons, although individual countries may also apply nationally defined cutoffs to determine when and where to intervene. Global consensus is needed on best practices for presenting survey results and defining the prevalence of deficiency.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to present up-to-date evidence regarding the association between nut intake and fertility outcomes in males and females. Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched from inception to 30 June 2023. Eligible articles were interventional or observational studies in human subjects of reproductive age (18-49 y) that assessed the effects (or association) of dietary nut consumption (for a minimum of 3 mo) on fertility-related outcomes. Random-effects meta-analyses were completed to produce a pooled effect estimate of nut consumption on sperm total motility, vitality, morphology, and concentration in healthy males. Four studies involving 875 participants (646 males, 229 females) were included in this review. Meta-analysis of 2 RCTs involving 223 healthy males indicated consumption of ≥ 60g nuts/d increased sperm motility, vitality, and morphology in comparison to controls but had no effect on sperm concentration. Nonrandomized studies reported no association between dietary nut intake and conventional sperm parameters in males, embryo implantation, clinical pregnancy or live birth in males and females undergoing ART. Our meta-analysis shows that including at least 2 servings of nuts daily as part of a Western-style diet in healthy males improves sperm parameters, which are predictors of male fertility. Due to their nutritional profile, nuts were found to have potential to promote successful reproductive outcomes. This trial was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42020204586).",

    "abstract": "Creating effective dietary guidance requires a rigorous evidence base that is predominantly developed from robust clinical trials or large-scale cohort studies, with the quality of the data available depending on the completeness and accuracy of their reporting. An international group of academics from 14 institutions in 12 different countries and on 5 continents, working on behalf of the Federation of European Nutrition Societies within its \"Improving Standards in the Science of Nutrition\" initiative, reviewed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement checklist as it pertains to nutrition trials. This perspective piece documents the procedure followed to gain input and consensus on the checklist previously published by this group, including its presentation and interrogation at the International Union of Nutritional Sciences International Congress of Nutrition 2022 (IUNS-ICN 22), inputs from a survey of journal editors, and its piloting on 8 nutrition trials of diverse designs. Overall, the initiative has been met with considerable enthusiasm. At IUNS-ICN 22, refinements to our proposal were elicited through a World Café method discussion with participating nutrition scientists. The contributing journal editors provided valuable insights, and the discussion led to the development of a potential tool specific to assess adherence to the proposed nutrition extension checklist. The piloting of the proposed checklist provided evidence from real-life studies that reporting of nutrition trials can be improved. This initiative aims to stimulate further discussion and development of a CONSORT-nutrition-specific extension.",

    "abstract": "Past and current U.S. sodium and health policy focused on population-wide reductions in sodium intake. Underlying that policy are a number of assumptions that recent scientific publications challenged. The assumptions include the following: 1) that current intakes are excessive; 2) that the “healthy range” must be below current intakes; 3) that sodium intake can be substantially reduced by public policy; 4) that human intake is dictated by the sodium content of the food supply; and 5) that, unlike all other essential nutrients in which a healthy range is defined by a Gaussian distribution, lower sodium intake is always better. Drawing on the most current published evidence, this review addresses each of these long-standing assumptions. Based on worldwide surveys that assessed sodium intake by 24-h urinary sodium measurements, it is now evident that, across 45 societies and 5 decades, humans consume a reproducible, narrow range of sodium: ∼2600–4800 mg/d. This range is independent of the food supply, verifiable in randomized controlled trials, consistent with the physiologic regulators of sodium intake and is not modifiable by public policy interventions. These findings indicate that human sodium intake is controlled by physiology and cannot be modified by public health policies.",

The Integration to Effective Implementation (I-to-I) concept is intended to address the complexities of the global health context through engagement of the continuum of stakeholders involved in the food and nutrition enterprise. The 2014 Micronutrient Forum (MNF) Global Conference held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in June 2014 offered the opportunity to apply the I-to-I approach with the use of current concerns about the safety and effectiveness of interventions to prevent and treat iron deficiency (ID) as a case study. ID is associated with a range of adverse outcomes, especially in pregnant and nonpregnant women, infants, and primary school-age children. Strategies to combat ID include iron supplementation, multiple micronutrient powders, and food-based interventions to enhance dietary iron intake. Recent reports indicate potential increased adverse risks when iron is provided in areas with high infection burdens (e.g., malaria). This paradox has weakened iron intervention programs. Furthermore, the selection and interpretation of available biomarkers for assessing iron nutrition have been found to be compromised by the inflammatory process. These issues highlight the need for a comprehensive approach that considers basic biology, assessment, interventions, and how these can be translated into appropriate programs and policies. The application of the I-to-I with the use of the MNF offered an opportunity to explore how that might be achieved.",

    "abstract": "HIV infection and undernutrition remain significant public health concerns for infants and children. In infants and children under these conditions, undernutrition is one of the leading causes of death. Proper management of nutrition and related nutrition complications in these groups with increased nutrition needs are prominent challenges, particularly in HIV-prevalent poor-resource environments. Several studies support the complexity of the relation between HIV infection, nutrition, and the immune system. These elements interact and create a vicious circle of poor health outcomes. Recent studies on the use of probiotics as a novel approach to manage microbiome imbalance and gut-mucosal impairment in HIV infection are gaining attention. This new strategy could help to manage dysbiosis and gut-mucosal impairment by reducing immune activation, thereby potentially forestalling unwanted health outcomes in children with HIV. However, existing trials on HIV-infected children are still insufficient. There are also conflicting reports on the dosage and effectiveness of single or multiple micronutrient supplementation in the survival of HIV-infected children with severe acute malnutrition. The WHO has published guidelines that include time of initiation of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-pregnant mothers and their HIV-exposed or HIV-infected children, micronutrient supplementation, dietary formulations, prevention, and management of HIV therapy. However, such guidelines need to be reviewed owing to recent advances in the field of nutrition. There is a need for new intervention studies, practical strategies, and evidence-based guidelines to reduce the disease burden, improve adherence to treatment regimen, and enhance the nutrition, health, and well-being of HIV-infected infants and children. This review provides up-to-date scientific information on current knowledge and existing challenges for nutrition therapy in HIV-infected infants and children. Moreover, it presents new research findings that could be incorporated into current guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Nuts are an energy-dense food, yet regular consumption is not associated with weight gain. A proportion of the fats found within nuts remains encapsulated within cell walls and cannot be digested. Metabolizable energy (ME) can be explored by measuring fecal fat excretion in human studies and fat release among in vitro studies. This systematic review with narrative synthesis aimed to examine the ME of tree nuts and peanuts (PROSPERO CRD42021252287). PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched to June 2021. Both in vitro and human studies (adults ≥18 y) were included. Data was synthesized via narrative synthesis with results reported in summary tables and compared between form, processing, and dose of nuts, where available. Twenty-one studies were included. The ME of nuts was consistently lower than that predicted by Atwater factors for investigated nut types (almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, pistachios, walnuts, and peanuts). The mechanisms may relate to a lower fat release from nuts, hence higher fecal fat excretion; however, this review did not consider the digestibility of carbohydrates and protein, which should be considered when interpreting the outcomes. ME was influenced by nut type (ME = 22.6 kJ/g for pistachios; ME = 18.5 kJ/g for raw almonds), physical form (flour > chopped > whole nuts), heat processing (butter > roasted > raw) and dose of consumption. The lower-than-expected ME may explain a lack of association between nut intake and body weight observed in the literature and has implications for the development of food composition databases, food labeling, and informing dietary guidelines. However, the strength of the evidence base was reduced by the variation in methods used between studies, suggesting that further clinical trials are needed to determine the impact of the findings of this review for clinical dietetics.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a primary modifiable risk factor for CVD, whereby even small reductions in blood pressure (BP) can decrease risk for CVD events. Modification of dietary patterns is an established, nonpharmacologic approach for the prevention and management of hypertension. Legumes are a prevailing component of dietary patterns associated with lower BP in observational research, but there is a need to understand the effects of legume consumption on BP. This study aimed to synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the effects of non-oil seed legume consumption on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (PROSPERO registration: CRD42021237732). We searched CINAHL, Cochrane, Medline, and PubMed scientific databases from inception through November 2022. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to assess the mean differences (MDs) for each outcome variable between legume-based and comparator diets. This review included 16 RCTs and 1092 participants. Studies ranged in duration (4-52 wk), participant age (17-75 y), and weekly legume dose (450-3150 g) in whole or powdered form. No significant overall effect between legume consumption and BP amelioration was observed in the meta-analysis (SBP-MD: -1.06 mm Hg; 95% CI: -2.57, 0.4410 mm Hg; I2 = 45%; DBP-MD: -0.48 mm Hg; 95% CI: -1.06, 0.10 mm Hg; I2 = 0%). The certainty of evidence was determined as low for SBP and DBP. Significant subgroup differences in SBP were found when studies were grouped according to participant BMI, with SBP reduction found for participants with overweight/obese BMI (MD -2.79 mm Hg, 95% CI: -4.68, -0.90 mm Hg). There is a need for large, high-quality trials to clearly define the benefits and mechanisms of legume consumption in BP management. Consideration of the relevance in individuals with obesity, overweight, and hypertension may also be warranted. This trial was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42021237732.",

    "abstract": "IronEach cell in the body acquires iron from the systemic circulation in a calibrated, carefully orchestrated manner for growth, development, and function [1,2].Iron, able to shuttle electrons between ferric (Fe 3þ ) and ferrous (Fe 2þ ) forms, is an essential element for oxygen transport, storage, and utilization.Iron is required for energy production and cellular proliferation and is present in cytochromes, heme and nonheme enzymes, iron-sulfur clusters, neurotransmitters, and other iron-dependent compounds.Although all cells require iron, the majority of body iron (~80%) is present within hemoglobin in circulating red blood cells.The body carefully conserves iron, losing only very small amounts each day, and has no regulated means of excretion.Consequently, iron homeostasis depends on the following: 1) strict control of intestinal iron absorption; 2) efficient recycling of iron from red blood cells at the end of their life span; 3) prompt passage of recycled iron to the erythroid marrow for effective erythropoiesis; and 4) managed maintenance of iron stores in macrophages and hepatocytes.The transport protein transferrin delivers iron through plasma to cells, with each molecule bearing up to 2 Fe 3þ ions.The master regulator of iron homeostasis, hepcidin, adjusts the concentration of transferrin-bound iron in the plasma to control the amount and distribution of body iron.The principal sources of iron export into plasma are the recycling of iron from senescent erythrocytes by specialized macrophages, dietary iron absorption by duodenal enterocytes, and iron release from hepatocyte stores.Hepcidin regulates iron entry to plasma by binding to the only known iron export protein, ferroportin.Hepcidin obstructs and induces degradation of ferroportin, resulting in the retention of iron within iron-exporting cells.Each cell in the body acquires iron from plasma transferrin by expressing transferrin receptor 1 on the cell membrane.After binding, the transferrin-iron-transferrin receptor 1 complex is internalized in an endocytic vesicle, and iron is subsequently released into the cytoplasm.Within the cell, the iron is either used for synthesis of iron-requiring compounds or is safely stored within ferritin, a large spherical protein that can hold up to 4500 iron atoms, and hemosiderin, aggregates of partially digested ferritin.In healthy individuals, plasma or serum ferritin concentrations are an indicator of the amount of body iron stores.With inflammation, plasma ferritin concentrations increase with the acute phase response while hepcidin rises and plasma iron falls.",

These soybean constituents have been proposed to exert several health benefits and as such they have been the subject of an enormous amount of research. This research includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and epidemiologic investigations. Although statistically significant associations between isoflavone intake and a wide range of health outcomes have been identified in cohorts involving low isoflavone intake populations, we suggest that these associations are unlikely to have a causal basis because exposure is too low for isoflavones to exert physiological effects. In cohorts involving predominantly non-Asian, non-vegetarian populations, the highest isoflavone intake category is typically ≤3 mg/d, an amount of isoflavones provided by approximately 30 ml (2 tablespoons) of soymilk made from whole soybeans. In comparison, mean isoflavone intake in the upper intake categories in observational studies involving high isoflavone intake populations is typically ≥50 mg/d. In RCTs, intervention doses of isoflavones typically range from between 40 and 100 mg/d. Health professionals advising patients and clients about soy food and isoflavone intake need to be aware of the limitations of epidemiologic research involving low isoflavone intake populations. Intake recommendations are best based on the results of RCTs using clinically relevant doses of isoflavones and epidemiologic studies involving populations for whom soy foods are a habitual part of the diet.",

Common methods for deriving dose-response meta-analysis (DRMA) may contribute to biased or overly certain risk estimates. We used DRMA models to evaluate the empirical evidence for colorectal cancer (CRC) association with unprocessed red meat (RM) and processed meats (PM), and the consistency of this association for low and high consumers under different modeling assumptions. Using the Global Burden of Disease project's systematic reviews as a start, we compiled a data set of studies of PM with 29 cohorts contributing 23,522,676 person-years and of 23 cohorts for RM totaling 17,259,839 person-years. We fitted DRMA models to lower consumers only [consumption < United States median of PM (21 g/d) or RM (56 g/d)] and compared them with DRMA models using all consumers. To investigate impacts of model selection, we compared classical DRMA models against an empirical model for both lower consumers only and for all consumers. Finally, we assessed if the type of reference consumer (nonconsumer or mixed consumer/nonconsumer) influenced a meta-analysis of the lowest consumption arm. We found no significant association with consumption of 50 g/d RM using an empirical fit with lower consumption (relative risk [RR] 0.93 (0.8-1.02) or all consumption levels (1.04 (0.99-1.10)), while classical models showed RRs as high as 1.09 (1.00-1.18) at 50g/day. PM consumption of 20 g/d was not associated with CRC (1.01 (0.87-1.18)) when using lower consumer data, regardless of model choice. Using all consumption data resulted in association with CRC at 20g/day of PM for the empirical models (1.07 (1.02-1.12)) and with as little as 1g/day for classical models. The empirical DRMA showed nonlinear, nonmonotonic relationships for PM and RM. Nonconsumer reference groups did not affect RM (P = 0.056) or PM (P = 0.937) association with CRC in lowest consumption arms. In conclusion, classical DRMA model assumptions and inclusion of higher consumption levels influence the association between CRC and low RM and PM consumption.

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks regulate metabolic homeostasis. Disruption to our circadian clocks, by lifestyle behaviors such as timing of eating and sleeping, has been linked to increased rates of metabolic disorders. There is now considerable evidence that selected dietary (poly)phenols, including flavonoids, phenolic acids and tannins, may modulate metabolic and circadian processes. This review evaluates the effects of (poly)phenols on circadian clock genes and linked metabolic homeostasis in vitro, and potential mechanisms of action, by critically evaluating the literature on mammalian cells. A systematic search was conducted to ensure full coverage of the literature and identified 43 relevant studies addressing the effects of (poly)phenols on cellular circadian processes. Nobiletin and tangeretin, found in citrus, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate from green tea, urolithin A, a gut microbial metabolite from ellagitannins in fruit, curcumin, bavachalcone, cinnamic acid, and resveratrol at low micromolar concentrations all affect circadian molecular processes in multiple types of synchronized cells. Nobiletin emerges as a putative retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (RORα/γ) agonist, leading to induction of the circadian regulator brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1), and increased period circadian regulator 2 (PER2) amplitude and period. These effects are clear despite substantial variations in the protocols employed, and this review suggests a methodological framework to help future study design in this emerging area of research.",

    "abstract": "Addressing malnutrition for all requires understanding inequalities in nutrition outcomes and how they intersect. Intersectionality is increasingly used as a theoretical tool for understanding how social characteristics intersect to shape inequalities in health outcomes. However, little is known about the extent, range, and nature of quantitative nutrition research engaging with intersectional inequalities. This systematic scoping review aimed to address this gap. Between 15 May 2021 and 15 May 2022, we searched 8 databases. Studies eligible for inclusion used any quantitative research methodology and aimed to investigate how social characteristics intersect to influence nutrition outcomes. In total, 55 studies were included, with 85% published since 2015. Studies spanned populations in 14 countries but were concentrated in the United States (n = 35) and India (n = 7), with just 1 in a low-income country (Mozambique). Race or ethnicity and gender were most commonly intersected (n = 20), and body mass index and overweight and/or obesity were the most common outcomes. No studies investigated indicators of infant and young child feeding or micronutrient status. Study designs were mostly cross-sectional (80%); no mixed-method or interventional research was identified. Regression with interaction terms was the most prevalent method (n = 26); 2 of 15 studies using nonlinear models took extra steps to assess interaction on the additive scale, as recommended for understanding intersectionality and assessing public health impacts. Nine studies investigated mechanisms that may explain why intersectional inequalities in nutrition outcomes exist, but intervention-relevant interpretations were mostly limited. We conclude that quantitative nutrition research engaging with intersectionality is gaining traction but is mostly limited to the United States and India. Future research must consider the intersectionality of a wider spectrum of public health nutrition challenges across diverse settings and use more robust and mixed-method research to identify specific interventions for addressing intersectional inequalities in nutrition outcomes. Data systems in nutrition must improve to facilitate this. This review was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42021253339.",

Understanding the temporal patterning of these 24-h behaviors and their contextual determinants is key to determining their combined effect on health. A scoping review was conducted to identify novel analytic methods for determining temporal behavior patterns and their contextual correlates. We searched Embase, ProQuest, and EBSCOhost databases in July 2022 to identify studies published between 1997 and 2022 on temporal patterns and their contextual correlates (e.g., locational, social, environmental, personal). We included 14 studies after title and abstract (n = 33,292) and full-text (n = 135) screening, of which 11 were published after 2018. Most studies (n = 4 in adults; n = 5 in children and adolescents), examined waking behavior patterns (i.e., both PA and SED) of which 3 also included sleep and 6 included contextual correlates. PA and diet were examined together in only 1 study of adults. Contextual correlates of dietary, PA, and sleep temporal behavior patterns were also examined. Machine learning with various clustering algorithms and model-based clustering techniques were most used to determine 24-h temporal behavior patterns. Although the included studies used a diverse range of methods, behavioral variables, and assessment periods, results showed that temporal patterns characterized by high SED and low PA were linked to poorer health outcomes, than those with low SED and high PA. This review identified temporal behavior patterns, and their contextual correlates, which were associated with adiposity and cardiometabolic disease risk, suggesting these methods hold promise for the discovery of holistic lifestyle exposures important to health. Standardized reporting of methods and patterns and multidisciplinary collaboration among nutrition, PA, and sleep researchers; statisticians; and computer scientists were identified as key pathways to advance future research on temporal behavior patterns in relation to health.",

This systematic review aimed to examine the interaction between genetic factors and breastfeeding and how their combination is associated with children weight status. Four databases were searched until August 2024, and 8 eligible studies were identified. The fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARG2) genes were the most examined genes. Although the results of interactions between breastfeeding and genetics factors on children's weight status were inconsistent, some of studies reported that breastfeeding or exclusive breastfeeding attenuated the disadvantageous association between the risk alleles of the genes (higher obesity-specific genetic risk score for a multiple-gene study) and overdevelopment of children's body weight. These findings support the WHO recommendations for prolonged breastfeeding and further suggest breastfeeding interventions to prevent childhood obesity may be more effective in populations with a disadvantageous genetic predisposition.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of dollar stores as retail sources of food in the United States is a phenomenon with implications for diets, nutrition, and well-being. We convened a broadly interdisciplinary group of researchers and experts from government and academia at the 2-day Food Access at Dollar Stores (FADS) workshop, held in Boston, MA in 2022. The event brought together economists, social scientists, public health researchers, and advocates to discuss the concerns and research questions raised by the growth of dollar stores and their increased role in food retail and access. In-person, moderated discussions on day 2 of the workshop generated a range of topics considered important for future research. A subsequent survey, using a modified Delphi approach, identified priority research areas. Nine research area categories emerged as a result of discussion at the FADS workshop and received prioritization from the experts: Local community impacts; Health and nutrition impacts; Policy and programs; Systemic issues - racism, poverty, and food access; Store offerings and locations; Shoppers and customers; Employees and employment; Corporate distribution, strategy, and marketing; and Dollar stores compared with other food sources. The growth of dollar stores as food retailers remains an under-researched area of study for food access and nutrition that requires interdisciplinary expertise and collaboration to understand.",

    "abstract": "Universal oral iron supplementation, undertaken according to 1998 WHO guidelines, produced adverse consequences among some children in malaria-endemic areas. Prompted by the Pemba trial, which revealed excessive hospitalizations and deaths, WHO advised that iron supplementation in such regions be accompanied by previous screening for iron deficiency. This agenda, however, poses issues of cost, benefit, acceptability, technical feasibility, and reliability of such screening. The cost of equipment and personnel is balanced against savings from iron supplements spared and treatment for morbidity averted. Costs aside, the most efficacious acceptable screening approach for avoiding hospitalization and deaths must be fielded. Screening before supplementation can be used to assess hematological, iron, and possible inflammatory status to differentiate the source of decreased hemoglobin concentration. Iron deficiency has often been inferred from hematological status markers. The need for extraction of blood, albeit capillary in origin, and high assay costs limit the use of validated methods in screening. Noninvasive methods, i.e., not requiring the extraction of blood, provide the most acceptable and potentially least expensive approach for determining hematological or iron status. Although a noninvasive technique for iron and inflammatory status would be the ideal, it is unattained. Field-friendly, skin-probe hemoglobin devices, derived from instruments for clinical settings, are being developed and tested for eventual rollout in malarial areas. Given a firm grounding for the theoretical requirements needed to advance the screening agenda, evaluation and monitoring of the performance of screening devices can proceed hand in hand.",

    "abstract": "Around one-quarter of the world's children suffer from iron deficiency anemia, and many of them live in malaria-endemic areas. However, there is evidence that iron supplements can increase risk of severe malaria morbidity. The dilemma is how to move forward with interventions to prevent iron deficiency and its consequences in young children, using strategies that minimize risks of malaria and related infections. Screening for iron deficiency is problematic for several reasons. Two complementary strategies are suggested for moving forward with interventions to prevent iron deficiency in children exposed to malaria. The first is to reduce exposure to iron in the form of supplements by: adopting a lifecycle approach to pediatric iron deficiency beginning in utero, using the lowest adequate dose, and giving iron in or with foods. The second is to coordinate iron interventions with malaria control efforts. To stop all iron interventions in malaria-endemic areas is an unreasonable policy option. While research findings continue to increase our understanding, there are also programmatic ways forward with the knowledge at hand.",

    "abstract": "The workplace has been identified as a potential location for dietary intervention delivery due to the amount of time spent and the meals eaten in this setting. It is recommended that interventions are tailored to specific occupational groups, and to date, there is limited synthesis of the evidence relating to health care workers. This review characterizes and evaluates the effectiveness of dietary interventions in health care workers to aid the design and implementation of interventions. The MEDLINE database was searched to September 2020. The reference list of an umbrella review was hand-searched for additional titles against inclusion criteria. The search included 1) population, 2) intervention, and 3) work environment. Studies were assessed for risk of bias. Harvest plots and forest plots were created to display study quality, direction, and size of effect of selected primary (energy, fruit and vegetable, and fat intake) and secondary outcomes (weight, BMI, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol concentrations). Thirty-nine articles assessing 34 interventions were eligible for inclusion. Intervention types most commonly used were environmental, educational, educational plus behavioral, and behavioral. Due to the heterogeneity in study design and intervention type, results were largely inconclusive. For dietary outcomes, interventions produced small–moderate favorable changes in fruit, vegetable, and fat intake. Decreased fat intake was mainly observed in environmental interventions and increases in fruit and vegetable intake were observed when an educational and/or behavioral component was present. Interventions producing weight loss were mostly nonrandomized trials involving education and physical activity. Total and LDL cholesterol decreased in interventions involving physical activity. Meta-analyses revealed significant decreases in energy intake, weight, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol in nonrandomized trials where data were available. Much more research is needed into strategies to promote diet quality improvement in health care workers. A protocol for this review is registered at PROSPERO (CRD42021234906).",

    "abstract": "The racial and ethnic disparities in diet-related chronic diseases are major concerns. This systematic review examines the extent to which diet-induced changes in health outcomes, such as cardiometabolic, inflammation, cancer, bone health, and kidney function outcomes, etc., have been reported and discussed by race or ethnicity in randomized trials with 2 or more diet arms that recruited both minority and non-Hispanic White groups. Databases (i.e., PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched up to August 2021. Thirty-four studies that discussed effects of defined dietary interventions on health outcomes by racial or ethnic minority group compared with non-Hispanic Whites were included in the systematic review (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021229256). Acute trials and those with 1 diet arm that accounted for race or ethnicity in their analyses and studies that focused on a single racial or ethnic group were discussed separately. Most studies were conducted in Black compared with White adults testing effects of energy restriction, macronutrient modification, sodium reduction, or variations of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on cardiometabolic outcomes. There was limited focus on other minority groups. Evidence suggests greater blood pressure reduction for Black adults compared with Whites particularly with DASH (or similar) diets. Overall, there was limited consideration for group-specific eating patterns and diet acceptability. Overall risk of bias was low. With emerging precision nutrition initiatives that aim to optimize metabolic responses in population subgroups through tailored approaches, it is imperative to ensure adequate representation of racial and ethnic subgroups for addressing health disparities. Factors that help explain variability in responses such as socioecological context should be included and adequately powered. Given the racial and ethnic disparities in chronic diseases, studying the adoption, maintenance, and effectiveness of dietary interventions on health outcomes among different groups is critical for developing approaches that can mitigate diet-related health disparities.",

    "abstract": "Evidence regarding the effect of isomaltulose on glycemic and insulinemic responses is still conflicting, which limits isomaltulose's application in glycemic management. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively evaluate its effectiveness and evidence quality. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) prior to October 2021. RCTs were eligible for inclusion if they enrolled adults to oral intake of isomaltulose or other carbohydrates dissolved in water after an overnight fast and compared their 2-h postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations. The DerSimonian-Laird method was used to pool the means of the circulating glucose and insulin concentrations. Both random-effects and fixed-effects models were used to calculate the weighted mean difference in postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations in different groups. Subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses were also conducted. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Finally, 11 RCTs (n = 175 participants) were included. The trials were conducted in 4 countries (Japan, Brazil, Germany, and the Netherlands), and all of the enrolled participants were >18 y of age with various health statuses (healthy, type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, and hypertension). Moderate evidence suggested that oral isomaltulose caused an attenuated glycemic response compared with sucrose at 30 min. Low evidence suggested that oral isomaltulose caused an attenuated but more prolonged glycemic response than sucrose and an attenuated insulinemic response. Low-to-moderate levels of evidence suggest there may be more benefit of isomaltulose for people with type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or hypertension; older people; overweight or obese people; and Asian people. The study was registered on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) as CRD42021290396 (available at https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/).",

    "abstract": "Numerous governmental and health organizations recommend reduced intake of added sugars due to the health risks associated with excess intake, including the risk of obesity. Some organizations further recommend avoiding dietary sweetness, regardless of the source. A scoping review and evidence map were completed to characterize the research that investigated associations between dietary sweetness and body weight. The aim was to identify and map published studies that have investigated total dietary sweetness, sweet food/beverages, sugar, or sweetener intake, and body weight-related outcomes and/or energy intake. Using preregistered search terms (osf.io/my7pb), 36,779 publications (duplicates removed) were identified from PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus and screened for inclusion. Eligible studies were clinical trials, longitudinal cohorts, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, and systematic reviews conducted among adults (age ≥18 y), which were performed to investigate associations between dietary sweetness, sweet foods/beverages, sugar, or sweetener (energetic or nonenergetic) intake and body weight, BMI, adiposity, and/or energy intake. A total of 833 eligible publications were identified, detailing 804 studies. Only 7 studies (0.9% of included studies; 2 clinical trials, 4 cross-sectional studies, and 1 with another design type) investigated associations between total dietary sweetness and body weight-related outcome and/or energy intake. An additional 608 (75.6%) studies investigated intakes of sweet foods/beverages, sugar, or sweetener, and body weight-related outcomes and/or energy intake, including 225 clinical trials, 81 longitudinal cohorts, 4 case-control studies, and 280 cross-sectional studies. Most studies (90.6%) did not measure the sweetness of the diet or individual foods consumed. Ninety-two (11.4%) publications reported data from studies on dietary patterns that included sweet foods/beverages alongside other dietary components and 97 (12.1%) systematic reviews addressed different but related research questions. Although there is a breadth of evidence from studies that have investigated associations between intakes of sweet foods and beverages, sugars, and sweeteners and body weight, there is a limited depth of evidence on the association between total dietary sweetness and body weight.",

    "abstract": "Carcinogenesis is a complicated process and originates from genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Recent studies have reported a potential critical role for the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene in carcinogenesis through different signaling pathways such as mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylation. The most common internal modification in mammalian mRNA is the m6A RNA methylation that has significant biological functioning through regulation of cancer-related cellular processes. Some environmental factors, like physical activity and dietary intake, may influence signaling pathways engaged in carcinogenesis, through regulating FTO gene expression. In addition, people with FTO gene polymorphisms may be differently influenced by cancer risk factors, for example, FTO risk allele carriers may need a higher intake of nutrients to prevent cancer than others. In order to obtain a deeper viewpoint of the FTO, lifestyle, and cancer-related pathway interactions, this review aims to discuss upstream and downstream pathways associated with the FTO gene and cancer. The present study discusses the possible mechanisms of interaction of the FTO gene with various cancers and provides a comprehensive picture of the lifestyle factors affecting the FTO gene as well as the possible downstream pathways that lead to the effect of the FTO gene on cancer.",

    "abstract": "The ability of children to recover from linear growth retardation, often referred to as catch-up growth, has intrigued researchers for many decades. Whether adoption from a low-to a high-income setting, which provides a comprehensive improvement in the conditions that cause children to not grow well, leads to catch-up growth is unknown. We estimated the association of adoption (or placement in foster care) with catch-up in linear growth and child development before 5 years of age. We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis using individual participant data for linear growth. We obtained study-specific and subgroup estimates and pooled the estimates using random-effects models. Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the robustness of our findings. A review of child development outcomes was conducted. We included 485 children under 5 years of age from 9 adoption studies. At baseline, children had a mean age of 15.8 mo and a length deficit of 3.9 cm. Adoption reduced this gap by 77% or 3.0 cm (95% CI: 1.9-4.1 cm)(mean age 32.3 mo). Catch-up growth was found in both girls (3.6 cm; 95% CI 2.9-4.2 cm) and boys (2.5 cm; 95% CI: 1.9-3.1 cm) and in children adopted after the age of 24 mo (2.2 cm, 95% CI 0.6-3.7 cm). The sensitivity analyses did not change any of the substantive findings. The magnitude of catch-up in child development (mean reduction in deficit of 46%) was smaller than in linear growth. Catch-up in linear growth in children under five is biologically possible when the environment is improved profoundly and comprehensively. Partial reversal of the accumulated height deficit was more likely than recovery in developmental outcomes which highlights the need to ensure all children grow and develop in environments that prevent deficits from occurring rather than trying to correct them. PROSPERO CRD42022298715; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPEROFILES/298715_PROTOCOL_20220429.pdf STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study, the first meta-analysis of adoption using individual participant data, showed that adoption reduced children's accumulated height deficit by approximately 3 cm. Catch-up in linear growth was more likely than recovery in developmental outcomes which highlights the need to ensure that children grow and develop in environments that prevent deficits from occurring rather than trying to correct them.",

    "abstract": "Consumer engagement is important to design high-quality educational nutrition information that holistically addresses consumers' needs. This can occur through consultation and feedback mechanisms like surveys or focus groups, consumer expert panels or advisory boards to provide the consumers' perspective, or through participatory research methods. The extent of consumer engagement also varies with differing levels of influence over the decision-making process. This systematic scoping review aimed to explore and synthesize the extent to which consumers are engaged in designing various types of educational nutrition interventions, the methods and levels of consumer engagement, and its impact on the resulting educational nutrition information presented. We comprehensively searched Medline via OVID, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycINFO. Each article was independently screened by two authors by title and abstract. Two reviewers independently assessed the full text of remaining articles for eligibility. Two authors independently extracted data from the 36 final articles (15 original and 21 sub-studies) which included an assessment of consumer engagement per the International Association of Public Participation (IAP2) spectrum. Fourteen of the fifteen studies obtained input from consumers to inform the design of the educational nutrition information in terms of content, design, wording, and platform. However, consumer engagement across the studies mostly sat within the \"Consult\" and \"Involve\" level of the IAP2 spectrum, with only one study achieving a \"Collaborate\" engagement level. This suggests a low level of genuine consumer partnership in the studies to date. Consumer engagement across the studies differ on how, and the extent to which consumers were engaged in designing educational nutrition information. Greater emphasis on shared decision-making and collaborating with consumers right from the start is key to ensuring that educational nutrition information designed for them best addresses their needs and preferences, which potentially translates to better health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The composition of total protein and free amino acids (FAA) in preterm human milk (HM) is crucial for optimizing infant growth and development. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to quantify the amount of true, crude, and unspecified protein and FAA in preterm HM. Ebsco, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched up to July 2023 measuring total protein and FAA in preterm HM. Two reviewers, working independently, screened all titles and abstracts using Covidence software to identify studies meeting inclusion criteria [preterm <37 weeks; Human Development Index >0.8; cross-sectional, case-controlled (n>1), prospective cohort, and randomized clinical trials; English language]. Random effects models were used to estimate mean protein and FAA content across studies. Data were aggregated for studies reporting multiple estimates (e.g., across time). Heterogeneity was estimated using I2 and publication bias using Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient. Of the 884 articles identified, a total of 66 original studies were included for the meta-analysis comprising an estimated 30,421 preterm HM samples. Preterm colostrum (<4 d) contained the highest mean [95% CI] true protein at 2. 32 [1. 96, 2. 68] g/100 mL, followed by transition preterm HM (5-14 d) mean true protein of 1. 77 [1. 60, 1.93] g/100 mL. Mature (>14 d) preterm HM had the lowest mean true protein content at 1.46 [1.34, 1.59] g/100 mL. Glutamate was the most prevalent FAA reported. This systematic review provides updated estimates of protein and FAA concentrations in preterm HM. We found significant variability in the quality of studies, completeness of the reported results, and analytical methodologies across studies. REGISTRY NUMBER IN PROSPERO: CRD42023445191 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The current manuscript advances the field of human milk nutrition by providing up-to-date estimates of protein and/or free amino acids in colostrum, transition, and mature preterm HM. These values fulfill a critical need for practitioners and researchers to more accurately understand the nutritional needs of preterm infants, as well as any supplementary nutrition that may be necessary for appropriate growth and development.",

    "abstract": "Aspartame (L-α-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester) has been implicated in increased risk for several chronic health conditions, yet underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To systematically identify and summarize all controlled intervention studies investigating effects of aspartame consumption on glucose, insulin and appetite-related hormone responses. Five academic databases, four trial registries, and additional resources were searched until June 2024. Search hits were screened, in duplicate, for intervention studies of aspartame versus comparator, which assessed glucose, insulin and/or any other appetite-regulating hormone. Results were tabulated, and meta-analyses run where ≥10 studies with similar methodology were found. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB-2. Certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. 101 articles were identified, detailing 100 experiments: 79 acute (<1 day), 8 medium-term (2-30 days), 13 long-term (>30 days). Experiments involved healthy adults, individuals with aspartame sensitivity and individuals with compromised glucose metabolism, varied widely in aspartame provision and comparator/s, and while almost all assessed glucose and/or insulin responses, few experiments investigated other appetite-regulating hormones. Meta-analyses (acute cross-over studies) revealed few effects of aspartame on blood glucose/insulin compared with vehicle or low-calorie-sweeteners (LCS), and lower blood glucose/insulin levels compared with sugars, other carbohydrates or nutritive elements. Over the medium- and long-term, few effects of aspartame were found, and high heterogeneity between studies remained. Similar effects were found in other populations, and other outcomes, with few adverse events. Risk of bias assessments suggested 'some concerns' for the majority of studies. The certainty of the evidence for all outcomes in all populations was judged to be 'very low'. Our findings suggest little to no effects of aspartame consumption on glucose metabolism over the short- or longer-term. Further studies over the longer-term, assessing a range of appetite-regulating hormones, and comparing aspartame with other LCS would be of value. PROSPERO:CRD42024540781, 29.04.24. While the health impacts of aspartame consumption remain controversial, this work identified 100 experiments investigating the effects of aspartame consumption on glucose, insulin and other appetite-regulating hormone responses. Little to no effects of aspartame were found over the short- or long-term, with no contra-indications for health.",

    "abstract": "The global increase in early childhood overweight and obesity has prompted interest in early prediction of overweight and obesity to allow timely intervention and prevent lifelong consequences. A systematic review was conducted to assess the accuracy and feasibility of predicting overweight and obesity in individual three to seven-year-old children using data available in healthcare and community settings on children under 24 months of age. This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024509603) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. From 7,943 unique articles identified through PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Google Scholar, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria, 13 from high-income countries and one from a middle-income country. These studies evaluated the accuracy of predicting childhood overweight or obesity in individual children using anthropometrics-alone or multiple-predictor models. Anthropometrics-alone models yielded areas under the curve (AUCs) ≥0.56 with expert guidance and ≥0.77 with machine learning. Multiple-predictor models yielded AUC ≥0.68 with expert guidance and ≥0.76 with machine learning. The inclusion of child, parental, and community predictors improved predictive accuracy but led to greater variation in performance across models. Models were more accurate when children were older at the initial assessment, multiple assessments were made, and the time between assessment and outcome prediction was shorter. Prediction models with an AUC ≥0.70 used machine learning to optimize variable selection, limiting their practicality for broad-scale implementation in healthcare or community settings. There is insufficient evidence on the accuracy of overweight and obesity prediction models for children in low- and middle-income countries. Existing prediction models are not well-suited for broad-scale screening of individual children for risk of early childhood overweight or obesity.",

    "abstract": "Among women living with HIV (WLHIV), adherence to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) combined with undetectable maternal viral loads and exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 mo of life dramatically reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This knowledge has led to updated World Health Organization infant feeding guidelines for WLHIV, calling for governments to support safe breastfeeding practices among WLHIV who want to breastfeed their infants by providing universal access to HAART, viral load tracking, and high-quality breastfeeding counseling and other needed support across settings. These guidelines eventually led several high-income countries, including the United States and Canada, to revise their infant feeding guidelines that previously contraindicated breastfeeding among WLHIV to incorporate safe, evidence-based breastfeeding recommendations for WLHIV. However, in most of the rest of the Americas, breastfeeding contraindication remains in place. We strongly recommend that all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean consider updating their breastfeeding guidance for WLHIV to allow for safe breastfeeding. Implementing the updated evidence-based recommendations poses major implementation challenges as there is no room for error. Systems-driven implementation science research will be needed to understand how best to codesign, implement, scale up, and sustain intersectoral and equitable person and family-centered policies and programs to empower WLHIV to breastfeed safely if they have the choice to do so.",

Undernutrition during this critical time in the lifecycle can have adverse effects on both the pregnant female and her offspring. Despite the widespread recognition of this issue, current international guidelines provide insufficient direction on optimal nutritional management strategies. Most clinical trial evidence has yielded inconclusive results. This perspective synthesizes evidence on current management strategies in addressing macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies in pregnancy. Additionally, we examine the critical role of inflammation in moderating the effectiveness of nutritional interventions and discuss emerging strategies that integrate infection control with nutrition to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes. Given the limitations of existing management strategies, there is an urgent need for more comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines to improve pregnancy outcomes for undernourished females worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Inequities in diet quality are evident worldwide and reflect structural disadvantages. There is increasing evidence that dietary inequities may be most meaningful in relation to educational attainment, a finding that contradicts the common belief that dietary inequities are primarily attributable to material disadvantage (i.e. inadequate incomes). Moreover, diet quality declines with each step down the educational ladder, and therefore, these educational inequities affect all of society. The purpose of this perspective is to posit that educational attainment is a key structural stratifier of diet quality and dietary inequities-what we term a super determinant-and that greater research attention should be given to interrogating pathways through which educational attainment shapes diet quality. To inform our perspective, we conducted extensive keyword searches in PubMed and Google Scholar to identify concepts, theories, and empirical data pertaining to educational inequities in diet quality, health, and mortality, followed by a conceptual synthesis of findings. On the basis of these findings, we first describe pathways through which educational attainment shapes diet quality. We then demonstrate that educational inequities in diet quality are often much larger than they are for income. For instance, absolute gaps and gradients in Healthy Eating Index-2015 scores between the most and least educated adults were 7-11 points in Canada, whereas they were just 2-5 points in relation to household income. We provide converging evidence related to large and growing educational inequities in diet quality, health, and mortality internationally. We subsequently consider an important counterfactual-that the affordability of a healthy diet is the key determinant of dietary inequities-and empirically demonstrate that economic factors are not primary drivers of socioeconomic inequities in diet quality. We conclude that attributing dietary inequities primarily to the higher costs of healthy foods is overly simplistic and ignores the critical role of educational attainment as a structural stratifier of dietary inequities.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized impact of vitamin supplementation on maternal, infant and lactational nutritional status in low- and middle-income countries. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and WHO library databases were searched. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials of micronutrient supplementation in healthy pregnant/lactating women, assessing maternal/infant micronutrient status or milk composition. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed for outcomes with ≥2 studies, and evidence quality was evaluated using GRADE. Eighty-seven papers (76 trials, including 65 for meta-analysis) were included. Maternal vitamin B-12 supplementation during pregnancy increased serum cobalamin levels (standard mean difference [SMD] 0.39; 95% CI 0.11, 0.68; P=0.01) and reduced deficiency (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.19, 0.95; P=0.04), with improved B-12 concentrations in milk, especially when administered postpartum (SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.02, 0.63; P=0.04), but had no consistent effect on infant or cord serum cobalamin levels. Vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy or postpartum improved maternal serum levels (SMD 0.57; 95% CI 0.12, 1.01; P=0.01) and reduced deficiency at thresholds ≤0.7 μmol/L (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.45, 0.73; P<0.001); however, its effects on infant and cord serum levels were negligible. Postpartum vitamin A supplementation improved milk vitamin A concentrations (SMD 0.53; 95% CI 0.19, 0.86; P<0.001), particularly with single high-dose regimens. Supplementation with vitamin D during pregnancy increased maternal serum vitamin D levels (SMD 0.89; 95% CI 0.55, 1.24; P<0.001), reduced deficiency at thresholds ≤50 nmol/L (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.14, 0.64; P<0.001) and increased vitamin D levels in infant and cord serum. Micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy and lactation improved maternal nutritional status but showed inconsistent effects on infant nutritional status, highlighting the need for further research.

    "abstract": "Human milk contains many components with physiological effects beyond basic nutrition, including large quantities of structurally diverse oligosaccharides. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been linked to health outcomes through microbiome-dependent and microbiome-independent mechanisms. To investigate the microbiome-independent effects of individual HMOs and their role in human health, it is necessary to understand their systemic availability. This narrative review focuses on the systemic availability of HMOs and summarizes studies that investigated the presence of HMOs in blood and urine following oral intake in humans. We searched PubMed using the following terms individually or in combination: human milk oligosaccharides, HMO, 2'-fucosyllactose, 3-fucosyllactose, 3'-sialyllactose, 6'-sialyllactose, difucosyllactose, lacto-N-tetraose, and lacto-N-neotetraose. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) study design observational or interventional; 2) cohort included breastfed infants, HMO-formula-fed infants or individuals taking HMO supplements; and 3) methods defined HMO absorption/excretion and described analysis. We identified 15 human studies. They varied in design, populations (healthy infants, infants with medical indications, and adults), administration (breastfeeding, formula, and supplement), ingested dose, sampling time points, and analytical methods. HMOs were absorbed into the bloodstream and excreted in urine, as they were detected in the blood and urine of breastfed infants, infants receiving HMO-fortified formula, and adults receiving HMO supplements, demonstrating their systemic availability. Most orally ingested HMOs appeared in blood, but some structures were not absorbed. Studies also reported that blood and urine concentrations of HMOs correlated with increasing doses. Some studies showed a difference between the number of HMOs ingested and the number of oligosaccharides found in urine. Current evidence supports the systemic availability of HMOs in both infants and adults, but absorption kinetics, rates, mechanisms, and metabolic fate remain unknown. Further research investigating the systemic availability of HMOs is needed to improve our understanding of the microbiome-independent effects of HMOs on human health.",

    "abstract": "Human activities contribute to large shifts in the global climate, with far-reaching impacts on ecosystems, societies, and human health. Modern food systems-designed to produce convenience foods that tend to have high inflammatory potential-exacerbate environmental degradation and shape the interwoven challenges of climate, nutrition, and health. Over the past three decades, extreme weather has worsened and poor diets have led to more inflammation-related health problems-two parallel trends that are exposing system-wide weaknesses and harming global health. Is there evidence of a connection between environmental degradation and inflammation? The medical and environmental literatures were searched by combining \"climate change\" OR \"environmental factors\" OR \"food systems\" AND \"inflammation\" AND \"diet\". All permutations of these terms were searched and all terms were searched as both text words and MeSH. The literature on inflammation and health is vast (≈750,000 articles in the National Library of Medicine [NLM]) as is the literature on diet and health (>1.8 million articles in the NLM). Interest in global climate change is growing (≈39,000 references in the NLM and >650,000 references in the Web of Science Core Collection). While the literature at the intersections of diet and inflammation with either climate change or, especially, food systems is small, evidence points to a connection between global climate changes and inflammation operating mainly through food systems. Large-scale industrialized agriculture and other environmental changes that are heating the planet produce food commodities that are causally related to inflammatory processes within organisms. The interplay between individuals' dietary decisions and system-level decisions regarding food production and processing sets the stage for deepening understanding of connections revealed in the literature and developing a multifaceted approach to address these critical problems that encompass individual behavior change and collaborative initiatives across sectors to effect meaningful change. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: While scientific knowledge on: 1) diet, inflammation and health; 2) climate change; and 3) food systems are vast, there is virtually nothing written regarding how all three may be connected. We propose a connection between personal behaviors associated with diet, food systems, climate change, and inflammation as the major substrate for determining health in human populations.",

    "abstract": "Healthy Food Voucher Programs (HFVPs) provide lower-income participants with benefits to purchase healthy, nutrient-dense foods and are a promising strategy for improving dietary and nutritional outcomes. HFVPs can complement policies aimed at reducing unhealthy food consumption, contributing to improved food security, dietary outcomes and reducing nutritional disparities. Understanding the structural factors that make these programs acceptable and effective in improving dietary patterns is essential for designing impactful HFVPs. However, updated evidence on these components is limited. This narrative review focuses on incentive programs that provide voucher benefits for healthy foods, synthesizing global evidence on program structure components (i.e., participant eligibility and enrollment, benefit delivery and timing, eligible products, benefit value, program duration, retail venues, and inclusion of nutrition education) that may influence program impact. It also summarizes diet and nutrition-related outcomes by country's income level, when possible. Key determinants of program acceptability included positive interactions with program and retail staff, available multilingual information, electronic benefits over physical ones, a variety of eligible healthy foods, and including local markets as participating venues. Additionally, offering remote enrollment options, using mail delivery or electronic benefits to avoid transportation costs, adjusting benefits for inflation and household size, allowing redemption in various retail venues, and coupling benefits with engaging nutrition education activities were factors influencing program effectiveness. Most evidence indicates that HFVPs increase the purchase and consumption of healthy foods, improve food security, and enhance nutrition knowledge. However, mixed results were found regarding diet quality indicators, physical health outcomes, and mental health. Factors such as insufficient benefit size, inflation and rising food prices, and short intervention lengths contributed to null results. Our findings underscore the potential of HFVPs to improve diets and reduce nutritional disparities; however, addressing identified barriers during program design and implementation is essential to ensure these programs achieve their goals. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the global evidence on healthy food voucher programs, highlighting structural components that significantly influence their acceptability and effectiveness across diverse populations. By emphasizing the importance of tailored program design and examining key factors that influence success, it provides a valuable foundation for future policy development and evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) is an ambitious effort to estimate the disease burden attributable to various risk factors. The results from the GBD are used around the world to monitor the UN established Sustainable Development Goals, set health policies and research strategies, among others. The GBD along with other studies, such as those from the Maternal Child Epidemiology Estimation Group and the Lancet Breastfeeding Series Group, produce estimates of the nutrition-related global burden of disease that exhibit considerable differences. These differences are difficult to reconcile due to the estimation methods, which in recent years have substantially increased in complexity. In this paper, we give a detailed review of the methods used by GBD and other entities to estimate the global burden of disease that is attributable to undernutrition and suboptimal breastfeeding. Further, we compare the methods to determine causes for differences in estimates. We find that the main determinant of differences in estimates is what causes of death are linked to each risk factor. Methods used to estimate nutrition-related disease burden need to be more clearly documented to foster discussion and collaboration on the important assumptions required to produce estimates.",

Based on the current understanding of the potential mechanisms of adverse effects of iron, the risk can probably be minimized by using the lowest possible efficacious dose of iron, preferably delivered in small amounts throughout the day with food, to minimize spikes in plasma nontransferrin-bound iron and large amounts of unabsorbed iron in the gastrointestinal tract. Results from 6 home fortification studies in malaria-endemic areas showed no increased risk of morbidity (including malaria), but these studies were not powered to rule out a modest increase in the risk of severe adverse events. At present, the safest option is to implement home fortification in the context of comprehensive malaria control strategies, as recommended in recent WHO guidelines.",

This review focused specifically on the neonatal period (first 28 d of life for humans) to inform guidance by WHO on recommendations related to NVAS. A systematic search of international and regional databases was conducted. Inclusion criteria were human or animal studies that gave oral vitamin A as a single or limited number of doses to apparently healthy neonates. Studies evaluating fortification or food-based approaches, dosing with retinoic acid, or studies of neonatal models of disease were excluded. The search retrieved 8847 unique records. After screening by title and abstract, 88 were screened using the full text, and 35 records met inclusion criteria: 13 human and 22 animal studies. Studies indicate that high-dose NVAS is absorbed well by neonates, typically mirroring fat absorption. Doses were primarily stored in the liver and transiently increased in the lung, kidney, spleen, adrenal glands, brain, skin, and adipose tissue, generally with a dose-response. Serum retinol and retinyl esters also transiently increased following NVAS. Although minimal acute adverse effects are noted, there is a lack of data supporting NVAS for improving organ maturation or sustained delivery to target organs. Research gaps include the physiological effects of the short-term increase of vitamin A concentrations in extrahepatic tissues, or whether there are unknown adverse effects over time.",

We map these developments across themes derived from conceptual A&N pathways and expert consultations. We created an interactive Evidence and Gap Map (EGM) from a systematic search of published and gray literature since 2008, following Campbell Collaboration guidelines. We retrieved over 30,000 reports from published literature databases, and individually searched 20 online repositories. We systematically screened 24,359 reports by title and/or abstract, 1577 by full report, and included 904 eligible reports. The EGM consists of rows of thematic domains and columns of types of tools, metrics, and methods, as well as extensive coding applied as filters. Each cell of the map represents research surrounding a type of tool, metric, or method within a given theme. Reports in each cell are grouped by stage of development, which expand to a corresponding bibliography. Users can filter EGM reports by various characteristics. The 4 most populated domains were: diets, nutrition, and health; primary food production; water, sanitation, and hygiene; and environment and sustainability. The 4 most common types of metrics, methods, and tools were: diet metrics; footprint analysis (especially water); technology applications; and network or Bayesian analysis. Gaps represent areas of few or no reports of innovation between 2008 and 2018. There were gaps in reports and innovations related to: power or conflicts of interest; food environments; markets; private sector engagement; food loss and waste; conflict; study design and system-level tools, metrics, and methods. The EGM is a comprehensive tool to navigate advances in measurement in A&N research: to highlight trends and gaps, conduct further synthesis and development, and prioritize the agenda for future work. This narrative synthesis accompanies the EGM, which can be found at https://www.anh-academy.org/evidence-and-gap-map.",

    "abstract": "Food allergy (FA) affects the quality of life of millions of people worldwide and presents a significant psychological and financial burden for both national and international public health. In the past few decades, the prevalence of allergic disease has been on the rise worldwide. Identified risk factors for FA include family history, mode of delivery, variations in infant feeding practices, prior diagnosis of other atopic diseases such as eczema, and social economic status. Identifying reliable biomarkers that predict the risk of developing FA in early life would be valuable in both preventing morbidity and mortality and by making current interventions available at the earliest opportunity. There is also the potential to identify new therapeutic targets. This narrative review provides details on the genetic, epigenetic, dietary, and microbiome influences upon the development of FA and synthesizes the currently available data indicating potential biomarkers. Whereas there is a large body of research evidence available within each field of potential risk factors, there is a very limited number of studies that span multiple methodological fields, for example, including immunology, microbiome, genetic/epigenetic factors, and dietary assessment. We recommend that further collaborative research with detailed cohort phenotyping is required to identify biomarkers, and whether these vary between at-risk populations and the wider population. The low incidence of oral food challenge–confirmed FA in the general population, and the complexities of designing nutritional intervention studies will provide challenges for researchers to address in generating high-quality, reliable, and reproducible research findings.",

    "abstract": "Poor vitamin D status impairs bone growth and immune defense in school-aged children and adolescents, particularly in minorities. Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency increases the risk of acute viral respiratory infection, underscoring the need for adequate vitamin D intakes during school sessions when viral exposure may be greatest. We studied available vitamin D-related survey data and published findings based on NHANES (2001-2018) to assess the dependency of vitamin D status {25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]; in nmol/L} on vitamin D intake (μg/d) in elementary school-aged children (4-8 y), middle school children (9-13 y), and high school adolescents (14-18 y). We sought evidence supporting the need for school programs to facilitate vitamin D adequacy. Usual vitamin D intakes from food and beverages by children/adolescents (NHANES 2015-2018) examined at the 50th percentile intake by race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic) showed all age groups consumed less than half of the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for vitamin D (10 μg/d), independent of race/ethnicity. NHANES (2001-2010) analyses show evidence of lower vitamin D status in school-aged children that is linked to lower intakes of fortified milk varying over race/ethnicity and age. Adolescents had lower vitamin D status and milk intake than younger children. A total of 22-44% of vitamin D intakes occurred away from home, with larger percentages of total intakes at breakfast and lunch, at times consistent with school meals. Ever-present inadequate vitamin D intakes with a large percentage consumed away from home together with well-established benefits to growth, bone, and immune defense from enriched vitamin D-fortified milk in school intervention trials provide strong justification to require enriched vitamin D-fortified foods in school meals. An easy to implement plan for improving vitamin D intakes is possible through the FDA's amendment allowing higher vitamin D fortification levels of dairy and plant-based milk alternatives that could increase vitamin D intakes beyond the EAR with just 2 daily servings.",

    "abstract": "National health and nutrition monitoring is an important federal effort in the United States and Canada, and the basis for many of their nutrition and health policies. Understanding of child exposures through human milk (HM) remains out of reach due to lack of current and representative data on HM's composition and intake volume. This article provides an overview of the current national health and nutrition monitoring activities for HM-fed children, HM composition (HMC) and volume data used for exposure assessment, categories of potential measures in HM, and associated variability factors. In this Perspective, we advocate for a framework for collection and reporting of HMC data for national health and nutrition monitoring and programmatic needs, including a shared vision for a publicly available Human Milk Composition Data Repository (HMCD-R) to include essential metadata associated with HMC. HMCD-R can provide a central, integrated platform for researchers and public health officials for compiling, evaluating, and sharing HMC data. The compiled compositional and metadata in HMCD-R would provide pertinent measures of central tendency and variability and allow use of modeling techniques to approximate compositional profiles for subgroups, providing more accurate exposure assessments for purposes of monitoring and surveillance. HMC and related metadata could facilitate understanding the complexity and variability of HM composition, provide crucial data for assessment of infant and maternal nutritional needs, and inform public health policies, food and nutrition programs, and clinical practice guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy represents a critical window for both maternal and child health. Previous studies have shown that the consumption of an organic diet during pregnancy can reduce pesticide exposure compared with the consumption of a conventional diet. It is possible that this could, in turn, improve pregnancy outcomes, because maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications. Organic foods are produced by methods that comply with organic standards, generally restricting the use of agrochemicals, such as synthetic pesticides. In the past few decades, the global demand for organic foods has increased drastically, driven in large part by consumer beliefs that organic foods provide benefits to human health. However, the effects of organic food consumption during pregnancy on maternal and child health have not been established. This narrative review aims to summarize current evidence regarding the consumption of organic foods during pregnancy and the potential effects on short- and long-term health outcomes in mothers and offspring. We performed a comprehensive literature search and identified studies investigating the association between organic food consumption during pregnancy and health outcomes in mothers and their offspring. The outcomes identified from the literature search included pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and otitis media. Although existing studies suggest that consumption of organic foods (overall or a specific kind) during pregnancy may have health benefits, further investigation to replicate the findings in other populations is needed. Moreover, because these previous studies have all been observational and thus may be limited by the potential for residual confounding and reverse causation, causal inference cannot be established. We argue that the next necessary step in this research is a randomized trial to test the efficacy of organic diet intervention in pregnancy on maternal and offspring health.",

More detailed FDA rules have been created since then, specifying the ranges or minimum intakes of nutrients and providing details for the safe production and evaluation of infant formulas. Although generally effective in ensuring safe IF, recent events have made it clear that a re-evaluation of aspects of all the nutrient composition regulations for IF is needed, including consideration of adding requirements related to bioactive nutrients not mentioned in the IFA. We propose that, as principal examples, the requirement for iron content needs to be re-evaluated and that DHA and AA should be considered for addition to the nutrient requirements after scientific review by a panel such as those established by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Additionally, there is no specific requirement in current FDA regulations for the energy density of IF, and this should be added alongside potential revisions of the protein requirement. It would also be ideal to have specific FDA rules on nutrient intakes for premature infants as these are exempted from the specific nutrient regulations of the amended IFA.",

This scoping review aimed to 1) analyze observational studies that assessed the relationship between diet and antihypertensive/lipid-lowering medication use and 2) evaluate whether medication was used as a complement to heart-healthy dietary intakes. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL through 14 January, 2023, for studies that assessed either 1) intraindividual changes in diet associated with lipid-lowering/antihypertensive medication initiation or use or 2) interindividual differences in diet between users and nonusers of these medications. A total of 17 studies were included. Of those, 3 prospectively assessed the intraindividual changes in diet associated with medication initiation or use, but none documented potential changes in diet prior to medication initiation. The 14 other studies compared dietary intakes of medication users and nonusers, most of which also relied on an incomplete assessment of the temporal dynamics between diet and medication use as they employed cross-sectional (n = 12) or repeated cross-sectional (n = 2) designs. Data from 8 studies, including 4 of the 5 studies from Europe, suggested that medication was used as a complement to heart-healthy diets, whereas data from the 9 other studies, including the 4 conducted in the United States, provided no such evidence, indicating potential between-country differences in this relationship. Finally, no studies investigated how the dynamics between diet and medication use influenced the long-term CVD risk. This scoping review suggests that the current literature on the relationship between lipid-lowering/antihypertensive medication use and diet provides an incomplete perspective on how medication may influence diet in CVD prevention. Prospective studies assessing intraindividual changes in diet associated with medication initiation and use and how these dynamics influence the CVD risk are thus needed.",

To date, no systematic reviews have examined randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of TRF supplementations specifically in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to examine the changes in HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin), blood pressure, and serum Hs-CRP (C-reactive protein high sensitivity) levels at post-TRF supplementation. Online databases including PubMed, Scopus, OVID Medline, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception until March 2023 for RCTs supplementing TRF in patients with T2DM. A total of 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis to estimate the pooled effect size. The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias (RoB) Assessment Tool was utilized to evaluate the RoB in individual studies. The meta-analysis revealed that TRF supplementation at a dosage of 250-400 mg significantly decreased HbA1c (-0.23, 95% CI: -0.44, -0.02, P < 0.05, n = 754), particularly where the intervention duration is less than 6 mo (-0.47%, 95% CI: -0.90, -0.05, P < 0.05, n = 126) and where duration of diabetes is less than 10 y (-0.37, 95% CI: -0.68, -0.07, P < 0.05, n = 83). There was no significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and serum Hs-CRP (P > 0.05). The present meta-analysis demonstrated that supplementing with TRF in patients with T2DM decreased HbA1c but does not decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure and serum Hs-CRP.",

    "abstract": "In 1997, the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) dietary reference intakes (DRI) Committee established a magnesium (Mg) tolerable upper intake level (UL) for adults of 350 mg/d from supplemental intake alone. Diarrhea was the limiting factor. The safety of oral Mg dietary supplements exceeding the UL is currently in debate. Increasing the UL may result in more Mg supplementation, decreasing the prevalence of undernutrition for this nutrient and thus providing additional protection against numerous chronic diseases. This perspective aims to show that more recent and comprehensive evidence-based data on the occurrence of diarrhea indicate that the Mg UL for adults should be re-evaluated. To update the literature base to re-evaluate setting the Mg UL, a PubMed search was conducted to identify intervention studies published between 1997 and 2022 that used single-ingredient Mg products reporting a priori diarrhea adverse events among adults. The Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) was also searched for adverse events caused by Mg supplementation. The PubMed search identified 10 studies, including 5 meta-analyses and 5 randomized controlled trials, that met the search criteria. Seven studies (Mg intakes of 128–1200 mg/d) found no significant differences in diarrhea occurrence between the intervention and control groups. One meta-analysis found only minor differences in gastrointestinal disturbances between groups given placebo versus 520 mg Mg/d, but withdrawals were not significantly different between groups. Another meta-analysis found that 3 of 13 studies (120–973 mg/d) reported diarrhea that led to study withdrawal, but the treatment arm was not specified in 2 studies. The CAERS search, when limited to single-ingredient suspect Mg products, found only 40 attributable cases of gastrointestinal adverse events. Only one-third of these 40 cases noted a complaint of diarrhea. These updated data indicate that doses above the current UL for Mg supplements can be consumed without adverse events.",

The summarized findings from human intervention studies investigating the effect of reduced dietary carbohydrate and increased fat intake (and in studies also increased protein) while maintaining energy intake at eucaloric requirements reveal a beneficial effect of carbohydrate reduction on hepatic TG content in obese individuals with steatosis and indices of insulin resistance. Evidence suggests that the reduction of hepatic TG content following reduced intake of carbohydrate and increased fat/protein intake in humans results from regulation of fatty acid (FA) metabolism within the liver, with an increase in hepatic FA oxidation and ketogenesis, together with a concomitant downregulation of FA synthesis from de novo lipogenesis. The adaptations in hepatic metabolism may result from reduced intrahepatic monosaccharide and insulin availability, reduced glycolysis and increased FA availability when carbohydrate intake is reduced.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) increases risk for morbidity and mortality. Food-based approaches offer one strategy to improve vitamin A status. This systematic review assessed evidence of the effects of food-based approaches on the vitamin A status of women and children under 5 y. VAD was defined as clinical ocular symptoms, such as loss of vision, and/or retinol plasma or serum concentration <0.70 μmol/L. Searches on food-based approaches to improve vitamin A status were conducted for the period 2011-2022 on PubMed, CINHAL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using PRISMA guidelines. English-language publications were included. Case studies, unpublished dissertations, and non-peer-reviewed studies were excluded. This review comprises 24 of 27,322 identified studies; 23 included studies focused on provitamin A carotenoids. There were 17,214 participants across the 24 studies with sample sizes ranging from 8 to 3571 individuals. Intervention studies spanned from 3 wk to 2 y. Fifteen (63%) studies were randomized control trials, 7 were cross-sectional, and 2 were longitudinal studies. Most studies (N = 21) used biochemical measurements, for example, serum retinol, to assess vitamin A status; other studies used clinical symptoms (for example, xerophtalmia) or dietary intake. Thirteen (54%) studies reported a statistically significant effect of food-based interventions (N = 8) or an association of diet (N = 5) on vitamin A status. This systematic review indicated that some food-based interventions improved vitamin A status, thus offering a safe and effective delivery mechanism for vitamin A. There appeared to be significant association between vitamin A status and consumption of foods with high concentrations of preformed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids. Differences across studies in regard to the period of evaluation, food approaches used, and statistical power may explain the lack of effectiveness of food-based approaches on vitamin A status in some studies.",

    "abstract": "In the United States, college students experience disproportionate food insecurity (FI) rates compared to the national prevalence. The experience of acute and chronic FI has been associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes in this population. This narrative review aims to summarize the current methodologies for assessing health outcomes associated with the experience of FI in college students in the United States. To date, assessing the health outcomes of FI has predominately consisted of subjective assessments, such as self-reported measures of dietary intake, perceived health status, stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep behaviors. This review, along with the emergence of FI as an international public health concern, establishes the need for novel, innovative, and objective biomarkers to evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of FI on physical and mental health outcomes in college students. The inclusion of objective biomarkers will further elucidate the relationship between FI and a multitude of health outcomes to better inform strategies for reducing the pervasiveness of FI in the United States college student population.",

    "abstract": "The only known function of iodine in the human body is as a component of thyroid hormones. Thus, all consequences of iodine deficiency should be mediated through altered thyroid hormone production. While it is well established that severe iodine deficiency affects thyroid hormone production, the association between mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency and thyroid function remains unclear. To review and summarize observational studies that examine the association between mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency and thyroid hormone function in the general population, including infants, children, adolescents, adults, pregnant and lactating women. Systematic searches of the literature were performed in November 2022 and repeated in February 2024 utilizing the Medline Ovid, Embase Ovid, and Cochrane Central databases. Mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency was defined as a median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) of 20-100 μg/L in children, adolescents, and general adults, and 50-150 μg/L in pregnant women. Thyroid function outcomes included TSH, (f)T3, and (f)T4, and clinical thyroid dysfunction entities. A total of 72 studies were included: 59 cross-sectional, 12 repeated cross-sectional (longitudinal), and one cohort study. Populations studied included infants, children, and adolescents (n=7); women of reproductive age, including lactating women (n=5); general adults (n=20); and pregnant women (n=43). Most studies reported no clear association between iodine status and thyroid function across all groups. For all population groups, most studies found no clear association between iodine status and thyroid function. Meta-analyses for eight studies in pregnant women showed no difference in TSH, fT4, or fT3 for those with mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency vs. adequate status [mean difference (95% CI): TSH, 0.03 (-0.05, 0.12) mIU/L; fT4, -0.20 (-0.94, 0.53) pmol/L; fT3, 0.05 (-0.14, 0.03) pmol/L]. No clear association between mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency with thyroid function in the different population groups was found. Registered at www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO as CRD42022360447. This is the first systematic review to provide a comprehensive overview of observational studies investigating the association between mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency and thyroid function in the general population, including infants, children, adolescents, adults, pregnant and lactating women.",

However, the adequacy of nutrient intake depends not only on the total amount consumed but also on the fraction absorbed and utilized by the body. Accurate assessments of nutrient bioavailability require predictive equations or algorithms. This paper outlines a 4-step framework designed to guide researchers in developing such equations. The framework includes: 1) identifying key factors that influence nutrient or bioactive compound bioavailability; 2) conducting a comprehensive literature review of high-quality human studies to inform the development of predictive equations; 3) constructing predictive equations based on these insights; and 4) validate the equation, when feasible, to potentiate translation. This structured approach aims to enhance the accuracy and precision of nutrient bioavailability estimates, address data limitations, and highlight evidence gaps to inform future research and policy on nutrients and bioactive compounds.",

    "abstract": "Modern cancer therapy is effective at reducing tumor burden and extending lifespan. However, cancer therapy also induces various gastrointestinal (GI) side effects that are dose-limiting, reduce quality of life, and potentially lead to treatment failure. Standard medical nutrition therapy for patients undergoing cancer treatment focuses on preventing weight loss and malnutrition but not reducing GI symptoms. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess efficacy of nutrition therapy to reduce GI side-effects during cancer treatment via systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic search was conducted in Scopus and PubMed databases. A meta-analysis was performed on articles meeting inclusion criteria to estimate the pooled effect size on GI symptoms, separated by nutrition intervention type (nutrient supplementation, oral nutrition supplement, or dietary counseling). Further Subgroup analyses were conducted based on cancer type, cancer therapy, and nutrient intervention. All statistical analyses were performed in Stata/MP version 17.0 using 2-sided tests with p < 0.05 as the threshold for statistical significance. 15,556 articles were captured by the search algorithm, and 139 studies met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Articles reported 12 different GI symptoms, resulting in 151 total meta-analyses across symptom, cancer treatment, and nutrition intervention subtypes. Meta analyses indicated that collectively (all interventions combined), nutrient supplementation reduced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea incidence (all p < 0.001). Oral nutrition supplements had no effects on GI symptoms (all p > 0.05). Dietary counseling reduced constipation and diarrhea incidence. While 9 individual nutrient supplementation interventions reduced 8 symptoms, probiotic supplementation had some of the strongest effects on abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea incidence. This meta-analysis supports implementation of specific medical nutrition therapies to treat GI symptoms during cancer therapy and identifies those requiring additional investigation. Given the large variation in responses within and across studies, future experiments should explore personalized nutrition-based strategies to optimize treatment efficacy.

    "abstract": "Increasing exclusive breastfeeding among Latino populations has potential to reduce health disparities. There is a need for a multi-level and multi-domain framework of exclusive breastfeeding determinants. Co-create an exclusive breastfeeding determinants framework among Latino populations; To map the framework using the current literature METHODS: Our community coalition convened in working groups to adapt a multi-level and multi-domain determinants framework with 20 cells (4 levels x 5 domains) for exclusive breastfeeding among Latino populations. We documented all referenced determinants in working groups, and two independent raters deductively and inductively analyzed these specific determinants into themes by cell (level-domain). An integrated scoping review mapped the determinants addressed in the literature of exclusive breastfeeding interventions among Latinos in the US onto the framework cells. Two independent raters transcribed intervention descriptions verbatim and deductively analyzed the text using our list of determinants as the codebook. Inductive analysis allowed for emerging determinants. We mapped determinants that were addressed by theme. A total of 111 specific determinants were referenced in working groups that were categorized into 53 determinant themes. Most studies addressed Individual level determinants at each domain (n=11-16 studies) except for Built Environment (n=3). At the Interpersonal level, Behavior (n=11) and Health Care System (n=16) domains were predominantly addressed. At the Community level, Built Environment (n=14) and Health Care System (n=15) domains were addressed. Most studies at the Societal level addressed the Health Care System domain but none addressed Biological, Behavior, or Built Environment domains. Extension of Care, Culturally Relevant Care, Knowledge and Skills, Mother-Infant Bonding, and Practitioner-Dyad Relationship were referenced the most of all 56 themes (n≥13 each). Increasing exclusive breastfeeding among Latinos is a multi-faceted challenge. Innovative areas for future work include Biological and Sociocultural domains beyond the Individual level as well as most domains at the Societal level.",

    "abstract": "Dietary guidelines recommend limiting saturated fat (SFA) intake by replacing SFA with polyunsaturated fats (PUFA). PUFA and SFA have opposing effects on LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and therefore the dietary ratio of PUFA to SFA (P:S) may be a better indicator of LDL-C response than SFA alone. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials was conducted to examine LDL-C responses to higher P:S ratio diets compared to isoenergetic, total fat-matched diets with lower P:S ratios in healthy adults. A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science was conducted. Randomized complete feeding trials lasting ≥3 weeks including two test diets with P:S ratios differing by >0.3 that were matched for energy, fiber, and total fat were included. Random effects meta-analysis was used to evaluate the mean difference (MD) in LDL-C with higher P:S ratio diets compared to lower P:S ratio diets. Heterogeneity in the effect of the P:S ratio by SFA content of the test diets was also evaluated. In total, 1001 publications were identified, and 24 publications reporting 24 trials (n=1011) were eligible. Higher P:S ratio diets (median P:S ratio 1.2; PUFA 10.6%kcal; SFA 8.0%kcal; MUFA 12.6%kcal) lowered LDL-C (MD -9.84 mg/dL; 95%CI -13.65, -6.04; I2=79%) compared to lower P:S ratio diets (median P:S ratio 0.4; PUFA 4.4%kcal; SFA 12.5%kcal; MUFA 14.6%kcal). Heterogeneity in the P:S ratio effect was observed by the test diet SFA content (p<0.001). Higher versus lower P:S ratio diets lowered LDL-C (MD -15.72 mg/dL; 95%CI -20.51, -10.92; I2=68%) when the test diets differed in SFA (≥2%kcal), but not when diets were SFA matched (MD -3.45 mg/dL; 95%CI -7.88, 0.98; I2=70%). Compared to lower P:S ratio diets, higher P:S ratio diets were associated with greater LDL-C reductions in generally healthy adults, and this effect was stronger when PUFA replaced SFA.

    "abstract": "The sine qua non of intervention studies in general, and randomized controlled trials in particular, is to define and isolate an exposure of interest that defines the intervention and distinguishes between groups. The isolation of a presumptive cause is a prerequisite to the confident attribution of given effects. In the context of dietary intervention studies, this has historically translated into a unitary intervention diet type, no matter the diversity of preferences, tastes, upbringings, ethnicities, and cultures represented in a given study cohort. To the extent such diversities have been constrained to achieve this aim, generalizability (external validity) has been diminished. To the extent such diversities have been ignored, inattention to them has likely shifted results toward the null and compromised adherence over time. These same liabilities pertain to food service projects and public health nutrition, notably the food-as-medicine movement. We propose a remedy to these issues and an update to the formula for dietary intervention research (and service) that accommodates a multicultural society: the fixed-quality, variable-type (FQVT) nutrition intervention. This method standardizes the objective measure of diet quality and incorporates fixed tolerances for nutrients of particular interest, while allowing for a range of diet types responsive to the variable preferences of study participants/population members. We describe the application of tools to facilitate this methodological innovation, enumerate the expected advantages, and characterize means of empirical testing. We submit the FQVT method as a promising, testable advance in the evolution of clinical nutrition research and food-is/as-medicine programming.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation in both animal and plant. miRNAs derived from edible plants, referred to as xenomiRs, are proposed to cross-kingdom barriers and to modulate mammalian gene expression. However, this dietary xenomiR hypothesis remains controversial, given numerous inconsistencies and conflicting evidence regarding stability, bioavailability, and functionality of xenomiRs in mammals. Despite promising findings, including reports of plant-derived miRNAs influencing mammalian gene expression in vitro and in animal models, evidence remains inconclusive in humans. Several independent investigations have reported contradictory findings, emphasizing reproducibility lack in identifying and validating the transfer of xenomiRs from plants to mammals, which has raised concerns about the robustness, reliability, and biological significance of some results. Additionally, no direct molecular evidence currently demonstrates that plant xenomiRs bind to mammalian silencing machinery. Although the concept of plant-derived xenomiRs holds significant potential, future research must address unresolved technical and biological limitations. If validated, this hypothesis may represent a novel avenue for epigenetic modulation through dietary intervention in precision medicine and personalized nutrition. This comprehensive narrative review critically provides an overview of the dietary xenomiR hypothesis, specifically focusing on those derived from edible plants. We summarize the current evidence regarding xenomiR cross-kingdom communication potential, and we discuss technical and biological challenges that impede their validation. We also explore the speculative yet plausible scenario that dietary miRNAs may act locally on the microbiota rather than systemically.",

    "abstract": "Assessing behaviors related to food choice at individual- and household-levels is essential for improving household diets, but assessment tools are limited. We conducted a scoping review to identify gaps in existing assessment tools for food acquisition, preparation, and household consumption practices in South Asia, where diets are rapidly changing. We undertook systematic keyword searches of three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection) to identify studies assessing food acquisition, food preparation, and household consumption practices in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, published in English between 2000 and April 2025. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, and extracted data on study characteristics and the assessment tools used to examine the food choice behaviors. Of 13,160 unique articles identified, 50 were included for synthesis. Food acquisition behaviors (e.g., what and how often food is purchased, changes in food purchases) were assessed by 26 studies, food preparation (e.g., cooking habits, intra-household distribution of responsibilities, preparation methods) by nine studies, and household consumption practices (e.g., timing, snacking, meal skipping, eating away from the home) by 30 studies. Most studies used quantitative methods (n=34), some used qualitative methods (n=13), and few used mixed methods (n=3). Likert scales and semi-structured interviews were the most used tools for quantitative and qualitative assessments, respectively. Across the 50 studies, 40 different tools were used to assess food-related behaviors and only 14 studies claimed using validated tools. Few studies included a full tool in text or in supplemental material (n=23). Currently, there is little alignment on how to assess food choice behaviors in South Asia, highlighting the need for a contextually adaptable repository of tools. Adapting and validating existing tools, rather than creating new ones, could improve efficiency, continuity, and comparability.

    "abstract": "DNA methylation represents a crucial epigenetic mechanism orchestrating gene expression, cellular homeostasis, and the aging trajectory. Dysregulation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)-the enzymes catalyzing this process-has been implicated in a wide spectrum of chronic conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that food-derived bioactive compounds can act as DNMT inhibitors, reshaping epigenetic landscapes. This systematic review, registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022320316), critically evaluated in vitro, in vivo animal, and ex vivo studies investigating the effects of dietary bioactives on DNMT expression and activity. A thorough search of PubMed up to May 23, 2025, yielded 103 studies, of which 76 met the inclusion criteria. Eligible publications were original, peer-reviewed, and provided evidence from in vitro, in vivo animal, or ex vivo models. Frequent candidates included epigallocatechin-3-gallate, curcumin, genistein, resveratrol, sulforaphane, and folate. Notably, nearly 90% of studies reported DNMT inhibition-often dose- and time-dependent. Approximately 21% defined minimal effective concentrations, predominantly for isolated compounds. Several studies described synergistic interactions between bioactives, and emerging data highlighted the gut microbiota's mediating role in epigenetic modulation. Despite promising outcomes, the predominance of preclinical evidence and variability in experimental protocols and dosing limit immediate translational impact. Nonetheless, current findings underscore the promise of dietary DNMT modulators as foundational elements for precision nutrition strategies aimed at promoting healthy aging and mitigating age-associated disease risk. The potential application of DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) as a biomarker of biological aging has been increasingly supported by recent literature, reinforcing its relevance in future nutritional epigenetics research. Further well-designed clinical trials are warranted to assess long-term efficacy, safety, and bioavailability of these compounds, and to validate their use in personalized epigenetic interventions, using biological aging markers. This review was funded by the European Union-Next Generation EU, PNRR Project Age-It (DM 1557 11.10.2022), and the University of Padua SID Grant (2024DCTV1SIDPROGETTI-00194).",

    "abstract": "Several novel incretin-based obesity management medications (OMMs) have been recently approved for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight. These agents have demonstrated substantial weight reduction effects, alongside glucoregulatory and cardioprotective benefits. However, the use of incretin-based OMMs presents nutritional challenges that remain insufficiently addressed. These include side effects such as gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances and loss of lean body mass (LBM), which may compromise nutritional status, reduce energy expenditure, and heighten the risk of rebound weight gain, sarcopenia, and frailty. Moreover, while these medications effectively suppress energy intake and reduce food quantity, they may also have unintended effects on diet quality, potentially influencing macronutrient distribution, ultra processed food consumption, risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and disordered eating behaviors, which could undermine long-term weight maintenance and the cardiometabolic benefits achieved through these pharmacotherapy agents. Emerging evidence suggests that specific dietary and behavioral strategies, such as higher protein intake, resistance training, nutrient-dense eating patterns, and fostering adaptive eating behaviors, may help mitigate nutritional challenges and physiological deterioration during significant weight reduction, while also supporting cardiometabolic health maintenance. However, the application of these strategies as adjunct treatments alongside the new OMMs remains unclear. This narrative review summarizes the current literature on these issues and proposes dietary interventions and behavioral modification strategies aimed at mitigating the adverse effects that can be associated with incretin-based OMMs. These considerations are increasingly important given the expanding use of these medications, the degree of weight reduction they induce, and the implications for specific at-risk groups, including aging populations prone to muscle and functional decline, individuals with pre-existing conditions of nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, and disordered eating patterns.",

Method of expression, hygiene practices and settings during expression, and processing can affect MOM composition. to review current evidence on the influence of feeding expressed MOM using varying expression methods, varying hygiene practices or settings during expressions, or varying treatments on health and growth of recipient infants. we systematically searched CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Embase, Emcare, EU trials, Global Health, Global Index Medicus, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, WHO, for primary research studies, including observational studies, published up to March 2024 evaluating different methods of MOM expression, hygiene practices or settings during expression, processing of MOM, and reporting clinical outcomes on recipient infants. Key outcomes of interest were growth, mortality, morbidity, feeding tolerance, adverse events, CMV infection, retroviral infection, other infections, nutrient deficiencies, neurodevelopment, breastfeeding. Qualitative thematic synthesis was conducted. An evidence gap map was produced using a GRADE evaluation. Of 29,320 studies screened, 45 met inclusion criteria. No expression method or pump type showed clear benefits for breastfeeding rates or infant growth. Three studies reported improved weight gain in infants receiving hindmilk. Evidence on the effect of processing methods on morbidity and mortality was inconclusive. Limited evidence was found on freeze-thawing's efficacy in reducing CMV transmission, while pasteurization proved more effective. No studies assessed clinical outcomes related to hygiene practices or expression settings. The use of hindmilk improves infant weight gain with some certainty of evidence. Hand expression of MOM has similar efficacy on the growth of recipient infants to that of electric pumping, also for mothers of preterm infants. Evidence on clinical outcomes of different MOM expression practices and treatments is very limited. This work underscores the need for future studies to address the substantial evidence gaps identified. REGISTRY AND REGISTRY NUMBER FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OR META-ANALYSES: The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024523299). Previous reviews have focused on the effects handling practices for expressed mother's own milk, such as expression methods, hygiene practices/settings during expressions, and storage and processing treatments on the composition of MOM; however, changes in composition do not necessarily correspond to changes in clinical outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the only systematic review to evaluate the effects of these practices on a large number of clinically relevant outcomes (growth, main morbidities, feeding tolerance, adverse events, viral and retroviral infections, other infections, nutrient deficiencies, neurodevelopment, and breastfeeding) of recipient infants. In this context, the present work is important to identify gaps in knowledge, including methodological limitations of existing evidence, and guide future research.",

    "abstract": "Non-sugar sweeteners (NSSs) are added to foods and beverages to provide sweetness in place of sugar while reducing the total caloric content. Reducing sugar intake, and corresponding calories, may decrease the risk of diabetes and other health conditions associated with obesity (e.g., cancer). Numerous observational epidemiology studies have evaluated the effect of NSSs on cancer risk, sometimes focusing on a specific NSS or a specific cancer, other times focusing on all NSSs and all cancers. We conducted a systematic review of epidemiology studies of NSS intake (of all types in aggregate and individually) and the risks of all types of cancer published through Fall 2024 (pre-registered with Open Science Framework [https://osf.io/gc8v6]). We considered how major study quality concerns might have impacted the interpretation of individual study results, as well as the evidence as a whole. We identified 90 studies of acesulfame potassium (ace-K), aspartame, cyclamate, saccharin, sucralose, or non-specific NSSs in aggregate (e.g., diet sodas, artificially sweetened beverages [ASBs]), and 17 specific types of cancer. We found no consistent associations between any NSS or NSSs in aggregate and any cancer overall, and no evidence for dose-response. NSS intake information was always self-reported, rendering exposure misclassification an ongoing challenge in all studies, and recall bias remains a significant possibility in all case-control studies. Many studies also did not fully account for potential confounders. Experimental animal and mechanistic evidence for NSSs does not support human-relevant carcinogenicity or any biologically plausible mechanisms by which NSSs could cause genotoxicity or cancer in humans. Overall, the epidemiology evidence does not support associations between any NSS and any cancer type.",

    "abstract": "The marked individual variability in response to common dietary exposures necessitates tailoring of dietary guidance to individuals, or small groups of individuals with similar needs, to optimize health. This is a complex task requiring integration of environmental, cultural, psychological and biological contributions. Work in the area of precision nutrition is an effort to translate science into practice. A research roadmap developed through an National Institutes of Health (NIH) conference identified many of the inputs that require quantification. Better characterization of ingestive behaviors is one key area. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize current understanding of the influences of age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), ethnicity and genetics on ingestive behaviors, including culture, sensory function, appetite, dietary intake, the gut-brain axis and microbiome. To do so, the extant literature was accessed through search engines relevant to the various topics covered. Outcomes assessed varied topically. In addition to compiling evidence on the nature and magnitude of these relationships, this review highlights the degree of individual variability in attributes or responses to an intervention. More broadly, it: a) documents that cause and effect relationships are difficult to establish as most are dynamic and interactive; b) there are inherent and learned contributions to both behavior and biology that will require different considerations and offer different opportunities for manipulation; c) a focus on intuitive approaches may not be as successful as desired; d) that external influences can, and often do, override internal influences of biology; and e) there are multiple ways to construct healthful diets. At the same time, it is vital that improved methods to characterize the multiple relevant inputs to ingestive behavior be developed. It is hoped the evidence compiled here will inform efforts to develop precision nutrition guidance.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional exposures during pregnancy and the first two years of a child's life influence growth and risk for obesity. Upstream interventions that involve policy, systems, and/or environmental approaches may support equitable nutrition and healthy growth early in life. Yet little is known about application of these interventions in clinical settings. This scoping review characterized the breadth, generalizability, and methodological rigor of nutrition-focused, upstream interventions for obesity prevention during the first 1,000 days in clinical settings. Eight databases were searched in November 2022 for policy, systems, and/or environmental approaches conducted during the first 1,000 days. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were independently screened in duplicate, with conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. Extracted elements included study characteristics, reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance, and the Downs and Black study quality checklist. Of the 73,969 records identified, 185 reports representing 126 studies were included. Studies frequently involved combinations of system (98%), environmental (56%), and/or individual (87%) approaches in prenatal care (35%), hospital (22%), or primary care (21%) settings. Over half (62%) were conducted with socially disadvantaged families. More studies reported positive effects on feeding practices (71%), child diet (70%), breastfeeding (67%), and maternal diet (62%), compared to child (31%) or maternal (48%) weight and growth outcomes. Variation in outcome reporting and measurement limited the ability to make conclusions regarding effectiveness. Maintenance of upstream approaches was seldom reported. Study quality ranged from poor to good. Results suggest the promise of scaling adoption of policy, systems, and/or environmental approaches that enhance standard clinical care by incorporating nutrition-focused elements to support healthy feeding behaviors and growth. To achieve equitable nutrition and healthy growth early during the first 1,000 days, implementation and evaluation of upstream policy efforts that integrate social and health care within and in collaboration with agencies beyond clinical settings may be warranted.

    "abstract": "Some of the most relevant yet controversial issues in nutrition are those surrounding the guidelines on quality and quantity of dietary fat in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and coronary heart diseases. Conflicting evidence questions the credibility of the previous dietary guidelines, particularly the quality of the evidence on which these recommendations were based. It is therefore important to explore the changes that have occurred in these guidelines and their influence on the adoption of different dietary patterns over time. In this review, we summarize the evolution of the fat component of the dietary guidelines, discuss controversial aspects, and highlight the areas in which additional evidence is still needed. Over the years, the scientific community has shown an obsession for calories in a diet instead of focusing on the quality of the food that makes up the diet. This is why certain authors have identified the importance of evaluating a diet focusing on diet patterns, rather than single isolated nutrients. This approach has been proposed in the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans.",

    "abstract": "Sugars have replaced fat as the dominant public health nutrition concern. A fructose-centric view of cardiometabolic disease has emerged whereby fructose-containing sugars are thought to have deleterious effects on body weight, fasting and postprandial blood lipids, glycemia, blood pressure, uric acid, and markers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Long-term prospective cohort studies have not supported these associations when assessing the relation between total fructose-containing sugars at any amount of intake and incident cardiometabolic disease. Conversely, a consistent signal for harm has been reported for sugary beverages when comparing the highest with the lowest intakes. These associations, however, do not hold at moderate intakes, which are more reflective of real-world intakes, are subject to important collinearity effects, and have small risk estimates with modest population-attributable risk fractions. Higher-level evidence from controlled feeding trials shows that fructose-containing sugars in either liquid or solid form have adverse cardiometabolic effects only when they supplement diets with excess calories compared with the same diets without the excess calories. In the absence of harm when fructose-containing sugars are exchanged for other sources of carbohydrate under energy-matched conditions, excess calories appear to be the dominant consideration. Like with the earlier fat story, it is difficult to separate the contribution of fructose-containing sugars from that of other sources of excess calories in the epidemic of obesity and cardiometabolic disease. Attention needs to remain focused on reducing the overconsumption of all caloric foods associated with obesity and cardiometabolic disease, including sugary beverages and foods, and promoting greater physical activity.",

    "abstract": "The inclusion of nutrition economics in dietary guidance would help ensure that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans benefit equally all segments of the US population. The present review outlines some novel metrics of food affordability that assess nutrient density of foods and beverages in relation to cost. Socioeconomic disparities in diet quality in the United States are readily apparent. In general, groups of lower socioeconomic status consume cheaper, lower-quality diets and suffer from higher rates of noncommunicable diseases. Nutrient profiling models, initially developed to assess the nutrient density of foods, can be turned into econometric models that assess both calories and nutrients per reference amount and per unit cost. These novel metrics have been used to identify individual foods that were affordable, palatable, culturally acceptable, and nutrient rich. Not all nutrient-rich foods were expensive. In dietary surveys, both local and national, some high-quality diets were associated with relatively low cost. Those population subgroups that successfully adopted dietary guidelines at an unexpectedly low monetary cost were identified as \"positive deviants.\" Constructing a healthy diet based on dietary guidelines can be done, provided that nutrient density of foods, their affordability, as well as taste and social norms are all taken into account.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable interest in dietary and other approaches to maintaining blood glucose concentrations within the normal range and minimizing exposure to postprandial hyperglycemic excursions. The accepted marker to evaluate the sustained maintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations is glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). However, although this is used in clinical practice to monitor glycemic control in patients with diabetes, it has a number of drawbacks as a marker of efficacy of dietary interventions that might beneficially affect glycemic control in people without diabetes. Other markers that reflect shorter-term glycemic exposures have been studied and proposed, but consensus on the use and relevance of these markers is lacking. We have carried out a systematic search for studies that have tested the responsiveness of 6 possible alternatives to HbA1c as markers of sustained variation in glycemic exposures and thus their potential applicability for use in dietary intervention trials in subjects without diabetes: 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), dicarbonyl stress, fructosamine, glycated albumin (GA), advanced glycated end products (AGEs), and metabolomic profiles. The results suggest that GA may be the most promising for this purpose, but values may be confounded by effects of fat mass. 1,5-AG and fructosamine are probably not sensitive enough to the range of variation in glycemic exposures observed in healthy individuals. Use of measures based on dicarbonyls, AGEs, or metabolomic profiles would require further research into possible specific molecular species of interest. At present, none of the markers considered here is sufficiently validated and sensitive for routine use in substantiating the effects of sustained variation in dietary glycemic exposures in people without diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Dysglycemia is a common complication of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children. Its prevalence and impact on short- and long-term outcomes are not well described. This systematic review was undertaken to review the available evidence on dysglycemia (either hypo- or hyperglycemia) in hospitalized children with SAM. The 2 primary objectives of this systematic review were to understand the prevalence of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in children with SAM. A secondary objective was to understand the relation between dysglycemia and clinical outcomes like mortality in children with SAM. MEDLINE was searched with terms related to children, SAM, and dysglycemia. A meta-analysis of proportions was completed to determine the hypoglycemia prevalence and a standard meta-analysis was done to determine the relation between hypoglycemia and mortality. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. A total of 2148 articles were identified in the database search of which 16 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review based on screening done by multiple reviewers. The overall prevalence of hypoglycemia in SAM across studies based on the meta-analysis of proportions was 9% (95% CI: 7%, 12%; I2 = 92%). Meta-analysis results showed that hypoglycemia was associated with a higher chance of mortality during hospitalization in children with SAM (OR: 4.29; 95% CI: 3.04, 6.05; I2 = 0%). According to the GRADE evaluation, the certainty of the evidence for the prevalence of hypoglycemia was low and for hyperglycemia was very low. For the relation between hypoglycemia and mortality, the certainty of the evidence was moderate. A meta-analysis was not carried out for the prevalence of hyperglycemia due to the wide range of definitions used for across studies, but the prevalence ranged from 2% to 38% in the literature. This systematic review highlights the need for further work in this area to include serial glucose measurements to understand the clinical importance of dysglycemia during hospitalization in children with SAM.",

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that higher than usual intakes of trans fatty acids (TFAs) have adverse effects on blood lipids. Because of this, in 2006 the US FDA mandated labeling of TFAs on food packages. The food and restaurant industries, including the potato industry, reformulated their foods to reduce or eliminate partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and TFAs. Before mandatory labeling, grain-based desserts, yeast breads, and French-fried potatoes (FFPs) were the top sources of TFAs in the food supply; by 2007, potato food manufacturers and quick-service restaurants had reduced or eliminated TFAs without increasing saturated fatty acids (SFAs). FFPs are no longer a source of TFAs in the food supply. This study examined energy and fatty acid intake among children aged 6–11 y, adolescents aged 12–18 y, and adults aged ≥19 y across 3 time periods by using data from the NHANES 2005–2006, 2007–2008, and 2009–2010. On average, intakes of total energy, total fat, SFAs, and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) decreased significantly between 2005–2006 and 2009–2010 among children and adolescents; however, the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) did not change. Among adults, intakes of total fat, SFAs, and MUFAs decreased; however, total energy and PUFA intake did not change. On the day of the 2009–2010 survey, ∼13% of children and 10% of adolescents reported consuming fried FFPs, whereas <7% of adults reported consumption of fried FFPs. Intakes of SFAs and TFAs from fried FFPs decreased significantly between 2005–2006 and 2009–2010 among children, adolescents, and adults. This study confirms that intake of TFAs from FFPs is trivial.",

    "abstract": "Vegetables are the major source of the dietary fiber, magnesium, potassium, and vitamins A and C that are crucial in the diets of children. This study assessed the nutrient content of vegetables offered through the National School Lunch Program and examined the relation between the overall nutrient density of vegetable subgroups and the costs of nutrients offered and wasted before and after the changes in school meal standards. Using data collected from 3 elementary schools before and after the changes in school meal standards, we found that vegetable plate waste increased from 52% to 58%. Plate waste for starchy vegetables, exclusive of potatoes, was relatively high compared with other subgroups; however, plate waste for white potatoes was the lowest among any type of vegetable. Energy density; cost per 100 g, per serving, and per 100 kcal; and percentage daily value were calculated and used to estimate nutrient density value and nutrient density per dollar. Cost per 100 kcal was highest for red/orange vegetables followed by dark green vegetables; however, nutrient density for red/orange vegetables was the highest in the group and provided the most nutrients per dollar compared with other subgroups. Given that many vegetables are less energy dense, measuring vegetable costs per 100 g and per serving by accounting for nutrient density perhaps is a better way of calculating the cost of vegetables in school meals.",

    "abstract": "White potatoes are a forgotten source of nutrients. The goal of this study was to identify the nutritional implications of replacing a composite of white potatoes with a composite of vegetables commonly consumed by children aged 2–18 y (n = 3460) in a nationally representative sample. The NHANES 2005–2012 24-h dietary recall data were used to determine nutrient intake. Two replacement models were developed: one for potato consumers and another for those consuming vegetables other than potatoes. Analyses focused on 1) mean nutrient contributions per 1 cup equivalent vegetable composite (VC)/potato composite (PC) consumed by participants, and 2) mean daily nutrient intake when the nutrients per 1 cup equivalent PC replaced the nutrients per 1 cup equivalent VC. Covariate adjusted analysis was tested for statistical significance (P < 0.002). When 1 cup equivalent VC replaced 1 cup equivalent PC, significantly lower mean intakes were found for 20 of the 23 nutrients studied and higher mean intakes of total sugars, folate, and calcium. Differences were found including higher total intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids and potassium and lower total intakes of vitamins A and K. The percentage contribution of the PC to total daily nutrient intake was 6% for total energy, 8% for total fat, 5% for saturated fatty acids, 13% for dietary fiber, 4% for sodium, and 11% for potassium. Both composites contributed a variety of nutrients to the total diet; the consumption of white potatoes may be an important strategy to help meet the potassium recommendation.",

In contrast to prior research demonstrating that images of Barbie objectified girls, lowered self esteem, and promoted body dysmorphia, with social media focus on \"Fistpiration' as well as \"Thinspiration\" amplifying the negative effect, the Barbie movie may have more positive impact than one might predict. As gleaned from an informal survey of patients, parents and peers, the messages of the Barbie movie include a mix of body positivity, recognition of the impact of depression and other aspects of mental health, critique of the perceived societal patriarchy, and a message of empowerment for girls, women, and people otherwise unrecognized. Barbie has been criticized in social media and in formal research for her impossible figure, promoting body dysphoria despite her myriad career choices. Yet the Barbie movie may move beyond the expected stereotypical response to allow for dark emotions to be expressed and hope to be within reach, and for the empowerment of girls, women and others previously unrecognized.",

    "abstract": "Government, health care systems and payers, philanthropic entities, advocacy groups, non-profit organizations, community groups, and for-profit companies are presently making the case for Food is Medicine (FIM) nutrition programs to become reimbursable within health care services. FIM researchers are working urgently to build evidence for FIM programs' cost effectiveness by showing improvements in health outcomes and health care utilization. However, primary collection of this data is costly, difficult to implement, and burdensome to participants. Electronic health records (EHRs) offer a promising alternative to primary data collection because they provide already-collected information from existing clinical care. A few FIM studies have leveraged EHRs to demonstrate positive impacts on biomarkers or health care utilization, but many FIM studies run into insurmountable difficulties in their attempts to use EHRs. The authors of this commentary all serve as evaluators and/or technical assistance providers with the USDA's GusNIP National Training, Technical Assistance, Evaluation, and Information Center. We work closely with over 100 GusNIP Produce Prescription FIM projects, which, as of 2023, span 34 US states and territories. In this commentary, we describe recurring challenges related to using EHRs in FIM evaluation, particularly in relation to biomarkers and health care utilization. We also outline potential opportunities and reasonable expectations for what can be learned from EHR data and describe other (non-EHR) data sources to consider for evaluation of long-term health outcomes and health care utilization. Large integrated health systems may be best positioned to use their own data to examine outcomes of interest to the broader field. This Perspective article describes recurring challenges related to using EHRs in FIM evaluation, particularly in relation to biomarkers and health care utilization.

    "abstract": "Understanding energy expenditure in children with chronic disease is critical due to the impact on energy homeostasis and growth. This systematic review aimed to describe available literature of resting (REE) and total energy expenditure (TEE) in children with chronic disease measured by gold standard methods of indirect calorimetry (IC) and doubly-labelled water (DLW), respectively. A literature search was conducted using OVID Medline, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane and Scopus until July 2023. Studies were included if the mean age of participants was ≤ 18 years, participants had a chronic disease and measurement of REE or TEE was conducted using IC or DLW, respectively. Studies investigating energy expenditure in premature babies, acute illness and intensive care patients were excluded. The primary outcomes are the type of data (REE, TEE) obtained and REE/TEE stratified by disease group. 271 studies across 24 chronic conditions were identified. Over 60% of retrieved studies were published > 10 years ago and conducted in relatively small population sizes (n range=1-398). Most studies obtained REE samples (82%) rather than that of TEE (8%), with very few exploring both samples (10%). There was variability in the difference in energy expenditure in children with chronic disease compared to healthy controls across and within disease groups. Eighteen predictive energy equations were generated across included studies. Quality assessment of the studies identified poor reporting of energy expenditure protocols which may limit the validity of results. Current literature on energy expenditure in children with chronic disease whilst extensive, reveals key future research opportunities. International collaboration and robust measurement of energy expenditure should be conducted to generate meaningful predictive energy equations to provide updated evidence that is reflective of the emerging disease modifying therapies.

    "abstract": "As the science surrounding population sodium reduction evolves, monitoring and evaluating new studies on intake and health can help increase our understanding of the associated benefits and risks. Here we describe a systematic review of recent studies on sodium intake and health, examine the risk of bias (ROB) of selected studies, and provide direction for future research. Seven online databases were searched monthly from January 2015 to December 2019. We selected human studies that met specified population, intervention, comparison, outcome, time, setting/study design (PICOTS) criteria and abstracted attributes related to the study population, design, intervention, exposure, and outcomes, and evaluated ROB for the subset of studies on sodium intake and cardiovascular disease risks or indicators. Of 41,601 abstracts reviewed, 231 studies were identified that met the PICOTS criteria and ROB was assessed for 54 studies. One hundred and fifty-seven (68%) studies were observational and 161 (70%) focused on the general population. Five types of sodium interventions and a variety of urinary and dietary measurement methods were used to establish and quantify sodium intake. Five observational studies used multiple 24-h urine collections to assess sodium intake. Evidence mainly focused on cardiovascular-related indicators (48%) but encompassed an assortment of outcomes. Studies varied in ROB domains and 87% of studies evaluated were missing information on ≥1 domains. Two or more studies on each of 12 outcomes (e.g., cognition) not previously included in systematic reviews and 9 new studies at low ROB suggest the need for ongoing or updated systematic reviews of evidence on sodium intake and health. Summarizing evidence from assessments on sodium and health outcomes was limited by the various methods used to measure sodium intake and outcomes, as well as lack of details related to study design and conduct. In line with research recommendations identified by the National Academies of Science, future research is needed to identify and standardize methods for measuring sodium intake.",

    "abstract": "Child undernutrition is a major public health challenge that is persistent and disproportionately prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. Undernourished children face adverse health, economic, and social consequences that can be intergenerational. The first 1000 days of life, from conception until the child's second birthday, constitute the period of greatest vulnerability to undernutrition. The transition process from milk-based diets to solid, semi-solid, and soft food and liquids other than milk, referred to as complementary feeding (CF), occurs between the age of 6 mo and 2 y. CF practices that do not meet the WHO's guiding principles and are lacking in both quality and quantity increase susceptibility to undernutrition, restrict growth, and jeopardize child development and survival. The gut microbiota develops toward an adult-like configuration within the first 2-3 y of life. Recent studies suggest that significant changes in the gut microbial composition and functional capacity occur during the CF period, but these studies were conducted in high-income countries. Research in low- and middle-income countries, on the other hand, has implicated a disrupted gut microbiota in child undernutrition, and animal experiments reveal the potential for a causal relation. Given the growing body of evidence for a plausible role of the gut microbiota in the link between CF and undernutrition, microbiota-targeted complementary food may be a promising treatment modality for undernutrition management. The aims of this paper are to review the evidence for the relation between CF and undernutrition and to highlight the potential of the gut microbiota to be a promising target in this relation. Our summary of the current state of the knowledge in this area provides a foundation for future research and helps inform the design of interventions targeting the gut microbiota to combat child undernutrition and promote healthy growth.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a global health issue among the aging population. The effect of the acid or base interventions on bone health remains controversial. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate effects of acidic diets and alkaline supplements on bone health simultaneously. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in 5 available databases and 1 registered clinical trial system to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed effects of the acid-base intervention on bone health. Depending on heterogeneity across studies, the pooled effects were calculated by fixed-effects or random-effects models. The present study included 13 acidic diet intervention studies and 13 alkaline supplement studies for final quantitative assessments. The meta-analysis showed that acidic diets significantly increased net acid excretion [NAE; standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.99; P = 0.003] and urinary calcium excretion (SMD = 0.47, P < 0.00001) but had no significant effect on bone turnover markers and bone mineral density (BMD). On the other hand, alkaline supplement intervention significantly reduced NAE (SMD = -1.29, P < 0.00001), urinary calcium excretion (SMD = -0.44, P = 0.007), bone resorption marker aminoterminal cross-linking telopeptide (NTX; SMD = -0.29, P = 0.003), and bone formation marker osteocalcin (OC; SMD = -0.23, P = 0.02), but did not affect the other bone turnover markers. Furthermore, alkaline supplements significantly increased BMD in femoral neck [mean difference (MD) = 1.62, P < 0.00001, I2 = 0%], lumbar spine (MD = 1.66, P < 0.00001, I2 = 87%), and total hip (MD = 0.98, P = 0.02, I2 = 99%). Subsequently, meta-regression analyses identified 1 study that substantially contributed to the high heterogeneity of BMD in the latter 2 sites, but sensitivity analysis suggested that this study did not affect the significant pooled effects. Despite that, the results should be interpreted with caution and need to be further validated by a larger RCT. In summary, through integrating evidence from RCTs, the present meta-analysis initially suggests that alkaline supplements may be beneficial to bone metabolism and acidic diets may not be harmful to bone health. This work may be clinically useful for both clinicians and patients with osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "Food policies for the prevention and management of diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) have been increasingly relying on microsimulation models (MSMs) to assess effectiveness. Given the increased uptake of MSMs, this review aims to provide an overview of the characteristics of MSMs that link diets with NCDs. A comprehensive review was conducted in PubMed and Web of Knowledge. Inclusion criteria were: 1) findings from an MSM; 2) diets, foods, or nutrients as the main exposure of interest; and 3) NCDs, such as overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer, as the disease outcome for impact assessment. This review included information from 33 studies using MSM in analyzing diet and diverse food policies on NCDs. Hereby, most models employed stochastic, discrete-time, dynamic microsimulation techniques to calculate anticipated (cost-)effectiveness of strategies based on food pricing, food reformulation, or dietary (lifestyle) interventions. Currently available models differ in the methodology used for quantifying the effect of the dietary changes on disease, and in the method for modeling the disease incidence and mortality. However, all studies provided evidence that the models were sufficiently capturing the close-to-reality situation by justifying their choice of model parameters and validating externally their modeled disease incidence and mortality with observed or predicted event data. With the increasing use of various MSMs, between-model comparisons, facilitated by open access models and good reporting practices, would be important for judging a model's accuracy, leading to continued improvement in the methodologies for developing and applying MSMs and, subsequently, a better understanding of the results by policymakers.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition training and building capacity to provide a competent workforce to support national and regional efforts to combat malnutrition remain a major challenge in Africa and other developing regions of the world. The capacity to provide the necessary intellectual drive for nutrition research, policy, and practice in countries lacking in readiness for nutrition actions is imperative to improve the health of their people. To help address this need, the eNutrition Academy (eNA) was formed as a global partnership organization by the African Nutrition Society, the Federation of African Nutrition Societies, the Nutrition Society of the United Kingdom and Ireland, the ASN, and the International Union of Nutritional Sciences, supported by Cambridge University Press. The primary objective of this partnership is to provide an online learning platform that is free to access, enabling users to benefit from a wide range of learning materials from basic tools to more-advanced learning materials for teachers and researchers in developing countries. The goal of this article was to summarize the findings of a symposium held at the ASN Scientific Sessions and Annual Meeting at Experimental Biology 2015, which explored the themes of international capacity development, with a particular focus on the African continent, online learning, and the eNA e-learning platform. Given the vast human capacity present in Africa that is poised to create new solutions to address the public health needs of the continent, now is an opportune time to establish South-North and South-South partnerships to develop the next generation of African nutritional scientists.",

    "abstract": "PUFA status is highly implicated in cognitive development and metabolic disorder-related diseases. Genetic variants of FADS genes encoding enzymes that catalyze the rate-limiting steps of PUFA biosynthesis appear to be associated with n-3 and n-6 PUFA contents. Therefore, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the association of the A-allele carriers of the FADS1 rs174556 with PUFA status. The PRISMA guidelines were followed. The literature search was conducted up to November 2022 in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, Airiti Library, and CINAHL. The Joanna Briggs Institute checklists were used to assess the methodological quality. The correlation with 95% CIs was determined by a random-effect meta-analysis. Eleven studies that met the inclusion criteria and acceptable quality were included in this systematic review. The data on PUFA contents were collected when they were mainly analyzed using blood samples and breast milk. Results of the meta-analysis on eight studies (one randomized controlled trial, one cohort study, and six cross-sectional studies) showed that the A-allele carriers of rs174556 were significantly negatively correlated with the concentrations of AA (P = 0.001), EPA (P = 0.004), and DHA (P = 0.025). However, ALA and LA were not associated with the A-allele carriers. To clarify the discrepancy, we further divided the studies into blood samples and breast milk subgroups. The subgroup analysis revealed that the A-allele carriers of rs174556 were significantly positively correlated with LA (P = 0.031) and negatively correlated with AA (P = 0.001), EPA (P = 0.036), and DHA (P < 0.001) in the blood sample group, but not in the breast milk group. The current meta-analysis proved that the A-allele carriers of the FADS1 rs174556 appeared to be highly associated with lower concentrations of AA, EPA, and DHA but higher LA in the blood samples. The study has been registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO:CRD42022363978). Adv Nutr 2023;x:xx-xx.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to promote health through improved diet and nutrition demand an appreciation of the nutritional ecology that accounts for the intersection of agriculture, food systems, health, disease and a changing environment. The complexity and implications of this ecology is exemplified by current trends and efforts to address nutrition-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs), most prominently type 2 diabetes. The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to rise unabated. Of particular concern is how to address the unhealthy dietary patterns that are contributing to this pandemic in a changing environment. A multi- disciplinary approach is required that will engage those communities that comprise the continuum of effort from research to translation and implementation of evidence-informed interventions, programs and policies. Using the prevention of type 2 diabetes by increasing fruit and vegetable consumption as an exemplar, we argue that the ability to effect positive change in this and other persistent nutrition-related problems can be achieved by moving away from siloed approaches that limit the integration of key components of the diet-health continuum. Ultimately the impact of preventing type 2 diabetes via increased fruit and vegetable consumption will depend on how the entire diet changes, not just fruits and vegetables. In addition, the rapidly changing physical environment that will confront our food production system going forward will also shape the interventions that are possible. Nonetheless, the proposed \"team science\" approach that accounts for all the elements of the nutrition ecology will better position us to achieve public health goals through safe and sustainable food systems.",

    "abstract": "Studies administering plasma protein isolates (PPIs) to experimentally challenged animals have reported improvements in growth, food intake, and overall condition when compared with animals fed control diets, due in part to improvements in gut barrier function, normalization of cytokine signals, and support of enteric immune function. These and early clinical studies suggest that nutritional therapy with PPIs may similarly assist in restoring homeostasis to gut barrier function in humans experiencing mild or more acute enteropathic symptomatology such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. This meta-analysis evaluated the ability of PPIs to promote weight gain and food intake in weanling animals, primarily piglets, after oral challenge with various enteric pathogens or bacterial toxins. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched from 1980 through August 2012 for specified terms and keywords. Twenty-nine articles retrieved through this process were evaluated; 11 studies including 13 experiments were selected for inclusion in the analysis. The meta-analysis included descriptive analyses and methods for combining P values for the primary endpoint, average daily growth (ADG) at week 1, and secondary endpoints including ADG, average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain to feed ratio (G:F) at weeks 1 and 2 and at the end of study. Primary and secondary endpoint analyses of growth (ADG, ADFI, and G:F) were significant (P < 0.01). The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α were significantly lower in animals fed dietary PPIs. Additional research in patients experiencing symptoms of enteropathy will further characterize the benefits of PPIs in clinical populations.",

Yet, little is known about the dietary intakes or nutritional needs across the older adulthood age span. This review aims to identify community-based cohorts that collected information on dietary intake of adults ≥65 y in the United States. Thirty-two cohorts met all inclusion criteria. We summarized information on the cohorts' design, demographics, and diet assessment. We also identified key gaps in the existing databases that, if filled, could enhance their utility to address certain research questions.

This systematic literature review aimed to determine the prevalence and impact of computed tomography (CT)–defined sarcopenia on survival outcomes for adult OPC+ patients (>18 y) undergoing any treatment modality. Prospective studies were searched using PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Web of Science up until and including February 2022. Bias was assessed using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. In total, 9 studies (total pooled OPC+ patients, n = 744) were identified and included in this review; 2 at low, 6 at moderate, and 1 at high risk of bias. All studies varied in sarcopenia assessment methods and skeletal muscle index threshold cutoff values. These studies demonstrated the cumulative prevalence of sarcopenia for OPC+ patients to be 42.9% (95% CI: 37.8%, 47.9%). While overall survival (3 studies, n = 253) and progression-free survival (1 study, n = 117) was lower in sarcopenic OPC+ patients, this was not statistically significant. GRADE certainty of evidence for impact of pretreatment sarcopenia on overall survival was low and progression-free survival was very low. Although these studies showed there to be a high prevalence of pretreatment sarcopenia in patients with OPC+, which may decrease survival, the impact on progression-free survival is very uncertain. Further, high-quality research utilizing consistent sarcopenia definitions and assessment methods that are conducted specifically in OPC+ is required to strengthen evidence certainty and determine if sarcopenia is an independent prognostic factor for this population.",

    "abstract": "Results from observational studies suggest that children and adolescents consuming ready-to-eat cereals (RTECs) have a healthier BMI and lower odds of overweight and obesity than consumers of other breakfasts or breakfast skippers. However, randomized controlled trials in children and adolescents are few and have been inconsistent in demonstrating a causal relationship between RTEC intake and body weight or body composition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of RTEC intake on body weight and body composition outcomes in children and adolescents. Prospective cohort, cross-sectional and controlled trials in children or adolescents were included. Retrospective studies and studies in subjects with disease, other than obesity, type-2 diabetes (T2D), metabolic syndrome, or prediabetes, were excluded. A search in PubMed and CENTRAL databases yielded 25 relevant studies, which were qualitatively analyzed. Fourteen of the 20 observational studies demonstrated that children and adolescents consuming RTEC have a lower BMI, lower prevalence and odds of overweight/obesity and more favorable indicators of abdominal obesity than nonconsumers or less frequent consumers. Controlled trials were few and only one reported a loss of 0.9 kg in overweight/obese children with RTEC consumption when accompanied by nutrition education. The risk of bias was low for most studies, but six had some concerns or high risk. The results were similar with presweetened and nonpresweetened RTEC. No studies reported a positive association of RTEC intake with body weight or body composition. Although controlled trials do not show a direct effect of RTEC consumption on body weight or body composition, the preponderance of observational data supports the inclusion of RTEC as part of a healthy dietary pattern for children and adolescents. Evidence also suggests similar benefits on body weight and body composition regardless of the sugar content. Additional trials are needed to determine the causality between RTEC intake and body weight and body composition outcomes. PROSPERO REGISTRATION: CRD42022311805.",

The food matrix is defined by the USDA as \"the nutrient and nonnutrient components of foods and their molecular relations.\" The matrix of a food is an important factor in evaluating its nutritional and health contributions to the consumer. Dairy foods are a complex mix of various nutrients and other components, which together form the food matrix. There are three main types of dairy food matrices: liquid (milk, some fermented milks), semi-solid (yogurt, some fresh cheeses), and solid (most cheeses). The nutritional value of dairy foods is determined by their nutrient composition and matrix structure, which can affect digestibility and the bioavailability of nutrients. Additionally, a number of studies have shown that the health effects of dairy products, of similar nutrient content, vary by their matrix.",

    "abstract": "An ongoing challenge to our ability to address the role of food and nutrition in health promotion and disease prevention is how to design and implement context-specific interventions and guidance that are safe, efficacious, and avoid unintended consequences. The integration to effective implementation (I-to-I) concept is intended to address the complexities of the global health context through engagement of the continuum of stakeholders involved in the generation, translation, and implementation of evidence to public health guidance/programs. The I-to-I approach was developed under the auspices of the Micronutrient Forum and has been previously applied to the question of safety and effectiveness of interventions to prevent and treat nutritional iron deficiency. The present article applies the I-to-I approach to questions regarding the safety and utility of large-dose vitamin A supplementation programs, and presents the authors' perspective on key aspects of the topic, including coverage of the basic and applied biology of vitamin A nutrition and assessment, clinical implications, and an overview of the extant data with regard to both the justification for and utility of available intervention strategies. The article includes some practical considerations based on specific country experiences regarding the challenges of implementing vitamin A-related programs. This is followed by an overview of some challenges associated with engagement of the enabling communities that play a critical role in the implementation of these types of public health interventions. The article concludes with suggestions for potential approaches to move this important agenda forward.",

In the absence of sufficient clinical trials focused on sodium intake and health outcomes, studies that used the surrogate marker of blood pressure have been used to support extreme sodium reduction. Under tightly controlled conditions, maximum achievable sodium reduction leads to a 1–6 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure, which presumably leads to reduced cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. However, in observational cohort studies that used not blood pressure but actual health conditions as outcomes, the presumed relation between sodium intakes <2500 mg/d was not observed. Thus, the blood pressure effect of sodium restriction can no longer be accepted as a surrogate for health outcomes associated with sodium intake. Evidence that reducing sodium intakes to <2500 mg/d will improve health is needed to justify continuing efforts to modify diet.",

    "abstract": "Strategic translational research is designed to address research gaps that answer specific guidance questions. It provides translational value with respect to nutrition guidance and regulatory and public policy. The relevance and the quality of evidence both matter in translational research. For example, design decisions regarding population, intervention, comparator, and outcome criteria affect whether or not high-quality studies are considered relevant to specific guidance questions and are therefore included as evidence within the context of systematic review frameworks used by authoritative food and health organizations. The process used in systematic reviews, developed by the USDA for its Nutrition Evidence Library, is described. An eating pattern and cardiovascular disease (CVD) evidence review is provided as an example, and factors that differentiated the studies considered relevant and included in that evidence base from those that were excluded are noted. Case studies on ω-3 (n–3) fatty acids (FAs) and industrial trans-FAs illustrate key factors vital to relevance and translational impact, including choice of a relevant population (e.g., healthy, at risk, or diseased subjects; general population or high-performance soldiers); dose and form of the intervention (e.g., food or supplement); use of relevant comparators (e.g., technically feasible and realistic); and measures for both exposure and outcomes (e.g., inflammatory markers or CVD endpoints). Specific recommendations are provided to help increase the impact of nutrition research on future dietary guidance, policy, and regulatory issues, particularly in the area of lipids.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of dietary-based lifestyle modification interventions (\"diet,\" or \"diet + exercise,\" or \"diet + exercise + behavioral\" intervention) on the measures of anthropometric and dietary intake parameters in women with breas cancer (BC). Databases were searched until June 2021. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials that enrolled only women with BC. Studies that used exercise or behavioral interventions alone were not included. Mean ± SD changes were extracted for each outcome, and pooled using a random-effects model; 7315 studies were identified. Fifty-one studies (n = 7743) were included. The median ± SD duration of treatment was 24 ± 16.65 wk. Dietary-based interventions significantly reduced body weight [45 studies (n = 7239), weighted mean difference (WMD) (95% CI): -2.6 (-3.2, -2.1) kg], BMI [31 studies (n = 5384); WMD (95% CI): -1.0 (-1.3, -0.7) kg/m2], lean body mass [15 studies (n = 1194); WMD (95% CI): -0.6(-0.7, -0.4) kg], fat mass [11 studies (n = 913); WMD (95% CI): -2.6 (-3.3, -1.8) kg], fat percentage [17 studies (n = 897); WMD (95% CI): -1.5 (-1.9, -1.3)%], hip circumference [9 studies (n = 489); WMD (95% CI): -2.43 (-3.34, -1.54) cm], and waist circumference [7 studies (n = 309); WMD (95% CI): 0.02 (-0.03, -0.005) cm]. Significant reductions in energy intakes [20 studies (n = 4608), WMD (95% CI): -162 (-220, 104) kcal/d] and fat intakes [7 studies (n = 4316), WMD (95% CI): -7.5 (-7.8, -7.2)% of energy/d], and an increase in fiber intakes [11 studies (n = 4241), WMD (95% CI): 2.4 (0.7, 4.1) g/d] were observed. No significant changes were seen in protein, carbohydrate, and fruit and vegetable intakes. Subgroup analyses showed that changes in anthropometric and dietary intake indices were significant in studies that enrolled patients with both obesity and normal weight, studies that used diet therapy in combination with exercise and behavioral therapy, and studies that started the intervention during the treatment period. Overall, a multimodal dietary-based lifestyle intervention had significant effects on anthropometric and dietary intake parameters in women with BC, specifically when started as early as the diagnosis. This meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42021291488.",

The analysis found that Mialon et al. enumerated COIs for each DGAC member with industry, removed from the original context, which prevented readers from assessing the COI risk. Moreover, the USDA ethics office concluded that \"the 20 committee members were in full compliance with the federal ethics rules applicable to special government employees.\" I conclude that Mialon et al. could use institutional mechanisms to encourage the USDA and HHS to strengthen future COI policies and procedures, aligned with the 2022 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report recommendations to improve the DGA 2025 to 2030 process.",

    "abstract": "Results from observational studies indicate that consumption of ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) is associated with higher diet quality and lower incidence of overweight and obesity in adults compared with other breakfasts or skipping breakfast. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have had inconsistent results regarding effects of RTEC consumption on body weight and composition. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of RTEC intake on body weight outcomes in observational studies and RCTs in adults. A search of PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases yielded 28 relevant studies, including 14 observational studies and 14 RCTs. Results from observational studies demonstrate that frequent RTEC consumers (usually ≥4 servings/wk) have lower BMI, lower prevalence of overweight/obesity, less weight gain over time, and less anthropometric evidence of abdominal adiposity compared with nonconsumers, or less frequent consumers. RCT results suggest that RTEC may be used as a meal or snack replacement as part of a hypocaloric diet, but this approach is not superior to other options for those attempting to achieve an energy deficit. In addition, RTEC consumption was not associated with significantly less loss of body weight, or with weight gain, in any of the RCTs. RTEC intake is associated with favorable body weight outcomes in adults in observational studies. RTEC does not hinder weight loss when used as a meal or snack replacement within a hypocaloric diet. Additional long-term RCTs (≥6 mo) in both hypocaloric and ad libitum conditions are recommended to evaluate further the potential effects of RTEC consumption on body weight outcomes.

    "abstract": "The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) provides healthy food to millions of children annually. To promote increased lunch consumption, policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) change strategies are being implemented in child nutrition programs. An evaluation of the current evidence supporting PSE interventions in school nutrition programs is needed to facilitate evidence-based practices across the nation for programs. This systematic review aims to determine the quality and breadth of available evidence of the effectiveness of PSE strategies on the consumption and waste of fruits, vegetables, milk, and water in the NSLP. The inclusion criteria required studies to occur in a United States K-12 school setting, data collection after 2012, report consumption and waste findings for fruit, vegetable, milk, or water, and be an original research article. Articles included in the review are restricted to positive or neutral quality. Thirty studies are included, policy level (n = 4), systems level (n = 8), environmental level (n = 10), and multi-category (n = 8). Results from positively rated policy-level studies suggest that recess before lunch may increase milk consumption, whereas removing flavored milk may decrease consumption. System-level studies of offering vegetables first in isolation of other meal components and offering spiced vegetables compared with traditional preparations may increase vegetable consumption, and locally procuring produce may increase fruit and vegetable consumption. Environmental-level studies such as water promotion strategies such as placing cups near drinking fountains may increase water consumption. Improving the convenience, attractiveness, and palatability of fruits and vegetables may increase consumption. Future PSE research in child nutrition programs should incorporate implementation aides and metrics into their study designs to allow a better understanding of how to sustain interventions from the perspective of school nutrition professionals.",

    "abstract": "Computer-tailored health communication (CTC) can enhance fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake and, consequently, health by providing personalized feedback. However, few studies have examined the long-term effects of such interventions in middle-aged and older adults. This research aimed to assess the 12-mo efficacy of CTC in promoting F&V consumption and potentially identify who among middle-aged and older adults changed their diet after the intervention. The protocol was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on 2021-12-09, code CRD42022330491. The research was performed without external funding. We searched 6 databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CTC interventions for increasing F&V intake with usual care/no intervention control in adults aged ≥40, measured 12 mo after the pretest. The search covered the period from 1 January 1990 to 1 January 2022. We selected 16 RCTs with 25,496 baseline participants for the review systematic literature reviews (SLR) and 11 RCTs with 19 measurements for the meta-analysis (MA). We assessed risk of bias with the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. The SLR revealed that at 1-y postCTC intervention, most of the treatment groups increased F&V intake more than the control groups. The overall bias in the data set was not high. The MA model on 11 RCTs revealed a significant effect size for F&V consumption in intervention groups compared with control, standardized mean difference of 0.21 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.12, 0.30), P = 0.0004. The evidence suggests that CTC is a suitable strategy for public interventions aiming to increase F&V intake in adults aged ≥40. The design of CTC for public interventions should consider the process of change and stages of change addressing awareness, attitudes, self-efficacy, and social influence as promising concepts for influencing behavior change.",

    "abstract": "Child undernutrition has multifactorial causes, ranging from food insecurity to etiologies refractory to conventional nutritional approaches, such as infections, environmental enteric dysfunction, and other conditions that lead to systemic inflammation. Poor appetite may be an important symptom of these causes and may be a useful marker of an undernourished child's ability to recover. We conducted a systematic review to characterize the methods and tools to measure appetite among children <5 y old in low- and middle-income countries. A systematic search of 8 databases identified 23 eligible studies published since 1995. Thirteen described methods based on direct feeding observation or quantification of nutrient intake from caregiver report, 16 described tools that assessed caregiver perceptions of appetite, and 6 reported assessments in both categories. Four studies that gauged caregiver perceptions assessed multiple appetite domains, whereas 12 assessed 1 domain-often with a single question. Only 6 studies reported validation processes, the most common of which compared an observed test meal with daily energy intake. No studies reported the use of a method or tool that was validated in multiple cultural or linguistic contexts. Although dietary intake measures and observed feeding tests have shown validity in some contexts, they are resource intensive. Subjective caregiver questionnaires may offer a more efficient appetite evaluation method, but they have been evaluated less consistently. A rigorously developed and validated tool to rapidly assess child appetite is needed and could be best addressed by a questionnaire that leverages the multiple domains of appetite. The application of interventions that target causes of undernutrition that are not amenable to food-based interventions in clinical or research contexts could be facilitated by an efficient appetite screening tool to identify appetite-related causes of undernutrition and to monitor children's response to such interventions.",

    "abstract": "The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) recommended steps to redesign the process of developing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) are based on 5 guiding principles (enhance transparency; promote diversity of expertise and experience; support a deliberative process; manage biases and conflicts of interest; and adopt state-of-the-art processes and methods). Using these principles and recommendations, the USDA and HHS updated the process for developing the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines, including the process for appointing members and managing the work of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. Modifications included having public comment on the topics and questions to be addressed by the Federal Advisory Committee, reviewing professional and financial activities on potential appointees to the committee prior to their appointment, redesigning the website to provide status updates on the work of the committee as analytical frameworks and draft conclusions were developed, strengthening the approaches for conducting systematic reviews, and adding a public meeting for discussion of the final report before its submission to the Secretaries of the USDA and HHS. Because the DGA is reviewed and updated every 5 y, it is possible to learn from each cycle what works well and where improvements in the process can be implemented. The current article illustrates, from the perspective of the advisory committee, the impact of the NASEM report on the development of the scientific report by examining changes in the process consistent with the 5 principles.",

    "abstract": "Several models have been developed to predict the effects of folic acid fortification programs on prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs), but each relies on different assumptions and data inputs. We identified and reviewed 7 models that predict the effects of folic acid intake or status on NTD risk. We applied 4 of these models [the original and a modified version of the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) and models developed by Arth et al. and Wald et al.] to predict the effect of folic acid fortification of wheat flour on reduction of NTDs using national survey data from Cameroon. The estimated percentage of NTDs averted due to fortified wheat flour (5.0 μg folic acid/g flour) varied by predictive model, with a 21–31% reduction in LiST to 83% in Arth's model, and 15% in Wald's model. As the simulated fortification level was increased from 1.0 to 7.0 μg folic acid/g flour, the pattern of change in estimated numbers of NTDs averted differed due to different model assumptions: the number of NTDs averted increased and then reached a plateau in the modified LiST model (as would be expected in real-world conditions), increased sharply in Arth's model, and increased continuously in Wald's model. This wide variation in predicted effects, and implausible results in some cases, undermines the models' utility for users of model outputs. Concurrent collection of dietary and biomarker data, including plasma and RBC folate concentrations, and NTD outcomes, is necessary to validate these models and monitor change in folic acid intake, folate-related biomarkers, and reduced NTD risk due to fortification. In the meantime, models based on erythrocyte folate concentration are recommended, based on biological plausibility and consistency with empirical evidence. Where erythrocyte folate data are unavailable, sensitivity analyses (using several models) could be conducted to examine the range of possible outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Dear Colleagues:\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to present this inaugural issue of Advances in Nutrition. Everyone is invited to take advantage of its high-profile, state-of-the-science reviews in the nutritional sciences. To enlist readers and successfully launch Advances in Nutrition, the Executive Board of The American Society for Nutrition (ASN) has decided to offer the publication without the need for subscription until 2012. Given the growing popularity of online journals and the need to keep costs low, the journal will be an electronic publication only.\r\n\r\nWhy did the ASN decide to publish this new reviews journal? The answer is simple: it will benefit our members and the broader community interested in nutrition. Our 2 flagship journals, The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (AJCN) and The Journal of Nutrition (JN), publish <30% of the manuscripts submitted to them. Although they publish some review articles, the primary focus of both AJCN and JN is on the publication of original research reports. The launch of Advances in Nutrition will allow ASN to greatly expand the availability of high-quality review articles on all aspects of nutrition research. Moreover, ASN members and associated professionals have told us that it is increasingly difficult to keep abreast of important developments outside their specialties. Advances in Nutrition will help them do so. There is growing interest in the nutritional sciences well beyond the ASN community. This includes not only health care professionals, but also the general public. Like our membership, they need a source that succinctly explains the importance and application of original research findings in the nutritional sciences.\r\n\r\nWith the launch of Advances in Nutrition, ASN will be able to address this unfulfilled need to publish high-quality review articles in an online format and extend our reach and impact to a much broader audience. Whereas AJCN and JN are primarily focused on discovery, Advances in Nutrition will help ASN fulfill its commitment to translation of nutritional science.",

    "abstract": "Since 1980, when inaugural national dietary guidance was to “avoid too much sodium,” recommendations have evolved to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans’ quantified guidance of 2300 and 1500 mg/d [USDA and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Dietary guidelines for Americans, 1st (http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DGAs1980Guidelines.htm) and 7th (http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/dietaryguidelines2010.pdf) eds.]. Too much sodium remains a valid concern, but are current targets too low for optimal health? New research moves beyond sodium’s effect on the surrogate marker of blood pressure to examine the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Results show that sodium intakes both less than and greater than ∼3000–5000 mg/d increase the risk of negative health outcomes. Additionally, newly compiled sodium intake data across populations show a uniformity that suggests that intake is physiologically set. Perhaps not coincidentally, the observed intakes fall within the range related to lowest risk. These findings are highly relevant to current efforts to achieve low sodium intakes across populations, because the data suggest that the efforts will be unsuccessful for healthy people and may cause harm to vulnerable populations. Remaining mindful of risks associated with both excessive and inadequate intakes is imperative with all nutrients, and sodium is no exception. Avoiding too much, and too little, sodium may be the best advice for Americans.",

    "abstract": "Only very few Cochrane nutrition reviews include cohort studies (CSs), but most evidence in nutrition research comes from CSs. We aimed to pool bodies of evidence (BoE) from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) derived from Cochrane reviews with matched BoE from CSs. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and MEDLINE were searched for systematic reviews (SRs) of RCTs and SRs of CSs. BoE from RCTs were pooled together with BoE from CSs using random-effects and common-effect models. Heterogeneity, 95% prediction intervals, contributed weight of BoE from RCTs to the pooled estimate, and whether integration of BoE from CSs modified the conclusion from BoE of RCTs were evaluated. Overall, 80 diet-disease outcome pairs based on 773 RCTs and 720 CSs were pooled. By pooling BoE from RCTs and CSs with a random-effects model, for 45 (56%) out of 80 diet-disease associations the 95% CI excluded no effect and showed mainly a reduced risk/inverse association. By pooling BoE from RCTs and CSs, median I2 = 46% and the median contributed weight of RCTs to the pooled estimates was 34%. The direction of effect between BoE from RCTs and pooled effect estimates was rarely opposite (n = 17; 21%). The integration of BoE from CSs modified the result (by examining the 95% CI) from BoE of RCTs in 35 (44%) of the 80 diet-disease associations. Our pooling scenario showed that the integration of BoE from CSs modified the conclusion from BoE of RCTs in nearly 50% of the associations, although the direction of effect was mainly concordant between BoE of RCTs and pooled estimates. Our findings provide insights for the potential impact of pooling both BoE in Cochrane nutrition reviews. CSs should be considered for inclusion in future Cochrane nutrition reviews, and we recommend analyzing RCTs and CSs in separate meta-analyses, or, if combined together, with a subgroup analysis.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary biology informs us that the living world is a product of evolution, guided by the Darwinian mechanism of natural selection. This recognition has been fruitfully employed in a number of issues in health and nutrition sciences; however, it has not been incorporated into education. Nutrition and dietetics students generally learn very little or nothing on the subject of evolution, despite the fact that evolution is the process by which our genetically determined physiological traits and needs were shaped. In the present Perspective article, 3 examples of topics (inflammatory diseases, nutrition transition, and food intolerance) that can benefit from evolutionary information and reasoning are given, with relevant lines of research and inquiry provided throughout. It is argued that the application of evolutionary science to these and other areas of nutrition education can facilitate a deeper and more coherent teaching and learning experience. By recognizing and reframing nutrition as an aspect and discipline of biology, grounded in the fundamental principle of adaptation, revelatory light is shed on physiological states and responses, contentious and unresolved issues, genomic, epigenomic, and microbiomic features, and optimal nutrient status and intakes.",

    "abstract": "Transparent reporting of nutrition research promotes rigor, reproducibility, and relevance to human nutrition. We performed a scoping review of recent articles reporting dietary folate interventions in mice as a case study to determine the reporting frequency of generic study design items (i.e., sex, strain, and age) and nutrition-specific items (i.e., base diet composition, intervention doses, duration, and exposure verification) in basic nutrition research. We identified 798 original research articles in the EMBASE, Medline, Food Science and Technology Abstracts (FSTA), Global Health, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) databases published between January 2009 and July 2021 in which a dietary folic acid (FA) intervention was used in mice. We identified 312 original peer-reviewed articles including 191 studies in nonpregnant and 126 in pregnant mice. Most studies reported sex (99%), strain (99%), and age (83%). The majority of studies used C57BL/6 (53%) or BALB/c (11%) mice aged 3-9 wk. Nonpregnancy studies were more likely to use only male mice (57%). Dietary FA interventions varied considerably and overlapped: deficiency (0-3 mg/kg), control (0-16 mg/kg), and supplemented (0-50 mg/kg). Only 63% of studies used an open-formula base diet with a declared FA content and 60% of studies verified FA exposure using folate status biomarkers. The duration of intervention ranged from 1 to 104 wk for nonpregnancy studies. The duration of intervention for pregnancy studies was 1-19 wk, occurring variably before pregnancy and/or during pregnancy and/or lactation. Overall, 17% of studies did not report ≥1 generic study design item(s) and 40% did not report ≥1 nutrition-specific study design item(s). The variability and frequent lack of reporting of important generic and nutrition-specific study design details in nutrition studies limit their generalizability, reproducibility, and interpretation. The use of reporting checklists for animal research would enhance reporting quality of key study design and conduct factors in animal-based nutrition research.",

    "abstract": "Supporting optimal newborn nutrition and the positive maternal-infant relationship, while encouraging safe sleep practices, are essential components of maternal and newborn care in the hospital setting following birth. Breastfeeding is widely recognized as best practice to support the nutritional needs and well-being of the infant, and recommendations have been developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to encourage and successfully support breastfeeding efforts prior to hospital discharge. The 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding, developed and promoted by the WHO, form the basis of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) and have become the international framework for public health initiatives to promote breastfeeding. An evaluation of hospital performance implementing the 10 Steps through the process of \"Baby Friendly Designation\" (BFD) has been suggested by many breastfeeding advocates as the optimal pathway to attain the goals of the BFHI. However, the WHO has recognized that BFD may not be an appropriate goal in all settings, and indicated, as part of their updated 2018 Guidance, that \"Facilities may make changes in their policies and procedures to obtain the designation, but these changes are not always sustainable, especially when there are no regular monitoring systems in place\" (1). In addition, unintended associated issues regarding newborn safety and maternal dissatisfaction with certain of the 10 Steps have emerged. This perspective will discuss the challenges facing hospitals attempting to implement the BFHI 10 Steps and suggest potential solutions to make progress in those efforts with or without BFD, as well as the efforts needed to support formula feedings when appropriate.",

    "abstract": "Current regulations require that the assessment of protein quality in infant formula be determined using the protein efficiency ratio (PER) rat bioassay where the growth of rats fed a test protein is compared with the growth of rats fed casein. This review cites authoritative body opinions that the PER is not a preferred method for scoring protein quality, particularly as applied to the infant formula. Methodological recommendations specified by FDA and recent guidance propose to control nonprotein dietary variables in the PER. In contrast, the essential amino acid pattern of human milk has been adopted internationally as the standard for protein quality in infant formula. Because casein, the control protein in the PER fails to meet the standard of human milk essential amino acids, the PER based on casein can generate a false assurance of the quality of protein in an infant formula. FDA should revise the method of demonstrating the quality factor for the biological quality of protein to the essential amino acid pattern of human milk, which would be simpler, conform to international standards, and should be considered by FDA under a new statute. Alternate methods of determination of protein quality can be used selectively when there are questions about the digestibility of new protein sources or the effects of manufacturing processes.",

    "abstract": "Although a posteriori dietary patterns (DPs) naturally reflect actual dietary behavior in a population, their specificity limits generalizability. Among other issues, the absence of a standardized approach to analysis have further hindered discovery of genuinely reproducible DPs across studies from the same/similar populations. A systematic review on a posteriori DPs from principal component analysis or exploratory factor analysis (EFA) across study populations from Italy provides the basis to explore assessment and drivers of DP reproducibility in a case study of epidemiological interest. First to our knowledge, we carried out a qualitative (i.e., similarity plots built on text descriptions) and quantitative (i.e., congruence coefficients, CCs) assessment of DP reproducibility. The 52 selected articles were published in 2001-2022 and represented dietary habits in 1965-2022 from 70% of the Italian regions; children/adolescents, pregnancy/breastfeeding women, and elderly were considered in 15 articles. The included studies mainly derived EFA-based DPs on food groups from food frequency questionnaires and were of \"good quality\" according to standard scales. Based on text descriptions, the 186 identified DPs were collapsed into 113 (69 food-based and 44 nutrient-based) apparently different DPs (39.3% reduction), later summarized along with the 3 \"Mixed-Salad/Vegetable-based Patterns,\" \"Pasta-and-Meat-oriented/Starchy Patterns,\" and \"Dairy Products\" and \"Sweets/Animal-based Patterns\" groups, by matching similar food-based and nutrient-based groups of collapsed DPs. Based on CCs (215 CCs, 68 DPs, 18 articles using the same input lists), all pairs of DPs showing the same/similar names were at least \"fairly similar\" and ∼81% were \"equivalent.\" The 30 \"equivalent\" DPs ended up into 6 genuinely different DPs (80% reduction) that targeted fruits and (raw) vegetables, pasta and meat combined, and cheese and deli meats. Such reduction reflects the same study design, list of input variables, and DP identification method followed across articles from the same groups.

    "abstract": "The continued use of basic, manual anthropometric tools (e.g., boards and tapes) leaves anthropometry susceptible to human error. A potential solution, 3-dimensional (3D) imaging systems for anthropometry, has been around since the 1950s. In the 1980s, 3D imaging technology advanced from photographs to the use of lasers for body digitization; and by the 2000s, the falling price of 3D scanners made commercial application feasible. The garment sector quickly adopted imaging technology for surveys because of the need for numerous measurements and large sample sizes. In the health sector, 3D imaging for anthropometry was not widely adopted; its use was limited to research and specialized purposes. The different cost and logistical requirements for measurement in the garment and health sectors help to explain why the technology was adopted in one sector and not the other. Despite reductions, the price of 3D imaging systems remained a barrier to the use of 3D imaging for regular nutritional assessment in the health sector. Additional barriers in the health sector were that imaging systems required dedicated space and were not designed for capturing measurements in young children. In recent years, the development of light-coding technology may have removed these barriers, and a handheld imaging system was developed specifically for young children. There are not yet recommendations to replace manual equipment with 3D imaging for nutritional assessment, and there is a need for more research on low-cost, handheld imaging systems-particularly research that evaluates the ability of 3D imaging to improve the quality of anthropometric data and indicators.",

Given the increasing volume of research articles generated, the retrieval and synthesis of evidence are increasingly becoming laborious and time-consuming. Information technology could help to reduce workload for humans. To guide supervised learning however, human identification of key study characteristics is necessary. Reporting guidelines recommend that authors include essential content in articles and could generate manually labeled training data for automated evidence retrieval and synthesis. Here, we present a semiautomated approach to annotate, link, and track the content of nutrition research manuscripts. We used the STROBE extension for nutritional epidemiology (STROBE-nut) reporting guidelines to manually annotate a sample of 15 articles and converted the semantic information into linked data in a Neo4j graph database through an automated process. Six summary statistics were computed to estimate the reporting completeness of the articles. The content structure, presence of essential study characteristics as well as the reporting completeness of the articles are visualized automatically from the graph database. The archived linked data are interoperable through their annotations and relations. A graph database with linked data on essential study characteristics can enable Natural Language Processing in nutrition.",

    "abstract": "In some European countries, yogurt consumption is common. However, such consumption is not common in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, partially because of the lack of a cultural tradition of consuming yogurt. Moreover, we also know that little information about the health benefits associated with yogurt consumption has been provided to the Mexican population. Thus, there is an immediate need to provide, at least to the nutrition community in the country, current scientific evidence about the health benefits of yogurt, with the aim that yogurt be included as part of the functional foods recommended to the population. Currently, extensive research has been conducted to investigate the mechanisms through which yogurt generates beneficial effects. Gut microbiota appear to be an important factor that can be modified by dietary prebiotics, as well as probiotics such as yogurt. The prevention or attenuation of gut microbiota dysbiosis is now associated with improvements observed in individuals with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Thus, it is important to establish guidelines for the consumption of dairy products, including yogurt. Such guidelines are necessary to increase the consumption of dairy products in Mexico and other countries.",

    "abstract": "The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, included guidelines for pregnancy, lactation, and children from birth to age 24 mo (B-24) to reflect the growing body of evidence about appropriate nutrition during the earliest stages of life. Guidelines were based on a thorough review of the existing scientific evidence by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC). This study's objective was to enumerate early-life (pregnancy, lactation, and B-24) nutrition research needs that are already being addressed by the scientific community and to identify remaining research gaps. The Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee was reviewed, and 138 research gaps relevant to early life were identified. Research gaps were consolidated into 13 topic areas. A total of 1632 nutrition- and early-life-focused research projects funded by the NIH between 2018 and 2020 were manually coded using title, abstract, and public health relevance statement available on NIH RePORTER. Projects were coded as affirmative if they addressed a research gap within 1 of the 13 research gap topic areas. Of coded projects, 235 (14.4%) addressed any early-life nutrition research gap. Between fiscal years 2018 to 2020, total costs of projects addressing any gap represented only 15% of total costs for all projects reviewed. Complementary foods, breastfeeding (never vs. ever), and frequency of eating were research gap areas most frequently coded as being addressed by a funded project. Iron supplementation, seafood consumption, and maternal diet food allergens were research gap areas least frequently coded as being potentially addressed by a funded project. This analysis highlights opportunities for changes in the federal government investment in maternal and child nutrition research to support development of effective, evidence-based dietary guidelines for improvement in early-life nutrition practices and overall public health.",

    "abstract": "Previous systematic reviews, which focused on sugar intake and its relation with health issues, were mainly conducted in Western countries, not Asian countries characterized by differences in dietary habits and disease prevalence. The scarcity of Asian studies may be attributed to the lack of assessment tools for estimating sugar intake. To provide an overview of the epidemiological studies on sugar intake in Asian countries, with a primary focus on dietary assessment methodology for estimating sugar intake, we conducted a scoping review of the epidemiological studies estimating sugar intake in Asian countries (the United Nations' definition) and Taiwan using PubMed and Web of Science. Study quality was evaluated based on its assessment of sugar intake in the whole diet, dietary assessment methods, and data sources used for estimating sugar content. We identified 143 studies from 136 publications from Eastern (n = 63), Southern (n = 30), South-Eastern (n = 26), and Western (n = 24) Asia. Total sugars were investigated in 95 studies, while 23-30 studies investigated sucrose, fructose, added sugars, and free sugars. The main aim of the selected studies was assessment of diet-disease relations (n = 85) and estimation of dietary intake (n = 40), and 62 studies assessed sugars as the primary exposure/outcome. A total of 120 studies assessed sugar intake in the whole diet, and 62 studies used validated FFQs or multiple-day dietary assessment methods. Only 41 studies used country-specific comprehensive food-composition databases or directly measured sugar content. Only 17 studies reported high-quality data. This review elucidated a sufficient number of epidemiological studies estimating sugar intake across Asian countries; however, most studies reported low-quality data. The results from our review showed that both feasible and validated dietary assessment methods, as well as comprehensive country-specific sugar-composition databases, are essential for producing high-quality studies with accurate sugar intake to examine its association with health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nI was very interested to read 3 of the recent reviews (1–3) from an ASN Scientific Sessions at Experimental Biology 2014 symposium designed to “review a growing body of evidence examining sodium intake and health outcomes that are highly relevant to sodium DRIs, the DGAs (Dietary Guidelines for Americans), and numerous government- and nongovernmental organization–driven efforts to significantly reduce sodium in the entire population” (1). These are comprehensive reports but they appear to have overlooked water intake in relation to sodium intake, and the physiologic regulation of both with respect to cardiovascular disease and overall health (4). Sodium is one aspect of this regulation that along with water intake can be altered through dietary recommendations. Current emphasis on reducing sodium intake not only does not address the core problem, it makes the solution more difficult. There are a host of practical and pragmatic reasons why consumers, and manufacturers in particular, add sodium to foods. These must be countered or suppressed for such a dietary policy to be effective. There is a far simpler path. Rather than seeking to reduce sodium intake, policy could focus on simply reducing it as a concern.\r\n\r\nThe issue surrounding dietary sodium arises through a human anomaly. In experiments with animals, increased dietary sodium intake increases plasma sodium, thus increasing plasma osmolality. The appropriate physiologic response is stimulation of the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which increases the release of vasopressin and stimulates thirst (leading to the ingestion of fluids). Increased fluid intake initially leads to increased blood volume, and perhaps increased blood pressure. This can create a pressure diuresis that increases kidney water and sodium excretion. Such a pressure diuresis would be temporary, existing until plasma volume and osmolality return to within the normal range, which would reduce activation of the osmoreceptors, lowering concentrations of vasopressin and switching off thirst (4). However, this does not appear to happen in humans under normal conditions; otherwise we would not be discussing dietary sodium policy. Why this does not happen is a separate question. The fact remains that in most people increased sodium intake is not followed by stimulation of an appropriate fluid intake. The question under discussion is the policy direction that is appropriate in dealing with this anomaly. Water drinking is the easiest part of the regulation of body fluids, and hence of cardiovascular regulation, that could be controlled, and seems in fact likely to be ultimately more effective than measures to reduce sodium intake.\r\n\r\nThe physiologic response to the osmotic stimulus of current sodium intake amounts is increased drinking. The absence of increased fluid intake, or only low amounts of fluid intake, leads to hypohydration and continual, stimulated release of vasopressin. In the long term this leads to a reduction in kidney function, which could be a component of chronic kidney disease. This chronic, mild hypohydration affects both the intracellular and the extracellular fluid compartments, the latter being associated with hypovolemia. In order to recover blood volume loss, both water and sodium are needed, and the physiologic mechanisms regulating this are thirst and salt appetite. Furthermore, hypovolemia stimulates the release of vasopressin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone, and unless blood volume is restored, even just temporarily, these hormones will continue to be released. Chronic, increased blood concentrations of these hormones are associated with cardiovascular disease (1–5) and possibly kidney disease.\r\n\r\nMedications that antagonize the renin-angiotensin (and aldosterone) system make up the overwhelming majority of treatments used to combat cardiovascular disease (5, 6). Yet, as shown by McCarron (2), a high concentration of sodium in the urine is normally associated with low plasma concentrations of angiotensin and aldosterone. The fact that, in humans, high intakes of sodium are associated with high blood concentrations of angiotensin, aldosterone, and vasopressin would indicate that humans are chronically dehydrated and/or hypovolemic. Physiologic regulation indicates further that no matter how much reduction of sodium in the diet takes place, unless blood volume is restored, these hormones will continue to be released, further promoting cardiovascular disease, as well as other health complications (4). Blood volume can be restored relatively easily by drinking sufficient quantities of water.\r\n\r\nAnimal research has shown also that angiotensin and aldosterone are associated with a centrally stimulated appetite for sodium (2, 7). This has not been demonstrated in humans but the fact that they consume large amounts of dietary sodium could indicate that the hormone-induced appetite may be operating. Once again, no matter what the policies are to reduce sodium intake (3), the physiology of hypovolemia dictates that we will continue to consume sodium in an attempt to restore blood volume. McCarron (2) points out that measures of kidney sodium excretion in humans are similar across ages, sexes, and cultures, and he thus suggests that intakes are also similar. However, work by Maril et al. (8) and Titze (9) would indicate that intake can be greater than the amount excreted and that this excess sodium is taken up and stored in kidneys, skin, and muscle without associated water. This would imply that there is a maximum kidney sodium excretion rate in humans and that to prevent a long-term increase in plasma osmolality (also detrimental for overall health), sodium must be removed from the circulation. This stored sodium is mobile and can be eliminated when appropriate hydration conditions are provided (9, 10).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, humans are perfectly well equipped to deal with excess sodium as long as there is an appropriate (increased) fluid intake. Dietary policies aimed at dealing with cardiovascular disease should involve principally recommendations to increase water intake. Once blood volume is returned to normal, the “appetite” for sodium should be reduced.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to A Baddock for valuable discussions.",

These, along with other recent publications (4, 5), add to this rapidly expanding, multifaceted area of research.\r\n\r\nWe agree that changes in eating patterns could have substantial, but uncertain, potential to mitigate the environmental impacts of food systems (3, 5, 6). The review by Hallstrom et al. (2) of available, but limited, literature on environmental impacts of current and theoretical dietary scenarios reports that reducing consumption of animal-based products (in particular, ruminant meat) could decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions considerably (2). It was noted also that the choice of methodology to assess dietary impacts can affect the scientific quality and outcome of studies. As noted in our review (6) and by others (2, 4, 7, 8), methodologic differences including the choice of functional unit in life cycle assessments (LCA), the gold standard for evaluating environmental impacts across multiple sectors (8), can lead to different and conflicting conclusions. The study by Vieux et al. (9), for example, reported that high nutritional quality diets that include higher fruit and vegetable consumption were not associated with low GHG emissions, as anticipated. These results were explained in part by whether GHG emissions were reported on the basis of caloric intake (CO2 equivalents/100 kcal) or food weight (CO2 equivalents/100 g).\r\n\r\nThe specific LCA method used also can lead to different and potentially conflicting conclusions. Whereas the studies reviewed by Hallstrom et al. (2) use attributional LCA methodology to assess impacts of dietary scenarios on GHG emissions, a recent study in Australia used an environmentally extended input-output LCA method to estimate GHG emissions for different food sectors (7). Australian dietary guidelines, as in other developed countries, recommend increased consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, and dairy along with reduced consumption of energy-dense foods and drinks that are high in saturated fat, added sugar, salt, or alcohol (referred to as noncore foods) to achieve recommended intakes of dietary essential nutrients. The climate impact of dietary patterns based on Australian Dietary Guidelines was estimated to be about 25% lower than that of the average Australian diet. The impact of dietary scenarios modeled with only a 10% reduction in red meat and eliminating noncore food items was similarly estimated to be 25% lower. Reducing consumption of red meat as a sole dietary strategy to mitigate GHG emissions posed nutritional challenges for obtaining key nutrients, including highly bioavailable iron and zinc. In this study, increased consumption of core foods and lower consumption of noncore foods could have the cobenefits of 25% lower GHG emissions from Australian dietary patterns and enhanced population health. Given the variability in LCA methodologies among researchers, agreement on the appropriate LCA methodology and functional unit is critically needed to inform future guidance on healthy and sustainable diets.\r\n\r\nConsumer lifestyle preferences and circumstances also play a major role in shaping environmental impacts associated not only with dietary patterns, but also with food waste, transportation, shelter, and household energy use (3, 10). Barriers to substantive changes in dietary habits include both implications to human health and cultural and societal resistance to behavior change (3). Indeed, concerted efforts to improve public health through recommended changes in dietary patterns to achieve nutrient adequacy have fallen short (3, 11). Similar anomalies in consumer behavior have been observed in relation to household energy use (3).\r\n\r\nThe report to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change notes that impacts of GHG emissions, energy consumption, and land use varies considerably across regions and countries and that the potential for successful mitigation strategies will be most effective when country-specific approaches for sustainable development are in line with national priorities (3). Others similarly report that both positive and negative environmental impacts and opportunities and barriers to GHG emissions mitigation are region specific; thus, mitigation options should be examined on a case-by-case basis (5). Further, as noted by Aleksandrowicz et al. (1), mitigation opportunities in developed countries differ from those in low- and middle-income countries. Food systems are diverse not only within individual countries but also within the broader economic and sociopolitical context globally (3, 5).\r\n\r\nDecision-makers need suitable tools to analyze the intended effects and unintended consequences of potential mitigation strategies while also considering potential trade-offs. A recent committee report from the Institute of Medicine in the United States proposed an analytic framework for researchers, decision-makers, and other stakeholders to examine the possible impacts of future dietary guidance on population health and the environmental, social, and economic aspects of food systems (4). The framework, which has applicability across the globe, is designed to facilitate understanding of the environmental, health, social, and economic effects of the food system and how they are linked; foster enhancement of data collection systems and methodologies; inform decision-making in food and agricultural practices and policies; and minimize unintended health, environmental, social and economic consequences. However, measurement tools to fully assess changes in the totality of the food system are lacking.\r\n\r\nBridging current population-level gaps between current and recommended dietary patterns can lead to improved health and potentially lower the environmental impacts of agriculture and food systems. However, researchers in agriculture, public health, nutrition, food safety, sociology, economics, complex systems, and the food industry will first need to address methodologic inconsistencies and further build the scientific research base to close gaps in understanding impacts of dietary patterns across environmental, social, and economic dimensions of food systems.",

    "abstract": "The impact of dietary fats and oils on health continues to be a controversial subject. In addition, the ability of the food industry to freely alter the fat content and composition of foods to meet dietary recommendations is limited by how these food components affect food quality and stability. Therefore, a recent workshop was held to bring together food and nutrition scientists to highlight nutritional research and product innovations that explore the nutritional impact of fatty acids in the food supply. The latest research on metabolic responses and health benefits associated with foods made with new nutritional and functional oils was discussed, along with a detailed look at how science-based advances in preparation methods and processing technologies affect the nutrient profile of food products, including potato products. Additional discussion was provided on how oil innovations align with dietary guidance and policy. This supplement issue presents articles on those presentations.",

    "abstract": "Cardiometabolic diseases and abnormalities have recently emerged as independent risk factors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, including hospitalizations, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Determining whether and how this observation translates to more effective long-term pandemic mitigation strategies remains a challenge due to key research gaps. Specific pathways by which cardiometabolic pathophysiology affects humoral immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and vice versa, remain unclear. This review summarizes current evidence of the bidirectional influences between cardiometabolic diseases (diabetes, adiposity, hypertension, CVDs) and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies induced from infection and vaccination based on human studies. Ninety-two studies among >408,000 participants in 37 countries on 5 continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, and North and South America) were included in this review. Obesity was associated with higher neutralizing antibody titers following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most studies conducted prior to vaccinations found positive or null associations between binding antibodies (levels, seropositivity) and diabetes; after vaccinations, antibody responses did not differ by diabetes. Hypertension and CVDs were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Findings underscore the importance of elucidating the extent that tailored recommendations for COVID-19 prevention, vaccination effectiveness, screening, and diagnoses among people with obesity could reduce disease burden caused by SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aims to comprehensively evaluate the literature regarding the impact of variations in dietary intake, both between- and within-day, on adiposity and glucose metabolism. We included observational and experimental articles obtained from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and gray literature until 9 October, 2023, evaluating the impact of between- or within-day variations in meal, energy, or macronutrient intake on these outcomes. Our focus was on adults aged ≥18 y, spanning both healthy individuals and those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Given the diverse range of exposures, treatments, and outcomes among the selected articles, we chose a qualitative synthesis approach to effectively analyze the data. Eighty articles from 43 observational and 37 experimental studies were included, involving 89,178 participants. Patterns of dietary intake variation were identified and systematically organized into distinct categories based on similarities. Between-day variations in dietary intake consisted of between-day variations in both the quantity consumed and meal timing. Meanwhile, within-day variations encompassed factors such as eating window, meal omission, within-day meal timing, within-day variation in dietary intake quantity, and temporal distribution. Despite mixed results, time-restricted eating was generally associated with lower adiposity. However, limited control for total daily energy intake (TDEI) suggests that the contribution of lower energy intake cannot be conclusively excluded. Conversely, the adverse effect of meal omission on glucose parameters was consistently supported by randomized trials. Interestingly, the results showed that consuming a substantial portion of TDEI in the morning may increase the likelihood of observing improvements in adiposity. Furthermore, inconsistencies in outcomes across articles examining the effects in healthy compared with T2DM populations, or in energy-sufficient compared with deficient individuals, indicate potential condition-specific effects. These findings support the need for further investigation into the effects of between- and within-day variations in dietary intake to better understand their impact on adiposity and glucose homeostasis. This review was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42020214307.",

    "abstract": "In today's world in which there is a surplus of both scientists and online nutrition \"experts,\" how do young professionals establish themselves? Becoming established as an expert requires selling yourself and your ideas to your colleagues and the general public by using effective communication skills. Helping young professionals develop these skills was the goal of a panel held at the ASN Scientific Sessions and Annual Meeting at Experimental Biology 2015. This panel featured a set of distinguished speakers who discussed techniques and strategies to enhance professional reputations centered around effectively leveraging communication platforms and opportunities to engage with colleagues. Early-career nutrition scientists can use the guidance provided by the panelists to improve their visibility and be a champion for themselves in order to establish themselves as experts in the field.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor:\r\n\r\nThe comments and concerns expressed by Thornton (1) relate to our recent reviews from the ASN Scientific Sessions at Experimental Biology 2014 symposium regarding sodium intake and health outcomes. His comments appropriately expand the discussion of whether to reduce sodium intakes to low amounts. Our intent with the cited papers was never to exclude critical cofactors such as water. The neural regulation of water and sodium are physiologically interrelated (2), because optimizing both volume and osmolality are essential elements of cardiovascular health. As noted by Thornton, the hormonal response to decreased perfusion invokes angiotensin II, aldosterone, and vasopressin release, all of which have potent vascular actions that potentially increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.\r\n\r\nThornton’s argument that overlooking the role of water intake in understanding the association of sodium with health outcomes raises another question as to the safety of a health policy directed at lowering sodium intake across the entire population. Hyponatremia at hospital admission and in free-living populations has been associated with both increased morbidity and mortality (3–6). Those findings are consistent with the proposition that sodium and water intake must be considered in tandem when assessing health outcomes. As opposed to previous hypotheses that comorbidities accounted for an increased risk of death, recent data indicate that the greatest risk appears in those with few comorbid conditions (5, 6).\r\n\r\nHyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance in the general population (6). Reduced sodium intake in and of itself can impair the healthy kidney’s ability to excrete excess free water (7). Therefore, a lower sodium diet would promote the development of a reduced serum sodium concentration, or hyponatremia. Although it is typically assumed that with normal kidney function there is a large excess renal capacity to excrete water, what is not generally appreciated is that reduced solute intake impairs the healthy kidney’s capacity to excrete excess water (7). Sodium intake is one of the principle contributors to the renal solute load. Thus, lower sodium intake potentially sets in motion a normal physiologic response that would contribute to the development of hyponatremia in a segment of the general population. If healthy persons lower their sodium intake as recommended by current guidelines, but maintain water consumption that exceeds requirements (as is widely promoted to the general population, especially physically active people), those guidelines may well set the stage for the emergence of hyponatremia even in otherwise healthy people. The hyponatremia-related mortality and morbidity data published to date and the physiology of sodium and water handling by the kidney provide a plausible explanation to account for the increased risk of death from lower sodium intake in healthy, low-risk individuals (8). Furthermore, such a risk would not solely rest on activation of the renin-angiotensin system and aldosterone invoked for those already at risk of CVD.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the simplest and most important aspect of the issue raised by Thornton is his reminder that water metabolism is linked to sodium. That obvious and accepted physiologic link should serve as a note of caution that there are many “moving parts” associated with reducing sodium intake in the general population. The longstanding assumption that sodium restriction to amounts below that normally consumed in modern societies is safe and effective fails to consider that complex physiology. The old adage that “it is too good to be true” may well apply to the simplistic policy view that sodium restriction lowers blood pressure and therefore reduces CVD risk.",

    "abstract": "Do We Know Enough?\" (1), which appeared in the July issue of your publication, I believe an important clarification is warranted.The title of the article suggests that the review will address the entirety of the autism population, but the article is focused exclusively on children.This observation is important because most individuals with autism are adults.By their omission the authors are contributing to the childcentric view of autism that has prevailed for some time across all domains of research.There are many reasons for this pediatric focus in autism research that are beyond the scope of this letter.Of late, however, there has been a growing recognition that autism is not static across the lifespan, because evidence suggests that major changes occur in brain function and structure in the transition from childhood to adolescence.Equally striking, it is generally believed that many behavioral symptoms typically attributed to lower-functioning individuals on the spectrum tend to abate in severity by early adulthood (2-7).Why there would be a reduction or change in behavior in the transition to adulthood is incompletely understood at present, although it is hypothesized to center on the restructuring of gray and white matter in the brain during childhood and into adolescence (8).It is also possible that a reduction in sensory abnormalities as part of the natural aging process also plays a role (9), as does greater self-awareness (10) and enhanced ability to draw on learned skills.Parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder have also noted these changes anecdotally as occurring in the transition from adolescence into adulthood (4).More importantly, research on the nutritional status of adults on the spectrum is now emerging (11), creating a picture of the unique patterns for this period of the lifespan.Across many domains of research it is being demonstrated that adults with autism are not simply children writ large.Consequently, we cannot (and must not) extrapolate the research findings on children to adults with autism.Moreover, this is not a matter of drawing attention to a minority or splinter of the autism spectrum as, again, most individuals with autism are adults.",

    "abstract": "Research on the effects of fish oil on clinical symptoms and psychosocial functioning in people with psychosis has been inconsistent. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the available data on the effects of oral intake of fish oil on psychological functioning in patients with psychosis. Three online databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched to identify relevant studies published by April 2021. The exposure was oral fish-oil supplementation. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) were our outcome measures. Seventeen randomized clinical trials involving 1390 patients were included. No change in PANSS was observed following oral fish-oil intake [weighted mean difference (WMD): −0.87; 95% CI: −16.99, 15.26; P = 0.92]. In a nonlinear dose–response analysis, a significant inverse association was observed between <10 wk of fish-oil supplementation and PANSS (WMD: −10; P-nonlinearity = 0.02). Although analysis of 4 studies showed a nonsignificant reduction in BPRS after fish-oil intake (WMD: −2.990; 95% CI: −6.42, 0.44; P = 0.08), a nonlinear dose–response analysis revealed significant inverse associations between dose (>2200 mg/d) and duration of fish-oil supplementation (<15 wk) with BPRS score (WMD: −8; P-nonlinearity = 0.04). Combined effect sizes from 6 randomized clinical trials showed significant increases in GAF after oral administration of fish oil (WMD: 6.66; 95% CI: 3.39, 9.93; P < 0.001). In conclusion, we did not find any significant changes in PANSS and BPRS scores following fish-oil supplementation. Nevertheless, oral fish-oil intake significantly contributed to improvement in GAF scores. This is the first meta-analysis to examine the effects of fish oil on the psychological functioning scores of PANSS, BPRS, and GAF simultaneously.",
