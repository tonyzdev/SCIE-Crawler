    "abstract": "Abstract The wing surfaces of 97 insect species from virtually all relevant major groups were examined by high resolution scanning‐electron‐microscopy, in order to identify the relationships between the wing microstructures, their wettability with water and their behaviour under the influence of contamination. Isolated wings with contact angles between 31.6° and 155.5° were artificially contaminated with silicate dusts and subsequently fogged until drops of water (“dew”) formed and rolled off. The remaining particles were counted via a digital image analysis system. Remaining particle values between 0.41% and 103% were determined in comparison with unfogged controls. Some insects with very unwettable wings show a highly significant “self‐cleaning” effect under the influence of rain or dew. Detailed analysis revealed that there is a correlation between the wettability and the “SM Index” (quotient of wing surface/(body mass) 0.67 ) with values ranging from 2.42 to 57.0. Furthermore, there is a correlation between the “self‐cleaning” effect and the SM Index, meaning that taxa with a high SM Index, e.g. “large‐winged” Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Planipennia, and many Lepidoptera, have very unwettable wings and show high particle removal due to dripping water drops. The “small‐winged” insects, such as Diptera and Hymenoptera, and insects with elytra, such as Blattariae, Saltatoria, Heteroptera and Coleoptera, show completely opposite effects. This is clearly a result of the fact that species with a high SM Index are, in principle, more restricted in flight by contamination than species with a low SM Index which can also actively clean their own wings. The wings primarily serve a protection function in insects with elytra, so that the effects of contamination are probably of minor importance in these insects.

    "abstract": "Abstract Scholtz, G. 2010. Deconstructing morphology. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 44–63 Morphology as the science of form is, in particular, related to the overwhelming diversity of animal forms. Due to its long pre‐Darwinian tradition, organismic morphology is partly burdened by ahistorical typological views. On the other hand, the study of organismic form has always implied concepts of transformation, which helped to pave the way for evolutionary theories. This contradictory history and the fact that we need words to describe organismic form lead in many cases to morphological concepts implying a mixture of structural, functional, developmental, ecological, typological, and evolutionary aspects in current morphological approaches. Because these mixed views lead to contradictory and misleading interpretations of animal form, I stress the need to deconstruct morphological concepts at all levels. I propose a morphology that analyses transformation of animal forms strictly at the structural level in combination with genealogical thinking. Function and other biological aspects of form should be considered in an independent second analytical step. A comparative pattern approach, including developmental patterns, of animal structure in an evolutionary framework allows for the analysis of morphological change, in particular, phylogenetic reconstructions, homology assessment, and the recognition of evolutionary independent morphological units.",

After toning, dehydrating and mounting in the usual manner the sections generally are ready for examinations within less than an hour. The method is available for specimens fixed in the ordinary fixatives but those containing oxidizing metal compounds. The procedure is discussed from a theoretical point of view and some results are shown in photomicrographs.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT An analysis of the brain of Chameleon has given evidence of a number of modifications in the general plan of the reptilian nervous system. The telencephalon shows a reduced olfactory mechanism and suggests the presence of the true motor cortex. The ventral peduncle of the lateral forebrain bundle is unusually large with the majority of its fibres terminating in two new nuclear masses in the hypothalamus, the nucleus entopeduncularis, and a few in the nucleus ruber. A high degree of effective response to optic stimuli is indicated by the extensive correlation between the optic tectum and the nuclear masses of the midbrain and the diencephalon. The wide range of eye movements is probably correlated with the development of the basal optic root ganglion and its numerous secondary connections and the elaborate relationship of the geniculate complex. The usually highly developed tecto‐bulbar system is partly replaced by a large tegmento‐bulbar system that relays the tectal impulses caudally. An interesting mesencephalic nucleus is a large nucleus profundus mesencephali that receives a great variety of impulses and appears to be an important correlation center. Ascending visceral mechanisms were described bringing the hypothalamus into relationship with the lower centers. The great excursion of the tongue is associated with a highly differentiated hypoglossal nucleus. Components of the medial lemniscus from the spinal cord and the medulla to the vicinity of the thalamus were demonstrated.",

The trochaea theory predicts that Porifera and Cnidaria have only monociliate cells and lack ciliary bands used in filter‐feeding, that the gastroneuralian larvae have downstream‐collecting ciliary bands with prototroch and metatroch of compound cilia on multiciliate cells, and that notoneuralian larvae have an upstream‐collecting neotroch on monociliate cells. The observations generally fit these predictions and the exceptions are discussed. In all the ciliated epithelia, except that of the sponge larva, each ciliated cell has an accessory centriole perpendicular to the basal body of the cilium and situated on its downstream side.",

Other similar but more modified types of cells, in which the inner edges of the radiating lamellae could be recognized as longitudinal ridges in the wall of a cylindrical flagellar pit, were found in ambulacral ampullae of Porania and in coelomic epithelia of Stichopus. Distinct indications of phagocytosis were seen in most of these cells. The present report together with previously published data lend support to the idea, that the choanocyte is a fundamental cell type in metazoans, probably derived phylogenetically from some flagellate ancestor.",

The blastopore closes in the posterior end of the larva. The ciliated, lecithotrophic larva has four pairs of coelomic pouches and three pairs of dorsal setal bundles. At metamorphosis, the larva curls ventrally by contraction of a pair of midventral muscles, which are extensions of the first pair of coelomic sacs; the larva attaches by the epithelium just behind the closed blastopore. The brachial valve is secreted by the middle part of the dorsal epithelium and the pedicle valve is secreted by the attachment epithelium. The second pair of coelomic sacs develop small attachment areas at the edge of the dorsal valve and become the lophophore coelom (mesocoel); the third pair of coelomic sacs become the body coelom (metacoel) with the adductor muscles. The posterior position of the closing blastopore is characteristic of deuterostomes. The ventral curving of the settling larva and the formation of both valves from dorsal epithelial areas indicate that the brachiopods have a very short ventral side as opposed to the phoronids. It is concluded that both groups have originated from a creeping ancestor with a straight gut.",

In this paper the assumed planktotrophic life‐style of the larva is critically analyzed and reconsidered. It is shown, in particular for the Mollusca, that a biphasic life‐cycle with a lecithotrophic larva is probably the plesiomorphic condition. Character distribution and structural data suggest a parallel evolution of the downstream collecting system used in planktotrophic larvae or filter‐feeding adults of gastropods, bivalves and other spiralian or aschelminth taxa. In the basic metazoans (Parazoa, Placozoa, coelenterates) direct or lecithotrophic development dominates by far. For the acoelomate (Platyhelminthes, Gnathostomulida) and pseudocoelomate taxa direct development is probably the plesiomorphic condition. The structural similarities of the upstream collecting system in tentaculate and deuterostome phyla may also be explained by parallel events of heterochrony out of an ancestor with adult filter‐feeding. The main conclusion of this survey is that larval planktotrophy is likely to be secondary and not a plesiomorphic condition among the Bilateria. Accordingly, theories which are based on the assumed plesiomorphy of larval planktotrophy of the Bilateria, need careful reevaluation.",

The tendency for the echinoderm cuticle to dissolve during fixation in phosphate‐buffered glutaraldehyde accounts for several previous reports that echinoderms have no cuticle. Depending on the species, there are from one to three cuticular sublayers. Abundant epidermal microvilli penetrate the cuticle of crinoids, echinoids and asteroids, but such microvilli are rare in ophiuroids and holothurians. The ophiuroid cuticle is especially modified, since numerous pinched‐off tips of microvilli are included in its outer layer, and its inner layer may be very thick. The discussion includes speculations on cuticle evolution, with special reference to the deuterostomes. Each echinoderm studied, except the two holothurians, harbors one or two morphological types of bacteria between the cuticle and the epidermal cells and/or embedded in the inner layer of the cuticle. These subcuticular bacteria are spindle‐shaped in Antedon , spiral in Echinocardium , encapsulated rods in Ophiothrix , rods in Ophiura , and a mixture of rods and spirals in both Psammechinus and Astropecten. The discussion considers the possible significance of this widespread, specific and apparently non‐pathologic association between echinoderms and their subcuticular bacteria.",

Virtually all of these compounds were localized within the spherules of the spherulous cells in the mesohyl. This is the first localization of any secondary metabolite at the cellular or sub‐cellular level in any marine invertebrate. In Aplysina fistularis , as in other species of the same genus studied by Vacelet, the spherulous cells are concentrated just beneath the exopinacoderm and just beneath the endopinacoderm of the excurrent canals. Moreover, there is electron microscopic evidence for degeneration of some spherulous cells throughout the mesohyl. Presumably, this degeneration can release some aerothionin and homoaerothionin, which are known to have antibiotic properties. After release from the spherulous cells, these brominated natural products could function (1) within the mesohyl to exclude some types of bacteria or to aggregate ingested bacteria and/or (2) within the boundary layer of the surrounding seawater for defense or offense, as considered in the discussion section.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Phalangida includes three of the four suborders of Opiliones (Arachnida): Eupnoi, Dyspnoi and Laniatores. We review the literature on the sensory structures and capabilities of Phalangida, provide new morphological data for 18 species and discuss the 11 sensory structures that have been described in the group. Based on the published data encompassing both behaviour and morphology, three conclusions are apparent: (1) species of Phalangida appear to have limited abilities to detect stimuli at a distance; (2) close range olfaction probably helps to find foods with strong odours, but (3) they appear to be highly dependent on contact chemoreception to detect live prey, predators and mates. We also highlight the fact that legs I in the three suborders and pedipalps in Dyspnoi and Eupnoi are very important sensory appendages, thus legs II should not be called the ‘sensory appendages’ of harvestmen. In conclusion, we highlight the fact that the sensory capabilities, diet, prey capturing and handling ability, and foraging behaviour of species of Phalangida seem to be different from those of most other arachnids. Finally, we suggest future directions for studies in the field of the sensory system of the group.",

Experimental observations are presented indicating that an unidirectional watercurrent is created from the vestibule to the gallery via the corridors which are formed by the leaves of the olfactory rosette. The conditions for creating the watercurrents are: oriented and symmetrical beats of cilia situated on the walls of the corridors, and appropriate spacing of the corridors. This principle for water sampling is found in the olfactory organs of trout, carp, roach, catfish, eel, rockling and dogfish. In some other fishes studied the olfactory organs have accessory olfactory sacs and there is no subdivision in vestibule and gallery. In these organs the watercurrents are achieved by a pumping mechanism of the sacs.",

Hypotarsus morphology is of significance for the identification of fossil taxa, and several extant groups show characteristic patterns that are of phylogenetic interest. So far, however, the diversity of hypotarsus morphologies has been little studied, and there are no comprehensive studies across all neornithine birds. In particular, the identities of the involved canals and sulci remain elusive, and some confusion exists about their correct homologies. In this study, hypotarsus morphologies are for the first time surveyed among all extant birds, and basic patterns are characterized. Instances are identified, in which particular hypotarsus morphologies are correlated with certain locomotion types, inferences are made about possible ancestral morphologies, and some patterns of phylogenetic interest are discussed.",

The premaxillary‐vomer arthrosis is present in the embryo of Struthio but is absent in the adult; it is present in the adults of the other Dromaeognathae; the trabeculo‐capsular entity is uninterrupted: therefore, there is no mesokinetic joint; kinesis, as a result, is limited. No orbitosphenoid present; septum ossifies as mesethmoid which appears on the dorsal surface. There are only two circumorbital bones present: the lacrimal and the jugal. The auditory region has only two centres of ossification: the prootic and opisthotic. The quadrate has a single elongated condyle of the processus oticus which articulates with the prootic and squamosal. The cranial base is ossified as the basioccipital and basisphenoid, the latter being of mixed origin. There are five dermal bones in the lower jaw of Struthio ; the gonial is present. The trigeminus musculature is reduced and shows very definite neotenic features. The peripheral cranial nerves are typically avian. The cranial parasympathetic nerves are well developed in the embryo but show definite signs of resorption in the later stages of development. The hyoid apparatus is mainly cartilaginous; the hyoid musculature is reduced.",

Due to its peculiar characteristics, such as the high resistance, easy availability and stabulation, and for its evolutionary characteristics, this fish lends itself to be one of the most used experimental models. This study aimed to characterize the mast cells in the intestine of Carassius auratus using anti‐TLR‐2, anti‐S100, anti‐VIP, anti‐serotonin (5‐HT) and anti‐Piscidin antibodies. The intestine of goldfish, like that of all vertebrates, plays an important role in the immunology of the animal. The gut‐associated lymphoid tissue GALT is an immune component containing several specific cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages and mast cells. In addition, the presence of goblet cells in the intestinal epithelium strengthens the defence system, secreting many cytokines and chemokines and displaying antibacterial properties. Our results show mast cells labelled with antibodies that are highly conserved between fish and mammals, demonstrating an active role of these cells in the immune response.",

At frequent intervals during development, elongation of the embryonic and larval body was measured at room temperature (22.5°C) and at the approximate temperature of the natural environment (30°C). Development was slower at the lower temperature, with metamorphosis commencing during the fifth week as compared to the third week at the higher temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to describe a frequently sampled series of hatched embryos, pre‐metamorphic larvae, metamorphic larvae, and juveniles. The advent (and sometimes subsequent disappearance) of the following structures was determined from the SEM data: general epidermal ciliation, peroral pit, mouth, primary gill slits, ciliary tuft, external opening of the club‐shaped gland, sense cells, anus, metapleural folds, and preoral cirri. Our SEM did not substantiate the claims of van Wijhe for a transitory larval mouth near the anteriovental end of the larvae. The general epidermal cilation, which is uniformly distributed in the embryos, becomes somewhat reduced in the pre‐metamorphic larvae and then disappears almost entirely during metamorphosis. The epidermis includes two distinct sense cell types (I and II) and possibly a third type (the ventral pit cells, to which an adhesive role has alternatively been attributed). The anus first opens on the right‐hand side and only later migrates across the mid‐ventral line to assume a position on the left‐hand side of the larva; this is contrary to the established view that the anus of the larval lancelets opens on the left‐hand side and remains there.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nuchal organs are epidermal sensory structures present in most polychaetes. They are situated at the posterior edge of the prostomium and may extend posteriorly onto the peristomium. Although there is considerable external variation, they all consist of ciliated supporting cells, bipolar primary sensory cells and retractor muscles. They are innervated directly from the brain by paired nerves. The sensory cells are usually monociliated; their sensory processes lie in subcuticular spaces, the olfactory chambers. Structural variability is to be observed in the location of the sensory cells, the course of the nuchal nerve, position of nuchal ganglia as well as in cytological features of sensory and supporting cells. These differences provide useful characters for phylogenetic considerations to establish supraspecific taxa within the phylogenetic system of the Annelida. Special emphasis is laid on the problem of whether the nuchal organs represent an autapomorphy of the Polychaeta or the Annelida and thus whether the lack of nuchal organs in Clitellata is primary or secondary. As is discussed, the probability of a loss of the nuchal organs in Clitellata is higher, which favours the second hypothesis: that nuchal organs are part of the ground pattern of the Annelida and very likely are an autapomorphy of this group.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The heart‐kidney of Saccoglossus kowalevskii , which is situated within the anterior preoral proboscis coelom (protocoel), consists of the stomochord, pericardium, heart sinus, and glomerulus. The stomochord, a diverticulum of the gut, is characterized by vacuolated epithelial cells surrounded by basal lamina and connective tissue. The pericardium, a myoepithelium, lies dorsal to the central heart sinus. Opening into the protocoel and connecting with the outside via the proboscis pore is the protocoel duct, which is, in part, composed of multiciliated absorptive epithelial cells. Perfusion of the dorsal trunk vessel with vital dyes reveals a rapid flow of blood into the glomerular blood vessels. Examination of the permeability characteristics of the extracellular matrix underlying the glomerular podocytes reveals the movement of iron dextran (mol. wt 5000 daltons) from the central heart sinus into the protocoel. Iron dextran uptake by glomerular cells and protocoel lining cells is demonstrated. These results suggest that vascular fluid is filtered by the glomerulus, producing a primary urine in the protocoel which may be modified as it passes over the peritoneum, through the protocoel duct, and out of the proboscis pore. New data concerning the morphology of the stomochord are presented. The controversial homology between the hemichordate stomochord and the chordate notochord is addressed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The presence of osteoderms within the integument, forming a carapace, is one of the most distinctive features of armadillos with the external morphology of these elements forming the basis of most systematic schemes. This is especially true for fossil taxa, where these elements are most frequent in the palaeontological record. A detailed study of osteoderms from the cephalic shield and different regions of the dorsal armour of Chaetophractus villosus (Euphractinae, Xenarthra) was made and compared to those of the extant genus Dasypus (Dasypodinae, Xenarthra), and the extinct genus † Eutatus . Three distinct histological zones were recognized: outer and inner zones are thin, formed by regular compact bone, the middle zone is thicker, with large cavities that contain mainly adipose tissue, hair follicles, and sweat and sebaceous glands. The internal structure of † Eutatus (also a member of Euphractinae) osteoderms is close to that of C. villosus , consistent with the notion that these taxa are phylogenetically closely related. In contrast, Dasypus shows marked differences. Dasypus shows hair follicles associated with both gland types (sweat and sebaceous) and connected to foramina on the external surface. Although not observed in adult C. villosus , it has been documented during embryonic development, only to atrophy later in ontogeny. Furthermore, the presence of red bone marrow is rare in C. villosus , but widespread in Dasypus novemcinctus osteoderms. These results suggest an early split of both subfamilies and support the hypothesis that the Euphractinae are more derived than the Dasypodinae.",

The bone histology of osteoderms in temnospondyl amphibians and in the chroniosuchian Bystrowiella . — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 96–114 Bone histology of osteoderms in the armoured temnospondyl Peltobatrachus , plagiosaurids ( Gerrothorax , Plagiosuchus ) and dissorophids ( Aspidosaurus , Cacops , Platyhystrix ), as well as in the chroniosuchian Bystrowiella , is studied. The massive osteoderms of Peltobatrachus and Gerrothorax consist of homogeneous parallel‐fibred bone, whereas in dissorophids, a lightly built, trabecular middle region is mantled by a thin cortex that is composed of a plywood‐type structure. In Bystrowiella and Plagiosuchus , the osteoderms consist to a large degree of interwoven primary fibres and have cell lacunae that bear stumpy canaliculi. The differences in the histological structure of dissorophids and plagiosaurids suggest an iterative evolution of osteoderms. Furthermore, histology in Plagiosuchus indicates a metaplastic development of the osteoderms, whereas the osteoderms of Gerrothorax represent periosteal ossifications as in dissorophids. This suggests a convergent origin of osteoderms also within plagiosaurids. The extensive armour in Gerrothorax probably constituted a calcium reservoir, indicated by cyclical resorption events preserved in the external cortex and interpreted as a physiological response to periodic changes in salinity of the aquatic environment. In contrast, the unique osteoderm structure of dissorophids provides maximum stability and minimum bone mass, and is coherent with the interpretation that the osteoderms served to strengthen the vertebral column during terrestrial locomotion.",

Here we tackle this problem for the family Mussidae, which is polyphyletic. Most of its members belong to two molecular clades composed of: (1) Atlantic Mussidae and Faviidae (except Montastraea ) and (2) Pacific Mussidae ( Cynarina , Lobophyllia , Scolymia , Symphyllia ) and Pectiniidae. Other Pacific mussids (e.g. Acanthastrea ) belong to additional clades. To discover new characters that would better serve as phylogenetic markers, we compare the skeletal morphology of mussid genera in different molecular‐based clades. Three sets of characters are considered: (1) macromorphology (budding; colony form; size and shape of corallites; numbers of septal cycles), (2) micromorphology (shapes and distributions of septal teeth and granules), and (3) microstructure (arrangement of calcification centres and thickening deposits within costosepta). Although most traditional macromorphological characters exhibit homoplasy, several new micromorphological characters are effective at distinguishing clades, including the shapes and distribution of septal teeth and granules, the area between teeth, and the development of thickening deposits. Arrangements of calcification centres and fibres differ among clades, but the fine‐scale structure of thickening deposits does not.",

The route of the water current through the olfactory organ and the different driving forces of the ventilation process are subject to discussion. In both the pelagic dogfish and the bottom‐dwelling catshark the pressure difference between the incurrent and excurrent nostrils achieved by active swimming appears to be the driving force, whereas the role of the beating of the non‐sensory cilia is not evident.

Ossification patterns of these embryos suggest that they died during the final third of their development. The therizinosauroid identity of the embryos follows from: (1) an edentulous premaxilla with a sharp downturned edge; (2) dentary with a lateral shelf; (3) teeth with fan-shaped crowns, with a few marginal cusps; (4) humerus with a massive deltopectoral crest extending proximally, with a pointed proximomedial tuberosity; (5) ilium with an expanded and hooked preacetabular process; (6) strongly curved hypertrophied manual unguals tapering to sharp points. These embryos are closest to two Chinese therizinosauroids, Neimongosaurus yangi Zhang et al. 2001 and Erliansaurus bellamanus Xu et al. 2002. An elongated narial opening, reduced basipterygoid process, low cervical neural spines, a transversely narrow pubic apron, and a pubic foot expanded anteriorly are found in these embryos and are synapomorphies uniting the Therizinosauroidea and the Oviraptorosauria. Fusion of cervical and caudal neural arches and centra, complete ossification of thoracic ribs and ilium, possible co-ossification of tibia and fibula, fused pubes, complete meta- and acropodial elements, together with small portions of unossified epiphyses of long bones suggest an advanced precociality of these embryos.",

    "abstract": "Regional variations of cone density, cone types and cone mosaic were investigated by light microscopy in yolk sac fry, parr and adults of salmon (Salmo salar) and trout (Salmo trutta trutta) and related to the feeding habits of different stages. The retinal organization of the two species is similar, as are their feeding habits. In parr and adults of both species a region with high cone density was found in the ventro-temporal part of the retina. The lowest values of cone density were found centrally in the dorsal half of the retina. An increase in cone density towards the ora serrata was noted in all retinae investigated. There is a good agreement between the density distribution of the cones in parr of salmon and trout and their feeding habits. The parr feed to a great extent on the invertebrate drift. Facing the current, the parr search the water region in front and above themselves for food organisms, thereby probably making use of the ventro-temporal area of high cone density. The connection between the cone density distribution and the feeding habits is less clear in adult salmon and trout, but the high cone density region is probably used when they feed on surface organisms and schooling prey. The ecological significance of cone types and cone mosaics is discussed. During growth there was a change of the cone mosaic from a regular square pattern in the fry towards a less regular square or row pattern in the adults. The position of regions with high and low cone density did not change during development in each species and had a similar distribution in the two species. On the other hand, the range of cone density values becomes relatively greater as the animal grows older. The cone density distribution seems to be more homogeneous in parr than in adults. Differences in the relative density distribution of the cones are influenced by recruitment at the retinal periphery and by spreading out of existing cells. In addition to the ora serrata, mitoses were also observed in more central parts of the retina having well-differentiated receptors and a cone mosaic. Mitoses were noted in all three nuclear layers but were most frequent in the outer nuclear layer, in which the resulting cells probably differentiate into rods. Undifferentiated zones similar to the peripheral growth zone of the retina were found on both sides of the falciform process in fry. In parr and adults an undifferentiated zone persisted only on the temporal side. It probably contributes to the high cone density in the ventro-temporal part of the retina by a delivery of new cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fin rays, scutes or ridge scales, and fulcra have been traditionally interpreted as modified scales, but their diversity has been almost ignored. Based on results presented here, revised definitions of these elements are provided. At least two patterns of basal fulcra are found in actinopterygians: in Pattern I all or most basal fulcra are paired elements, whereas in Pattern II, a series of unpaired basal fulcra that are bifurcated proximally, and whose forking gradually becomes larger caudad, are followed by a series of paired elements. Basal fulcra are commonly present on unpaired fins of lower actinopterygians, including basal neopterygians. Among living fish they are absent in polypteriforms, Amia and teleosts. Fringing fulcra are always paired. Three patterns of fringing fulcra series are described: the series of fringing fulcra in basal actinopterygians is formed by expanded terminal segments of marginal lepidotrichia (Pattern A). Another series is formed by a combination of slightly expanded or modified terminal segments of rays and independent spiny, small elements (Pattern B). The third series is formed of small, spiny ossified elements positioned along the leading marginal fin ray(s) (Pattern C). Other patterns of basal and fringing fulcra remain to be investigated, along with their phylogenetic implications.",

On the head morphology of Phyllium and the phylogenetic relationships of Phasmatodea (Insecta). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00 : 1–16. External and internal head structures of Phyllium siccifolium are described in detail. The findings are compared with conditions found in other phasmatodeans and members of other neopteran lineages. The compiled 125 characters were analysed cladistically. A clade Eukinolabia (Phasmatodea + Embioptera) was confirmed. Synapomorphies of these two taxa are the shift of the origin of M. tentorioparaglossalis to the hind margin of the prementum, the presence of M. tentorioscapalis medialis, and antennal muscles that originate exclusively on the anterior tentorial arms. Within Eukinolabia, the position of Timema remains somewhat ambiguous because of missing anatomical data. However, it was confirmed as sister group of Euphasmatodea in a monophyletic Phasmatodea. Apomorphic groundplan features of Euphasmatodea are salivary ducts with separate external openings, apically rounded glossae, the presence of the galealobulus, and the reduction of the antennifer. The monophyly of Neophasmatidae was confirmed. Autapomorphies are the loss of M. frontobuccalis posterior, the anteriorly or dorsally directed maxillary palps, and the reduction of the mandibular incisivi. The analysis of characters of the head yielded three new autapomorphies of Phylliinae, the presence of a protuberance on the attachment site of the dorsal tentorial arms, dorsoventrally flattened maxillary‐ and labial palps, and possibly the narrow and U‐shaped field of trichomes on the apical part of the galea.",

We here investigate the cranial shape of 171 representatives of the turtle lineage and the relationship of shape to different habitat and diet preferences using two‐dimensional geometric morphometrics. The skull shape of extant turtles correlates with both ecological proxies, but is more affected by habitat than diet. However, the application of these correlations to extinct turtles produces mostly flawed results, as least when compared to external data such as sedimentary environment, highlighting that the morphospace held by extant turtles is not necessarily the optimal location in tree space for a particular ecology. The inability of this study to correctly predict the ecology of extinct turtles is likely related to the fact that the shape of turtle skulls is dominated by the emarginations and jaw closure mechanisms, two shape features unrelated to habitat or feeding ecology. This indicates that various specializations that are apparent in the skull only contribute little to overall shape.",

Although this implies a uniform meaning, the term has in fact been used to address immatures with very different characteristics. For providing more precise reference how the term larva is applied in a specific context, I outline here different criteria that have been used to identify an immature as a larva. These include larvae that (a) differ morphologically from their adult (morpho‐larva s. l.); (b) differ morphologically from their adult and additionally possess structures that become reduced during ontogeny (morpho‐larva s. str.); (c) have a different ecological niche than their adult (eco‐larva s. l.); (d) have a different ecological niche than their adult and additionally fulfil a dispersal function (eco‐larva s. str.); (e) transform by a metamorphosis to the non‐larval immature or adult (metamorph‐larva); (f) differ from the adult by having evolved new structures in the early stages (apo‐larva); (g) differ from the adult as the adult has evolved new structures (plesio‐larva). The differentiation of these criteria will provide a more precise reference reducing possible misunderstanding and allowing a more precise communication.",

In the Xingu River basin, Pará, Brazil, the species is found from its middle portion up to the confluence with the Amazon River. This extensive distribution led to questions about the influence of the Volta Grande do Xingu rapids on genetic diversification between populations above and below this area. To explore this hypothesis, 39 mitochondrial gene sequences (COI and 16S rRNA) from 22 samples collected from both areas were analysed in a phylogeographic context. Bayesian Inference and haplotype networks revealed at least two genetically distinct lineages of S. pictus in the Xingu River. The resulting genetic structure found within these populations raised questions about the taxonomic cohesion of the taxon and the potential existence of cryptic species that warrant further investigation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular study on the genetic structure of a Sylviocarcinus species from the Amazon basin. Given the novelty and the underestimated diversity in this region, we advocate for additional studies on morphological and taxonomic approaches about this taxon to contribute to a future understanding of the evolutionary history of the genus.",

Freshwater chelonians (Testudines) are bioindicators of environmental pollution because of their longevity, ecological diversity, and trophic positioning. This systematic review assessed toxic metal bioaccumulation in freshwater turtles across the American continent, focusing on mercury (Hg), a global public health and ecological concern. A comprehensive search on PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science identified 620 papers, of which 32 met the inclusion criteria. The United States and Brazil (93.6%) contributed the most data, with Chelydra serpentina and Podocnemis expansa frequently studied, followed by Canada (4.26%) and Colombia (2.13%). Hg was the predominant contaminant (75% of studies), with the highest concentrations observed in hatchlings and keratinized tissues, such as carapace and claws. Bioaccumulation patterns varied by region, species and life stage, emphasizing physiological and reproductive impacts. This review highlights the need for noninvasive sampling methods and long‐term monitoring to guide conservation strategies and assess ecosystem and turtle health. It also highlights the significant lack of data in South America and the lack of studies on juveniles and eggs. Freshwater chelonians remain essential for understanding contamination dynamics and mitigating environmental degradation in aquatic habitats.",

Castericystis sprinklei belongs to the dexiothete stem group. The history of the echinoderm stem group is reconstructed. Chordate bilateral symmetry evolved by six successive steps. Tail–head overlap occurred independently in craniates and acraniates. The neural crest would have existed in the latest common ancestor of extant chordates, or even earlier. Gross asymmetries occur in extant chordates in organs derived from the calcichordate head, but not in those derived from the calcichordate tail. The anterior boundary of hox gene expression in vertebrates corresponds to the anterior end of the calcichordate tail. Left–right organ pairing (an important step in the origin of chordate bilateral symmetry) may have involved the interaction of a symmetrizing morphogen, produced from the anterior end of the tail, with a lateral morphogen (Wilhelmi's morphogen), produced in ontogeny at first from the left and later from the right. This mechanism may still act in the metamorphosis of amphioxus and in mirror‐imaging in vertebrate twins. Wilhelmi's morphogen may be related to one or more members of the dorsal cascade of Drosophila.",

Our emphasis is on a scanning electron microscope analysis (SEM) of the involved trophic structures in spore‐feeding larvae and adults of the Ptiliidae, Leiodidae and Staphylinidae, describing the fine structure of their main functional elements. Functionally, mouthpart structures resemble brushes, brooms, combs, rakes, rasps, excavators, knives, thorns, cram‐brushes, bristle troughs, blocks and differently structured grinding surfaces. Their different involvement in the various aspects of the feeding process (i.e. food gathering, transporting, channelling and grinding) is deduced from our SEM analyses plus direct video observations. We infer five different patterns of food transport and processing, discriminating adults of ptiliids, leiodids plus staphylinids (excluding some aleocharines), several aleocharine staphylinids, and the larvae of leiodids and staphylinids. The structural diversity of the mouthparts increases in the order from (1) Ptiliidae, (2) Leiodidae towards (3) Staphylinidae, reflecting the increasing systematic and ecological diversity of these groups. Comparisons with non‐spore‐feeders show that among major lineages of staphylinoids, shifts from general microphagy to sporophagy are not necessarily constrained by, nor strongly reflected in, mouthpart morphology. Nevertheless, in several of these lineages the organs of food intake and grinding have experienced particular fine‐structural modifications, which have undergone convergent evolution, probably in response to specialized mycophagy such as spore‐feeding. These modifications involve advanced galeal rakes, galeal or lacinial ‘spore brushes’ with arrays of stout bristles, reinforced obliquely ventrad orientated prosthecal lobes and the differentiations of the molar grinding surfaces into stout teeth or tubercles. In addition, several staphylinids of the tachyporine and oxyteline groups with reduced mandibular molae have evolved secondary trituration surfaces, which in some aleocharines are paralleled by considerable re‐constructions of the labium–hypopharynx.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Problems concerning terminology and relationships of basement membranes to extracellular matrices (ECMs) and connective tissue systems in invertebrates are discussed, and recommendations regarding nomenclature are presented. It is suggested to use ‘basal matrix’ as a comprehensive term for various basal ECM structures, and apply the term ‘basement membrane’ (BM) for a unique ECM structure that is fully resolved only by electron microscopy and as a general and descriptive word in both light microscopy, biochemistry and electron microscopy. When possible and relevant it is recommended to apply the subdivisions: ‘lamina lucida’, ‘lamina densa’ (= ‘basal lamina’) and ‘lamina fibroreticularis’ (sometimes missing). A brief and non‐technical account of the recent concepts of BM macromolecules and their assembly is given, based on mammalian models. Basement membranes probably first appeared in cnidarians, and from then on became obligatory ECM structures. It is emphasized that this event was crucial for evolution of the multicellular state, and for construction and morphogenesis of tissues and organs. Lower worms, such as turbellarians and nemertines, display the most varied and complex basal matrices. First, in annelids, complete correlation between BM structure and composition has been demonstrated, with isolation and consecutive localization of basement‐specific molecules such as, for example, collagen IV and laminin. Both in arthropods, especially insects, and echinoderms, the introduction of modern techniques corresponding to those used in mammalian BM research has now given equally valid results. An interesting and fundamental outcome of the reviewed work on invertebrate BMs is the realization of the early evolution of BM components. Macromolecules such as laminin, collagen IV and fibronectin are highly conserved, but with fine modulations, and in lower invertebrates they may exist without being assembled into true BM structures. Laminin and fibronectin are expressed with certainty in cnidarians, and fibronectin possibly already in sponges.",

These organs, situated dorsally on the carapace were, with few exceptions, always found in two anterior and three posterior pairs. The lattice organ morphology displayed by the Ascothoracida, a seta–like structure with a terminal pore, is believed to be the most plesiomorphic condition. Within the Cirripedia lattice organ morphology varied from types resembling the Ascothoracida in the Acrothoracica and the lepadomorph Capitulum mitella , to an elongate pore field with a larger terminal pore in most Thoracica and Rhizocephala. Akentrogonid Rhizocephala seem to display the most apomorphic condition. While lattice organ morphology was generally constant at the family level, cases were seen where closely related species such as Chthamalus stellatus and Chthamalus montagui showed minor, but clear cut differences. Lattice organs in 2 + 3 pairs are argued to represent a synapomorphy for the Ascothoracida and the Cirripedia. The results confirm that the cyprid morphology at the ultrastructural level will prove to be of high value in estimating phylogeny within the Cirripedia.",

The late larva exhibits a prominent apical organ connected to the ‘cerebral’ commissure of large cerebral ganglia, which supply the paired frontal organ. From the cerebral ganglia two paired nerve cords project backwards, closely resembling the tetraneuralian pattern of basal molluscs. In addition, a neural ring supplying the prototroch is present. The epidermis is composed of myoepithelial cells. Dorsally its cuticle is covered by granules of unknown composition. The prototroch consists of two ciliary rings; a downstream collecting system is not present. Although there is a one‐way gut with a lumen throughout, the larva obviously does not feed. A single pair of protonephridia is present. The foot sole shares distinct similarities with basic molluscs, particularly with those of the aplacophoran Solenogastres: The anterior part shows a huge, subepidermal pedal gland and several bundles of cirri consisting of compound cilia. The posterior part is ciliated with intraepithelial mucous cells interspersed. The dorsoventral muscle fibres show the mollusc‐like ventral intercrossing. The present results and previous findings, in particular the chitinous, non‐moulted cuticle, the sinus circulatory system, and a number of neural features shared by Kamptozoa and Mollusca, provide substantial evidence for a direct sister‐group relationship between these phyla. In addition, the basal position of the Solenogastres (Neomeniomorpha) within the Mollusca is corroborated.",

Using a single Gompertz growth curve, asymptotic values obtained for TBL were 211.6 cm and 197.4 cm for males and females, respectively. Asymptotic lengths were attained at 11 years in males and 9 years in females. The gestation period was estimated to last approximately 11.5 months.

Most conspicuous is the subepidermal membrane complex (SMC), and the major part of the ECM is present in this structure, which consists of a limiting basal lamina on each side of a central thick filamentous layer, probably of a collagenous nature. Distinct anchoring filaments are found as part of the SMC. A basal lamina is also observed in connection with the gastrodermal cells. The mesoderm is represented by a loose, ill‐defined parenchyma, without filaments. The SMC is discussed in relation to subepidermal basal matrices occurring in turbellarians and enteropneusts, the two groups to which a relationship to Xenoturbella previously has been suggested. Comparisons between the ECM in Xenoturbella and in turbellarians do not support the notion of a relationship between these groups. Conversely, the present study strengthens previous indications of distinct similarities between certain characteristics of the epidermis and the SMC present in both enteropneusts and in Xenoturbella.",

Only a single cell, also recognizable in the unsettled cypris, is injected into the host, while the rest of the kentrogon degenerates after invasion. The speed of kentrogen development and much of the kentrogon anatomy can be interpreted as a defense against host crab grooming.

The sense organs of the two species are quite different in outer cuticular morphology, but the inner cellular parts are constructed after the same model: the arthropod sensory setae. All investigated sensilla contained ciliary structures. Regeneration of the cirri during moult is very similar to the regeneration process in insects and spiders, but in the two arthrotardigrades the trichogen cell is not retracted from the cuticular part of the setae after moult. The clava is presumed to be olfactory; the cephalic cirri and the leg spines are contact chemoreceptors with one mechanoreceptive cilium terminating at the sensillum shaft. Cirrus E is compared with the trichobothrium of arthropods and the phylogenetic implications of the investigated structures are discussed.",

Ultrastructural features of the process of wound healing after tail and limb amputation in lizard.— Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 306–318 Wound healing and re‐epitelization after amputation of tail and limb in lizard have been studied by electron microscopy to understand the cytological base of immunity to infection in this species. After 2 days post‐amputation in both limb and tail stumps, numerous granulocytes are accumulated over the stump, and participate to the formation of the scab. Bacteria remain confined to the scab or are engulfed by leukocytes and migrating keratinocytes located underneath the scab. Bacteria are degraded within lysosomes present in these cells and are not observed among mesenchymal cells or in blood vessels of the regenerative blastema. Granulocytes, migrating keratinocytes, and later macrophages form an effective barrier responsible for limiting microbe penetration. The innate immunity in lizard is very effective in natural (dirty) condition and impedes the spreading of infection to inner tissues. While the complete re‐epitelization of the tail stump underneath the scab requires 4–7 days, the same process in the limb requires 8–18 or more days post‐amputation, depending from the level of amputation and the persistence of a protruding humerus or femurs on the stump surface. This delay produces the permanence of inflammatory cells such as granulocytes and macrophages in the limb stump for a much longer period than in the tail stump, a process that stimulates scarring.",

Characters from fossils have been viewed as less informative or more subjective than comparable information from extant taxa. However, fossils are often the only known representatives of many higher taxa, including some of the earliest forms, and have been important in determining character polarity and filling morphological gaps. Here we evaluate the influence of fossils on the interpretation of character evolution by comparing estimates of ancestral body size in fishes (non‐tetrapod craniates) from two large and previously unpublished datasets; a palaeontological dataset representing all principal clades from throughout the Phanerozoic, and a macroecological dataset for all 515 families of living (Recent) fishes. Ancestral size was estimated from phylogenetically based (i.e. parsimony) optimization methods. Ancestral size estimates obtained from analysis of extant fish families are five to eight times larger than estimates using fossil members of the same higher taxa. These disparities arise from differential survival of large‐bodied members of early branching lineages, and are not statistical or taphonomic artefacts. Estimates of ancestral size obtained from a limited but judicious selection of fossil fish taxa are more accurate than estimates from a complete dataset of extant fishes.",

All blood cells seem to have a common origin from the hemoblast, which is an undifferentiated cell with large nucleus, prominent nucleolus and cytoplasm filled with ribosomes. At least two kinds of granulocyte (microgranular and macro‐granular amoebocyte) are recognizable on the basis of granule size. Furthermore, the microgranular amoebocyte contains small vesicles, glycogen and peripheral bundles of microfilaments. The macrogranular amoebocyte displays a well developed RER formed by elongated cisterns that contain a finely granular material and swell to form large sac‐like structures. Specialized amoebocytes (macrophages) can phagocytize cell fragments and entire cells, thus forming large necrotic masses. The morula cell is characterized by large vacuoles in which are strongly electron dense masses that contain iron, as revealed by X‐ray microanalysis. Both young and mature morula cells are described and the probable formation of the masses from the Golgi complex is suggested. The nephrocyte (purinic cell) shows very few giant vacuoles containing numerous granules, mostly electron lucent and often of geometric form, that are presumably the same as the refringent granules visible in vivo.",

These nerves, running from the anterior margin of the brain to the frontal edge of the animals, are found to contain the dendrites of three types of morphologically different sensory neurons. The first unit consists of two dendrites (distinguished by their myelinization) leading to two small hairs on the front. Their detailed structure was not investigated. The second unit consists of a few large dendrites ending in branching cilia. The latter are surrounded by a specialized glial cell. The ciliary branches are regularly sized and arranged. The third unit consists of c . 17 dendrites ending with cilia at the cuticle. The cilia are split into irregular branches which are buried in modified epidermal cells which, in the case of Calanus , are connected with cuticular pores. By analogy with other presumed chemosensory organs in the Arthropoda, the second and the third unit are considered, on a morphological basis, to be chemoreceptors. The second unit receives internal stimuli. Because it resembles other X‐organs in the Crustacea, all X‐organs could have the same function. The third unit is thought of as receiving external stimuli.",

The hemichordates are perhaps closer to the echinoderms than to the chordates, but these groups appear to have been derived from a bilaterally symmetrical dipleurula ancestor, not from a sessile pterobranch‐like form. The origin of the chordates is speculative but the idea of a prototunicate stage is rejected. The tunicate is viewed as a highly modified end product, with fewer similarities to the ancestral form than amphioxus. Amphioxus is quite suggestive of the vertebrate, yet it is more like the tunicate in the details of its embryology and along with that rather extreme peripheral group is best thought of as constituting a subphylum, the Acraniata. The idea of the early vertebrate as a filter feeder must be rejected since it is assumed here that perfection of that function led to a sessile or inactive way of life (as in the acraniates or lamprey larva) and failed to lead to the active creature with highly developed sensory, neural, and locomotor systems identified here as the protovertebrate. Further, the muscular plastic pharynx and moveable mouth of the protovertebrate suggest feeding on larger organisms, predation, and the abandonment of ciliary water‐current feeding.",

Sea urchins (Echinoidea) have evolved a diverse array of jawed appendages termed pedicellariae to deter pests and predators. Pedicellarial structure and function are reviewed and their distribution mapped in 75 extant genera. Using a phylogeny of echinoids at family level constructed from 353 skeletal characters scored across 162 extant and fossil taxa, the evolution of pedicellarial form and function is reconstructed. For much of the Palaeozoic echinoids possessed a very restricted pedicellarial armament. By the early Mesozoic a diverse array of pedicellarial types had become established, implying that the threat from predators and pests markedly increased at this time. Since the Triassic, echinoids have continued to improve their defensive capability by evolving more effective venom delivery in globiferous pedicellariae, developing spatulate‐tips and curved blades for a more efficient grab in tridentate pedicellariae, and stouter, more robust valves with a stronger bite in ophicephalous pedicellariae to disable and remove ectoparasites. However, pedicellarial types are shown to be particularly prone to subsequent secondary loss, especially among infaunal echinoids, and thus have higher homoplasy levels than other phylogenetically useful skeletal structures.",

The natural surfaces exploited by these lizards may be rough, undulant and unpredictable and therefore likely provide only limited, patchy areas for adhesive contact. Here, we examine the microtopography of rock surfaces used by seven species of R hoptropus and compare this to several rough and smooth artificial surfaces employed in previous studies of gekkotan adhesion. These data are considered in relation to the form, configuration, compliance and functional morphology of the setal fields of these species. Our results demonstrate that natural rock surfaces are rough and unpredictable at the scale of the setal arrays, with equal amounts of variation existing within and between the various types of rock surfaces examined. Such surfaces differ from smooth and rough artificial surfaces in the proportion of surface area available for attachment and the relative predictability of surface undulance. Generally, setal field characteristics of individual species are not relatable to specific substrates, but instead are configured to allow for sufficient attachment to a wide variety of unpredictable surfaces. Our findings provide insight into the evolution and microanatomy of the adhesive system of gekkotan lizards and its adaptive relationship to topographically unpredictable surfaces.",

The human nervous system is unable to regenerate after an insult, or due to senility, while low vertebrates still exhibit this ability. Comparative neurobiology can increase knowledge about neuronal degeneration and regeneration. Anamni vertebrates retain the ability to regenerate up to large areas of the nervous system. The regenerative ability of central nervous system components depends on the phylogenetic distance between classes of vertebrates. It decreases during evolution. Teleosts can skilfully regenerate brain, spinal cord and retina. Amphibians and reptiles can only regenerate certain areas; spinal cord regeneration in reptiles is limited to axonal regrowth. Retina regeneration is possible in bird embryo but not in the adult. In this review, we analyse how the regeneration of neurons occurs in different classes of vertebrates, and how the study of these mechanisms could be applied to the search for new therapies for neurodegenerative disorders.",

Copulatory mechanism in Holocnemus pluchei and Pholcus opilionoides , with notes on male cheliceral apophyses and stridulatory organs in Pholcidae (Araneae).— Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 76: 291–300. The pholcid spiders Holocnemus pluchei (Scopoli, 1763) and Pholcus opilionoides (Schrank, 1781) are investigated with respect to functional morphology of their genital organs using freeze‐fixation of spiders during copula in liquid nitrogen and subsequent preparation of histological serial sections of the copulatory organs in functional contact. Special attention is paid to the mode of male pedipalpal arrestation before copulation, which is achieved in two quite different ways: in Pholcus by contact of the lateral cheliceral apophysis with the pedipalpal trochanter‐apophysis, in Holocnemus by locking the pedipalpal trochanter between chelicera and pedipalpal coxa. The condition in Pholcus is considered to be apomorphic and to present a synapomorphy of about a dozen genera for which the name “ Pholcus ‐group” is proposed. The stridulatory apparatus of Holocnemus pluchei is described, its biological significance discussed and an overview of accounts on stridulation in Pholcidae given.",

The evolution of dorsal respiratory fields with a weakly wrinkled surface occurred at least six times within the Crinocheta. In five of these cases, a further development can be observed. The evolution of a partly covered respiratory field with strongly wrinkled surface may have taken place six times. It is assumed that completely internalized lungs with spiracles surrounded by a water‐repellent surface microsculpture, evolved at least six times independently within the Oniscidea: in the Tylidae, Actaecia , Aphiloscia , the Eubelidae, the Armadillidae and in a taxon probably comprising Porcellionidae plus Armadillidiidae.",

Adult dinophilids and the dorvilleid larva exhibit the same structure of the ventral nerve cord, with two main nerves spaced far apart, one median and two paramedian nerves. A serotonergic plexus is situated between the paramedian nerve pair, above the ventral locomotory ciliary band. These similarities between adults and larva corroborate the presumed progenetic origin of dinophilids. However, since larval nervous systems of other polychaete taxa also seem to be organized in this way, this result cannot support the view that dinophilids originate from dorvilleids. In P. psammophilus the main nerve cords are widely separated only in the last segment, indicating that this pattern may be correlated with the absence of parapodia. The unpaired median nerve of dinophilids, P. psammophilus and many other polychaetes, is considered to be part of the basic annelid body plan. The ground pattern of the ventral paired dinophilid ganglia is represented by three (anterior, main, posterior) commissures, conserved in most of the ganglia in the Dinophilus species and mostly reduced to a main commissure in the Trilobodrilus species. The dinophilid species and P. psammophilus possess six pairs of ganglia indicating six trunk segments – in contrast to former views. The two rings behind the prostomium in both the dinophilid and the dorvilleid species contain one pair of ganglia only, corroborating the presumed homology of this peristomial region in the two taxa. The Dinophilus nervous system with 12 longitudinal nerves and three perpendicular nerve rings per segment resembles orthogonal nervous structures characteristic of platyhelminths.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The embryonic and larval development of the Polypteriformes, the presumed sister group of all other living actinopterygians, is poorly known. The main reason is the scarcity of successful breedings in captivity and therefore the lack of developmental series of any one polypterid species. A series of five successful breedings of P. senegalus now makes it possible to define developmental stages of this species based on numerous closely timed specimens. The staging given here focuses on external embryonic and larval features: epidermal surface structures documented by SEM, colour pattern, development of fins and squamation, larval feeding and locomotory behaviour. The development of P. senegalus is characterized by a long free embryonic phase. Suction feeding is performed from the beginning of larval life (apterolarval phase). The pectoral fins start to become employed for slow locomotion and as supportive structures at around the same time. Olfactorily guided prey capture, however, is observed later in the pterolarval phase. Quantitative kinematic data also demonstrate a change in the mode of undulatory locomotion during this phase. Sustained axial undulation becomes confined to the posterior abdominal and caudal region of the body. At about the same time the paraxial high frequency undulation of the pectoral fin fold is replaced by the characteristic propeller‐like movement of much greater amplitude and wavelength. Surfacing for aerial breathing is not seen before a marked change in colouration has taken place at the beginning of the juvenile period. The external gills slowly become reduced during this period. The definitions of larval and juvenile stages given here may advance understanding of developmental processes in the ontogeny of these primitive actinopterygians, and may serve as a tool for comparison with the ontogeny of Tetrapoda and Dipnoi, as well as to that of some “primitive” groups of Actinopterygii. Judging from its distribution among extant taxa, embryonic and larval ciliation is a character that most probably belongs to the grundplan ‡ of Osteognathostomata. Phylogenetic evaluation is not so clear for the two other prominent embryonic and larval specializations found in Polypterus : upper labial attachment glands and opercular external gills. © 1997 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Two conspicuous pore plates serve as exits for glandular secretion that gets discharged into the uterus externus. The secretion accumulates close to the pore plates and to some extent in the region of the heavily sclerotized valve that separates the uterus externus from the uterus internus. During copulation, the male transfers spermatozoa and male secretions into the female genital tract where they are embedded and stored in the female secretion. As Ph. phalangioides does not possess any separate sperm storage organs such as receptacula seminis, the glandular secretion serves to store and fix the sperm mass in a specific position within the uterus externus itself.",

In both sexes, three types of sensilla chaetica, two types of sensilla trichodea, five types of sensilla basiconica, one type of sensilla coeloconica, one type of sensilla campaniformia and Böhm sensilla were distinguished. The possible function of the sensilla was discussed and three types of sensilla were considered as olfactory, sensilla trichodea type 2 and sensilla basiconica types 1 and 2. Olfactory sensilla occupy dorsal and/or ventral areas of the flagellomeres and occur sparsely (sensilla basiconica type 1) or not at all (sensilla basiconica type 2 and sensilla trichodea type 2) outside these areas. No remarkable sexual differences in the types, numbers and distribution of antennal sensilla were found.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cypris morphology in the Rhizocephala differs both between the sexes of individual species and between the species. The large aesthetasc on the third antennular segment is unique to male cyprids of the Lernaeodiscidae, Peltogasteridae and Sacculinidae (suborder Kentrogonida) and Mycetomorpha vancouverensis (suborder Akentrogonida). A fourth segmental aesthetasc, common to both sexes, is much longer in males than in females. A spinous process on the attachment disc is another male‐specific character, but is absent altogether in the Lernaeodiscidae. It is argued that these aesthetascs help locate the settlement targets. Except in Mycetomorpha vancourverensis , aesthetascs have been secondarily lost in cyprids of the suborder Akentrogonida, and there are no other morphological means for separating the male and female settling stage. In cyprids of Sylon hippolytes (Sylonidae) and of Mycetomorpha vancouverensis and Thompsonia sp. (Akentrogonidae) the long and slender antennules are probably used in penetration without formation of a kentrogon, as already reported for Clistosaccus paguri (Clistosaccidae). Cyprids of Sylon hippolytes and Clistosaccus paguri are almost morphologically identical.",

They are described here for 26 species in 16 families. The folds consist of ciliated cells, usually associated with gland cells, and have no intrinsic muscular system. Protraction of the dorsolateral folds to make contact with the substratum during uptake of food is mainly achieved by contractions of the musculature of the body wall in the anterior part of the body. These folds either occur alone or are associated with a ventral pharyngeal organ. Dorsolateral ciliated folds are structures originally adapted to microphagy. From the present study and the literature it is obvious that these structures are widespread among polychaetes of various taxa. This distribution and their similar structure suggest that dorsolateral folds are phylogenetically old structures which might already have been present in the stem species of polychaetes.",

The sexes are separate among the zooids of a colony, but a given colony may contain females and males. In zooids of either sex the single gonad is associated with a large haemal sinus in the trunk sac and is displaced laterally (to the right or to the left). The wall of the gonad is composed of three layers: an outer metasomal peritoneum, an internal lining of germinal epithelium and an intervening genital haemal sinus. The mature gametes lie in the lumen within the gonad. The spermatozoon is characterized by an elongate nucleus, no obvious acrosome, a long mitochondrial filament in a midpiece appendix and a single flagellum with a 9+2 axoneme. Females brood 200 μm eggs and embryos in their distinctive, basally coiled tubes. The yolky eggs undergo radial cleavage and develop into ciliated, lecithotrophic, oblong larvae (400 μm in length) that are characterized by: (1) yellow coloration peppered with black pigment spots; (2) a deep ventral depression; (3) a posterior adhesive organ; (4) an anterior apical sensory organ; (5) an evenly ciliated epitdermis. The ventral depression is not invaginating endoderm, but is instead a glandular epithelium that evidently secretes the larval cocoon and the adult tube. Internally, the peritoneum of the coelomic cavities begins to split from the periphery of a large, central mass of yolky mesenchyme cells. The larva swims using cilia, but also undergoes contractions, evidently powered by the peritoneal cells, which constitute a myoepithelium. The discussion considers pterobranch affinities with other deuterostomes and with lophophorates.",

The giant axons of Aglantha show no Fa‐IR. The cnidothylaces of Proboscidactyla contain neurons reacting with antisera to FMRFamide and APP. Present evidence suggests that in hydromedusae Fa‐IR is confined to distinct subsets of neurons. These appear to be either sensory units or units supplying smooth muscles, but they are not involved in the innervation of striated muscles.",

Size at sexual maturity was determined according to three criteria: morphometric (change in the relative growth of reproductive characters), histological (first maturation of gonads) and functional (capability to mate and carry eggs). Regarding females, morphometric maturity occurred at a carapace length (CL) of 11.50 mm, considering abdomen width as a reproductive character. Gonad maturity of females could be observed at a minimum size ranging from 15 to 17 mm CL. The smallest ovigerous female observed in the field was 15.60 mm CL, although a relevant population incidence of ovigerous females (86.6%) has just been observed at values higher than 17 mm CL. As for males, the relative growth of the left chela length changed at a value of 15.40 mm CL, while morphological changes in sexual tube occurred between CL of 14 and 16 mm. Testicular maturation occurred at a CL ranging from 17 to 19 mm. The smallest size of males having spermatozoids in their vasa deferentia was 18.70 mm CL. The results obtained indicated that, in both sexes, functional maturity occurred after morphometric maturity and at a size similar to that of gonad maturity. Comparing sexes, females acquired sexual maturity (morphometric, gonad and functional maturity) at sizes statistically smaller than those of males.",

An intermingled network of arteries and veins (rete tibiotarsale) was found in all stages of complication, ranging from the most simple with only 3 arteries and 5–7 veins (tinamou and owl) to the most elaborate types with more than 60 arteries and 40 veins (flamingo). As opposed to what has hitherto been believed, elaborate retia are present in many short-legged species, while most of the long-legged wading birds only have retia of a very simple type. Arctic forms of eider ducks were found to possess elaborate retia comparable to those in other ducks. In species lacking the rete tibiotarsale, the single artery and its counter-current veins are forming a venae comitantes system. The number of counter-current veins increases with foot size and in ravens and crows up to 8 veins were surrounding the artery, resembling the pattern described in the fins of whales. In species of gulls and guillemots, the contact surface between the veins and the artery appeared to be higher in arctic forms than in more southerly distributed birds. The findings are discussed in relation to heat economy, foot size, and ecology of the species. Further, theories for the evolution of the different types of heat exchange systems are presented. It is concluded that no single selective factor can explain the evolution and occurrence of the rete tibiotarsale.",

Great quantities of water are evidently filtered through these nets at relatively low resistance and particles even below bacterial size (0.5 μm) are effectively trapped.

Accordingly, the atrial sphincter and the generally eight branched, longitudinal muscle cells connecting the terminal membrane and the membranous sac are interpreted as ectoderm. The membranous sac is attached to the cystid wall with two lateral ligaments and at four abfrontal areas: 1) a wide distal area, 2) an area at the origin of the retractor muscles, 3) a small area between 1 and 2, and 4) a small basal area at the origin of a pair of small muscle cells attached to the lowermost part of the caecum.

A vas deferens arises from the external side of each testis and three parts were clearly distinguished: proximal vas deferens (PVD), middle vas deferens (MVD) and distal vas deferens (DVD). The PVD is opalescent and highly convoluted, the MVD is pale white in colour and convoluted, but wider in diameter than the PVD, while the DVD shows the widest diameter, is straight and is white in colour. A single‐layered epithelium is recognized in the vas deferens; with cylindrical cells in the PVD and cuboid cells in the MVD and DVD. The formation of the spermatophore starts at the PVD, while the secondary layer of the spermatophore seems to be added at the MVD. At the DVD, the highly coiled spermatophore is surrounded by the periodic acid Schiff‐positive sticky components of the secondary layer.

The use of morphology and phylogenomic data in metazoan systematics. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 11–19 Animal phylogenies have been traditionally inferred by using the character state information derived from the observation of a diverse array of morphological and anatomical features, but the incorporation of molecular data into the toolkit of phylogenetic characters has shifted drastically the way researchers infer phylogenies. A main reason for this is the ease at which molecular data can be obtained, compared to, e.g., traditional histological and microscopical techniques. Researchers now routinely use genomic data for reconstructing relationships among animal phyla (using whole genomes or Expressed Sequence Tags) but the amount of morphological data available to study the same phylogenetic patterns has not grown accordingly. Given the disparity between the amounts of molecular and morphological data, some authors have questioned entire morphological programs. In this review I discuss issues related to the combinability of genomic and morphological data, the informativeness of each set of characters, and conclude with a discussion of how morphology could be made scalable by utilizing new techniques that allow for non‐intrusive examination of large amounts of preserved museum specimens. Morphology should therefore remains a strong field in evolutionary and comparative biology, as it continues to provide information for inferring phylogenetic patterns, is an important complement for the patterns derived from the molecular data, and it is the common nexus that allows studying fossil taxa with large data sets of molecular data.",

A survey of the vessels of Amphioxus using this technique is given. The dorsal arteries and their ramifications are described in detail. The new injection technique brought to light myoseptal plexi, supplied from the dorsal arteries, between every two myomeres. Also the ventral parietal arteries have a much more complicated course than hitherto accepted. They are connected with an atrial plexus which is a continuous net of small vessels in the whole length of the dorso-lateral wall of the atrial cavity. It is postulated that this plexus has a supplementary function in respiration. Plexi of minute vessels in the gonads and a real blood circulation with afferent and efferent gonadal vessels have been demonstrated. Two vessels connecting the liver plexus with the cardinal vein (or the atrial plexi) have been noticed, the v. communicans accessoria anterior mentioned in 1900 by Burchardt, and a so-called oblique vessel never described before. The vessels of the caudal region are analyzed completely and also here a real blood circulation appears possible.",

In this work, we discuss developmental data on two squamate species, provide data on the onset of the squamate sesamoids and the muscles they are associated to. Our results show that Mabuya mabouya and Liolaemus albiceps exhibited rather similar ontogenetic patterns and that the first sesamoids appear in embryos. The ossifying sesamoid timing is different between M. mabouya and L. albiceps , being faster in the former. In adults, we found 41 sesamoids, considering both fore and hindlimbs. We did not find any intrataxonomic differences, or any differences between the right and left side of the specimens in relation to the sesamoid presence. We recognize four types of sesamoids: (1) embedded sesamoids; (2) interosseus sesamoids; (3) glide sesamoids; and (4) supporting sesamoids. A table is included with a preliminary survey of the sesamoid distribution pattern in 10 Squamate clades.",

Its postorbital process is extended ventrally and probably enclosed part of the infraorbital sensory canal, as in some placoderms. Doliodus has a shark‐like dentition, but its upper anterior tooth files were supported by the internasal cartilage of the braincase, not by the palatoquadrates. Modern selachian jaws and dentitions are not representative of primitive crown‐group gnathostomes because they display a mixture of conserved and derived character states. Separation of the palatoquadrates by the internasal cartilage is probably a primitive condition for crown‐group gnathostomes. Continuity of the upper dental arcade across the ethmoid region may represent a synapomorphy of chondrichthyans and some acanthodians (the condition is not found in placoderms or osteichthyans). Exclusion of the arcade from the ethmoid region is probably apomorphic within elasmobranchs. Doliodus has curious bar‐like, paired subcranial ridges ending posteriorly at the hyomandibular articulation. These superficially resemble visceral arch infrapharyngohyals fused to the floor of the braincase, adding circumstantial palaeontological support to the old proposal that parts of visceral arches may be incorporated into the gnathostome braincase, although it seems more plausible that they formed in the lateral margins of the embryonic parachordal or hypotic lamina.",

(1987, 1991, 2007), and contrary to the conclusions of Sterli and Joyce (2007), Joyce (2007), Sterli (2008), and Anquetin et al. (2008). Specific characters found in Kayentachelys and diagnostic of cryptodires include the processus trochlearis oticum, the curved processus pterygoideus externus with a vertical plate, and the prefrontal–vomer contact, which are confirmed as absent in the outgroups, specifically the Late Triassic Proganochelys. The Joyce (2007) analysis suffers from the reduction of the signal from skull characters, with a consequently greater reliance on shell characters, resulting in pleurodires being resolved at various positions within the cryptodires. Kayentachelys reveals what a primitive cryptodire would be expected to look like: a combination of primitive and derived characters, with the fewer derived characters providing the best test of its relationships to other turtles. Although incompletely known, the Mid-Late Jurassic Condorchelys, Heckeremys, and Eileanchelys may be early cryptodires close to Kayentachelys. We confirm the Late Triassic Proterochersis as a pleurodire, dating the pleurodire–cryptodire split as Late Triassic or earlier.",

Mitoses are observed in the periphery of the retina, but are also seen in more central parts of the retina containing differentiated receptors and a cone mosaic. The fate of the cells resulting from the centrally located mitoses is not known. No signs of longitudinal fission of differentiated single cones are seen. It is suggested that double cones in the retina of perch fry arise by fusion of single cones which associate closely and develop subsurface cisterns coextensive with the region of intimate contact in the ellipsoid. During the first few weeks after hatching, there is a gradual shift in arrangement of the cones. In the newly hatched fry, the single cones are arranged in rows. When double cones are first seen, square‐pattern units appear, built up from four double cones and a single cone.",

The structure of alimentary tract has been studied in a cold water fish Glyptosternum maculatum, an endemic teleost species of notable economic importance and with high potential for controlled rearing of the species in Tibet, by light and electron microscope. Glyptosternum maculatum has short oesophagus, large caecal-type stomach and short intestine, and the digestive tract with four layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis and serosa. Taste buds were found in the epithelium of lips, buccopharynx and oesophagus. The stratified epithelium of buccopharynx and oesophagus was located with numerous goblet cells. The U-shaped stomach has three parts, corresponding to mammalian cardiac, fundus and pyloric portion, lined with a single-layered columnar epithelium, and tubular gastric glands are present in cardiac and fundic portion, but absent in pyloric portion. No pyloric caeca was detected. The intestine is separated from the stomach by a loop valve. The intestine epithelium is composed of simple columnar cells with a distinct microvillus brush border and many goblet cells. Meanwhile, the intestinal coefficient was 0.898. At the ultrastuctural level, three type cells (mucous, glandular and endocrine cell) were found in the stomach, and glandular cell with a great amount of pepsinogen granules.

In the spermatozoon a helical acrosome, a helical nucleus and a “body” with axonema follow each other in normal sequence. Head and tail are joined by a very short neck region containing two modified centrioles. The posterior portion of the nucleus is surrounded by a mitochondrial sheath consisting of three tightly wound mitochondrial helices. In the main portion of the tail the 9+2 unit is sorrounded by a granular sheath of dense material. In the neck region a centriole adjunct develops into a dense substance containing about nine rods. At an early stage, when the centriolar apparatus and flagellum become associated with the nucleus, three large mitochondria with fairly regular cristae are seen at the base of the nucleus. A well developed Golgi apparatus is present in early stages. Rows of microtubules are observed encircling the spermatid nucleus. Compared with the primitive type of spermatozoon the pogonophore sperm shows elongated and specialized nucleus, acrosome and mitochondria. It is concluded that the ancestral form must have had a fairly primitive spermatozoon and that evolution has proceeded towards a modified sperm with complicated spiral structure in connection with the evolution of a modified biology of fertilization, viz. specialized spermatophores. It is not known how the spermatophore discharges the spermatozoa nor how the spermatozoa find their way to the eggs. Two kinds of sperms are produced in the gonads of Siboglinum.

The intrusion of the ischiadic nerve into the limb bud is produced very early in ontogeny. The pre‐cartilage appears in the pre‐motile stage. Therefore, the nerve produces a movement analogous to the ‘embryonic motility’ that would induce the emergence of the pre‐cartilage. The acetabulum is the first of all cavitation processes to form, the second one being the knee. The acetabulum appears before the muscles are mature, although it has been stressed that the muscle contraction maintains joint progenitors committed to their fate.

Red Hill is a particularly informative site that preserves a diverse fauna and flora within a depositional setting suggesting penecontemporaneous deposition of locally derived material. Here, for the first time, we report on the full suite of early tetrapod remains from Red Hill and consider the implications for tetrapod diversity within the Red Hill ecosystem. Previously described material is reviewed and considered in relation to newly reported specimens. New material described includes isolated skull elements (two jugals, a postorbital, a lacrimal and a coronoid) and postcranial elements (a femur and a gastral scale). The characteristics of many of the Red Hill tetrapod specimens conform to the morphological expectations of Late Devonian forms. Several elements, however, illustrate more derived characteristics and strongly suggest the presence of the oldest known whatcheeriid‐like tetrapod. This study demonstrates the difficulty in making taxonomic associations with isolated remains, even when found in close proximity to one another. Exploration of the characteristics of each element, however, demonstrates the presence of at least three early tetrapod taxa at the Red Hill site.",

The issue of which breathing mechanism was used by the earliest tetrapods is still unsolved. Recent discoveries of stem tetrapods suggest the presence of internal gills and fish-like underwater breathing. The same osteological features were used by Bystrow to infer a salamander-like breathing through external gills in temnospondyl amphibians. This apparent contradiction – here called Bystrow's Paradox – is resolved by reviewing the primary fossil evidence and the anatomy of the two gill types in extant taxa. Rather unexpectedly, we find that internal gills were present in a range of early crown tetrapods (temnospondyls), based on the anatomy of gill lamellae and location of branchial arteries on the ventral side of gill arch elements (ceratobranchials). Although it remains to be clarified which components are homologous in external and internal gills, both gill types are likely to have been present in Palaeozoic tetrapods – internal gills in aquatic adults of some taxa, and external gills in the larvae of these taxa and in larvae of numerous forms with terrestrial adults, which resorbed the external gills after the larval phase. Future developmental studies will hopefully clarify which mechanistic pathways are involved in gill formation and how these might have evolved.",

In general, ammocoetes burrowed after transfer from the acclimation to the experimental temperature baths and later came out of the substrate only in lethal temperatures. A relationship was observed between the resistance time and the time taken to emerge, with the resistance time increasing exponentially with decreasing experimental temperature. In Ichthyomyzon fossor, landlocked Petromyzon marinus, Lampetra (Lethenteron) Lamottenii and in Lampetra (Lampetra) planeri from two different times of the year, the incipient lethal levels over a two week experimental period for larvae acclimated to 15° G were respectively 30.5, 30, 29.5, 28.5 and 28° C.

The motile sperm consist of a somewhat elongated head, a kind of midpiece and a long tail. An acrosome is absent. The nucleus is surrounded by longitudinally oriented microtubules running in furrows in the nuclear envelope. These microtubules are not interconnected by links or connected to the nuclear envelope; they persist in the mature sperm. No appreciable chromatin condensation takes place. The midpiece contains some unmodified mitochondria and a centriole. The tail is a simple, free flagellum. The results are in particular discussed in relation to other known microtubule-nuclear envelope complexes in sperm cells. The sperm cells of Pycnogonum littorale are, on the other hand, highly aberrant. They are unmotile, elongated cells containing a very high number (often more than 1000) of longitudinal microtubules arranged in complex patterns. Some folded membranes may represent the nuclear envelope. Other organelles are unidentificable or may be absent.",

This species has been the focus of several ecological, genetic and morphological studies. However, morphological studies have generally been limited to examination of interspecific variation among extant species of S outh A merican crocodylians. Here, we present the first study of intraspecific variation in the skull of M . niger using a two‐dimensional geometric morphometric approach. The crania of 52 sexed individuals varying in size were analysed to quantify shape variation and to assign observed shape changes to different types of intraspecific variation, that is, ontogenetic variation and sexual dimorphism. Most of the variation in this species is ontogenetic variation in snout length, skull depth, orbit size and the width of the postorbital region. These changes are correlated with bite force performance and probably dietary changes. However, a comparison with previous functional studies reveals that functional adaptations during ontogeny seem to be primarily restricted to the postrostral region, whereas rostral shape changes are more related to dietary shifts. Furthermore, the skulls of M . niger exhibit a sexual dimorphism, which is primarily size‐related. The presence of non‐size‐related sexual dimorphism has to be tested in future examinations.",

Also, the endocranium exhibits a partial segmentation in the form of vestiges of intrametameric articulations attributable to the anterior five metameres. Finally, the basicranial muscle of osteolepiforms, extending across the lower part of the endocranial articulation within the second metamere, is possibly supplied by a separate cranial nerve, for which the term nervus rarus is proposed. This hypothetical cranial nerve, which in osteolepiforms possibly emerges from the endocranium through a canal in the fourth metamere, is suggested to constitute, together with the trochlear nerve, the somatic motor component of the second cranionerval segment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In Oncopeltus fasciatus , the A‐cells of the pars intercerebralis and their tracts are stainable in situ with the performic acid‐victoria blue (PAVB) method. The axons from these cells, after traversing the corpus cardiacum, terminate in the anterior part of the aorta which thus serves as the neurohemal organ. Ultrastructurally, four types of secretory neurons are distinguishable in the pars intercerebralis region: pic‐I with granules measuring 1000–3000 Å in diameter; pic‐II with granules of irregular size and shape, the elongate ones showing mean dimensions of 2400 × 1400 Å; pic‐III with less electron‐dense granules measuring 1000–2700 Å in diameter; pic‐IV, present not only in the pars intercerebralis but also in adjacent regions of the brain, with variable proportions of granules measuring 700–1800 A and dense‐cored vesicles measuring 1000–2400 Å. The nervi corporis cardiaci contain at least three types of neurosecretory axons, based on granule content, presumably representing pic‐I, pic‐II and pic‐III neurons. The wall of the aorta contains endings of at least three distinct types, again representing pic‐I, pic‐II and pic‐III neurons, and thus provides the neurohemal site for these three types of protocerebral neurosecretory cells. Axons of pic‐IV neurons appear to enter the cerebral neuropil. The corpus cardiacum is composed of two types of parenchymal secretory cells, with electron‐dense granules measuring 1300–3000 Å and 1000–2300 Å in diameter, respectively. The corpus cardiacum also contains interstitial cells and some axons of extrinsic origin, with and without granules. The corpus allatum may be paired or median, and receives a small number of at least two types of axons. The corpora allata of some reproducing females show a large number of PAVB‐stainable inclusions which appear to be modified cytoplasmic organelles, but are definitely not neurosecretory material. The hypocerebral ganglion is composed of two types of secretory‐appearing neurons and glial cells. The two neuronal types contain secretory granules, 1000–3000 Å and 900–2100 Å in diameter, respectively. Axons of the recurrent nerve also may contain occasional granules. In this heteropteran insect, the two principal functions of the corpus cardiacum appear to be spatially separated: the neurohemal function is subserved by the aortic wall, which permits release of material into both the aortic lumen and the hemocoel, and the intrinsic endocrine function is possessed by the parenchymal cells.",

However, recently intermediate eye designs, combining features of both apposition and superposition eyes were found in tiny insects. Here, we examine the eyes of 12 species of moth, ranging from 1.88 to 6.03 mm body size, by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Correlations between body and eye sizes are discussed with regard to the eyes' functionality. Although all of the species shared an ommatidial organization characteristic of pterygote insects, three optical designs were found: (a) an apposition eye, (b) an eye resembling apposition eyes, but with a unique crystalline cone, and (c) an eye intermediate in structure between apposition and superposition eyes. Our comparisons also revealed a new type of basal matrix for the Lepidoptera. The results show that in most of the examined compound eyes (with the exception of the apposition eye of M icropterix aruncella ), a clear distinction between apposition and superposition eyes is not feasible. Due to functional morphological constraints as a consequence of miniaturization, evolutionary transformations from superposition into apposition optics may have occurred several times independently in various ‘microlepidopteran’ taxa. The P hyllonorycter medicaginella eye appears to illustrate this evolutionary scenario best.",

The lengths of the posterior regions (carrying the mitochondria) and the thinner anterior regions were also measured when appropriate. Maximum lengths of sperms for individual species varied from 268 μm for Fabaeformiscandona velifera Smith and Janz, 2008 through to 11 787 μm for Australocypris robusta De Deckker, 1974; these lengths represent the shortest so far recorded for the superfamily and the longest ever recorded in ostracods, respectively. There appears to be only a loose relationship between taxonomy and sperm lengths. Species of the subfamily Candoninae generally have the shortest sperms compared with other subfamilies, but one Candoninae species, Candona altoides Petkovski, 1961, has sperms longer than some species of the families Cyprididae, Ilyocyprididae and Notodromadidae. The family Cyprididae showed the most variation, with sperms ranging from 1000 μm through to 11 787 μm in length. No hypothesis satisfactorily explains the origin of giant sperms in ostracods or the longevity of this trait through geological eras, and their existence remains enigmatic.",

    "abstract": "Filter feeding in mussels is a secondary adaptation where the gills have become W-shaped and greatly enlarged, acting as the mussel filter–pump. Water pumping and particle capture in the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, have been studied over many years. Here, we give a short status of the present understanding of ciliary structure and function of the mussel filter–pump, supplemented with new photo-microscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures of gill preparations. Pumping rate (filtration) and pressure to maintain flow have been extensively studied so the power delivered by the mussel pump to the water flow is known (1.1% of total respiratory power), but the actual cost based on gill respiration is much higher (19%), implying that the cost of maintaining of the large gill pump is considerable and that only relatively little energy can be saved by stopping or reducing the activity of the water-pumping cilia so that continuous feeding with a ‘minimal scaled’ pump is cheaper than discontinuous feeding with a correspondingly larger pump. According to the present view, the pump proper is the beating lateral cilia (lc) on the gill filaments and particle capture is accomplished by the action of laterofrontal cirri (lfc) transferring particles from the main water current to the frontal gill filament currents driven by frontal cilia (fc). Unexplained aspects include retention efficiency according to particle size and the role of pro-laterofrontal cilia (p-lfc) placed between the lfc and fc. The structure of cilia and the mode of ciliary beating have been re-examined in this study by new high-resolution light and scanning electron microscopy of isolated gill preparations exposed to serotonin (5-HT) stimulation which can activate the lc and lfc at low concentrations (10-6 M), but removes the lfc from the interfilament canals at higher concentrations (10-5 M).",

Special attention has been given to the development of the sound‐conducting apparatus and to the structural changes of the palatoquadrate during metamorphosis. The operculum, the pars interna plectri and the pars media plectri are apparently of capsular origin, whereas the pars externa plectri and the anulus tympanicus, which develop from a common blasteme, appear to the be derivatives of the palatoquadrate. It is suggested that the infrapharyngohyal had been incorporated into the otic capsule during the phylogeny, and that it gives rise to the operculum and the pars interna et media plectri, as well as to the floor of the fossa fenestrae ovalis and the otic ledge of the adult. Similarly, the epihyal became incorporated into the posterior portion of the larval palatoquadrate (epimandibular), and gives rise to the pars externa plectri of the adult. The suprapharyngohyal is represented by the otic process and the lateral portion of the parotic crest. The anulus tympanicus is probably the homologue of the stylohyal of fishes. The suprapharyngomandibular and the infrapharyngo‐mandibular are both absent in the adult skull.",

While faeces have been suggested to contain socially relevant chemical stimuli, epidermal gland secretions are generally believed to be the leading source of chemosignals involved in lizard communication. Early research has shown that sex hormones affect epidermal gland activity, with androgens stimulating gland/pore size and/or gland productivity. However, the functional significance of hormone‐induced glandular activity in lizard chemical communication remains unclear. In this study, we manipulated testosterone (T) concentrations in male Podarcis muralis lizards. While T‐supplementation did not change pore size, it did increase secretion production substantially. Chemosensory tests showed that female conspecifics tongue‐flick at a higher rate and more quickly towards the secretion of males with experimentally increased T levels than towards the secretion of control males, suggesting that females can discriminate between males with dissimilar T levels based on chemical cues of secretion alone. Based on the scent of faeces, however, females were unable to discriminate between males with differential T levels. Also, females reacted more quickly when offered larger amounts of secretion – irrespective of whether secretions were obtained from control or T‐increased males. This result indicates that secretion quantity affects chemosignal detectability in Podarcis muralis .",

However, the ovarian follicles and oviduct morphology of Lohmann Brown and Potchefstroom Koekoek laying hens have not yet been studied. The study aimed to determine the morphological variations of the ovarian follicles and oviduct of Lohmann Brown and Potchefstroom Koekoek laying hens aged 40 weeks. The Student's t ‐test results revealed that breed had a significant effect ( p &lt; .05) on the weight of the small white follicles (SWF), large white follicles (LWF) and small yellow follicles (SYF), where Lohmann Brown performed higher than Potchefstroom Koekoek. The outcomes also displayed that breed had a significant effect ( p &lt; .05) on the number of LWF and SYF. The results further displayed that breed had a significant effect ( p &lt; .05) on the weight of F2, F3, F4 and F5. The outcomes showed that breed had a significant effect ( p &lt; .05) on the weights of the infundibulum, magnum and isthmus, where Lohmann Brown displayed a higher performance than Potchefstroom Koekoek. Furthermore, the findings revealed that breed had a significant effect ( p &lt; .05) on the lengths of the magnum, isthmus and shell gland, where Lohmann Brown displayed a better performance than Potchefstroom Koekoek. The findings also showed that the discriminant variables in the study are the isthmus length, isthmus weight and magnum length. In conclusion, there are morphological variations in the weights and numbers of the ovarian follicles, and the weights and lengths of the oviduct segments of Lohmann Brown and Potchefstroom Koekoek laying hens.",

The larvae are notable for their coarse punctures on the head capsule, paired angular processes on the labrum, a prominent truncate process on the haptomerum, mandibles with a prominent left S4 tooth and a subtle right one, and thoracic claws flattened at the apex. This unique combination of traits distinguishes them from all previously described species. Additionally, the living strategies underlying their relatively small size and life history strategies were briefly discussed.",

Despite its impact, no studies have examined the anatomical and histological structures of the alimentary canal and Malpighian tubules of C. elatus . Therefore, this study aimed to describe these structures in detail, which could provide insights into potential control methods. Ten individuals were collected and histologically processed, with observations made using stereo, light and electron microscopies. The alimentary canal is divided into three sections: the foregut, midgut and hindgut. The foregut comprises the pharynx, oesophagus, crop and proventriculus. A gastric caeca pair lies at the proximal anterior end of the midgut. The midgut is the longest portion. The Malpighian tubules, whose proximal ends open into the midgut and hindgut, have distal ends that connect to the colon wall. The hindgut is further subdivided into the ileum, colon and rectum. The rectum, the final segment of the alimentary canal, has a thick muscular wall and a more pronounced intima layer than the other hindgut regions. Cross sectional SEM images show six rectal pads where the final absorption of nutrients occurs. These findings may lead to new strategies for controlling this agricultural pest. Understanding these structures is crucial for further research.",

The majority of the sensory cells are of three types: two type I variants, with simple collars of unbranched microvilli surrounding their cilia, and one kind of type II cell, with an extended collar of repeatedly branched microvilli. The two type I variants differ in the structure and arrangement of the microvilli, basal body and rootlet, and the length of the cilium. Both variants are probably primary sensory cells (i.e. each has its own axon), but the data supporting this conclusion are much better for one variant than for the other. Type II cells are secondary sensory cells, with synaptic terminals borne on short extensions of the cell body. The presence of degenerating type II cells suggests that they may be subject to a regular process of loss and renewal. The results do not resolve the evolutionary issue of how amphioxus sensory cells relate to the epithelial sensory and receptor cells of vertebrates. Being primary, the type I cells resemble the supposed ancestral type more closely than do type II cells. Type II cells may be chemosensory, however, and should not be ruled out a priori as possible homologues of either primary or secondary chemosensory cells in vertebrates.",

The larvae represent at least four and possibly five different species of Facetotecta. Y‐cyprids have five pairs of lattice organs in the head shield (carapace) organized into two anterior pairs and three posterior pairs. Both groups of lattice organs are arranged around a large central pore. The facetotectan lattice organs are elongate areas with a longitudinal keel, just as in the Ascothoracida and some Cirripedia Acrothoracica. The terminal pore of the organs is situated posteriorly in all five pairs. TEM confirms that the organs have the same general morphology as in the Cirripedia and Ascothoracida, namely, a cuticular chamber into which project ciliary segments from the chemosensory cells. Unlike Cirripedia the cuticular roof of the chamber lacks any pores. We conclude that five pairs of lattice organs represent an autapomorphy for the Thecostraca, which supports the monophyly of this taxon. In the ground pattern the terminal pore is posterior in all five pairs. The anterior position of the pore in lattice organ pair 2 is apomorphic for the Cirripedia, while within this taxon an anterior position also in pair 1 is apomorphic for a monophylum comprising the Thoracica and the Rhizocephala. Minute pores in the roof of the organs is another apomorphy of the Cirripedia, but its elaboration into pores visible with SEM may have been subject to some homoplasy. Since lattice organs are omnipresent in the settling instar of the Thecostraca they probably serve a critical role for the function of these cypris or cypris‐like larvae.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While the majority of marine bivalves are oviparous, the two freshwater families among the order Veneroida, i.e. Corbiculidae and Sphaeriidae, comprise species with ovoviviparous and viviparous reproduction. Within the Corbiculidae, the genus Corbicula , which is well‐known for its invasive and, thus, ecologically important representatives, is characterized by (i) a wide range of limnic habitats, inhabiting both brackish water and freshwater environments, and (ii) contrasting modes of reproduction, including ‘planktonic’ development via a free‐swimming larva vs. intrabranchial incubation (brooding) of shelled juveniles. The present investigation of five species of Corbicula from the Indonesian islands Sumatra and Sulawesi, which were hitherto not studied anatomically, adds to the diversity in reproductive patterns in this genus. As a unique feature among Corbicula we here report on two newly observed modes of brooding in species endemic to Sulawesi, (i) tetragenous brooding (i.e. in both demibranchs) in Corbicula possoensis Sarasin &amp; Sarasin, 1898 from Lake Poso, and (ii) prolonged incubation in the maternal gills, with juvenile shells reaching up to 1.3 mm in length and with a well‐developed hinge in C. linduensis Bollinger, 1914 from the Lindu River system. In contrast, a third method is seen in the following taxa that incubate their young in their inner demibranchs only until the stage of juveniles with straight‐hinged shells (D‐shaped): C. matannensis Sarasin &amp; Sarasin, 1898 from Lake Matano and Lake Mahalona, C. loehensis Kruimel, 1913 from Lake Masapi (all on Sulawesi) and C. moltkiana Prime, 1878 from Lakes Maninjau and Singkarak (on Sumatra). Details of the anatomical and histological features of ctenidia are described for each type of brooding, and some trends in the evolution of reproductive strategies within the Corbiculidae are discussed, comparing them with those known from other limnic molluscs.",

Such cells are first detected in the 2‐day larva: these are (1) enterochromaffin cells in the inner epithelium of the gut and (2) anterior serotonergic neurons at the rostral end of the nerve cord. In the 6‐day larva, relatively low levels of serotonin appear in ventro‐lateral perikarya and cell processes of intraspinal serotonergic neurons scattered along the nerve cord. In the 18‐day (early metamorphic) larva, antero‐lateral serotonergic neurons are detected near the rostral end of the nerve cord as two small, bilateral clusters of perikarya with axons that descend the nerve cord; at later developmental stages, these axons extend almost to the posterior end of the body. In the 21‐day (mid‐metamorphic) larva, serotonin can no longer be detected in the anterior serotonergic neurons, but serotonin‐containing cells are found subjacent to the inner epithelium of the digestive caecum and in the peribranchial epithelium covering the primary gill bars. In the discussion, we suggest that the anterior serotonergic neurons may play a role in larval photoreception and that the antero‐lateral serotonergic neurons may be homologous to vertebrate hindbrain neurons with axons descending the spinal cord to modulate undulation (if this homology is valid, the anterior limit of the lancelet hindbrain would be roughly 100 μm behind the rostral tip of the nerve cord).",

They occur either as single cells or as cell clusters within the filamental epithelium. Two populations of NE cells were identified that exhibit an immunoreactivity either for serotonin alone or for met‐enkephalin and leu‐enkephalin co‐distributed in the same cells. We demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of open‐type endocrine cells in the fish gill epithelium and confirm the presence of only serotonin‐immunopositive cells of the closed type. The NE cells of the species studied do not react positively to other neuroendocrine markers occurring in the mammalian lung. Great differences probably exist in the expression of these epitopes on antigenic structures among various animal species. Although the physiological role of neuropeptides and serotonin in the fish gill NE cells is unknown, the presence of these molecular markers is of interest not only from an evolutionary aspect, but also in terms of a potential animal model to study the supposed functions of the airway neuroendocrine system in the vertebrates.",

Phylogenetic relationships were inferred by maximum parsimony and results evaluated by bootstrapping. With Branchinecta packardi as an outgroup, the following tree was inferred: the first branch leads to a node that joins a pentastome, a branchiuran and the two ostracodes; the second branch leads to a node that has the two copepods as a sister taxon to a clade that includes the acrothoracican and thoracicans; the last branch leads to a node joining the two decapods. The analyses suggest: (1) acrothoracicans diverged very early from the cirripede line and are not derived from a lepadomorph‐like ancestor; (2) branchiurans are not related to either copepods or thecostracans but are closely allied with pentastomes; and (3) the Maxillopoda, broadly defined, is not a monophyletic taxon. These results differ from previous studies of these groups.",

Altogether this provides a wide data basis for phylogenetic considerations, particularly for the crustacean branch of the Arthropoda.

    "abstract": "Abstract The neural gland complex of Ascidia interrupta consists of three parts: dorsal tubercle, ciliated duct, and neural gland. The dorsal tubercle protrudes above the pharyngeal lining and bears a ciliated funnel. The funnel opens into a ciliated duct which opens into the neural gland, a blind sac in a blood sinus below the brain. Funnel and duct cells are joined by adhaerens junctions and, apically, by putative tight junctions. The neural gland wall is a loose, irregular, non‐ciliated epithelium of phagocytes. Adhaerens, but not tight, junctions join the cells. Secretory cells were not observed. Tracers delivered onto the dorsal tubercle and dissolved in seawater around undissected animals are transported unidirectionally inward into the neural gland. The continuous ciliary incurrent moves the tracers across the wall of the neural gland and into the pharyngeal blood vessels. Small particulates and large macromolecules, however, are removed from the water stream by endocytosis on neural gland cells. Large particulates delivered onto the dorsal tubercle do not enter the system but rather are rejected by cilia on the surface of the tubercle. The neural gland complex is interpreted as an organ of blood volume regulation that consists of a pump (cilia) and coarse (tubercle) and fine (gland) filters. Analogous and homologous systems are discussed.",

Little is known about the morphological variability and sexual shape differences in this species. In this paper, the variation of the cephalic scales in L. bilineata is analysed by means of a geometric morphometric approach. A main structural pattern is characterized by negative allometry of the frontal and interparietal areas, and positive allometry of the parietal and frontoparietal scales. Sexual differences are described both in size and shape. In males, the scales are generally larger, with relative shortening of the frontal area, frontoparietal enlargement, occipital lengthening and bulging of the parietal scales, which compresses and narrows the interparietal and occipital areas midsagittally. This pattern is based on a shared allometric trajectory, with males displaying a peramorphic morphotype. However, males show some shape differences in the occipital area that are not size‐related, and cannot be interpreted in terms of general head enlargement. This structural trajectory can be related to the development of the skull, but the role of soft tissues (temporal, nuchal and masticatory muscles) must also be considered. The development of the jaw and nuchal muscles involved in intra‐ and intersexual behaviours could have played a pivotal role in the evolution of this pattern.",

A total of 64 adult males were collected between December 2002 and February 2005 in mangroves of the Baía de Antonina, State of Paraná, Southern Brazil (25°25′08″S, 48°42′33″W). The reproductive system of this species is composed of the following paired symmetrical structures: testes, vasa deferentia (distal, medial and proximal portions), ejaculatory ducts and penises. During spermatogenesis, which takes place in the testes, the following developmental stages are observed: primary and secondary spermatogonia, primary and secondary spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoids. Production of male gametes was continuous throughout the study period, indicating that males of this species are physiologically capable of reproducing all year long.",

Thus the old idea that rupture of the cell membrane causes the uncoiling in sea water is no longer tenable. If the thread cells are transferred without additional fluid to a microscope slide, no uncoiling occurs until sea water or distilled water is added when the process occurs rapidly; however, in double strength sea water uncoiling is slowed down. In tetrahydrofuran or glycerin there is no uncoiling in 100 % or 50 % solutions; however in 5 % solutions uncoiling occurs slowly. Thus the availability of adequate amounts of water seems to be necessary for uncoiling. Presumably, water acts directly on the thread, causing the organelle to straighten and thus uncoil. The defensive value of the slime production is discussed.",

Results of the study show very rapid scale formation in Hemichromis. The papilla of the scale differentiates a little in advance of the bone scale formation. No epidermal cells are involved in the constitution of the scale pocket made up of scleroblasts. In Hemichromis , as in other teleost scales, the osseous layer is the first one to be secreted by, presumably, only the scleroblasts. Then the scleroblasts specialize in their functions. Superficial ones are involved in the formation of osseous circuli; marginal scleroblasts are responsible for growth in diameter of the scale; while deep scleroblasts allow the scales to thicken owing to the progressive addition of collagen fibrils organized in a “plywood‐like” structure which constitutes the fibrillary plate of the scale. Mineralization occurs very rapidly within the osseous layer in the form of hydroxyapatite‐like crystal deposits. The fibrillary plate is not yet mineralized in Hemichromis at the stages studied here, but presumably is later. Results obtained in Hemichromis are discussed against similar data available in the literature on teleost scale formation.",

Testicular tissues were collected, embedded in plastic, sectioned on an ultramicrotome, and stained with the periodic acid–Schiff+ procedure followed by a haematoxylin counterstain. Alligators have a prenuptial pattern of germ cell development, where spermatogenesis begins in early spring and sperm is mature by the time mating begins in May. Consistent spatial relationships between germ cells are absent within the seminiferous epithelium of the alligator. Their germ cells progress through the phases of spermatogenesis as a single cohort, leading to one continuous spermiation event that occurs during their mating season (May–June). This temporal germ cell development is different from the consistent spatial development seen within seasonally breeding birds and mammals but is similar to the recently described germ cell development strategies of two other temperate breeding reptiles, the slider turtle and the European wall lizard. The germ cell development strategy shared by these three temperate reptiles representing three different taxa within the class Reptilia is reminiscent of the temporal strategy seen within the anamniotic testis. Thus, alligators and at least two other temperate reptiles exhibit primitive spermatogenic cycles within derived amniotic testes and may be consider intermediates in terms of testicular organization, which may have significance phylogenetically.",

In spite of great external diversity, the investigations revealed an overall ultrastructural similarity. Differences between species investigated mainly concern the size of the organs as well as the number and arrangement of cells. The organs comprise supportive cells and uniciliated penetrative sensory cells. Their dendrites are closely arranged and thus their cilia may resemble multiciliated cells. There are two types of sensory cells: one type possesses no or mainly thin microvilli of which usually only a few reach the cuticular surface, and in the other type the cilium is consistently surrounded by 10 strong microvilli, which form a pore‐like opening in the cuticle. Further differences occur in the structure of the rootlet system. Basally, a retractor muscle attaches to the organ. The systematic significance of these organs within Annelida is discussed with respect to the conflicting phylogenetic hypotheses explaining the relationships of annelid taxa.",

The latter process was essential for land colonization during vertebrate evolution and produced an efficient barrier in amniotes. Keratinocytes are made of cross‐linked keratins associated with specific proteins and lipids that are produced at advanced stages of embryogenesis when the epidermis becomes stratified. In these stages the epidermis changes from an aquatic to a terrestrial type, preadapted in preparation for the impact with the dry terrestrial environment that occurs at hatching or parturition. The epidermal barrier against water‐loss, mechanical and chemical stress, and microbe penetration is completely formed shortly before birth. Beneath the outer periderm, variably stratified embryonic layers containing glycine‐rich alpha‐keratins are formed in preparation for adult life. The following layers of the epidermis produce proteins for the formation of the cornified cell membrane and of the cornified material present in keratinocytes of the adult epidermis in reptiles, birds and mammals. The general features of the process of soft cornification in the embryonic epidermis of vertebrates are presented. Cornification in developing scales in reptiles, avian feathers and mammalian hairs is mainly related to the evolution of keratin‐associated proteins. The latter proteins form the resistant matrix of hard skin derivatives such as claws, beaks, nails and horns.",

The gastral scales of limbed tetrapodomorphs evolved from the 'elpistostegid'-type of scale by an enlargement and differentiation of the articulation facets and a shortening and broadening of the keel. These changes caused a tighter connection between gastral scales within a scale row and a greater overlap between the rows. Dorsal round scales of limbed tetrapodomorphs developed from a gastral scale-type by an alteration of the ontogenetic pathway. The posterolateral direction of scale rows in 'elpistostegids' was retained in the gastral scalation of most limbed tetrapodomorphs, whereas the arrangement of round dorsal scales is modified to a transverse orientation. Both gastral and dorsal scales of limbed tetrapodomorphs consist solely of parallel-fibred bone with circumferential growth marks. The proportionally larger overlap surfaces of gastral scales and their mode of articulation in the ventral midline indicate that the body of limbed tetrapodomorphs might have been more flexible than that of their finned relatives. The alteration of dermal scales was one of the most rapid morphological changes during the fish-to-tetrapod transition. Once established, gastral and dorsal scales were retained as a conservative character in different lineages of basal tetrapods, in both the amphibian and the amniote lineages.",

The early development of the echidna, Tachyglossus aculeatus (Mammalia: Monotremata), and patterns of mammalian development. —Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 92: 75–88. The echidna is one of the last survivors of the most basal clade of living mammals and as such, it is an important species to understand character transformation in the dawn of mammalian evolution. Based on description of several embryological stages and consideration of characters taken from the classical drawings of Richard Semon (1859–1918), we study the early development of this species using the Standard Event System. We describe and analyse developmental timing with a phylogenetic approach (Parsimov). A mosaic of plesiomorphic and derived features – reportedly found in the echidna adult anatomy and genome, when compared to other living mammals – is also found when examining its embryonic development. In contrast to sauropsids, we found mammals to be characterized by late eye and ear development, possibly related to their contrasting early postnatal life history. The differentiation of the jaw bones may be reflected in the developmental timing of the mandibular process among mammals. Whereas in therians the mandibular process shows an accelerated development, in echidna a delayed timing of mandibular process characters is observable. We highlight the limitation of interpreting heterochronic data and expose the plasticity in the timing of developmental characters, examined under alternative phylogenetic frameworks and character definitions.",

Two of these cell types are basophilic and assumed to be gonadotropic. The third cell type is acidophilic and its similarity to somatotropic (STH) cells is evident. Green fluorescent cells corresponding to cells with dense core vesicles of about 85 nm are scattered between the PPD and the proximal neurohypophysis (PNH). Their possible content of a catecholamine was demonstrated with microspectrofluorometric analyses. Four axon types with granules 65, 81, 110 and 137 nm in average diameter terminate at the basement membrane. Only fibers with granules of 81 nm enter the PPD to make synapses with the STH cells. Extensions of the basement membrane are continuous with the perivascular space and penetrate the endocrine tissue. It is postulated that axon terminals on the basement membrane are functionally equivalent to synaptic contacts on the endocrine cells. Axon type 4 has granules which in sizes correspond to those of cells in lateral and ventrolateral parts of the nucleus lateralis tuberis (NLT). A similar correlation is possible between axon type 3 and other cells in the NLT. This is in accordance with earlier conclusions of a regulation of the gonadotropic cells from the lateral (posterior) parts of the NLT.",

The cells are enveloped by two so-called \"cellules épidermiques juxta-cristallines\". There are also six pigmented retinula cells, all contributing to the rhabdom. A peculiar feature of the Artemia crystalline cone cells is that their elongated parts, the so-called cone cell roots, widen and flatten proximally, forming interdigitating \"endfeet\". The basement membrane thus consists of a cellular portion combined with the basal lamina. The main mass of the rhabdom of the Artemia eye is built up by five retinula cells, two contributing a smaller part. The microvilli are oriented in four directions, two being orthogonal. The sixth cell contributes on two small portions to the rhabdom in the distalmost and a more proximal position. The rest of it runs axon-like outside the omnatidium. Where the sixth cell wedges in, the direction of the microvilli is changed and has no orthogonal pattern. Two rhabdom types of compound eyes are distinguished: the decapod or banded or layered rhabdom: and the anostracan rhabdom with continuous rhabdomeres.",

Sticky predators: a comparative study of sticky glands in harpactorine assassin bugs (Insecta: Hemiptera: Reduviidae). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00 : 1–10. For more than 50 years, specialized dermal glands that secrete sticky substances and specialized setae have been known from the legs of New World assassin bugs in the genus Zelus Fabricius (Reduviidae: Harpactorinae). The gland secretions and specialized ‘sundew setae’ are involved in enhancing predation success. We here refer to this predation strategy as ‘sticky trap predation’ and the specialized dermal glands as ‘sticky glands’. To determine how widespread sticky trap predation is among Reduviidae, we investigated taxonomic distribution of sticky glands and sundew setae using compound light microscopical and scanning electron microscopical techniques and sampling 67 species of Reduviidae that represent 50 genera of Harpactorini. We found sticky glands in 12 genera of Harpactorini and thus show that sticky trap predation is much more widespread than previously suspected. The sticky glands vary in shape, size and density, but are always located in a dorsolateral position on the fore tibia. Sundew setae are present in all taxa with sticky glands with the exception of Heza that instead possesses unique lamellate setae. The sticky trap predation taxa are restricted to the New World, suggesting a New World origin of this unique predation strategy.",

During our previous studies on Isohypsibius granulifer granulifer Thulin, 1928 (Tardigrada, Eutardigrada), which examined alterations of the midgut epithelium during oogenesis, we found that some of the specimens were infected with microsporidia. All stages of pathogens occurred in the cytoplasm of the digestive cells in the midgut epithelium of I. g. granulifer that were infected with microsporidia: meronts, sporonts, sporoblasts, and spores. The cytoplasm of the digestive cells was rich in mitochondria, cisterns of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and Golgi complexes. Autophagy in the digestive cells of the dorsal midgut was much more intensive in comparison with noninfected specimens. Membranes of phagophores surrounded the pathogens forming autophagosomes. These latter structures fused with lysosomes forming autolysosomes and residual bodies appeared. Neither glycogen granules nor droplets of varying electron density, which accumulated in digestive cells during vitellogenesis and choriogenesis, appeared in individuals with microsporidia. While the midgut epithelium in noninfected specimens takes part in vitellogenesis and choriogenesis, in infected specimens, midgut cells are involved in the process of autophagy as a survival strategy.",

We investigated the structure of carapace shape variation in six populations of Macrobrachium australe Guérin‐Méneville 1838 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Palaemonidae) from Reunion Island (Indian Ocean) freshwaters. The morphometric analysis revealed the occurrence of two morphotypes corresponding to two different types of habitats. Individuals living in lotic habitats present a thick carapace armed with a short, robust and straight rostrum, while individuals from lentic habitats have a slender carapace armed with a thin long rostrum orientated upward. This difference suggests an adaptation to lotic disturbances and is tentatively interpreted as adaptive phenotypic plasticity. In such amphidromous organisms regressing to freshwaters after a marine larval phase, selection for physiological and developmental flexibility might facilitate further adaptation and allows the colonisation of a wide panel of environmentally different and sometimes geographically distant insular streams.",

In this study, we explored aspects of sexual dimorphism in noncolor morphological traits in S . minor and characterized the gonadal cycle in males and females from each of two sites ( E l E nzuelado and L a M anzana) in H idalgo, M éxico, differing in key ecological aspects linked to life‐history trait expression in other lizards. Males were generally larger than females in each population and expressed larger forms of several other morphological traits, although not all comparisons attained statistical significance. Both sexes attained reproductive maturity at a larger size in E l E nzuelado relative to L a M anzana, and females from E l E nzuelado had larger litters. Gonadal cycles differed substantially between the two populations and suggest that reproductive activity of males and females was synchronous at E l E nzuelado and asynchronous at L a M anzana, an unusual pattern. Geographic variation in sex‐specific responses to environmental variables may be at least partly responsible for the exceptional species diversity of spiny lizards in M éxico.",

Fish specimens were obtained by using fishing rods at the muddy flat in tributaries of the Hau River from August 2017 to July 2018. Data analysis of a collection of 1,504 individuals (930 males and 674 females) showed that the sex ratio of this species was significantly different from the ratio 1:1. As mature gonads were found monthly during the study period, it is suggested that P. septemradiatus is an iteroparous species releasing eggs for a year‐round cycle. The fish length at first mature ( L m ) showed an increase from estuary to upstream areas. Male P. septemradiatus had higher L m values than that of females. Likely, the batch fecundity increased from estuary region (5,916 ± 312 SEM eggs) towards upstream area (11,451 ± 953 SEM eggs). The fish total length and weight values had strong positive relationships with batch fecundity, as shown by high determination values ( r 2 ), suggesting that batch fecundity increased with fish size. This study provided more information on reproductive biology of P. septemradiatus , which can be utilized for fish population conservation and artificial reproductive study.",

The epidermis and cranial nerves of Myxine glutinosa were also examined for evidence of a lateral line system. Together with results previously published by other researchers, we conclude that most or all eptatretid hagfish possess a lateral line system composed of shallow trenches, or grooves, lined with a single class of flask‐shaped receptive cells. No species of myxinid hagfish has been shown to possess any component of this system. Three groups of lateral line grooves are present in eptatretids: preoptic, dorsal postoptic, and ventral postoptic groups. The preoptic grooves are innervated by a single pair of ganglionated cranial nerves and the two postoptic series of grooves are innervated by a pair of cranial nerves which each possess two ganglia, possibly as a result of fusion of two pairs of ganglionated nerves. Morphometric analysis indicates that these grooves continue to grow throughout life and that the variability in the distribution of grooves between animals may result from developmental instability in lateral line ontogeny. The morphology of the receptive organs is compared to neuromasts of the vertebrate lateral line system and ciliated receptor cells of other chordates. The morphology of hagfish lateral line receptors may represent the primitive condition for craniate lateral line organs, or more likely, they are highly derived as a result of regressive evolution. © 1997 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Evolution of cerebral vesicles and their sensory organs in an ascidian larva. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 81 : 243–258 The ascidian larval nervous system consists of the brain (comprising the visceral ganglion and the sensory vesicle), and, continuous with it, a caudal nerve cord. In most species two organs, a statocyst and an ocellus with ciliary photoreceptors, are contained in the sensory vesicle. A third presumptive sensory organ was sometimes found in an ‘auxiliary’ ganglionic vesicle. The development and morphology of the sensory and auxiliary ganglionic vesicles in Botryllus schlosseri and their associated organs was studied. The sensory vesicle contains a unique organ, the photolith, responding to both gravity and light. It consists of a unicellular statocyst, in the form of an expanded pigment cup receiving six photoreceptor cell extensions. Presumptive mechano‐receptor cells (S1 cells), send ciliary and microvillar protrusions to contact the pigment cup. A second group of distinctive cells (S2), slightly dorsal to the S1 cells, have characteristic microvillar extensions, resembling photoreceptor. We concur with the idea that the photolith is new and derived from a primitive statocyst and the S2 cells are the remnant of a primitive ocellus. In the ganglionic vesicle some cells contain modified cilia and microvillar extensions, which resemble the photoreceptor endings of the photolith. Our results are discussed in the light of two possible scenarios regarding the evolution of the nervous system of protochordates.",

Motoneurones supplying the ventral and dorsal compartments can be distinguished from one another on a number of morphological criteria. The ventral compartment motoneurones are neither symmetrical nor particularly ordered in arrangement. Their cilia are short and point forward or obliquely across the central canal; their axons run along the basal lamina adjacent to processes from muscle fibres, with which they make extended linear series of synapses containing 45–60 nm synaptic vesicles. The dorsal compartment motoneurones are paired and tend to be positioned at or near the junctions between somites. Their cilia are longer and project caudally; their axons are large, filled with mitochondria and 30–45 nm synaptic vesicles, and make synapses only at specific, segmentally repeated sites. An unusual feature of both cell types is that synaptic input occurs all along the axon, either by direct axo‐axonal synapses or via slender dendritic processes. This allows for redundancy and multiple inputs, and is possible only because amphioxus somatic motor axons lie entirely within the nerve cord, which is itself an unusual feature among chordates. The possible significance of dual somatic innervation is discussed in relation to the dual innervation of the head in vertebrates, which has separate sets of somatic and visceral/branchiomotor nerves.",

In the present paper, the microanatomy of the brain and the innervation of, inter alia , the antennae, the nuchal organs and the alimentary canal of Hyalinoecia tubicola, Nothria conchylega, Eunice norvegica and E. pennata are described. The results are summarized in schematic diagrams and tables and compared with corresponding observations in other polychaete families. Thereby, some earlier opinions about the morphological value of the cephalic appendages of the Eunicea are strengthened while others are rejected. On the basis of the present observations and earlier results arrived at by the present author, and as an object for future discussion and criticism, a diagram of the fundamental constitution of the cephalic nervous system of the Polychaeta is tentatively outlined.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An oval, dorsal organ, variously bearing four minute pits around a central pore and/or encircled by a cuticular border, has been reported for the cephalic region of various groups of living and fossil crustaceans. Although varying somewhat in location and in size, the organ appears basically uniform in organization in at least two of the major crustacean taxa: Branchiopoda (especially Laevicaudata) and Malacostraca (Decapoda and Syncarida). Little is known about its ultrastructure and function in various groups, and it is likely that the term ‘dorsal organ’ also has been applied to several nonhomologous structures. In particular, the embryonic dorsal organ, reviewed recently by Fioroni (Fioroni, P. 1980.— Zoologische Jahrbücher (Anatomie) 104: 425–465) and apparently functioning in nutrition and ecdysis, is not the topic of this paper; that organ is similar in name and location only and appears in embryonic uniramians, chelicerates, and crustaceans. The function of the dorsal organ in branchiopods is in ion regulation, possibly a secondary modification of the original function in marine crustaceans, which is unknown. In larval decapods, the organ probably functions as a chemo‐ or mechano‐receptor. We review the known occurrence of the crustacean dorsal organ, describe the similarities and differences in structure in various taxa, and review the competing hypotheses concerning its function. Phylogenetic implications are discussed.",

The orientation of the basal structures of the cilia is related to the direction of their beat. The basiepidermal nervous system is grouped mainly at the frontal and abfrontal faces. The basement membrane is thickest on the frontal face and consists of circular collagen fibrils near the epidermis and longitudinal ones near the peritoneum. All peritoneal cells surrounding the mesocoel are provided with smooth longitudinal myofibrils, and isolated axons are situated between these cells and the basement membrane.

This fluorescent dye is taken up preferentially (but not highly selectively) by epidermal receptors and often stains sensory axons to their full extent. Type I primary receptors in the epidermis first become morphologically detectable along the rostrocaudal axis of the 2.5 day larva when their epidermal perikarya extend unbranched axons to the nerve cord. These axons run posteriorly or anteriorly within the nerve cord, depending on whether their perikarya are located, respectively, rostral or caudal to the most posterior pharyngeal slit. In later larvae, axons of type I receptors are organized into a dorsal and a subdorsal sensory tract on either side of the nerve cord. In the epidermis of metamorphic juveniles, CM‐DiI also stains type II receptors (which are axonless, secondary receptors) and ventral pit cells (which may not be receptors). It is probable, but not yet conclusively demonstrated, that peripheral neurites from Retzius bipolar cells (primary intramedullary sensory neurones) synapse with type II secondary epidermal receptors or ramify freely among the other epidermal cells. The discussion considers homologies among epidermal sensory receptors in chordates.",

An investigation of Dysponetus pygmaeus (Chrysopetalidae) with confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that circular muscles are entirely absent. Further studies indicate that this feature is characteristic for all Chrysopetalidae. A scrutiny of the literature showed a similar situation in many other polychaetes. This lack of circular muscle fibres may either be due to convergence or represent a plesiomorphic character. Since circular muscles are very likely important for burrowing forms but not necessary for animals which proceed by movements of their parapodial appendages or cilia, this problem is also related to the question of whether the ancestral polychaete was epi‐ or endobenthic.",

The apical ganglion contains three 5‐HT‐ir neurons, many FMRFamide‐ir neurons and a tripartate 5‐HT‐ir and FMRFamide‐ir neuropil. A lateral nerve extends from each side of the apical ganglion across the episphere and the ventral hyposphere, where the two nerves combine to form the paired ventral nerve cord. These nerves have both 5‐HT‐ir and FMRFamide‐ir processes. Three circumferential nerves are associated with the ciliary bands: two prototroch and one metatroch nerve. All contain 5‐HT‐ir and FMRFamide‐ir processes. An oral nerve plexus also contain both 5‐HT‐ir and FMRFamide‐ir processes develops from the metatroch nerve, and an esophageal ring of FMRFamide‐ir processes develops in later larval stages. In young stages the ventral ganglion contains two 5‐HT‐ir and two FMRFamide‐ir perikarya; during development the ventral ganglion grows caudally and adds additional 5‐HR‐ir and FMRFamide‐ir perikarya. These are the only perikarya that could be found along the lateral nerve and ventral nerve cord. The telotroch nerve develops from the ventral nerve cord. The 5‐HT‐ir and FMRFamide‐ir part of the nervous system is strictly bilateral symmetric. and much of the system (i.e. apical ganglion, lateral nerves ventral nerve cord, dorsal nerve and oral plexus) is retained in the adult.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Since the publication of Darwin's theory of evolution in 1859, lingulids have probably been the most widely quoted examples of arrested evolution. This, to some degree, may be because few anatomical features are impressed either on or inside valves so these may not adequately reflect the extent of change incurred during lingulid evolution. Two lingulid brachiopods, Lingulella chengjiangensis and Lingulellotreta malongensis , from the Early Cambrian Chengjiang Lagerstätte (Yunnan, South China) show preservation of a series of soft parts, notably the lophophores, setae mantle canals and perfectly impressed visceral region, which are vital to understanding the evolution and lifestyle of brachiopods. Analysis of the valve interiors favours the claim that an epifaunal mode of life could be a plesiomorphic state in contrast to the infaunal one of modern lingulids. Based on these fossils, the three‐pseudosiphon formation of setae found in Recent lingulids is proposed to be an apomorphy derived as an adaptation to an infaunal lifestyle. Comparison between the interior of the fossils with that of modern lingulids does little to support the widespread notion that the morphology of this lineage has remained remarkably constant since at least the early Palaeozoic.",

Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationships of Cambaroides are controversial. To gain more information about East Asian crayfish and to shed some light on the phylogeny and evolution of freshwater crayfish, some aspects of the embryonic and postembryonic development of the Japanese freshwater crayfish species Cambaroides japonicus are described. The general appearance of the embryo and the growth zone consisting of about 40 ectoteloblasts correspond with the apomorphic pattern described for all other freshwater crayfish species. The occurrence of eight mesoteloblasts is a typical malacostracan character. In addition to the occurrence of freshwater crayfish apomorphies, such as a telson thread, the postembryonic development of C. japonicus follows the ground pattern of the Northern Hemisphere Astacoidea. In particular, some characteristics are in common with the postembryonic development of the Astacidae. These concern the shape of the telson of the juvenile stage 1 and the occurrence of plumose telson setae in juvenile stage 2. Furthermore, the recurved hooks of the hatchlings are lost in the juvenile stage 2, indicating an early independence of the juveniles from the mother. On the other hand, the early appearance of a spermatheca ( annulus ventralis ) is shared between C. japonicus and the other (American) Cambaridae. The hypothesis is developed that the evolutionary success of the different freshwater crayfish taxa might be related to the stepwise extension of maternal care as an adaptation to the freshwater environment.",

(1) Filtration: the larvae retained algal cells on the upstream (frontal) side of a sieve composed of a row of stationary laterofrontal cilia. Movement of the laterofrontal cilia could not be observed during capture or rejection of particles, but the laterofrontal cilia can bend toward the beating lateral cilia, a possible mechanism for releasing rejected particles from the ciliary sieve. (2) Localized changes of ciliary beat: the larvae may also concentrate particles by a local change in beat of lateral cilia in response to particles. The evidence is that the beat of lateral cilia changed coincident with captures of algal cells and that captured particles moved on paths consistent with a current redirected toward the frontal side of the tentacle by an induced local reversal of the lateral cilia. The change of beat of lateral cilia could have been an arrest rather than a reversal of ciliary beat, however. The similar ciliary bands in adult and larval lophophorates (brachiopods, phoronids, and bryozoans) suggest that these animals share a range of ciliary behaviours. The divergent accounts of ciliary feeding of lophophorates could be mostly the result of different authors observing different aspects of ciliary feeding.",

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is often considered to be restricted to vertebrates, however, cartilaginous tissues are also found within invertebrates. Unfortunately, most definitions and classification schemes for cartilages suffer from a strong vertebrate bias, severely hampering the efforts of those who have attempted to include invertebrate tissues as cartilage. To encompass all types of cartilage, current classification systems need to be expanded. Here we present vesicular cell‐rich as a new cartilage classification. Invertebrate cartilages, comparable to vertebrate cartilages at both cell and tissue levels, are composed of similar molecules, yet the extent to which they may be homologous is unknown. One option for studying the evolution of tissues is to adopt molecular phylogenetic approaches. However, the paucity of published molecular data makes addressing the evolution of cartilage using molecular phylogenetic approaches unrealistic at this time. Cartilage likely evolved from a chondroid connective tissue precursor, and may have been independently derived many times. The appearance of cartilaginous tissues of unknown phylogenetic affinities in such a wide diversity of animal groups warrants further investigation.",

At the posterior edge, aberrant stemma units may be present which lack a dioptric apparatus and have a star–shaped rhabdom composed of at least six retinula cells. The stemmata of Nannochorista appear to be derived from stemmata of the Panorpa ‐type (Mecoptera‐Panorpidae). Differences between the stemmata of Nannochorista and Panorpa can be explained as adaptations to aquatic life (flat cornea) or as regression. A compound larval eye is ascribed to the ground plan of the Mecoptera sensu lato and is considered a genuine plesiomorphy. The identical basic number (seven) of stemmata in the Neuropteroid/Coleoptera assemblage, Amphiesmenoptera and some Mecoptera (Bittacidae, Boreidae) is attributed to parallel evolution.",

These concepts are based on the putative lack of B‐cells in the differentiation zone of the hepatopancreas tubules. In the giant tiger prawn Penaeus monodon I could clearly identify differentiating B‐cells in that zone by using an ultrastructural distinguishing mark, the apical complex, that is much more sensitive than markers used before. Tracking of this feature from mature B‐cells through the differentiation zone up to the embryonic E‐cells revealed that B‐cells directly originate from E‐cells. The recognition of B‐cells as a separate cell line calls for a new functional interpretation. Ultrastructural and histochemical data suggest a degrading function. B‐cells may clear the hepatopancreas tubules from remnants of digestion in the time span between nutrient absorption and secretion of new digestive enzymes.",

At this phylogenetic level, the conflict between internal integration of the phenotype and its evolvability can be resolved by the correlated progression model, in which many disparate traits evolve by a sequence of small increments in loose correlation with one another, rather than by the modularity model. The trend leading to the new higher taxon implies the existence of a long ridge in an adaptive landscape. An evolutionary lineage tracking it requires adaptive changes in broad biological characteristics, involving many traits. Species selection is a possible additional driver of the trend. These conclusions are tested against the synapsid fossil record of the origin of mammals. The reconstructed sequence of acquisition of mammalian traits supports the correlated progression model. The adaptive ridge involved is postulated to have been a sequence of overlapping niches requiring increasing ability to remain active in daily and seasonally fluctuating environments by means of increasing internal regulation. An inferred speciation bias in favour of relatively small, relatively more progressive carnivores indicates that species selection was also involved in driving the trend. Palaeoenvironmental evidence indicates that ecological opportunity probably played a role at certain points along the lineage.",

Most of the 42 specimens studied came from the Greater Phyllopod bed (Walcott Quarry) and were collected from five bed assemblages, each representing a single obrution event. Specimens are probably preserved within their original habitat. In contrast to all brachiopods known from the Burgess Shale, the shells of the new stem group brachiopod are often deformed and do not show signs of brittle breakage, which suggests that the valves were originally either entirely organic in composition or, more likely, had just a minor mineral component. Acanthotretella spinosa differs from all the other described Cambrian brachiopods in that it is covered by long, slender and possibly partly mineralized spines that are posteriorly inclined at an oblique angle away from the anterior margin. The spines penetrate the shell and are mainly comparable with the thorn‐like organic objects that have been inferred from early siphonotretoid brachiopods. The pedicle was slender and was composed of a central coelomic region and emerged from an apical foramen at the end of an internal pedicle tube. The finding of a pedicle attached to the macrobenthic algae Dictyophycus and other epibenthos implies that A. spinosa did not have an infaunal mode of life. The visceral region and interior characters are poorly preserved.",

As a unique feature in coelomate spiralians it was found that the perikarya of all muscle cells are located internal to the entire contractile muscular layer. The muscles are solitary myocytes embedded in extracellular matrix. Masses of secretory and indifferent cells occur inside the muscles. Two types of secretory cells were distinguished. Both of them apparently undergo holocrine secretion. A complete lining of thin peritoneal cells delimits the body cavity. Also, the gut and sperm sac have a complete peritoneal lining. The coelomic lining of the gut is a single‐layered myoepithelium, that of the sperm sac a pseudo‐stratified myoepithelium. The vas deferens was seen to be ciliated. The entrance of the sperm sac is formed by a ciliated funnel that leads into the reservoir by means of a thin, ciliated canal.

The main spawning event of the population is highly synchronized, occurring on a single night each year between the last quarter and the new moon in mid summer. The released orange eggs are held together by mucus and remain attached amongst the polyps on the outside of the female colonies. Twelve hours after spawning, the young embryos have blastomeres of equal size with numerous microvilli on their external surface. Due to unequal cleavage, bizarre embryos are also formed. By 48 h a blastopore is visible, indicating that a gastrula is developing. Eight days after spawning mature planulae are observed. The external mode of embryo development on the surface of the parent colony reduces dispersal of the planulae. However, this reproductive feature enhances formation of locally dense populations of C. hamra , with distinct habitat preferences.",

Through macroscopic and histological analyses of the female gonads, six stages of ovarian development could be distinguished. The histological description of the testis was made only from adult males. Through analyses of the genital pores and gonads, three sexual forms were distinguished in P. defossus : intersexed females (246), intersexed males (259), and individuals with an ootestis (7). Individuals with an ootestis had a gonad that produced male and female reproductive cells simultaneously. Parastacus defossus can be classified as a partially protandric hermaphrodite species.",

It successively takes into account data from morphology and embryology, from the structure of the nervous system, from palaeontology and from developmental genetics. Discussion focuses on possible homologies between the head segments and appendages in arachnomorphs and those in mandibulates. The comparative anatomical and ontogenetic data, especially those concerning the central nervous system, its connections with the stomatogastric system, and head innervation, show many similarities between the head organization of chelicerates and that of mandibulates, and lead to conclusions that contradict some of the hypotheses deduced from recent studies on developmental biology, but favour more traditional views. In particular they support the presence of a deutocerebral segment in the head region of the ground pattern of arthropods and its loss in all extant chelicerates. They also support the homology of the cheliceral ganglia with the tritocerebral ganglia of mandibulates. The possible existence of a precheliceral segment and of a presegmental acron remains open to question.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Magadictyon haikouensis (Luo and Hu, 1999) from the Early Cambrian Chengjiang Lagerstätte, an incomplete specimen of a large lobopod with strong appendages, has been regarded as related to the lobopods Microdictyon and Onychodictyon . Newly discovered complete specimens of Magadictyon cf. haikouensis (found by the Early Life Institute field team) show that the taxon, in addition to its strong appendages with appendicules, also had a head bearing similar caecum‐like structures to those of the arthropod Naraoia and Chelicerate, ‘ Peytoia ’‐like mouthparts and frontal appendages. Because of their similarity, the caecum‐like structures of Magadictyon cf. haikouensis are considered to be homologous with those of stem‐group arthropods. The ‘ Peytoia ’‐like mouthparts and the frontal appendages are similar to those of the AOPK ( Anomalocaris–Opabinia–Pambdelurion–Kerygmachela ) group. In addition, the appendages with appendicules show that Magadictyon cf. haikouensis is closely related to Onychodictyon . Therefore, Magadictyon cf. haikouensis is regarded here as a rare transitional form between lobopods and arthropods. Besides, together with other lobopods, the morphology of Magadictyon cf. haikouensis demonstrates that the Cambrian lobopods appear to have been diverse and not particularly closely related to one another, and do not seem to represent a monophyletic clade.",

This comparative study revealed a wide variation in the cloacal morphology. Fifteen morphological characters were considered to be primary homology hypotheses and were optimized over the topology derived from the parsimony analysis of the available soft morphological evidence, including the characters described in this study. The synapomorphies optimized for Squamata are bifid urodaeum, common urodaeal cavity with similar histological features of the urodaeal horns, and presence of glands in the anterior urodaeum; for Scleroglossa the synapomorphy is the lateral position of the vaginal intrusion into the anterior urodaeal chamber, for Nyctisaura + Scincomorpha the synapomorphy is the presence of a bifid posterior urodaeum; and for Xantusidae + Annulata it is the presence of simple glands in the anterior urodaeum. The central position of the vaginal intrusion into the urodaeal chamber and the intraepithelial position of the glandular unit in the anterior urodaeum behave as autapomorphies for Iguanidae. This study contributes evidence that defines the relationships within Scleroglossa. Cloacal features provide interesting information that is useful as a source of morphological characters for phylogenetic studies in Squamata.",

The olfactory organ has the shape of an open groove with a protruding papilla. In embryos and early juveniles the groove is smooth and is provided with a continuous sensory epithelium. During ontogenesis the papilla develops and the composition of the epithelium is changed as areas of nonsensory epithelium appear and eventually separate the sensory epithelium into islets. In adults the sensory epithelium consists of supporting, basal, and two types of receptor cells, ciliated and microvillous. In juveniles also ciliated nonsensory cells are present. This difference can be correlated with differing locomotory habits of adults and juveniles. The receptor cilia show a 9 + 0 microtubular pattern while the nonsensory cilia have the general 9 + 2 pattern. Deviating dendritic endings were found and are considered an indication of ongoing cell dynamics.",

Here we investigate in detail the outer ‘homogeneous’ layer of the lyonsiid bivalve Entodesma navicula . The apparently equigranular crystals (up to 10 µm) are, in fact, short prisms which grow in a dense organic matrix with their c ‐axes and fibre axes coincident, perpendicular to the growth surface. These prisms are distinct from the aragonitic prisms grown by other bivalves in both their morphology and their mode of growth and so we propose the term granular prismatic microstructure. The organic content of granular prisms (7.4%) is the highest yet recorded for any molluscan microstructure and it is apparent that the short prisms have grown within a gel‐filled space. Although this high organic content is likely to make the microstructure metabolically expensive to produce, it has the benefit of making the valves very flexible. This may be advantageous in the intertidal zone inhabited by E. navicula by allowing a tight seal between the valves.",

The organisation of invertebrate brains: cells, synapses and circuits. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 64–71 Invertebrate brains are structurally diverse. Neuron numbers range from ∼10 2 to 10 8 in different groups, compared with larger numbers in vertebrate brains, ∼10 7 to 10 14 . The underpopulated brains of invertebrates are noted in their extreme cases for having few cells, and neurons that can be identified from animal to animal, many known in great detail. Although few in number, invertebrate neurons nevertheless comprise many classes. Correlated with the paucity of their number they are sparsely connected, many having ∼50 synapses or fewer. Synaptic densities, roughly 1 per μm 3 of neuropile, differ little from those for much larger vertebrate neurons. Invertebrate neurons differ from their vertebrate counterparts in the position of their soma, generally in a cortex surrounding the neuropile that consequently occupies a relatively small volume. Their axons typically lack myelin and, supporting a range of conduction velocities, have diameters that differ over a wide range, from 10 3 to 10 −1 μm. Nerves with thousands of axons differ from neuropile fascicles, which typically have 20 or less. Unlike most vertebrate synapses, but like those of the vertebrate retina, synapses in many invertebrate groups – probably all ecdysozoans and possibly some lophotrochozoans – have synaptic contacts with multiple postsynaptic elements, dyads, triads and so on.",

Suppositions and misconceptions about missing data, often couched in terms of ‘wildcard taxa’ and ‘the missing data problem’, continue to cloud the literature on the topic of fossils and phylogenetics. Comparisons of real data sets show that no a priori (or indeed a posteriori ) decisions can be made about amounts of missing data and most properties of cladograms, and both simulated and real data sets demonstrate that even highly incomplete taxa can impact on relationships. The exclusion of fossils from phylogenetic analyses is neither theoretically nor empirically defensible.",

Individual plates of the head and trunk shield show considerable variation between individuals. Plates that show the greatest degree polymorphic traits are the rostral (R), marginal (M), submarginal (SM), preorbital (PrO), anterior dorsolateral, anterior median ventral (AMV) and posterior ventrolateral (PVL) plates. The paths of the sensory line canals are the most variable feature and the dermal plates of the cheek show the greatest asymmetry. It is apparent that if anatomical data in arthrodires are to be interpreted with greater precision, detailed knowledge of intraspecies variation, polymorphic and asymmetric traits is essential. How these variables are treated in cladistic analysis is also critical. Here multistate characters were coded differently in five discrete analyses, each analysis yielding a different number of trees and relationships. It was concluded that including and coding for multistate characters gave the most robust tree. In addition, further morphological characters from a new specimen of Gogosteus sarahae Long (1994 ) indicates many of the characters used to separate this genus from Incisoscutum are inconsistent and so it is here considered that the genus Gogosteus is a junior synonym of Incisoscutum.",

The first examination by neutron tomography of a skull of Lystrosaurus declivis (Therapsida, Anomodontia) from the Lower Triassic of South Africa showed complexly constructed cartilaginous maxilloturbinals in the nasal cavity. They were situated directly in the respiratory air flow and fill out most of the ventral part of the nasal chamber. Because maxilloturbinals in extant mammals and birds serve as a countercurrent exchange system for thermoregulation and humidification, their presence in the anomodont Lystrosaurus suggests strongly that Lystrosaurus was already endothermic. The endothermic metabolism allowed Lystrosaurus to tolerate high ambient temperature fluctuations. The complexly constructed maxilloturbinals could have reduced respiratory water loss because of higher ventilation rates in drought conditions in the Karoo basin.",

The cytological differences between the two assumed gonadotropic cells are reviewed. The pseudoisocyanine technique gave a selective fluorescent picture of the assumed gonadotropes. Fine structural analysis shows that the gonadotropic cells close to the neurohypophysis are innervated by one type of fiber in contrast to most of the gonadotropic cells, which are not innervated. In the latter case the neuroendocrine information reaches the gonadotropic cells by a median eminence system in which the intervascular channels in the proximal pars distalis are the last parts.",

The overall incidence of limb loss in C. bairdi was 38.8 %, with female adults less prone to damage than males and juveniles. Limb loss increases in frequency in more posterior limbs. Right hand limbs are lost more often than left in both species. This \"right handedness\" appears to be widespread in crabs and may be due to the greater vulnerability of leading limbs.

The present morphological study describes the color of hatchling, juvenile, and adult crocodilian skin and the origin of its pigmentation. In situ hybridization and immunostaining indicate that crocodilian scales grow as an expansion of the proliferating epidermis of the hinge region that form thin lateral rings. In more central areas of growing scales, new epidermal layers contribute to increase the thickness of the stratum corneum. The dark pigmentation and color pattern derive from the different distribution of epidermal and dermal chromatophores. The more intensely pigmented stripes, irregular patches and dot-like spots, especially numerous in dorsal scales, derive from the incorporation of the eumelanosomes of epidermal melanocytes in differentiating beta cells of the epidermis. Dermal melanophores, mainly localized in the loose upper part of the dermis, also contribute to the formation of the dark or gray background of crocodilian scales. The eumelanosomes of dermal melanophores determine the darkening of the skin pattern in association with the epidermal melanocytes. Iridophores are infrequent, while xantophores are present in the species analyzed with a sparse distribution in the superficial dermis among melanophores. The presence of xantophores and of the few iridophores in areas where epidermal melanocytes are absent appear to determine the brown or the light yellow-orange background observed among the darker regions of crocodilian scales.",

No fluorescence characteristic of monamines is found in the rostral pars distalis, in the proximal pars distalis or in the cells of the nucleus lateralis tuberis (NLT), although fluorescent varicosities are found within the ventral hypothalamus in the vicinity of the NLT. Bilateral clusters of fluorescent cell bodies are located in the ventral hypothalamus (posterior to the NLT); some of these cells border the neurohypophysis. Fluorescent tracts from these cell clusters extend to a pair of elongate nuclei of nonfluorescent neurons which are surrounded by fluorescent varicosities. Alteration of osmotic conditions did not effect the fluorescence, except for the caudal neurosecretory cells of fish exposed to fresh water for long periods. Adrenergic nervous input thus seems to be an important component of both the cranial and caudal neurosecretory systems.",

Postnatal ontogenetic scaling of Nesodontine (Notoungulata, Toxodontidae) cranial morphology. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 249–259. Toxodontidae is a clade of endemic South American ungulates that comprises medium to very large animals, including strict megammamals, i.e., 1000 kg or more. Adinotherium at approximately 120 kg and Nesodon at 550 kg are, respectively, the smallest and the largest Nesodontinae of Santacrucian age (early Miocene). The large number of specimens recorded and the quality of preservation (including very young animals) permit a morphometric study of cranial ontogeny. We measured 17 cranial variables on an ontogenetic series of 23 specimens of Adinotherium ovinum and 11 of Nesodon imbricatus . Bivariate analysis (standardized major axis) was performed to obtain the coefficients of allometry using skull length as the independent variable. Results indicate that eight of 16 variables show an isometric trend, seven exhibit positive allometry, and only the height of the orbit in N. imbricatus exhibits negative allometry. Contrary to expectation, neurocranial variables are positively allometric or isometric. With respect to the splanchnocranium, most variables related to the rostrum, palate, and masticatory muscles show positive allometry, suggesting a strengthening of masticatory system in adults of both taxa. The splanchnocranial allometric trends fail to support previous inferences of specialized herbivory, suggesting generalized herbivory in nesodontines.",

In this study, we describe the sounds, their context-specific emission and the structures related to sound production of the carnivorous larvae of Ceratophrys ornata (Amphibia, Anura, Ceratophryidae). Tadpoles emit a brief, clear and very audible metallic-like sound that consists of a short train of notes that occur at all stages of larval development. Tadpoles make sound only when a conspecific tadpole is preying upon it or when touched by an object. Ceratophrys ornata larvae possess the basic required anatomical structures for sound production via expulsion of atmospheric air from the lungs through the open soft-tissue glottis. The glottis is opened and closed via the larval laryngeal muscles (constrictor laryngis and dilatator laryngis). The arytenoid cartilages appear at stage 40 and the cricoid cartilage does at stage 43. Adult laryngeal muscles differentiate from the larval ones at stage 46 together with the vocal sac formation from the adult interhyoideus muscle. We demonstrate (n = 2160 conspecific predator–prey interactions) that larval sounds occur always under predatory attack, probably serving to diminish the chances of cannibalism. These data raise the possibility that other macrophagic carnivorous anuran larvae may produce sound.",

Rose bitterling ( Rhodeus ocellatus ) embryos parasitize freshwater mussels by competing for nutrients and oxygen. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00 : 1–6. Understanding how parasites inflict fitness costs on their hosts is a key question in host–parasite biology. Rose bitterling ( Rhodeus ocellatus ) are small cyprinid fish that place their eggs in the gills of living freshwater mussels. The embryos complete their development inside the mussel gill and emerge as free‐swimming larvae after approximately 4 weeks. Bitterling show a range of specialized adaptations for using mussels as a spawning substrate, and the presence of bitterling embryos has been shown to retard the growth of mussels. We compared the development and survival of embryos incubated in either mussels or Petri dishes and exposed to either nutrient‐rich or nutrient‐poor pond water. Embryonic development rate was significantly faster in Petri dishes, probably as a result of oxygen limitation in mussel gills. Embryo survival rate was significantly higher in nutrient‐rich than filtered water, suggesting that the embryos obtained a nutritional benefit prior to emergence from the host. The results imply that bitterling embryos compete for oxygen and nutrients with their host mussel, as well as each other, and in this way, impose a growth cost on mussels.",

The cytology and distribution of chromatophores responsible for skin pigmentation in chelonians is analyzed. Epidermal melanocytes are involved in the formation of dark spots or stripes in growing shelled and non‐shelled skin. Melanocytes rest in the basal layer of the epidermis and transfer melanosomes into keratinocytes during epidermal growth. Dermal melanophores and other chromatophores instead remain in the dermis and form the gray background of the skin. When dermal melanophores condense, they give origin to the dense spots or stripes in areas where no epidermal melanocytes are present. In the latter case, the epidermis and the corneous layer are transparent and reveal the dermal distribution of melanophores and other chromatophores underneath. As a result of this basic process of distribution of pigment cells, the dark areas visible in scales can have a double origin (epidermal and dermal) or a single origin (epidermal or dermal). Xanthophores, lipophores, and a cell containing both pterinosomes and lipid droplets are sparse in the loose dermis while iridophores are rarely seen in the skin of chelonians analyzed in the present study. Xanthophores and lipophores contribute to form the pale, yellow or oranges hues present among the dark areas of the skin in turtles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The morphology of the system subcommissural organ—Reissner's fibre—terminal ampulla is described in the newt Pleurodeles waltli . A participation of phagocytes in terminal decomposition of the fibre secretion is supposed. In order to get information on the still unclarified function of the complex subcommissural organ—Reissner's fibre the subcommissural organ of juvenile, postmetamorphic newts was mechanically removed and the consequences of the operation were studied up to 18 months post operationem. About 4 weeks p.op. the animals developed kyphoses and scolioses of the vertebral column, due to growth anomalies in the area of intercentral cartilages. Lesions in the area of the habenular commissure including partial epiphysectomy, performed as control operations, were without effect on the axial skeleton. Total epiphysectomy resulted in curvatures of the skeletal axis only if simultaneously as an incidental consequence of the operation the subcommissural organ was unable to form the Reissner's fibre. In order to block the transport of Reissner's fibre into the central canal Agar or polystyrene latex was filled into the IV. ventricle of the brain, damages of nervous tissue being avoided. The newts developed the same deformations of vertebral column as they did after ectomy of subcommissural organ. If in the further course of the experiment the ventricular spaces allowed the fibre to pass again, the curvatures of the skeletal axis disappeared, provided that the length growth of the animal body was sufficient. Thus the absence of Reissner's fibre in the central canal of spinal cord was the cause of the abnormalities of the vertebral column. On conditions of experimentally produced absence of Reissner's fibre the newts formed atypical tail tip regenerates with curved axes after tail tip amputations. A hypothesis is developed according to which the subcommissural organ controls by means of the formation of Reissner's fibre the straight outgrowth of the axial organs: ependymal tube, spinal cord and vertebral column and hence guarantees the normogenetical growth extension of the vertebrate organism. Therefore the function of the subcommissural organ should be understood from an aspect of the developmental physiology. Zusammenfassung Die Morphologie des Systems Subcommissuralorgan—Reissnerscher Faden—Endampulle beim Rippenmolch ( Pleurodeles waltli ) wird beschrieben. Es wird eine Beteiligung von Phagozyten am terminalen Abbau des Fadensekrets vermutet. Um Hinweise auf die noch ungeklärte Funktion des Komplexes Subcommissuralorgan—Reissnerscher Faden zu erhalten, wurde das Subcommissuralorgan bei juvenilen, postmetamorphotischen Rippenmolchen auf mikrurgischem Wege entfernt und die Folgen des Eingriffs bis zu 18 Monaten post operationem studiert. Etwa 4 Wochen p.op. zeigten sich charakteristische Ausfallserscheinungen in Form von Kyphosen und Skoliosen der Wirbelsäule, denen Wachstumsanomalien im Bereich der Intervertebralknorpel zugrunde lagen. Zu Kontrollzwecken gesetzte Läsionen im Bereich der Commissura habenularum einschließlich partieller Epiphysektomie blieben ohne Wirkung auf das Achsenskelett. Totale Epiphysektomie hatte nur dann Skelettachsenverkrümmungen zur Folge, wenn die Operation gleichzeitig zur Verhinderung der Fadenbildung am Subcommissuralorgan geführt hatte. Um den Transport des Reissnerschen Fadens in den Zentralkanal zu blockieren, wurde unter Schonung des Nervengewebes Agar oder Polystyrol‐Latex in den IV. Ventrikel eingebracht. Es kam zu gleichen Wirbelsäulendeformationen wie nach Ektomie des Subcommissuralorgans. Wurden die Ventrikelräume im späteren Versuchsverlauf wieder durchgängig, bildeten sich bei entsprechendem Längenwachstum der Versuchstiere die Verbiegungen der Skelettachse zurück. Ursache der Wirbelsäulenanomalien war mithin das Fehlen des Reissnerschen Fadens im Zentralkanal des Rückenmarks. Bei experimentell herbeigeführter Abwesenheit des Reissnerschen Fadens kam es nach Schwanzspitzenamputationen zur Ausbildung atypischer, achsenverkrümmter Regenerate. Es wird eine Hypothese entwickelt, gemäß der das Subcommissuralorgan über die Bildung des Reissnerschen Fadens das gestreckte Auswachsen der Axialorgane Ependymrohr, Rückenmark und Wirbelsäule kontrolliert und damit die normogenetische Wachstumsstrekkung des Wirbeltierorganismus garantiert. Die Funktion des Subcommissuralorgans wäre folglich unter entwicklungsphysiologischen Aspekten zu sehen.",

The ovarian cycle histochemistry and its relationship with hepatopancreas weight in the blue crab Callinectes danae (Crustacea: Portunidae). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00 :1–13. Several studies use macroscopic patterns of the ovarian development in crustaceans. Here, we examined the relationship between ovary histochemistry, changes in gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices against the macroscopic pattern of the ovarian development in Callinectes danae . Animals were collected in the south coast of São Paulo State, Brazil. Ovaries were macroscopically classified as juvenile, rudimentary, developing, intermediary, mature, and rudimentary ovigerous. Samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, processed for historesin, and stained with HE, protein, and neutral and acid polysaccharides detection. The juvenile oocytes are not enclosed by follicular cells and have fewer yolk nuclei being less intense in PAS reactivity than rudimentary oocytes. Developing oocytes show yolk granules and thick follicular cells. Yolk granules were positive for proteins and neutral polysaccharides. The intermediary stage is marked by a qualitative increase in yolk granules and the onset of chorion formation. In mature oocytes, cytoplasm is completely filled by yolk granules and the chorion is completely formed. Ovigerous ovaries have several atretic follicles and large quantities of hemocytes in the process of tissue reorganization. In C. danae, the changes in cell, goandosomatic and hepatosomatic indices coinciding with macroscopic observations and any combination of different macroscopic stages in a single pattern should be avoided.",

Thus, the changes occurring during postmetamorphic stages have largely been overlooked. Herein, we describe cranial and postcranial skeletogenesis, and change in skull shape through the metamorphic and postmetamorphic development of Leptodactylus bufonius . Several elements, particularly those of the cranium, are already ossified at metamorphic climax; among these elements are the frontoparietals, prootics, premaxillae, maxillae, squamosals, pterygoids, neopalatines, angulosplenials, dentaries, mentomeckelians, and the mesosternum. Determining the exact timing of ossification of some elements is difficult because variation in their development may result from extrinsic factors. The otic region and that of the jaw closure undergo the greatest changes in shape, which may imply functional constraints. The development of many skeletal elements is still incomplete at metamorphosis; thus, the changes occurring postmetamorphically are crucial to achieving the configuration and function of an adult skeleton.

In some cryptochirid species, females live in open depressions accessible to males; while in others, females are rather isolated in semiclosed galls, which necessitates elaborate sperm storage capabilities by the female. In this study we investigate the female gross morphology and reproductive systems of Fungicola syzygia lodged in semiclosed flattened pits, Opecarcinus cathyae with semiopen pits and Pseudocryptochirus viridis from shallow open depressions using line drawings and histological methods. The general morphology of the cryptochirids' reproductive systems is uniform and conforms to other thoracotreme brachyurans: paired muscular vaginae of the concave pattern lead from the sternal gonopores into paired seminal receptacles where sperm is stored. The seminal receptacle is internally lined by distinct types of epithelia: a cuticle underlined by a columnar epithelium ventrally, a monolayered secretory epithelium dorsally and a multilayered transfer tissue where the oviducts enter the seminal receptacle. In all studied specimens, the seminal receptacle contained free spermatozoa; however, in specimens of Pseudocryptochirus viridis it also contained spermatophores, indicating a recent insemination. In contrast to most other brachyurans ovaries of the investigated cryptochirids extend into the pleon. The specific degree of ovary extension differs between the studied species and is closely related to female body shape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Embryos and larvae of an isocrinid sea lily, M etacrinus rotundus , are described by scanning electron microscopy. Around hatching (35 h after fertilization), the outer surface of the gastrula becomes ubiquitously covered with short cilia. At 40 h, the hatched swimming embryo develops a cilia‐free zone of ectoderm on the ventral side. By 3 days, the very early dipleurula larva develops a cilia‐free zone ventrally, densely ciliated regions laterally, and a sparsely ciliated region dorsally. At this stage, the posterior and anterior ciliary bands first appear: the former runs along a low ridge separating the densely from the sparsely ciliated epidermal regions, while the latter is visible, at first discontinuously, along the boundary between the densely ciliated lateral regions and the cilia‐free ventral zone. In the late dipleurula larva (5 days after fertilization), the anterior and posterior loops of ciliary bands are well defined. The transition from the dipleurula to the semidoliolaria larva occurs at 6 days as the posterior loop becomes rearranged to form incompletely circumferential ciliary bands. The larva becomes competent to settle at this stage. The arrangement of the ciliary bands on the semidoliolaria is maintained during the second week of development, while the larva retains its competence to settle. The larval ciliary patterns described here are compared with those of stalkless crinoids and eleutherozoan echinoderms. The closest morphological similarities are between M . rotundus and the basal eleutherozoan class A steroidea.",

Larvae induced to settle on bivalve shells and cultured in the laboratory developed into late cystideans. Three‐dimensional (3 D ) images reconstructed from very early to middle cystideans indicated that 15 radial podia composed of five triplets form synchronously from the crescent‐shaped hydrocoel. The orientation of the hydrocoel indicated that the settled postlarvae lean posteriorly. In very early cystideans, the orals, radials, basals and infrabasals, with five plates each in the crown, about five columnals in the stalk, and five terminal stem plates in the attachment disc, had already formed. In mid‐cystideans, an anal plate appeared in the crown. Late cystideans cultured in the field developed into pentacrinoids about 5 months after settlement. These pentacrinoids shared many crown structures with adult sea lilies. On the other hand, many features of the stalk differed from those in adult isocrinids, while sharing many characteristics with the stalk of feather star pentacrinoids, including disc‐like proximal columnals, high and slender median columnals, synarthrial articulations developmentally derived from the symplexial articulations, limited formation of cirri only in the proximal columnal(s), and an attachment disc. On the basis of these findings, phylogenetic relationships among extant crinoid orders are discussed.",

The deployment of the adhesive system is activated by the musculoskeletal system during active traverses of such surfaces, but adhesion on such substrata can also be achieved by passive means, with the body weight of the gecko applying tensile loading to the adhesive setae, maintaining prolonged, static contact with the surface. To investigate whether passively induced adhesion is employed by geckos holding station on smooth vertical surfaces, we investigated the magnitude of shear force generation for the manus and pes, and the positioning of the limb segments and digits in C hondrodactylus bibronii in freely selected resting postures (head‐up, head‐down and facing laterally to the left and right). Our results indicate that different subsets of digits occupy positions consistent with them being passively loaded in different body orientations. Limb segment and digit orientation are consistent within, and differ between, the resting postures, and relatively few of the 20 digits are positioned to take advantage of gravitationally induced loading in any posture. The pedal digits have greater adhesive potential than the manual ones and, more frequently, capitalize on passive loading than do manual digits. This is especially evident in the commonly adopted head‐down resting posture.",

Using confocal immunohistochemistry, we determined the coexpression of specific neurochemical markers. Colocalization studies showed that 5 HT is coexpressed with calbindin and nNOS and choline acetyltransferase (Ch AT ) is coexpressed with nNOS in the PGC s. This study also shows for the first time the simultaneous occurrence of piscidin 1 and 5 HT in the PGC s. The function of these cells being equivalent to ones found in fish gill subepithelial parenchyma is still not known. Due to the importance of piscidin 1 in local immune defence, more research is to be useful to understand a possible interaction of PGC s with immune response in the bichir lung. In fact, the capacity of PGC s to produce NO and other neuroactive substances found in immune cells of fish may represent a primitive form of immunoregulation of innate immunity and specifically antimicrobial function as NO induction and respiratory burst activity are correlated with immune response.",

To more thoroughly comprehend the steroidogenic pathways that govern the seasonal reproductive cycle, we investigated the mRNA expression of key enzymes involved in the androgenic and oestrogenic biosynthesis pathways in the testis of frogs taken in the reproductive and postreproductive period. Furthermore, we also analysed androgen and oestrogen levels and their own receptor gene expressions. Our findings showed that during the reproductive period, 3β‐hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17β‐hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 5α‐reductase mRNA levels were higher than those during the postreproductive period. High testosterone and 5α‐dihydrotestosterone titres as well as the expression levels of androgen receptors in the reproductive testis strongly confirmed that the androgenic pathway is necessary for spermatogenesis activation. Conversely, during the postreproductive period, the highest P450 aromatase, estrogen receptor α and β mRNA levels, paralleling with oestradiol titres, indicated that the oestrogenic pathway is essential for the interruption of the reproductive processes. Our findings demonstrated, for the first time in amphibians, that testicular endocrine cyclic activity could be modulated by the up‐regulation of key steroidogenic enzyme gene expressions. This in turn determines the activation of the androgenic pathway in reproductive phase and the oestrogenic one in postreproductive phase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The killifish genus Aphaniops consists of nine species distributed in Eastern Africa and the Middle East. However, distinguishing these species from each other based on morphological traits is challenging. Here we investigate the utility of otoliths (sagittae) in distinguishing between A. dispar , A. ginaonis , A. hormuzensis , A. kruppi and A. stoliczkanus . Our approach is based on otoliths from 89 specimens and involves (1) otolith morphometrics, following prior recommendations, (2) shape analysis of otolith contours based on discrete wavelet transformation—a novel method in killifish otolith research—and comparative statistical analyses. Both methods reveal significant interspecific variation in the otolith regions of the rostrum, antirostrum and excisura. While method (1) effectively discriminates most species, method (2) struggles to differentiate A. hormuzensis , A. stoliczkanus and A. kruppi . Additionally, both methods encounter challenges in correctly classifying A. hormuzensis due to the high otolith variability of this species in our sample. Possible factors accounting for their variability are environmental fluctuations at the sampled hot sulphuric spring (Khurgo) and potential introgressive hybridization. We conclude that otolith morphometry is a valuable tool for Aphaniops species identification. Furthermore, we found that the distinctiveness of species‐specific otolith traits increases with the divergence age of the species.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fish, first jawed vertebrate group appearing in evolution, have immune system similar to those of mammals. These early animals' innate and adaptive immune systems are completely developed, having head kidney and thymus as primary, spleen and mucosa associated lymphoid tissue as secondary immune organs. The adaptive immunity performs key role in defence against recurring infections and elimination of fish pathogens with the help of its memory cells, T‐cell‐receptors and immunoglobulins. Epidermal secretions including antibacterial peptides, lysozymes, lectins, complement and C‐reactive proteins which function in disruption of antigens, phagocytosis, inflammatory response and mending of tissue injury play a significant role as elements of fish immune system. Fish, however, have greater innate immunity than humans do. Estrogens play crucial role in immunomodulation through nuclear oestrogen receptors, which are found in majority of immune cells and lymphoid organs in fish. There is mounting proof that xenoestrogens, that can attach as agonists to oestrogen receptors, pose significant ecotoxicological risk by disrupting the defence mechanism in fish. Though less potent than natural oestrogen, they can bioaccumulate to finally reach a substantial dose. This review's objective is to give an overview of the fish defence system, its estrogenic regulation and estrogenic‐endocrine disruption.",

Antibody staining for expression of the gene Distal‐less demonstrates the formation of the labrum from a pair of regions in the ocular lobes, indicating a possible appendicular origin for the labrum. The chelicerae are followed from their initial postoral position through their anterior rotation to become preoral. The pedipalpal lobe, involved in the formation of the gnathosoma, is shown to be almost the size of the pedipalp at some stages, as well as expressing Distal‐less . The fourth pair of walking limbs are not present in oribatid prelarvae and larvae, however, their anlage are visible in later embryonic stages but these do not express the gene Distal‐less , suggesting that formation of distal structures is suppressed at this stage. Claparède’s organs, present between coxae of legs I and II of larvae, are shown for the first time unequivocally to derive from the base of legs II.

Transformation of the skin surface to produce scales takes place between stages 19 and 23, after which the shape of scales is complete over most of the embryonic surface. Scalation is not synchronous; different regions develop scales at different rates. Initially scales are formed on the back and dorsal side of the proximal tail and appear as undulations of the epidermis which form symmetrical (bumps) or asymmetrical (serrated) scale anlagen. No dermal condensations are apparent beneath the epidermis, although in some areas of the skin (belly, limbs) mesenchymal cells are more numerous within the bumps than in other areas. At stage 21, scalation has spread to the neck and belly but is absent or poorly developed over most areas of the flank, gular, jaw, limb and head regions. Grooves form between the outer edges of adjacent scales or interbump regions. A superficial denser dermis and a reticulated deep subdermis are visible in many scales from stage 21. The dermis forms a superficial loose and a deep dense layer from stage 22. Both loose and deep dermis, and sometimes the deep reticulate subdermis, move towards the surface to form the dermal core of scales, although the mechanism of this movement is not known. Bundles of collagen fibrils, with almost no elastic fibrils, are progressively deposited, especially in the denser dermis. At stage 22, the flank, gular and proximal areas of limbs form scales, but the head, jaw, distal limbs and digits still lack scales. The digits become scaled at stage 23 when scalation is well advanced in the other regions. By stage 24 most of the body is scaled and subsequent scale modifications occur only by growth. Five main types of scales are recognized by their shape: symmetrical scutes, asymmetrical scutes, overlapping scutes, tuberculate scales, and elevated asymmetrical scutes (tail verticils). Pigmentation, mainly due to epidermal melanocytes, is visible at embryonic stage 23 and progresses through stages 24 and 25.",

Both species are characterized by frontal dwarf ovicellate zooids, that are female autozooidal polymorphs in C. hyalina and simultaneous hermaphroditic autozooids in C. annulata . The latter species in addition has ovicellate autozooids of the usual type. Each ovicell is formed from a maternal zooid only, and its cavity is lined by the outer hemispherical fold (ooecium) and the distal zooidal wall. The coelomic cavity of the ooecium is separated from the body cavity of the maternal zooid by a transverse wall with simple pores. Each pore is closed by a cell plug, and the ooecia may be considered as kenozooids. Each oocyte is accompanied by a single nurse cell that degenerates after ovulation. The eggs are macrolecithal in C. annulata and microlecithal in C. hyalina , and the former species is a non‐placental brooder whereas the latter forms a placenta. Fertilization is precocious. Possible mechanisms of sperm entry as well as oviposition are discussed. The literature concerning ovicell structure and development in cheilostomates is analysed. It is proposed that the brood chamber of cribrimorphs evolved by a fusion of costae and a reduction of the daughter zooid in ancestral forms. © 1998 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Ultrathin sections of adult and the first juvenile stage O. dentatum are labelled with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin coupled to colloidal gold. The pharyngeal cuticle consists of a trilaminate epicuticle and an amorphous basal layer, which also exhibits individual fibres in adult worms. The pharyngeal cells of the first juvenile stage are already arranged as in the adult worm. In comparison with data for additional nematodes taken from the literature, a trilaminate epicuticle and an amorphous basal layer are postulated for the pharynx in the ground pattern of the Nematoda. Lectin‐gold labelling reveals a strong binding to the pharyngeal cuticle of O. dentatum . Competitive inhibition experiments with N ‐acetyl‐D‐glucosamine and triacetylchitotriose, as well as treatment with chitinase, neuraminidase and sulphuric acid, indicate that the pharyngeal cuticle contains chitin. This finding is supported by staining of the pharyngeal cuticle by the fluorescent brightener calcofluor white in cryosections of O. dentatum . The occurrence of chitin is interpreted as an original character of the Nematoda. © 1997 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The first four stages are passed within the egg‐membrane. The larval and the post‐larval phase are separated by a profound change in morphology that takes place between stages VI and VII. The larva shifts from a dorso‐ventrally flattened ‘larval’ appearance up to stage VI to a laterally flattened, more ‘adult’ appearance from stage VII. New morphological data have been revealed by this study, including (1) a large and globular larval dorsal organ; (2) the carapace starts its development from the segments of the first and second maxillae; (3) the anterior ramus of the second antenna in adult Cyclestheria hislopi is the endopod, and the posterior ramus the exopod. Direct development of the brood in Cyclestheria hislopi – unique among conchostracans – is compared with that of the Cladocera. If Cyclestheria is the sister group to the Cladocera, as favoured in this work, the classical neoteny theory of the Cladocera must be reconsidered, as there is no particular similarity between any adults of the Cladocera and any of the larval stages of Cyclestheria . It is suggested that Cyclestheria displays the type of development present in a cladoceran ancestor. A comparison between Cyclestheria and the Upper Cambrian ‘Orsten’ fossil Rehbachiella kinnekullensis reveals a remarkable similarity in the endite morphology of the trunk limbs.",

In the present paper, the brain, the circum‐oesophageal connectives and the innervation of, inter alia , the tentacular membrane (including the dorsal ridge), the buccal tentacles, the alimentary canal, the nuchal organs and the branchiae (when present) of Amphicteis gunneri , Anobothrus gracilis , Melinna cf. cristata , Pectinaria auricoma , P. belgica , P. koreni , Petta pusilla , Pista cristata , Eupolymnia nebulosa , Thelepus cincinnatus and Polycirrus medusa are described. The results are summarized in schematic diagrams and compared with each other and with the central nervous system of other polychaetes. It is concluded that the ampharetids, the pectinariids and the terebellids bear no antennae and no palps and that their buccal tentacles belong to the alimentary canal. It is emphasized that all attempts to range their cephalic nervous system into previously proposed common and general schemes of ‘the polychaete nervous system’ seem totally fruitless.",

Pillars are present in the epicuticle of almost all heterotardigrades, but these structures are also known in a few species of eutardigrades. The apparent heterogeneity of the cuticular ultrastructure in several species of the Macrobiotidae (Eutardigrada) prompted us to analyse the structure of the cuticle in this family. Eleven species in several genera were investigated with light and/or electron microscopy. All the species of the genera Murrayon and Dactylobiotus showed pillars in the epicuticle, whereas the examined species of Macrobiotus , Richtersius and Xerobiotus completely lacked pillars. Therefore, in the Macrobiotidae, in contrast to what appears with light microscopy, the cuticle is homogeneous within each genus examined at the electron microscopic level. Considering the absence of pillars in the Macrobiotidae a synapomorphy, we propose the erection of two new subfamilies. Macrobiotinae subfam. n. is characterized by the absence of pillars in the epicuticular layer and includes, in addition to the genera Macrobiotus, Xerobiotus and Richtersius, the genera Pseudohexapodibius, Adorybiotus, and probably also Minibiotus, Calcarobiotus and Pseudodiphascon . Murrayinae subfam. n. is characterized by the presence of pillars in the epicuticular layer and includes the genera Murrayon, Dactylobiotus and, probably, Macroversum.",

We have undertaken this work to compare odontode with tooth development, structure, attachment to a bony support and replacement. We studied the odontodes fixed on the scutes (i.e. postcranial dermal plates) in a growth series of Corydoras aeneus using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Odontodes are constituted of a pulp cavity surrounded by a cone of dentine itself capped with hypermineralized substance. The pulp cavity is devoid of nerves and blood vessels and there are no odontoblastic processes in the dentine. The dentine cone is firmly attached to a circular bony protuberance of the scute surface, the pedicel or attachment bone, by means of a ligament. An odontode anlage develops as a small invagination of a dermal papilla projecting into the epidermis, the basal cell layer of which constitutes a dental epithelium. First, dentine is deposited, next the hypermineralized substance, then the ligament and attachment bone. Odontodes develop in two positions with regard to the scute surface: a primary position when new odontodes form at the posterior border of the enlarging scute; a secondary position when new odontodes replace old odontodes that have been shed during thickening of the scute. In this case, the ligament and part of the base of the dentine cone are resorbed but not the pedicel of attachment bone, which is covered by deposition of scute matrix after the odontode has been shed. Within the scute matrix, the embedded pedicels of successive generations of odontodes are preserved, forming piles in the scutes of adult specimens.",

Distribution of spermatogonia and subsequent stages of development are consistent with an intermediate type of testes, somewhere between the restricted and unrestricted types. Spermatogenesis is semicystic, a feature rarely found in fish, which may account for the high vacuole count found both in the various spermatogenic phases and in the Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells cover the interior of the testicular lobes and have an initial phase of secretion. They go on to penetrate the lobular lumen and become phagosomes. The spermatozoon has a relatively long midpiece and is surrounded by large quantities of seminal fluid. The sperm makes its way from the central sperm duct to a series of peripheral ducts, where the sperm line up with their heads toward the epithelium and their tails toward the lumen. All indications are that this orientation facilitates the release of sperm onto the gelatinous mass of eggs, and that this could be linked to this type of semicystic spermatogenesis. Results obtained confirm that S. notata is a specialized ovuliparous species.",

In particular, skin from the snout of adult Australian lungfish ( Neoceratodus forsteri ) contains horizontal plexuses and vertical capillary loops which resemble in structure, size and density components of the cosmine layer in such Paleozoic lungfishes as Dipterus valenciennesi and Chirodipterus australis. In addition to these dermal papillae, the skin of the snout also contains ampullary electroreceptors, goblet cells, compound mucus glands, and terminal branches and openings of the mechanoreceptive lateral line system. Pore canal systems of fossil lungfishes previously have been interpreted as housing electroreceptors or other cutaneous sense organs of the lateral line system. In contrast, we regard pore canal systems as evidence of a complex cutaneous vasculature involved in the deposition of mineralized tissues. Prevailing ideas on the structure and biological role of cosmine are reinterpreted, including the theory that electroreceptors played an important part in the origin of the dermal skeleton.",

The flagellum has a lateral ‘undulating membrane’, containing a folded longitudinal cisterna and an axoneme. The basal body of the axoneme is at the anterior tip. The axoneme lacks outer dynein arms and extends through the entire flagellar region and most of the cell body. The main portion of the flagellum and of the cell body contains a series of vesicles with tightly packed tubules that may serve as a cytoskeleton. The cell body contains a partly condensed nucleus, several mitochondria and some cytoplasm. Some elongated mitochondria are arranged in the postnuclear region. When the spermatozoon moves, the undulations propagate from the basal body at the flagellar tip. Late spermatids can be recognized by the nucleus and the flagellum being coiled and enclosed within a common cell membrane. As in other rotifers, there are cigar–like cell products (‘rods’) in the testes. The general organization of the cell, including the absence of an evident acrosome, resembles that of the other known monogonont sperm types.",

Animals were fasted for 1 week while active or for 3–9 months during aestivation. Short-duration fasting (1 week) had little effect on the morphology of the small intestine, whilst prolonged fasting during aestivation induced marked enteropathy including reductions in intestinal mass, length and diameter, longitudinal fold height and tunica muscularis thickness. Enterocyte morphology was also affected markedly by prolonged fasting: enterocyte cross-sectional area and microvillous height were reduced during aestivation, intercellular spaces were visibly reduced and the prevalence of lymphocytes amongst enterocytes was increased. Mitochondria and nuclei were also affected by 9 months of aestivation with major disruptions to mitochondrial cristae and increased clumping of nuclear material and increased infolding of the nuclear envelope. The present study demonstrates that the intestine of an aestivating frog responds to prolonged food deprivation during aestivation by reducing in size, presumably to reduce the energy expenditure of the organ.",

The genus Lepidodasys has a debated phylogenetic position and has been linked in turn to the family Lepidodasyidae and the family Thaumastodermatidae. The sperm features of the two Lepidodasys species examined are distinct from those typical of the two families: the absence of the periaxonemal cylinder, a character shared only with Turbanellidae among Macrodasyida, could be considered as a symplesiomorphy, suggesting a basal position of the genus along the Macrodasyida clade. Moreover, a comparison of the spermatogenic process of Lepidodasys sp. with those of Acanthodasys aculeatus (Thaumastodermatidae) and Cephalodasys maximus (Lepidodasyidae) has revealed that the process of acrosome formation and nuclear morphology during spermatogenesis are peculiar in Lepidodasys sp. and differences are evident especially in the late stages of spermatogenesis.

The general muscle organization of the marine interstitial macrodasyidans, Paradasys and Turbanella , not only confirms earlier observation on other species but also adds new details concerning the organization and number of helicoidal, longitudinal and other muscle bands (e.g. semicircular band). The freshwater, epibenthic–epiphytic chaetonotid, Polymerurus nodicaudus , has a similar muscular organization to other species of Chaetonotidae, especially species of Chaetonotus , Halichaetonotus and Lepidodermella. Perhaps unique to Polymerurus is the combined presence of an unbranched Rückenhautmuskel (also in Halichaetonotus and Lepidodermella ) and a specialized dorsoventral caudal muscle, which flank the splanchnic component of the longitudinal muscles (only in Chaetonotus and Lepidodermella ). This combination, together with the presence of splanchnic dorsoventral muscles, known only in Xenotrichulidae, implies a unique phylogenetic position for Polymerurus , and indicates a potential basal position of this taxon among the Chaetonotidae studied so far (i.e. Aspidiophorus , Chaetonotus , Halichaetonotus and Lepidodermella ).",

Five types of monociliary receptors were identified: (1) non‐collared receptors with a single long and narrow ciliary rootlet; (2) non‐collared receptors with a wide main ciliary rootlet and a smaller posterior rootlet; (3) non‐collared receptors with a single wide and hollow ciliary rootlet with a granulated core; (4) Collar (?) receptors with obliquely radial filament bundles in the cell apex and with a single hollow ciliary rootlet composed of numerous strand‐like elements; and (5) Collar receptors lacking a striated rootlet but with a granular body (swallow's nest rootlet). While H. miamia bears the first two receptor types, P. bermudensis has receptors of type 1, 3 and 5, and Cona. thela and Conv. convoluta have receptors of type 3, 4 and 5. The density of receptors is generally highest at the anterior body tip, regardless of where the mouth is located. Most receptor types occur scattered over the whole body but type 2 receptors of H. miamia are restricted to the pharynx and mouth region. The lack of a common receptor type specific for the mouth and pharynx of the investigated species points to an independent origin of the pharynges in Hofsteniidae and in Proporidae and of the mouth tube in Convolutidae. Moreover, the homology of the so‐called collar receptors in Acoela with typical collar receptors in other invertebrates is questioned.",

The integument of copepods is of the arthropod type. Pore canals and other structures traversing the cuticle, common in most arthropods, are not always present in free‐living and some parasitic copepods. In parasitic forms, with advanced morphological changes, the cuticle is generally very thin and the epicuticle in many species forms external microvilli‐like structures. In the copepods hitherto investigated the epicuticle is probably the sole layer present in the cuticle. Some copepods show specialized regions of the cuticular surface, the function of which still remains obscure. Integumental organs and integumental structures are numerous and variable. The association of bacteria with the cuticle has been observed in many species. The structure of the integument of parasitic species lacking an alimentary tube and in close contact with the host tissue or hemocoelic cavity supports the idea that the integument could be the obligatory site of nutrient uptake. In spite of the relatively few species of copepods that have been investigated, a remarkable variation of cuticular fine structure has been revealed.",

The lumen of the heart is lined by a basal lamina and an associated epithelium, composed of myoepithelial cells with well developed thin and thick myofilaments. The heart is located in the pericardial cavity, which is deliminated by the pericardium. The latter is composed of two flat layers of myoepithelia with fused basal laminae. The outer layer of the pericardium is the protocoelomic lining, and the inner layer is the ‘parietal’ pericardial epithelium. The myoepithelium forming the heart wall can be considered to represent the ‘visceral’ pericardial epithelium. The spacious glomerular vessel is lined by a basal lamina, on which typical podocytes rest. These cells indicate that ultrafiltration takes place through the wall of the glomerular vessel. The lumen of the vessel contains fine granular material (presumably precipitated blood proteins), fibrils with a faint cross striation, suggesting that they represent collagen, and stellate cells, which in part line the vessel. Since ultrafiltration requires hydrostatic pressure, it is inferred that the blood flow is from the dorsal region then through the heart and into the glomerular vessel.",

Each of these bulbs contains four cell bodies, which, according to their fine structure, as well as the synaptic connections with receptor and brain fibers, belong to three different types. It is suggested that the sense organ is a chemosensor and that its remarkable similarity to the vertebrate mechanisms for olfaction makes it probable that the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica possesses a ‘protochordate’ counterpart to the craniate olfactory apparatus.",

Structural changes in the spermatophore of the freshwater ‘red claw’ crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus (Von Martens, 1898) (Decapoda, Parastacidae). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 88 : 000–000 The structure of the spermatophore was studied in Cherax quadricarinatus . Pieces of the distal vas deferens and transferred spermatophore from the females were fixed, cut and stained. Within the distal vas deferens, the primary layer and the secondary layer of the spermatophore were distinguishable. In the latter, two components were detected: cytoplasmic droplets and a homogeneous matrix. During the first 10 minutes post‐extrusion the cytoplasmic droplets drastically changed from looking like ‘empty droplets’; at this time the spermatophore changed from a liquid stage to a sticky one. One hour after extrusion the spermatophore began to harden and within the first 24–48 h post‐mating it was a solid and intense white structure tightly attached to the female; after 72 h it acquired a softer aspect, completely dehiscing between 96 and 120 h post‐mating. Histologically, the primary layer maintained its integrity surrounding the spermatozoa while the secondary layer lost the cytoplasmic droplets. The spermatophore began to hydrate between 24 and 48 h and by 72–96 h many sections of the sperm cord began to coalesce. From 48 h post‐mating some fissures appeared within the matrix that enlarged between 72 and 120 h. We propose that both manipulation by the female and hydration are the mechanisms involved in the release of the spermatozoa from the spermatophore.",

The erythrocytes are remarkably large, oval and nucleated. They are well defined in all their developmental stages by a characteristic micropinocytosis. They originate from blast cells which proliferate in the circulating blood. The blast cells probably form from agranulate stem cells of the intestinal myeloid tissue. The granulocytes constitute about half of the leucocytes. They are neutrophilic with a lobated nucleus. The granulocytopoiesis takes place in the intestinal myeloid tissue. The agranulocytes mainly include two cell types, termed spindle cells and lymphocyte‐like cells. These cell types, however, transform into each other. Macrophages occur essentially in the peritoneal cavity rarely in the blood. Transition forms between macrophages and granulocytes may exist. The blood also contains cells which on morphological grounds have been termed thrombocytes. Whether these cells are identical with those necessary for clotting of the blood remains to be proved. With the exception of erythroblasts, the different lines of blast cells are difficult to identify and distinguish from each other. Possibly all lines of blood cells originate from agranulate lymphocyte‐like stem cells, most of which are produced by the intestinal myeloid tissue.",

Cross‐species comparisons of certain characteristics, using size as a comparator to investigate scaling relationships, suggest certain relationships between subdigital pad area and body size. The manner in which the adhesive apparatus grows and scales within any one species, however, remains unknown, and it is unclear whether interspecific and intraspecific patterns are similar. To address this, we examined a post‐hatching ontogenetic series of the southern African gecko Chondrodactylus bibronii and demonstrate that setal density, setal basal diameter and setal spacing remain relatively constant in relation to size, indicating conserved subdigital pad assembly rules that are independent of size. Conversely, however, average and maximal setal lengths increase slightly and isometrically with size, an outcome that is probably explained by setal row recruitment, and the surface area of the subdigital pads scales close to, but below, isometry with respect to body mass and snout–vent length, it therefore does not increase sufficiently with size to compensate for the increase in mass. As a result, relative adhesive capacity decreases with growth with a regression slope of –0.45.",

Bilateral symmetry of the barb ridges determines the organization of feather cells into feather branching. The length of the barb ridges, derived from the number of cells associated to form the barbule plates, determines the length of the barbule branching. Long chains of barb cells form long barbs that branch from the rachis with an increase of feather size. Supportive cells function as spacers between the barbule cells. New cells derive from stem cells localized in the collar region of the feather follicle, as indicated from the re‐organization of collar cells into barb ridges (a morphogenetic process inherited from that of embryonic feathers), production of an embryonic type of keratin (feather keratin), permanence of periderm granules (typical embryonic organelles) in barb vane ridge cells. Variations in the process of barb ridge morphogenesis allow the fusion of ridges into a rachis. The differentiation of hooklets contributes to the origin of planar feathers. Separation between rachis and merging barb ridges is by supportive cells, derived from the marginal plates of the barb ridges. Speculations on the evolution and diversification of feathers are presented.",

There are no anterior but huge posterior byssal retractor muscles and both anterior and posterior pedal retractors. The ctenidia are of Type B(1a) and the ctenidial–labial palp junction is Category 3. The ctenidia collect, filter and undertake the primary sorting of potential food in the inhalant water. The labial palps are small with simple re‐sorting tracks on the ridges of their inner surfaces. The ciliary currents of the mantle cavity appear largely concerned with the rejection of particulate material. The mantle margin comprises an outer and an (either) inner or middle fold. The outer fold is divided into outer and inner components that secrete the shell and are photo‐sensory, respectively. The latter bears a large number of pallial eyes, especially posteriorly. The inner/middle mantle fold of A. noae , possibly representative of simpler, more primitive conditions, may have differentiated into distinct folds in other recent representatives of the Bivalvia.",

The eye stalks are greatly transformed, but contain hypertrophied retinas. The ommatidia of all three species lack a dioptric apparatus, possessing only retinular cells, which are arranged in a cylinder‐like fashion. Folds from the retinular cells project into the “cylinder” and are covered with microvilli. The arrangement is explained functionally by an increase in the photopigment‐bearing surface as an adaptation to low‐light intensities. The orderly arrangement of microvilli in most arthropod compound eyes has been lost, and the arrangement is thus multidirectional in these mysids. With the photopigment dipoles arranged along the microvillar axis, the disorderly arrangement of microvilli signifies a more efficient capture of non‐polarized light. It is concluded that the mysid compound eyes show adaptations to low‐light intensities probably acquired during the species' evolutionary descent into deep‐sea habitats. Amblyops abbreviata and Pseudomma affine , belonging to genera with entirely transformed eyes and with an ultrastructure less “normal” than that of Boreomysis scyphops are believed to be earlier descendants into the deep‐sea habitats than the latter species, which belongs to a genus in which most of the species have well‐developed eyes.",

The ovaries were light‐pink and smooth and presented a tortuous cord‐like aspect. Many primordial follicles were found in all the females studied. Follicles in different states of maturation and primary and accessory corpora lutea were observed in the cortex. These structures were smaller than those present in other related species. Follicles did not project into the surface of the organ. Calcified follicles of diverse size were found in all the ovaries. Atretic follicles were found in all the stages analysed. Interstitial tissue surrounding the follicles and the corpora lutea was also observed. The number and proportion of different cortical structures varied in the physiological stages analysed.

This hypothesis requires that a single crystallite enameloid (SCE) monolayer must be present in the teeth of the most primitive chondrichthyan. However, the dental microstructure of the earliest sharks has yet to be investigated. We have studied the tooth enameloid microstructure of the two oldest tooth‐bearing shark species currently known, Leonodus carlsi Mader (1986 ) and Celtiberina maderi Wang (1993 ), from the lowermost Lochkovian (Lower Devonian) of Spain. Our study demonstrates the presence of a SCE monolayer in the teeth of both species. These results show that a superficial cap of SCE is present in the oldest shark teeth known, which suggest its presence in the most basal chondrichthyans.",

Development of the nidicolous tadpoles of Eupsophus emiliopugini (Anura: Cycloramphidae) until metamorphosis, with comments on systematic relationships of the species and its endotrophic developmental mode. —Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 92: 27–45. Species of Eupsophus are unique within Alsodinae in having nidicolous tadpoles. They are characterized by traits typical of generalized exotrophic (e.g., oral disc and spiracular tube) and endotrophic larvae (e.g., scant pigmentation and large hind limbs). The larval morphology and development of E. emiliopugini, including external, buccal, and musculoskeletal features, is described herein. Like the larvae of other alsodines, these larvae have four lingual and four infralabial papillae, quadratoethmoid process, and an m. rectus cervicis with a double insertion. Among the traits exclusive to the genus are: the absence of the pseudopterygoid process and quadrato-orbital commissure; presence of the m. subarcualis rectus I with two slips; and presence of the m. subarcualis rectus II–IV inserting on Ceratobranchial II. The development and metamorphosis of Eupsophus include some characters that develop later (e.g., degeneration of mouthparts and chondrocranium with minimum calcification), characters that develop earlier (e.g., hind-limb appearance and jaw and suspensorium ossification), and characters that develop at the same time (e.g., most external features and cranial muscles) than in most exotrophic species. Some distinctive characters (third lower labial ridge absent, general configuration of the hyobranchial skeleton, skeletal development with retention of larval traits) resemble those of other endotrophic species, and the precocious ossification of jaws and suspensorium is shared with several direct-developing species among recent amphibians.",

The tritocerebrum and the clypeolabrum in mandibulate arthropods: segmental interpretations. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 249–266 Different interpretations of the segmental composition of the head in mandibulate arthropods are critically reviewed, with particular focus on three closely associated structures: the tritocerebrum, the stomatogastric nervous system and the clypeolabrum. The main conclusions arising from the different discussions are the following. (1) Each tritocerebral ganglion has a dual composition, clearly discernable in some crustacean and hexapod species, including a dorsal portion connected with the second antennae and a ventral portion connected with the stomatogastric nervous system via the frontal ganglion. (2) The suboesophageal commissure linking the tritocerebral lobes of the two sides, can be wholly ascribed to the tritocerebral segment. (3) The stomatogastric nervous system is a morphologically autonomous system that is not fundamentally affected by head metamerization. (4) The clypeolabrum, the epistome–labrum and the hypostome are regarded as homologous formations. The clypeolabrum represents a fundamental structure of the head probably present in the arthropod ground plan. Its close spatial and developmental association with the stomodeum and its derivative, the stomatogastric nervous system, suggests that it is an anterior outgrowth of the forehead arising from a preoral territory (presegmental acron or protocerebral–ocular region?) and secondarily connected with the tritocerebrum, rather than derived from a pair of reduced appendages.",

Congruence, non‐homology, and the phylogeny of basal turtles.– Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) Modern cladistic analysis is characterized by the assembly of increasingly larger data sets coupled with the use of congruence as the final test of homology. Some critics of this development have recently called for a return to more detailed primary homology analysis while questioning the utility of congruence. This discussion appears to be central to the debate regarding the phylogenetic relationships of basal turtles, as the large data sets developed by us have been criticized recently for utilizing poorly constructed characters and including too many homoplasy‐prone characters. Our analysis of this critique reveals that (1) new information regarding poorly understood taxa has a greater impact on the outcome of turtle phylogenies than the characters under dispute; (2) most current turtle phylogenies differ in taxon sampling, not character sampling, and so it appears illogical to condemn a particular analysis for its character sampling; (3) even evolutionary taxonomists should agree that key characters utilized to resolve basal turtle relationships cannot be thought to be ‘infallible’; (4) whereas various criteria provide positive evidence for homology, only congruence provides positive evidence for non‐homology; and (5) a stalemate between conflicting camps within a congruence frame work is preferable to the ad hoc dismissal of data sets, because authoritative statements are untestable.",

Studies looking for potential effects of temperature and temperature fluctuations on phenotypic traits of reptile hatchlings have shown species variation, but have not always allowed a distinction between effects of fluctuation per se and temperature extremes themselves. To examine whether incubation temperature fluctuation has a key role in influencing the phenotype of offspring, we incubated eggs of the sand lizard Lacerta agilis at one of the four temperature regimes (27, 27 ± 2, 27 ± 4 and 27 ± 6 °C). We found that: (1) hatchlings incubated under the four temperature regimes did not differ from each other in any of the morphological and physiological traits examined; (2) interactions that included temperature treatment did not affect any trait examined; (3) the mean incubation length was longer in the 27 ± 6 °C treatment than in the other three treatments; and (4) female hatchlings were shorter in head length and width but longer in snout‐vent length as well as abdomen length than males derived from the same‐sized egg. Our data show that both the type and the magnitude of temperature variation can affect incubation length. We found no evidence for phenotypic divergence in responses to temperature fluctuations during incubation and therefore suggest that temperature variation does not affect the phenotype of hatchlings in L. agilis .",

The mature keratinized cells were extremely flattened and solid in structure but all nuclear basophilic staining was lost. The small horny scales in the neck skin were intermediate in appearance between the loose hinge horny layer and the larger compact scales of the legs. In the narrow hinge regions between the leg scales and also in the wider hinge zones in the neck epidermis, the stratum corneum was made up of layer upon layer of loosely arranged, separate keratinized lamellae. These were formed of horny cells joined at their lateral edges but free on their upper and lower surfaces. 3 The loose hinge horny layer contained some cystine but there was a much stronger reaction in the leg horny scales. Cysteine showed a reversed distribution with a greater concentration in the hinge horny layer and little in the leg scales. 4 Protein-bound phospholipids were found in the epidermis and were also strongly present in the hinge horny layer and in the neck scales, but the compact leg scales showed only a very weak reaction. There was a similar distribution of protein-bound calcium in the stratum corneum. Nucleic acids were not found in the keratinized cells. 5 Growth rings showed sites of retention in the stratum corneum of old horny cells of previous years. These occurred on the leg scales as well as on the carapace. 6 The stratum corneum of the tortoise appears similar in structure throughout its depth in contrast to the Squamata where differences occur through the thickness of the horny layer. These differences are discussed in relation to keratinization and sloughing. It is suggested that the tortoise horny layer is more homogeneous than in snakes and lizards because keratinization is probably a continuous process in contrast to the cycles of the Squamata.",

The epithelium progressed from a stratified pavement in the oesophagus to a simple column in the other segments, with a flat striated border in the intestine. A large number of mucus‐secreting periodic acid‐Schiff ( PAS )‐positive cells were observed in the oesophagus. In the stomach, the number of glands in the region decreased towards the cardiac–fundic region, and none were found in the pylorus. The intestine showed an epithelium with absorption cells and an increasing number of PAS ‐positive caliciform cells towards the distal region. Tests showed that the oesophagus is adapted for passing and preparing food for the chemical digestion that occurs in the stomach, which also has storage functions without grinding action. The proximal intestinal region was consistent with fat absorption, and the medium region, with the absorption of other nutrients. The distal region was short and consistent with a role in absorption for osmoregulation as well as in the formation, storage and disposal of faeces.",

Developmental palaeontology, the study of life history evolution and ontogeny in fossils, remains an area of investigation that could benefit from, but also illuminate, the discourse and research agenda of evo‐devo. Understanding how and why evolution proceeds in phenotypic space is an important goal of evo‐devo and one that can be significantly enriched through the examination of development in the fossil record (Palaeo‐evo‐devo). Such an approach permits developmental pathways to be extended into the past, constraining hypotheses of developmental evolution in ways that cannot be predicted by patterns observed from extant taxa alone. The comparison of developmental dynamics among extant and extinct taxa yields a more complete understanding of the temporal persistence of factors that shape evolution in phenotypic space. As more data are compiled that document ‘fossilized ontogenies’, a stage will emerge from which insights into the evolution of development can begin to appraise those phenotypes that are inaccessible to evo‐devo.",

In the periphery of the choanal and the infundibular cleft, small papillae were scattered across the palatine mucosa. The palate was lined by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, which contained conical papillae of varying height. However, the folds of the keratinized stratified squamous epithelial layer covering the choanal and infundibular cleft were nonkeratinized. The rostral aspect of the choanal cleft contained simple branched tubulo‐alveolar glands of both mucous and sero‐mucous characteristic, whilst the caudal aspect included mucous simple branched tubular glands. Furthermore, it was ascertained that the secretion of the palatine glands contained glycoproteins, carboxylated proteoglycans, weakly and strongly sulphated mucins, sialic acid and hyaluronic acid, but lacked glycogen. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the histological structure of the mucosal epithelium and the supporting elements displayed similarity to those of other domestic avian species.",

In both species, papillae linguales caudales were shaped like a letter “ V ” between the corpus linguae and the radix linguae. From these papillae, the length of the laterally placed papillae was greater compared with others in both species. Two or three secondary papillae were detected on these papillae in the seagull. In scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) examinations, in the seagull, the apex linguae was composed of multilayered desquamated cells, while in the buzzard, scalelike simple projections on the surface of desquamated cells were observed. In the buzzard, glandula (gll). linguales, and gll. mandibulares caudales were seen, while in the seagull, gll. cricoarytenoideae and gll. mandibulares caudales were present. In the seagull, apex linguae were bifurcated, and there were desquamating multilayered cells, particularly at the apex linguae. The number and location of salivary gland orifices are specific to this species. The common buzzard had similarities to many characteristics of the long‐legged buzzard. An absence of long and curly threadlike projections at the two lateral sides of the corpus linguae and an excessive number of salivary gland orifices at the corpus linguae were the main differences from the long‐legged buzzard.",

The results showed that cellular aggregations of precursor epidermal glands start to appear in stage 31 of (Herpetologica, 16, 1960 and 183) and then proliferate and invade the dermis. After stage 41, granular and mucous glands are very similar to those found in adults. The granular glands are syncytial and are surrounded by a distinct layer of myoepithelial cells. In the region of parotoid macroglands, the granular glands accumulate and their alveoli progressively increase until they reach adult size. An analysis by scanning electron microscopy showed the inner distribution of the syncytial nuclei and the myoepithelial cells. The morphological changes observed in the integument of tadpoles are associated with the gradual adaptation to terrestrial environments by preparing the individual for future chemical defence against predators and micro‐organisms.",

During impregnation of sections, increased copper and decreased pH give paler staining, more selective for nerve fibres. Prolonging impregnation from 24 to 48 hours weakens the stain and decreases selectivity. The intensity of the stain depends chiefly upon the amount of unreduced (developable) silver combined with the tissues; selectivity is determined mainly by the number and distribution of the reduced silver particles (‘nuclei’). In development, increased sodium sulphite gives more differentiation, increased hydroquinone gives less. Optimum developer composition depends upon impregnation, and thick sections need more differentiation than thinner ones. Within limits, change in one of the factors that control staining can be balanced by changes in others, but by suitable adjustment of the conditions the result can be varied from almost total staining of nerve fibres, for general neuroanatomy, to highly selective staining for tracing individual fibres.",

Blocking-experiments were also used to control the conjugate fluorescence. In the indirect method sheep-anti-rabbit-gammaglobulin was labelled with fluorescein. First the sections of the hypophysis were treated with antiserum from rabbits. After careful rinsing the sections were exposed to the dyemarked sheep-anti-rabbit-gammaglobulin. For orientation in the pituitary gland histological staining was carried out in parallel to that by fluorescence. The investigation has shown that the erythrosinophilic cells in the rostral pars distalis contained prolactin.

We used power functions and geometric principles to explore allometric relationships of both morphological and foraging characteristics of mammalian herbivores in the South African savannah, covering a body size range of more than three orders magnitude. Our results show that, although intradental mouth volume scaled to a power slightly less than one to body mass, actual bite volume, as measured in the field, scaled to body mass with a factor closer to 1.75. However, when including the volume added to intradental mouth volume by soft mouth parts, such as tongue and lips (or trunks in elephant), mouth volume scaled linearly with actual bite volume and in a similar fashion as actual bite volume to body size. Bite mass and bite leaf mass scaled linearly with body size. We conclude that these scaling relationships indicate that large herbivores use their enlarged soft mouth parts to not only increase bite volume and thereby bite mass, but also select soft plant parts and thereby increase the leaf mass fraction per bite.",

These neurons, like those of the subcutaneous plexus, receive pericellular terminations from the axons of central cells. Capsular neurons receive innervation from 5HT‐positive and nNOS ‐positive nerve fibres. Other nerve endings belonging to two separate nerve populations are identified in the striated muscles. They contain TH and nNOS immunoreactivity. Due to the lack of any topographical labelling, the cell origin and the projections of the neurons into the cranial and spinal nerves are unknown. This study provides anatomical evidence of multiple (5HT and nNOS ) peripheral innervation of the neurons. However, it does not provide information about the function of these neurons in the hagfish. We suggest that hagfish neurons have a phylogenetic relationship with the spinal group of the dorsal cells of lampreys and the supramedullary cells of teleosts.",

Using phospho‐histone‐H3 immunohistochemistry the mitotic activity of limb tissues at 12–25 days after amputation has been studied, when a limb outgrowth of 0.5–2 mm in length is covered by wound epidermis and the underlying connective is turning into a dense scar. In comparison with a regenerating tail of 3–5 mm in length, the number of dividing cells is reduced of 40–70% in different tissues of the scarring limb 1–2 mm in length at 18 days postamputation. Dividing cells are still present at 12–25 days postamputation in the cartilaginous epiphyses of the transected tibia and fibula and of the untransected femur. Also, the injured muscles present at the base of the scarring outgrowth still contain sparse dividing cells after 25 days postamputation of the limb. Together previous studies, the present observations suggest that after the initial proliferation of fibroblasts deriving from the injured tissues, especially from the dermis and intermuscle connectives during the initial 7–15 days postinjury, these cells cover the injured tissues underneath the wound epidermis, but rapidly produce high levels of collagen turning the initial blastema into a scar.",

Due to a renewed interest in the cnidae of L. pertusa, specifically comparisons of adult and larval cnidae and their functions, we now redescribe the cnidome from material collected at the Tisler reef in Norway, close to Carlgren's collection site at Saekken (Sweden). Cnidae from column, tentacles, actinopharynx, mesenterial filaments and acontia were investigated. Fresh tissue preparations were compared to histological preparations of decalcified polyps to verify the presence of cnidocysts and secretory cells, and their composition and organization within tissues. The cnidome included microbasic b‐mastigophores, microbasic and mesobasic p‐mastigophores, holotrichous isorhizas and spirocysts. The nematocyst type cnidae (b‐, p‐mastigophores, isorhizas) appeared in different size classes with different distributions within the tissue. Spirocysts were highly variable in shape and size, without distinct size classes. In addition, developing stages of cnidae were documented, with new observations on the succession of p‐mastigophore shaft development. The present observations were in general congruent with the cnidocyst descriptions from L. prolifera made by Carlgren; however, a tiny cnida, possibly of isorhiza type, has been added. Finally, the use of the term acontia is discussed.",

However, it is still unclear if these two reproductive modes depend on the presence of relatively complex placentas. We describe the ultrastructure of the maternal follicular placenta of 11 poeciliid fishes using electron microscopy. In addition, we quantified six ultrastructure characteristics that reflect the degree of complexity (number of vesicles, area of vesicles, number of microvilli, microvilli length, thickness of the maternal follicle and follicular area). Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we evaluated the relationship between degree of matrotrophy and placental characteristics. We also analysed the potential effect of the presence of superfetation on placental complexity. We found a positive relationship between the degree of matrotrophy and follicular area, number of microvilli and number and area of vesicles. Similarly, follicular area and number of microvilli were larger in species with superfetation than in those without superfetation. We conclude that high degrees of matrotrophy and superfetation are associated with placental characteristics that increase the efficiency of nutrient transfer between mother and embryos.",

There are many chondrocranium descriptions in the literature, encompassing many clades of vertebrates. The definition of a comparable “tempus optimum” for fully formed chondrocrania, as developed herein, will enable discrete character definition in the sense of phylogenetic systematics. The “tempus optimum” is a time period in which the nose region shows full chondrification and the basicranium has not yet changed in its anatomy by ossification processes. For studies on heterochrony, changes in the developmental timing through evolution, the available data in the literature are insufficient. Anatomical standardizations, traceable methodological approaches and clear definitions of comparable developmental stages are needed. Moreover, for profound homology assertions of chondrocranial structures, ontogeny needs to be traced from early mesenchymal condensation, through several stages of cartilage development, up to postnatal stages, in which ossifications are already present. A holistic observation, including hard and soft tissue anatomy, is of paramount importance to generate hypotheses of homology with much explanatory power and to derive conclusions on functional morphology. For that, traditional histological methodology is needed. We exemplify the suggested approach in two case studies on the disputed laterosphenoid in turtles and crocodiles and on the homology of pila antotica in a pleurodire turtle, and, using here defined criteria, we formulate hypotheses on their homology.",

Rainfall is irregular and concentrated within the first 3 months of the year. Prolonged periods of drought, with low total rainfall, may extend for two or more years. Most of the rivers of this biome are temporary, remaining totally dry during periods of drought. We collected and observed the natural history and biology of the species Proceratophrys cristiceps , Pleurodema diplolister and Physalaemus spp, both in the rainy and dry seasons, in ten field expeditions to the State of Rio Grande do Norte (Brazil). We focused on the morphology of the skin and cutaneous glands, specifically in their defence against desiccation. During the dry season, they form concentrations in the bed of temporary rivers, burrowing themselves in favourable locations within the sand, at depths that may exceed 1.50 m. No morphological evidence was found that there are specific cutaneous adaptations against water loss. We suggest that the cutaneous fragility per se is a cutaneous adaptation to water balance. The behaviour of such anuran species, together with their physiological characteristics, should be the main tools to face the challenge of living in xeric conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigated the morphological variation of gibel carp Carassius gibelio collected from various water bodies in Türkiye. The fish samples were obtained from three dams (Karacaören‐1, Karakaya, and Keban), two natural lakes (Beyşehir and Suğla), and a river (the Tigris River). The dimorphism in body shape was examined with geometric morphometrics, while elliptic Fourier analysis and shape indices were used to describe the variation in lapilli otoliths (hereafter “otoliths”) and scale shapes. The body of C. gibelio revealed higher variations, particularly in the body depth, snout length, caudal fin, and caudal peduncle, among different stations. Geometric morphometric analysis determined a streamlined body shape of C. gibelio in the Tigris River compared to other stations, while C. gibelio from the natural lakes had a deeper body shape. The body of C. gibelio exhibited a significant homogenous shape between the Beyşehir and Suğla lakes, providing the lowest Procrustes distance. The elliptic Fourier analysis revealed that the otolith shape varied significantly between all stations. However, the scale shape was remarkably similar among nearby areas such as Karacaören dam, Suğla, and Beyşehir lakes. These results evinced high degree of intra‐population morphological variation in C. gibelio in response to prevailing environmental conditions that probably facilitate their successful establishment in a novel environment.",

Structure and Ultrastructure of the Spermatozoa of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley and Trichogramma atopovirilia Oatman and Platner (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 81 : 205–211 Spermatozoa of the Trichogramma pretiosum and T. atopovirilia are very slender and long, about 0.35 µm in diameter and 283 µm and 106 µm in length, respectively. Under light microscopy, they appear wavy along their entire length. The head contains a small acrosome which, together with the initial nuclear region is surrounded by an ‘extracellular sheath’, from which innumerable filaments irradiate. The nucleus is filled with homogeneous, compact chromatin and is attached to the flagellum by an electron dense centriolar adjunct, which extends anteriorly from the nuclear base. The flagellum consists of an axoneme with the 9 + 9 + 2 microtubule arrangement pitched in a long helix, as well as a pair of spiralling mitochondrial derivatives which coil around the axoneme. Based on these characteristics, the sperm of these Trichogramma are very similar to the chalcidoids studied to date and differ from non‐chalcidoid Hymenoptera. They differ widely from the sperm of T. dendrolimi and T. ostriniae studied, where no helically twisted structure is shown. However, based on these results we argue that the spiralling of the flagellar structures is a synapomorphy for Trichogrammatidae as well as for Eulophidae + Eurytomidae + Pteromalidae.",

Adult morphology is useless in discussing the monophyly of the Cirripedia, since rhizocephalan adults are too reduced to furnish any phylogenetic evidence. But numerous, detailed similarities in nauplii and cyprids of the Thoracica, Acrothoracica and Rhizocephala as well as the ultrastructure of their sperm are synapomorphic relative to other Thecostraca and indicate that these three orders form a monophylum. There is evidence that the stylet in the rhizocephalan kentrogon is homologous to an element in the ancestral mouth field. If so, the Rhizocephala probably evolved before setose feeding was adopted, and constitute the sister group to the Acrothoracica and Thoracica. This conclusion is based on frail evidence so the term Cirripedia should be retained to comprise the Rhizocephala, Thoracica, and Acrothoracica. These three orders all possess remarkably similar cyprids, adapted to accomplish irreversible settlement by cement secretion and initiate metamorphosis, so their last common ancestor was most probably a permanently sessile organism.",

Most significantly, perhaps, the valuable descriptions of the Orsten material have shed some light on the origination of crustaceans through the sequential acquisition of crustacean characters in a group of ‘stemgroup crustaceans’ and even more basic forms. An attempt is made to outline an evolutionary tree leading on one side to trilobitomorphs and chelicerates, on the other to crustaceans and related forms. It involves numbers of synapomorphies added successively, and it appears unlikely that true crustaceans were present already in the earliest Cambrian.",

A premaxillary dentition consisting of small (50–100 μm long) slender pointed teeth showing no true replacement is only present in larval and juvenile stages and is subsequently lost, possibly in relation to a change in feeding mode from predatory to bottom feeder. Like odontodes, teeth are composed of dentine surrounding a pulp cavity and are covered by a hypermineralized cap. Particular features, also found in odontodes, are the absence of dentinal tubules and of nerves and capillaries in the pulp cavity, both possibly related to the small size of the teeth. The irregular pattern of implantation and the variability in attachment mode (primary and/or secondary attachment bone, fusion, mere apposition or ligamentous connection) distinguish the teeth from most other teleost teeth and from odontodes and are interpreted as reflecting considerable differences in dynamics of remodeling of the supporting element (premaxillary bone vs scute). This comparison of teeth and odontodes strongly supports current views according to which teeth and odontodes are two very closely related phenotypic expressions of a single, modifiable, morphogenetic system probably rooted in the earliest stages of vertebrate evolution.",

The balance organ lies just in front of the infundibular cells and consists of 10 electron‐dense cells with long, bulbous cilia, each surrounded by a ring of accessory cells. The ciliary bulb cells have axons that terminate in vesicle‐filled swellings that lack identifiable synapses. The accessory cells have short basal processes that are minor contributors to the adjacent neuropile. Based on morphology, we suggest a mechanosensory function for the ciliary bulb cells, possibly related to balance or motion detection. Scattered cells of similar type are found elsewhere in the cerebral vesicle, along with a variety of other neurones with caudally projecting axons and varicosities, but few synapses. Instead, nonsynaptic, paracrine secretion appears to be the predominant mode of transmitter release in the neuropile and ventral tracts of the cerebral vesicle. The closest vertebrate homologue of this part of the amphioxus brain is arguably the limbic core of the caudal diencephalon and mesencephalon, including the homeostatic control centres of the hypothalamus. We postulate that this limbic core is an ancient structure traceable at least as far back in evolution as the common ancestor of amphioxus and vertebrates.",

The mesopneumonia and the post‐hepatic septum of the Teiioidea (Reptilia: Squamata). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 81 : 109–119 This study investigates the structure of the pleuroperitoneal cavity of Teiioidea. Seven of nine genera of Teiidae and eight of 35 genera of Gymnophthalmidae were dissected and the results are presented in a highly schematic two‐dimensional representation. The main anatomical differences between the two families are (1) the presence of a hepatic ligament which fuses with the pericardiaco‐peritoneal septum in the Gymnophthalmidae but not in the Teiidae; (2) the presence of a ventral mesopneumonium on the right side in the Gymnophthalmidae, while this structure is secondarily lacking in the Teiidae; (3) that the post‐hepatic septum of Teiidae consists of a bipartite hepatic ligament and the ventral mesentery, while in gymnophthalmids the hepatic ligament remains undivided. Neusticurus and Echinosaura completely lack a post‐hepatic septum. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Gymnophthalmidae are primitive within the Teiioidea and that the Tupinambinae are the most highly derived teiids. We propose that the post‐hepatic septum may restrict passive visceral movement during breathing, thereby increasing the efficiency of respiratory effort; a modification that could benefit the fitness of active, predatory teiids.",

These are similar in position to the larval arms of bipinnaria larvae and the epaulettes and vibratile lobes of echinoid pluteus larvae, all of which structures are potentially homologous. When the auricularia is converted to a doliolaria with a series of circumferential ciliary bands, the ridges of the former are retained as basic elements from which the circumferential bands of the latter then develop. There is a simple repeating pattern in the arrangement of these elements in which bands composed of two elements alternate with bands composed of four. The available evidence does not resolve the question of which of the above four larval types, whether feeding or non‐feeding, is more primitive. The common plan apparent among them suggests, however, that this plan, whatever its origin, predates the diversification of larval types among eleutherozoan echinoderms.",

Anti‐SI immunoreactivity first appears in the apical ganglion in late gastrulae at the same time as anti‐serotonin immunoreactivity. Initially, anti‐S1 immunoreactivity is restricted to fibres of the neuropile, but in later feeding stages, cell bodies are also immunoreactive. Anti‐S1 immunoreactivity appears as 2–4 cells in the oral ganglion of early prism stage larvae, whereas anti‐serotonin immunoreactivity does not occur in the oral ganglion until the 8‐arm stage. Anti‐S1 immunoreactivity also occurs in diffuse fibres in the oesophagus and in a single fibre encircling the pyloric sphincter of the gut. A reticular network associated with the apical surface of the epithelial cells of the vestibule of the adult rudiment was anti‐S1 immunoreactive. In double‐labelling experiments, anti‐serotonin and anti‐S1 immunoreactivity co‐localize in the neuropile of the apical ganglion. The distribution of S1, in association with putative sensory cells in the apical and oral ganglia and with muscles of the oesophagus and gut, suggests S1 may have diverse functions in the larval nervous system. The distribution of anti‐S1 immunoreactivity in echinoid embryos and larvae supports the proposal that SALMFamide‐like peptides are widely shared in echinoderms and potentially have a fundamental role in neural function.",

Computer‐generated reconstructions of histological sections indicate that the cephalopodium of Haliotis kamtschatkana Jonas, 1845 rotates by a full 180° relative to the shell and visceral lobe during the first quarter of pre‐metamorphic development. However, a portion of pallial epithelium, including some of the shell field, accompanies the rotating cephalopodium; a process facilitated by detachment of the pallium from the apertural rim of the protoconch. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that a tract of the larval retractor muscle, which Crofts (1955) implicated in the mechanism of torsion, inserts on both pedal and pallial cells. A deep invagination of shell field epithelium is a major focus of rotational torque. As a result of pallial deformation during cephalopodial rotation, the anus and gill rudiment are restricted to the right half of the larval body for 2 days after cephalopodial rotation by 180° has been completed. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy indicate that grooves in the lateral flanks of the protoconch correspond to the deep invagination of shell field epithelium. The grooves are not created by a coiling type of accrelionary shell growth or by flexion of the protoconch. A calcareous shelf is secondarily added to the periostracal template of the protoconch along its visceral apertural rim. Morphogenetic movements during ontogenetic torsion in this species are more complex than a simple rotation between cephalopodium and visceropallium and the protoconch shows no evidence of exogastric coiling. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",

LR White sections of larval and adult Loricifera were labelled with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to colloidal gold. The pharyngeal cuticle of Nanaloricus mysticus exhibits a multilaminate epicuticle and an amorphous basal layer with osmiophilic fibres. The lorical cuticle consists of an osmiophilic or trilaminate epicuticle, one to three amorphous layer(s), and a basal fibrous layer which is strongly labelled by the lectin‐gold conjugate. Chitinase treatment or competitive inhibition with N‐, N ′‐, N ″‐triacetylchitotriose exclude labelling almost completely, whereas competitive inhibition with N ‐acetyl‐D‐glucosamine does not affect labelling intensity. The binding of WGA in connection with competition experiments indicates the presence of chitin in the fibrous layer. In most areas of a section, three amorphous layers extend below the epicuticle of the Nanaloricidae. Only in favourably orientated sections can all three “amorphous” layers be seen to be formed by stacks of lamellae. Modified articulation sites with bundles of osmiophilic longitudinal fibres and an osmiophilic plate (Nanaloricidae only) occur in adult Loricifera, but not in the larval stages. The ultrastructure of the lorical cuticle of the Loricifera resembles that of other Nemathelminthes (= Aschelminthes). The morphology of the articulation sites and the number of lorical plates seem to differ between the Loricifera and Priapulida. Therefore, it is currently not possible to conclude whether the lorica of the Loricifera and Priapulida are homologous structures. © 1997 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

    "abstract": "Abstract The circulatory organs of nine representative species of all five chilopod orders were examined by light microscopy and by in vivo observations of haemolymph flow. In Scutigera coleoptrata , the heart ultrastructure was studied. The circulatory system in Craterostigmomorpha is described for the first time. Further focus is placed on the Geophilomorpha since previous descriptions in this group have been only superficial. In all investigated species, the circulatory system consists of two longitudinal central vessels which are connected in the first body segment by the maxilliped arch. The posterior part of these vessels is contractile and thus haemolymph is pumped anteriorly in the heart, while it is pumped posteriorly in the supraneural vessel. From these central vessels numerous peripheral vessels branch off. Differences among the chilopod orders lie mainly in the distribution of the peripheral vessels. The circulatory system in Scutigeromorpha shows some striking morphological adaptations with regard to the functional coupling of circulatory and respiratory tasks. The most peculiar structures are the aortic diverticles which act as accessory pumps in the head. Phylogenetic analysis of the circulatory organ traits within Chilopoda supports the Pleurostigmophora hypothesis. Synapomorphies supporting the Myriapoda hypothesis or the Tracheata concept were not found.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A survey of pretarsal structures in Reduviidae of 22 higher‐level taxa and several outgroup representatives is conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy. Based on histology and SEM, pretarsal structures are described in detail for Rhodnius prolixus . Structures of the distal tarsomer, which appear to be functionally correlated with the pretarsus, are documented for the first time in Heteroptera. These comprise lateral oval sclerites, two campaniform sensilla and two marginal setae, observed in Reduviidae and other heteropteran taxa. The presence of a peg‐like dorsomedian sensillum medially between the claws in Reduviidae and Nabidae is demonstrated. As a result of its structure and position, homology of this sensillum with the ‘dorsal arolium’ in other heteropteran groups is proposed. Within Reduviidae, the transformation of the peg‐like dorsomedian sensillum to a campaniform sensillum, as seen in most representatives of the harpactoroid complex, is hypothesized. The first record of parempodia other than setiform within Reduviidae is noted in nymphs of Harpactorinae, which may possess lamellate parempodia. Several characters that are possibly useful for clarifying relationships among the harpactoroid groups are described and discussed. The pretarsal structures, including the unguitractor plate and the tarsal marginal setae among reduviid groups are discussed in a phylogenetic context.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is an accepted fact that fusion between the coelomic cavities and the primary body cavity occurs during development in the Arthropoda. However, such a fusion is much disputed in the Onychophora. In order to clarify this subject, the fate of embryonic coelomic cavities has been studied in an onychophoran. Ultrastructural investigations in this paper provide evidence that embryonic coelomic cavities fuse with spaces of the primary body cavity in Epiperipatus biolleyi . During embryogenesis, the somatic and splanchnic portions of the mesoderm separate and the former coelomic linings are transformed into mesenchymatic tissue. The resulting body cavity therefore represents a mixture of primary and secondary (coelomic) body cavities, i.e. the ‘mixocoel’. The nephridial anlage is already present, when the ‘mixocoel’ is formed, although there is no trace of a sacculus yet. The lumen of the nephridial anlage, thus, communicates with the newly formed ‘mixocoel’. Accordingly, the lumen of the nephridial sacculus cannot be regarded as a kind of ‘persisting coelomic cavity’ in E. biolleyi . Our findings support the hypothesis that the ‘mixocoel’ was already present in the common stem species of the Onychophora and Euarthropoda.",

Using the major Remanian criteria for identifying homologies, equivalents in the amphinomid brain and the central nervous systems of some ‘sedentary’ and ‘errant’ families are proposed.

The epidermal organization is described to best advantage in terms of the various cell types present, their intricate interrelationships and their interaction with the highly developed subepidermal membrane complex (SMC). The epidermis is composed mainly of ciliated epidermal supporting cells, at least two types of gland cells (one dominant mucous type with basophilic, alcian blue‐positive granules; another possessing acidophilic, PAS‐positive granules), several types of nerve cells present in the intraepidermal nerve layer and, finally, some peculiar basally arranged ‘pillow cells’. Junctional structures are sparsely developed. The epidermal supporting cell is provided with a distinct cell web, but diagnostic for this cell type is the presence of a very prominent single supporting fibre (SF) composed of supporting filaments. Distally some of these filaments may terminate on the tapering proximal ends of ciliary rootlets, a highly unusual phenomenon. Basally the SF is attached to the SMC in a complex arrangement. The possible relationship of the supporting filaments to cytoskeletal intermediate filaments is discussed. The SF is compared to other cytoplasmic filament systems in mammals and various invertebrates. The ultrastructural organization of Xenoturbella is now fairly well understood, nevertheless, our conclusion must be that it is still not possible to assign an appropriate place for this animal in the systematic‐phylogenetic system.",

Testicular tissues were collected, embedded in plastic, sectioned by ultramicrotome, and stained with methylene blue and basic fuchsin. Black swamp snakes have a postnuptial pattern of development, where spermatogenesis occurs from May to July and spermiation is completed by October. Though spatial relationships are seen between germ cells within the seminiferous epithelium during specific months, accumulation of spermatogonia and spermatocytes early in spermatogenesis and the depletion of spermatocytes and accumulation of spermatids late in spermatogenesis prevent consistent cellular associations. This temporal germ cell development within an amniotic testis is consistent with that seen in other recently studied temperate reptiles (slider turtle and wall lizard). These reptiles’ temporal development is more similar to the developmental strategy found in anamniotes than the spatial germ cell development that characterizes birds and mammals. Our findings also imply that a third germ cell development strategy may exist in temperate breeding reptiles. Because of the phylogenetic position of reptiles between anamniotes and other terrestrial amniotes, this common germ cell development strategy shared by temperate reptiles representing different orders may have significant implications as far as the evolution of sperm development within vertebrates.",

When one or several neurulae were manually demembranated (follicle cells, vitelline coat and test cells removed) and cultured in seawater they failed to form caudal fins. Fins were normal when the follicle cells alone were removed. The shape of the fins was normal when demembranation was delayed to the late tailbud stage. Does demembranation cause the loss of an essential factor produced by the embryos themselves or do the test cells provide a factor for fin morphogenesis? Demembranated neurulae of Ascidia callosa were cultured in groups ranging in size from 2 to 80 in 1 ml volumes of seawater. The mean lengths of the caudal fins increased with group size . In larger groups, some embryos developed fins that were normal in shape and as long as undemembranated controls. Results were similar with Corella inflata . These experiments suggest that a diffusible substance from the embryos facilitates fin morphogenesis and that test cells are not required. Test cells deposit ‘ornaments’ on the tunic in some species. In other species no ornaments are produced. Ten families are compared. It is proposed that the test cells make the tunic hydrophilic.",

Electroretinogram (ERG) recordings were used to investigate the electrophysiological responsiveness to flashes of light of varying intensity and colour, behavioural observations were made of phototactic reactions, and optical measurements and calculations related to the path of light rays in the eye were made. The retina contains principally two types of cells: first, photoreceptor cells with both microvilli and cilia, and second, cells, often strongly pigmented, that are supportive in nature. The ERGs obtained were essentially similar in form, amplitude and duration to those known from other gastropods that have exclusively rhabdomeric photoreceptors. Spectral sensitivity curves closely fitted the absorption spectrum of a rhodopsin‐like pigment. The spectral sensitivity peak was at 475 nm. Measurements of the refractive indices of the lens gave values of 1.55 for the outer layer and 1.57 for the lens core. None of the snails tested exhibited a ‘defensive reflex’ and although no preference between light and dark regions was expressed, we nevertheless argue that, on the basis of optical measurements and calculations, the eye of V. viviparus is well‐adapted for seeing under water. Our main conclusion is that in the eye of V. viviparus with its ‘mixed photoreceptor’ cell type, there is an equal probability for microvilli and cilia to function as principal photoreceptive elements.",

(1) Lateral cilia changed beat and a backcurrent occurred at the time and place that particles were retained. (2) Algal cells were sieved and held stationary at the upstream (frontal) side of a row of laterofrontal cilia that were not beating. (3) Localized extension of cilia toward the inhalant chamber, coincident with particle captures, indicated that laterofrontal cilia flick toward the inhalant chamber. These flicks may aid transport of captured particles toward the mouth. Thus my earlier report that larvae only sieve, in contrast to the adults (which have an active ciliary response) was in error. The similar ciliary bands in adult and larval bryozoans and in other lophophorates (brachiopods, and phoronids) suggest that these animals share a core repertoire of ciliary behaviours in the capture and concentration of suspended food particles.",

Additional gut fossils exhibit distinctly the anterior portion composed of esophagus and distended stomach, situated in the alleged visceral cavity, with the recurved intestine accommodated inside a hollow pseudointerarea. The frequency of occurrence of this intestinal layout suggests that this is not just an artefact of preservation. The gross configuration of the guts and the way they are preserved in the fossils suggest that they are in situ and, therefore, we can assume that Lingulellotreta had a hollow cavity presumably subtended by the pseuodelthyrium, which was invaded and occupied by the visceral organs.

Functional morphology of the postpharyngeal gland of queens and workers of the ant Monomorium pharaonis (L.). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 87 : 101–111 The postpharyngeal gland (PPG) is unique to ants and is the largest exocrine gland in their head. In queens of the pharaoh's ant, Monomorium pharaonis , the gland contains approximately 15 finger‐like epithelial extensions on each side and opens dorsolaterally in the posterior pharynx. In these ants the PPG morphology varies considerably according to age and mating status. The epithelial thickness increases with age and reaches a maximum at 3 weeks in both virgin and mated queens. A considerable expansion of the lumen diameter occurs in both groups between 4 and 7 days. Virgin queens release their secretion into the gland lumen from an age of 7 days, whereas mated queens accumulate large amounts of secretion in their epithelium. The increasing epithelial thickness, together with the increasing lumen diameter, the presence of numerous inclusions in the epithelium and the release of secretion, are indicative for increasing gland activity. The gland ultrastructure indicates involvement in lipid metabolism and de novo synthesis of lipids. The PPG of workers consists of 12 finger‐like tubes at each side. There is a significant difference in epithelial thickness between nurses and repletes and between nurses and foragers. We suggest the PPG serves different purposes in pharaoh's ants: it is likely that the PPG of workers and virgin queens is used to feed larvae. In mated queens the gland probably plays a role in providing the queen with nutritious oils for egg production. The PPG may also function in signalling species nestmate and caste identity, as well as in the reproductive capacity of the queens.",

Claws originate from a thickening of the epidermis covering the tips of digits under which mesenchymal cells aggregate. Mesenchymal cells are in continuity with perichondrial cells of the last phalange, and are connected to the epidermis through numerous cell bridges that cross an incomplete basement membrane. The dense lamella is completed in non‐apical regions of the digit where also collagen fibrils increase. The dorsal side of the developing claw derives from the growth of the outer scale surface of the last scale of the digit. The corneous layer, made of beta‐keratin cells, curves downward by the tip of the growing claw. The epidermis of the ventral side of the claw contains keratohyaline‐like granules and alpha‐keratinocytes like an inner scale surface. The thickness of the horny layer increases in the elongating unguis while a thinner and softer corneous layer remains in the subunguis. These observations show that lizard claws derive from the modification of the last scale or scales of the digit, probably under the influence of the growing terminal phalanx. Some hypotheses on the evolution of claws in reptiles are presented.",

    "abstract": "The olfactory organs of 6 rainbow fish species were studied, and were compared with those of closely related cyprinodonts. It has been found that, in contrast to cyprinodonts, the olfactory mucosa of rainbow fish is more conspicuously thrown up into folds. Their arrangement in parallel is considered a relatively primitive character of the organ. Electron microscopic investigations on Nematocentris maccullochi have shown that the sensory epithelium consists of basal, supporting, and two types of receptor cells, ciliated and microvillous. As in cyprinodonts the receptor cell cilia exhibit a basic 9 + 0 microtubular pattern. In Nematocentris the frequency of receptor cells, between 200,000 and 250,000 per mm2, is lower than in cyprinodonts. It may be suggested that the lower density is compensated for by enlargement of the sensory area due to the folding. In addition to broad-surfaced dendritic membrane appositions found in both Nematocentris and cyprinodonts, contacts by means of dendritic spines are found only in the rainbow fish. The olfactory supporting cells of the latter are distinguished from those in cyprinodonts by more prominent lateral interdigitations, centrioles, and the higher number of vesicles associated with extensive Golgi complexes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Eurasian bullfinch spermatozoon differs from typical passeridan spermatozoa in several major respects. The mature acrosome consists of a concavo‐convex vesicle differing from the typical passeridan acrosome, which is a helical structure, is usually longer than the nucleus and has a prominent helical keel. The nucleus differs from that of other oscines in not showing a twisted cylindrical form, in being shorter, and in tending to be an elongate ellipsoid in shape. The chromatin often appears in an uncondensed form reminiscent of a spermatid and consists of discrete fascicles. A small proportion of the mature sperm population however, is characterized by marked chromatin condensation. The midpiece comprises a small group of mitochondria clustered around the nuclear–axonemal junction in contrast to the single, long mitochondrion wound helically around the axoneme that is found in typical Passerida. The presence of a proximal centriole (in addition to the distal one) is a notable difference from all other oscine passerines. We suggest that the unusual morphology of the Eurasian bullfinch spermatozoon, resembling that of a spermatid, is the result of the progressive suppression of the final stages of spermiogenesis and is associated with the likelihood that sperm competition is infrequent in this species.",

In the macula sacculi and macula lagenae the hair cell polarization is different from that hitherto described from bony fishes and other vertebrates.

    "abstract": "Abstract From a comparative viewpoint, this paper deals with structural and functional aspects of skeletal annulations in lizards, especially those displayed by sections cut transversally through the larger bones of the appendages. Cross-sections of the diaphyses exhibit an alternation of concentrically arranged thinner and thicker annulations which were formed during colder and warmer seasons, respectively. The thinner annulations are chromophile and anisotropic but not hypermineralized; they are generally referred to as “resting lines” or “adhesion lines” and are due to a slowing down of the temperature-dependent growth process; they also differ structurally from “cementing reversal lines”. In certain cases, the thinner annulations (here called LAC) are surrounded by bone lamellae and thus compare closely with the annuli on the flat bones. From the study of two lizards of known age, as well as on the basis of a preliminary experimentation with fluorochrom labelling, it has been demonstrated conclusively that the recurrence of the LAC in lacertilians shows an annual regularity. Therefore, it would seem that the LAC can be employed for age determination in lizards.",

Phylogenetic analysis of Devonian lungfish based on a dataset of 150 characters and 33 taxa indicates that the new taxon is more crownward than Dipterus and the clade comprising Adololopas , Sorbitorhynchus and Pillararhynchus . Our results agree broadly with previous cladistic solutions. Diabolepis is placed as a sister group to all other Devonian lungfish. The species referred to Chirodipterus fail to form a monophyletic group. The result shows a large number of convergences corresponding to early radiation of lungfish compressed in time.",

Based on investigations using both light and scanning electron microscopes, we divided the embryonic development of the grass snake integument into four phases. The shape of the epidermal cells changes first on the caudal and ventral parts of the embryo, then gradually towards the rostral and dorsal areas. In stage V on the ventral side of the embryo the gastrosteges are formed from single primordia, but on the dorsal side the epidermis forms the scale primordia in stage VII. This indicates that scalation begins on the ventral body surface, and spreads dorsally. The appearance of melanocytes between the cells of the stratum germinativum in stage VII coincides with changes in embryo colouration. The first dermal melanocytes were detected in stage XI so in this stage the definitive skin pattern is formed. In the same stage the epidermis forms the first embryonic shedding complex and the periderm layer begins to detach in small, individual flakes. This process coincides with rapid growth of the embryos.",

This study presents a comparative analysis aiming to show the remarkable differences found in gonad morphology between six fish species from the genera Incertae Sedis in the Characidae family. Maturing ovaries of Astyanax fasciatus presented grayish color whilst the other species’ were yellowish in color. The cortical alveoli of the analyzed species are small (5.20 ± 1.44–8.28 ± 2.02 μm) and are formed by various discontinuous layers of vesicles except in the Bryconops affinis , where they are large (12.87 ± 2.41 μm) and form various continuous layers of vesicles. The pellucid zone is thin and varies from 2.44 ± 0.90 to 5.79 ± 1.90 μm and is thickest in B. affinis (10.57 ± 2.08 μm). Folds in the pellucid zone were observed in Astyanax bimaculatus , A. fasciatus , Hemigrammus marginatus , and Moenkhausia costae. The follicular cells of B. affinis are columnar (28.19 ± 13.71 μm), while they are squamous in other species (1.52 ± 0.64–2.12 ± 0.78 μm). This study showed that the morphologic and biometric characteristics of the B. affinis vitellogenic oocytes are statistically different than the analyzed other ones Incertae Sedis of the Characidae family. In advanced maturing testis of A. bimaculatus and A. fasciatus , the spermatozoa were embedded in acidophilic secretion which was gradually reabsorbed in the seminiferous tubules when males were partially spent.",

Numerous bite traces on skeletal parts of agnathan pteraspidiforms and psammosteiforms, placoderm arthrodires and antiarchs and sarcopterygian porolepiforms and osteolepiforms are described. Evidence of healing shows that prey organisms responded to predation by reconstruction of damaged skeletal elements. Ichthyofaunistic analysis is used to establish possible predators. The most probable predators in the Middle and Late Devonian communities are sarcopterygian porolepiforms and osteolepiforms. Predatory tetrapods become evident during the Famennian. Global analysis of aquatic predators during the Silurian–Devonian interval shows a gradual increase in species numbers with time. During the Late Silurian, only ischnacantid acanthodians, early osteichthyans and sarcopterygians are known to belong to this trophic group. By the end of the Devonian this list is complemented by chondrichthyans, arthrodires, porolepiform, osteolepiform, struniiform and rhizodontiform sarcopterygians and tetrapods. Only Devonian agnathans show no predatory groups. In sarcopterygians, predatory dentitions, which developed according to more or less the same pattern, show little change during the Devonian.",

The SCO‐RF‐system is an area of the brain with a relative high sulphur content. The maximum of the 35 S‐amino acid incorporation in the SCO is in lower vertebrates not reached before one or more days after the injection of the labeled amino acid. In the investigated species the apical parts of the SCO‐cells contain more labeled material than the basal parts of the cells. Labeled secretion of the SCO was found in the cerebrospinal fluid some hours after the injection of labeled amino acids. Conclusions are drawn about the working of the gland cells. The rates of growth and passage times of the RF, the rate of secretion of the SCO and the relative secretion of the organ are defined as parameters of the SCO‐RF‐system. The average daily rate of growth of the RF is a few millimeters for the species investigated. The labeled material of the RF may pass the third and fourth ventricles and the central canal of the spinal cord approximately within 10 (mouses) to 115 (river lampreys) days. The quantity of the secretion released by the SCO (rate of secretion) into the third ventricle is between 1.0 × 10 ‐5 mg wet weight daily (Lampetra planeri) and 1.9 × 10 ‐5 mg wet weight daily (Rana esculenta) that amounts less than 1% of the total weight of the organ. One cell of the SCO releases approximately 10 ‐9 mg wet weigt per day. 100 g CSF contain about 4–200 mg RF wet weight or 0.07–3.6 mg RF dry weight. This was found from the wet and dry weight of RF and the quantity of CSF also determined for each species. Contrarily we found the concentration of the RF substances in the CSF of the central canal of the spinal cord to be in average 200–1800 mg% wet weight or 4–30 mg% dry weight. During its growth RF releases no labeled substances into the CSF. Conclusions are discussed concerning the poorly known function of the organ. Zusammenfassung Vom Subcommissuralorgan (SCO) und dem Reissnerschen Faden (RF) sowie von anderen Bereichen des ZNS von Bachneunaugen (Lampetra planeri Bloch), Flußneunaugen (Lampetra fluvitilis L.), Wasserfröschen (Rana esculenta L.), Mäusen (Laborstamm) und Ratten (Wistar Stamm) wurden nach 35 S‐Thioaminosäureapplikationen und histologischer Aufbereitung Autoradiogramme verfertigt. Das SCO‐RF‐System zählt zu den relativ schwefelreichen Bereichen im Wirbeltiergehirn. Die maximale Inkorporation im SCO wird bei niederen Wirbeltieren erst etwa ein bis mehrere Tage nach der Applikation der markierten Aminosäure erreicht. Bei den untersuchten Arten enthalten die apikalen Zellabschnitte mehr markiertes Material als die basalen. Radioaktives SCO‐Sekret ist im Liquor erst mehrere Stunden nach der Applikation der markierten Aminosäuren nachweisbar. Die Arbeitsweise der Drüsenzellen wird diskutiert. Wachstumsraten und Passagezeiten des RF, die Sekretionsrate des SCO und die relative Organsekretion werden als Parameter des SCO‐RF‐Systems definiert. Die durchschnittliche tägliche Wachstumsrate des RF der untersuchten Arten liegt im Millimeterbereich. Die markierte Fadensubstanz passiert den Hohlraum in Hirn und Rückenmark in etwa 10 (Mäuse) bis 115 (Flußneunaugen) Tagen. Für die Sekretionsrate des SCO wurden bei den untersuchten Arten durchschnittlich etwa 1,0 × 10 ‐5 mg Frischgewicht/Tag (Bachneunaugen) bis 1,9 × 10 ‐5 mg Frischgewicht/Tag (Frösche) bestimmt, d.h. weniger als 1% des Organeigengewichtes. Die tägliche sekretorische Leistung von Einzelzellen der Drüse beträgt gegen 10 ‐9 mg Frischgewicht. Aus der jeweils ermittelten Masse des RF (Frischgewicht und Trockengewicht) und den bestimmten Volumina des Ventrikelsystems ergibt sich, daß die Konzentration der RF‐Substanz in 100 g Liquor bei den untersuchten Arten im Durchschnitt etwa 4–200 mg, bezogen auf das RF‐Frischgewicht, bzw. 0,07–3,6 mg, bezogen auf das RF‐Trockengewicht, beträgt. Die Konzentration der RF‐Substanz im Liquor des Canalis centralis beträgt hingegen durchschnittlich etwa 200–1800 mg% Frischgewicht bzw. 4–30 mg% Trockengewicht. Aus dem RF‐Material werden während des Wachstums durch das Hohlraumsystem in Hirn und Rückenmark keine markierten Substanzen abgegeben. Es wird geprüft, welche Folgerungen sich aus der Dynamik der Organsekretion und den Parametern der Organleistung in Hinblick auf die Beurteilung der Organfunktion ergeben.",

All dermal skeletons including dorsal fin‐spines, cephalic spines, dermal denticles and one tooth are well preserved in their natural position. It is a shark of about 490 mm total length with a fusiform body. The braincase has large, downturned postorbital processes and otic capsules, no postorbital articulation, long palatoquadrate and large triangular Meckel's cartilage. It bears two dorsal fins and two pairs of heteromorphic cephalic spines. The tooth is of low‐crowned, multicuspid type; the elongate tooth crown has stout crown shoulder and well‐developed, rounded labial peg; the cusp and cusplets are moderately tumid, and have a few strong and curved folds; the tooth root is higher on the labial face than the lingual face. The dermal denticle is placoid scale‐like, with its crown surface ornamented with some parallel ridges. Gansuselache , the first articulated hybodontiform from Asia, also represents the first complete hybodontiform from the Permian.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Within the Tetrapodomorpha, the Late Devonian Gogonasus andrewsae of the Gogo Formation, Gogo, Western Australia, has occupied an uncertain phylogenetic position. Following the description of several well‐preserved three‐dimensional skulls and pectoral girdles, the discovery of the first complete specimen (NMV P221807) made Gogonasus one of the best‐known tetrapodomorph fish. Recent studies of pectoral fin structure and the spiracular opening of Gogonasus have suggested an unexpected affinity with ‘elpistostegalid’ fish such as Tiktaalik . Subsequent work has refuted characters linking these taxa, with phylogenetic analysis of the Tetrapodomorpha placing Gogonasus basal to megalichthyids and tristichopterids. In this paper we reanalyse characters linking Gogonasus with ‘elpistostegalid’ fish and those supporting the placement of Gogonasus crownward of Eusthenopteron. New phylogenetic analyses of the Tetrapodomorpha show a revised phylogenetic position of Gogonasus as being deeply nested within the Tetrapodomorpha, crownward of Osteolepis and Megalichthys , but basal to Eusthenopteron +‘elpistostegalids’. Functional consideration of the spiracular structure suggests a position of Gogonasus closer to ‘elpistostegalids’, although data is lacking from other less‐well‐preserved taxa to fully test the hypothesis. The humerus of the Late Devonian lungfish Chirodipterus from Gogo, Western Australia is figured for comparative purposes.",

The olfactory and the vomeronasal system are the two major chemosensory systems found in terrestrial vertebrates. Among tetrapods, amphibians are unique in having an aquatic larval stage, followed by metamorphosis to a terrestrial adult. In the present work, we studied the histological development of the olfactory and vomeronasal organ and associated multicellular glands of the toad Rhinella (Bufo) arenarum, from early poshatching larva to postmetamorphic toadlets. As in other bufonids, the olfactory epithelium of R. arenarum in larvae is divided into dorsal and ventral branches in the rostral and mid-nasal regions. At metamorphic climax, the larval pattern changes drastically and the adult olfactory configuration develops. Bowman's glands appear in the olfactory epithelium of R. arenarum at the onset of metamorphic climax. The vomeronasal epithelium develops early in larval development in R. arenarum, around the time of operculum development. Interestingly, a novel sensory epithelium develops in the floor of the principal chamber of R. arenarum at metamorphic climax. This novel sensory epithelium resembles larval sensory epithelium lacking Bowman's glands, and suggests that these animals would be able to sense not only air-borne, but also water-borne odors during their adult terrestrial life.",

Temperature and food supply appeared to affect sex ratio, sex composition and percentage of sexual individuals in three Hydra species: Hydra vulgaris , Hydra circumcincta and Hydra viridissima . We found three sexes present: females, males and hermaphrodites depending on environmental conditions. Hydra vulgaris appeared to be a species with a temperature‐dependent sex determination (TSD). The males and hermaphrodites were present only under rising temperatures, whereas females were observed exclusively at lowering temperatures. Hydras reproduced asexually at constant room temperature. Unlimited food affected sex ratios and induced the presence of males in H. circumcincta at lowering temperatures. Thus, H. circumcincta may be recognised as another Hydra species in which sex is determined by environmental factors (ESD). Under rising temperatures, the number of hermaphroditic individuals was higher when food supply was unlimited in all three species, indicating that hermaphrodites may need more energy to produce both male and female gonads. Both temperature changes and food supply positively affected asexual reproductive strategies in hydras, especially budding rates. Hydra circumcincta appeared to be less agile than other hydras and able to self‐fertilise. It is likely that self‐fertilisation is an adaptation to the low probability of meeting a mate belonging to the other clone.",

Anatomy of an enigma: an osteological investigation of the Namibian festive gecko ( Narudasia festiva : Gekkonidae: Gekkota). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 465–486. The monotypic genus Narudasia is a poorly studied Namibian endemic gekkonid lizard. It has been hypothesized to have close relationships with a diversity of other gekkotan genera, including representatives of three of the currently recognized families of geckos, but most such interpretations have been based solely on overall morphological similarity. X‐ray CT scans, cleared‐and‐stained specimens and conventional radiographs were used to provide a detailed osteological description of N. festiva , with an emphasis on the cranium. Narudasia exhibits a number of features associated with miniaturization, including a relatively large neurocranium and a bulging occipital condyle. However, many skeletal features differ from other minaturized taxa but are shared with one or more larger‐bodied gecko taxa. Narudasia shares a number of putatively derived features with at least some representatives of a large clade of Afro‐Malagasy gekkonids, but at present neither molecular nor osteological data adequately resolve its relationships. It remains a phylogenetic enigma, but more extensive osteological taxon sampling across the Gekkota may ultimately reveal synapomorphies uniting Narudasia with particular Afro‐Malagasy genera.",

The tongue was fairly elongated and terminated in oval apex. Cone‐shaped filiform papilla was composed of one larger main papilla and two smaller secondary papillae, which emerged from bottom of main papilla. Rounded fungiform papillae were randomly distributed on the body and torus, and some fungiform papillae were surrounded by evident groove. On the ventral surface, some of them had evident fossa on their surfaces. The lenticular papillae on the lateral and rostral side of the torus were smaller in length compared with ones localized on central region of the torus. Eleven to fourteen circumvallate papillae were situated on each caudolateral side of the torus. The circumvallate papillae were surrounded by a prominent gustatory groove and there were no annular pads surrounding the groove. Morphological features of the tongue of the chital deer were similar to some wild and domestic ruminants. In this regard; it is thought that this research will provide morphological contributions for deer species as there are not sufficient and detailed sources on species‐specific morphology in researches on Cervidae family.",

Osteoderm microstructure indicates the presence of a crocodylian‐like trunk bracing system in a group of armoured basal tetrapods. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 260–280. The microstructure of dorsal osteoderms referred to the chroniosuchid taxa Chroniosuchus , Chroniosaurus , Madygenerpeton and cf. Uralerpeton is compared to existing data on the bystrowianid chroniosuchian Bystrowiella and further tetrapods. Chroniosuchid osteoderms are marked by thin internal and relatively thick external cortices that consist of lowly vascularised parallel‐fibred bone. They are structured by growth marks and, in case of Madygenerpeton , by lines of arrested growth. The cancellous middle region is marked by a high degree of remodelling and a primary bone matrix of parallel‐fibred bone that may include domains of interwoven structural fibres. Whereas the convergence of Bystrowiella and chroniosuchid osteoderms is not confirmed by our observations, the internal cortex of the latter displays a significant peculiarity: It contains distinct bundles of shallowly dipping Sharpey’s fibres with a cranio‐ or caudoventral orientation. We interpret this feature as indicative for the attachment of epaxial muscles which spanned several vertebral segments between the medioventral surface of the osteoderms and the transversal processes of the thoracic vertebrae. This finding endorses the hypothesis that the chroniosuchid osteoderm series was part of a crocodylian‐like trunk bracing system that supported terrestrial locomotion. According to the measured range of osteoderm bone compactness, some chroniosuchian species may have had a more aquatic lifestyle than others.",

Abstract The skin in the lumbar region of nine species of Pleurodema and in the monotypic genus Somuncuria (Anura: Leiuperidae) bears macroglands [lumbar gland (LG)]. Lumbar glands of Pleurodema bibroni , P. borellii , P. brachyops , P. bufoninum , P. cinereum , P. cordobae , P. kriegi , and P. thaul , as well as Somuncuria somuncurensis, were examined using histological and histochemical methods. The epidermis and the dermis of LGs are described. Also, skin of LGs presents characteristic features as the interruption of the Eberth–Katschenko layer and the presence of a differentiated type of gland only observed in macrogland and not previously described for Pleurodema or Somuncuria ; this is termed lumbar serous gland. These glands are filled with a granular product, which occasionally is immersed in a matrix. Differences in the secretory products of mucous and serous glands are described, as well as inter‐ and intraspecific variability of gland structure. The mode of toxin expulsion from macroglands and the homology between lumbar and inguinal glands among anuran families are discussed.",

The present study aimed at analyzing spermatogenesis and the changes occurring in the testis throughout the reproductive cycle in the South American perciform fish Cichlasoma dimerus . Testes were studied using light and electron microscopy techniques. This species has an unrestricted lobular testis composed of two compartments: germinal, containing Sertoli and germ cells, exhibiting a cystic mode of spermatogenesis; and interstitial, composed of Leydig cells and connective tissue elements. Spermatozoa belong to the anacrosomal type I aquasperm and possess two flagella, this being the first report of an externally fertilizing cichlid exhibiting biflagellate sperm. Under laboratory conditions, C. dimerus proved to be a multiple spawner throughout the year, with a season of higher reproductive activity extending from September to March, during which fish spawned on average every 29.4 days. Changes in the germinal epithelium and the germ cell stages present allowed the description of five reproductive classes: regressed, early, mid‐, and late maturation, and regression. During the high reproductive season, each cycle went through the first four classes. The regressed class overlapped with the late maturation class, because sperm was being released while spermatogonia were proliferating. The regression class occurred solely in sexually inactive males during the period of low reproductive activity.",

Statistical analysis of whole‐skin thickness revealed two main groups according to body regions; the first with thin skin (wing and tail membrane) and the second with thick skin (head and dorsum, abdomen, footpad). The density of hair was evaluated by a novel method, and it revealed that the density was significantly higher in the head region than in dorsal and ventral body parts. These differences possibly play a role for bat ectoparasites when choosing the preferred region of their host. Along the axis of each hair, the scale morphology was found to be variable. Hair morphology, however, did not vary among body regions. Mast cells were numerous in the hairy areas around vessels and hair follicles of the dorsum and abdomen, which are easily accessible to ectoparasites. Increased numbers of mast cells in hair‐bearing skin are part of the host adaptation system in parasite‐preferred locations.",

Filiform papillae and their CTC s lie throughout the tongue surface, featuring subtypes and different shapes. Fungiform papillae are dome‐shaped, and their CTC s are few, with heterogenic disposition among the filiform papillae in the lingual apex and body and in grooves stretching to the side margin among the foliate papillae towards the lingual apex. Foliate papillae are well developed, and their CTC s are composed of five pairs of parallel seams limited by deep grooves placed bilaterally in the caudal region. Two vallate papillae are observed in the caudal region and reveal specialized structures which are developed and differentiated when they present compound elements by a double epithelial projection, in a column, similar to the shape of the foliate papilla. Further, the epithelium is organized by layers with ultrastructural components. Therefore, we conclude that the structural descriptions, dimensional aspects of tongue papillae, their CTC s and the ultrastructure of the tongue epithelium of guinea pigs are similar to other rodent mammals, however, with new descriptions as double epithelial projection constituting each vallate papilla.",

The dentine of the teeth is divided in two layers: an inner layer of circumpulpal dentine and an external one of pallial dentine, and their apical top has a lightly flattened cap of enameloid. A peculiar specificity of the teeth is the presence of plicidentine in their basal part, which is thought to strengthen the tooth attachment. This is a new example of plicidentine in teleostean teeth following its description in the lingual teeth of the osteoglossid Arapaima gigas . Some other ichthyophagous Characiformes also show caniniformes teeth with plicidentine: Hydrocynus , Hydrolycus . So, in the Actinopterygii, plicidentine is not limited to the lepisosteids only. We interpret plicidentine in the teeth of these actinopterygian fishes as a morphofunctional adaptation to a predatory life style.",

In fact, at least with respect to external features, we found a similar level of disparity. N . h. haje embryos lagged behind those of N . kaouthia in body and head scale development, size in ovo and hatchling length, despite having a slightly shorter incubation period and a somewhat larger adult size. Some of these differences may have been the result of differing incubation temperatures. Nonetheless, there does appear to be a broadly conserved pattern of in ovo development in at least macrostomatan snakes.",

The stimulation of the proliferation process may involve the proto‐oncogene c‐myc . The immunocytochemical analysis detects the c‐myc protein few days after wound in free cells accumulating over the injured tissues of the tail stump. Western blot detects a protein band at 68–70 kD a that is more intense in the regenerating blastema than in normal tail tissues. Nuclei positive for the c‐myc protein are seen in mesenchymal‐like cells located among muscles, connectives and fat tissues of the tail stump 4 days postamputation. Proliferating cells labelled for 5BrdU are seen at 4 days postamputation and are sparse in the mesenchyme of the regenerating blastema formed at 12 days postamputation. Fine immunolocalization of the c‐myc protein shows it is mainly located over euchromatin or poorly condensed chromatin to indicate gene activation. The study correlates the detection of the c‐myc protein with activation of cell division in the injured tissues leading to the formation of the regenerative blastema. The lizard c‐myc protein probably activates a controlled proliferation process through a mechanism that can give information on the uncontrolled process occurring in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During tail regeneration in lizards, the epidermis forms new scales comprising a hard beta‐layer and a softer alpha‐layer. Regenerated scales derive from a controlled folding process of the wound epidermis that gives rise to epidermal pegs where keratinocytes do not invade the dermis. Basal keratinocytes of pegs give rise to suprabasal cells that initially differentiate into a corneous wound epidermis and later in corneous layers of the regenerated scales. The immunodetection of a putative p53/63 protein in the regenerating tail of lizards shows that immunoreactivity is present in the nuclei of basal cells of the epidermis but becomes mainly cytoplasmic in suprabasal and in differentiating keratinocytes. Sparse labelled cells are present in the regenerating blastema, muscles, cartilage, ependyma and nerves of the growing tail. Ultrastructural observations on basal and suprabasal keratinocytes show that the labelling is mainly present in the euchromatin and nucleolus while labelling is more diffuse in the cytoplasm. These observations indicate that the nuclear protein in basal keratinocytes might control their proliferation avoiding an uncontrolled spreading into other tissues of the regenerating tail but that in suprabasal keratinocytes the protein moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a process that might be associated to keratinocyte differentiation.",

Locomotory design of ‘cyclostome’ fishes: Spatial arrangement and architecture of myosepta and lamellae. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 81 : 267–283 In recent years, it has been established that the main features of the locomotory apparatus of gnathostome fishes (myoseptal and muscular system) have remained relatively unchanged throughout evolution. The petromyzontiforms (lampreys) and myxiniforms (hagfishes) display a similar way of undulatory locomotion as gnathostomes. We investigated whether the anatomical features of the myoseptal system that facilitate undulatory locomotion in gnathostomes are also present in lampreys and hagfishes. We present a description of the myoseptal system, including for the first time the spatial arrangement and fibre architecture in ‘cyclostomes’, using a clearing technique, microdissections, polarized light microscopy, and SEM. We revealed that the myoseptal system of the Myxiniformes, Petromyzontiformes and Gnathostomata are each constructed in different ways. Petromyzontiform myosepta lack the conical structures but bear tendon‐like structures in the flanking parts. Their central parts lack tendon‐like structures but possess a system of crossing collagen fibres. Myxiniform myosepta bear comparable conical structures as gnathostomes but a highly asymmetric spatial arrangement. The fibre architecture of myosepta is not comparable to any of the two remaining taxa. The collagen fibre architectures of the multiple horizontal sheets of lamellae in ‘cyclostomes’ and the gnathostome horizontal septum are comparable. Our results 1) support the monophyly of Myopterygii (Petromyzontiformes + gnathostomes and a sistergroup relationshop of Myopterygii and Myxiniformes; 2) demonstrate that considerable changes must have taken place in the locomotory apparatus early in vertebrate evolution.",

Structure and development of the ctenial spines on the scales of a teleost fish, the cichlid Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 81 : 139–158 Numerous teleost species possess ctenoid scales characterized by the presence of ctenial spines arranged in rows (the cteni) along their posterior, free margin. Whilst the morphology and function of the ctenial spines are similar to those of odontodes (extra‐oral teeth), e.g. in armored catfish, their homology is questionable. To address this problem, we have studied ctenial spine development, structure, attachment to a bony support, and replacement with the aim of comparing these features to those described for odontodes. The ctenial spines have been studied in a growth series of the cichlid Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum , using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Ctenial spines are entirely constituted of a collagen matrix. They lack a pulp cavity and, although their distal end can be in contact with the epidermal basal layer cells, they are not covered by an enameloid‐like tissue. They are attached to the scale by means of a narrow strand of unmineralized collagen matrix acting as a ligament and allowing spines to be movable. The ctenial spines develop as prolongations of the external layer of the scale, a woven‐fibroid collagen matrix, and subsequently grow by addition of parallel‐fibred collagen matrix. New ctenial spines are added at the posterior scale border in waves that follow the same rhythm as the deposition of circuli in the anterior region. From the focus region to the scale border, the ctenial spines constitute lines in which only the most posterior ctenial spine is functional. The other spines that are no longer functional are not shed but resorbed from the top, and their attachment region mineralizes and thickens by deposition of new material. The remnants of spines constitute the main part of the superficial layer of the scale in which anchoring bundles attach; this region is covered afterwards by the limiting layer, a tissue devoid of collagen fibrils. Because of their tooth‐like morphology (shape and size), their posterior orientation and their attachment to the scale surface, the ctenial spines resemble odontodes. Moreover, both elements perform a similar hydrodynamic function. Nevertheless, the structure and development of the ctenial spines differ completely from those of odontodes and consequently, they cannot be considered homologous elements. Ctenial spines and odontodes in teleosts provide us with a beautiful example of homoplasy; they share shape and function, but have a different origin as evidenced by their different structure and process of development.",

Here we describe the muscle fiber types in both the superficial and deep bellies of the pectoralis of one such adept soaring species, the white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos). Histochemical techniques are used to demonstrate both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced) and myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase activities within the muscle fibers. Immunocytochemical methods employing several monoclonal antibodies, each directed against a different myosin heavy chain epitope of the chicken, are also used to characterize the fibers. While the superficial belly of the muscle consists entirely of fast‐twitch oxidative‐glycolytic fibers, the deep belly is composed exclusively of slow fibers. These slow fibers are labelled by two different antibodies specific for chicken slow myosin. We suggest that the fibers of the superficial belly are best suited to flapping flight, and that the fibers of the deep belly would be recruited only during soaring flight. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the deep belly found in the pectoralis of soaring species probably evolved from a deep neuromuscular compartment of the superficial belly.",

Sphenomorphus group spermatozoa (e.g. Ctenotus ) and the Egernia group ( Tiliqua ) differ from the more derived Eugongylus group ( C. virgatus, L. delicata and C. pectoralis ) in that the acrosome is elongate and apically depressed; the perforatorium is strongly oblique; the midpiece is relatively short, with four dense ring structures in longitudinal succession; mitochondria are columnar; and enlarged peripheral fibres 3 and 8 do not show the gross anterior enlargement seen in Carlia and Lampropholis. Heteronotia binoei (Gekkonidae) sperm have no epinuclear electron‐lucent region; nuclear shoulders are smooth, as in sphenomorph but not Eugongylus group skinks; mitochondria are columnar; unlike skinks, the median surfaces of the mitochondria are indented by triangular, sometimes longitudinally, interconnected dense bodies. In Lialis burtonis (Pygopodidae) sperm, the perforatorium extends virtually to the tip of the fore‐shortened apically domed acrosome; nuclear shoulders are absent; the mitochondria alternate singly or in groups with one or more dense bodies which also form an interrupted collar around the distal centriole. Spermatozoal ultrastructure suggests that a common ancestry of snakes and pygopods deserves consideration.",

Instead, the first step is a transverse fission. This results in the detachment of the caudal fourth of the mother animal. The detached part forms what we call the butterfly stage, which initially has no mouth and no eye fields. This stage gives rise to two new individuals by a longitudinal fission. Within 2–3 days the eye fields and a mouth develop in each of the two progenies formed in this way. In the meantime the mother individual grows and develops the three typical caudal lobes. The mother animal can repeat this process resulting in three individuals every fourth day. The finding of this new pattern of reproduction in the Acoela has prompted us to review the various ways by which asexual reproduction occurs in the group. The peculiar combination of few cases but high diversity of asexual reproduction in the Acoela is discussed from an evolutionary point of view.",

Some species are considered parasitic, others commensal. This study focuses on the phylogeny of the tribe, using two other Carapidae species as an outgroup ( Snyderidia canina and Onuxodon fowleri ). Insofar as possible, the selected anatomical and behavioural characters where chosen in an ecomorphological perspective, as features that could be responses to various lifestyle‐related constraints. Our character selection also took into account the fact that some features are (presumably) linked. Such features were grouped together as a single trait to avoid their overvaluation. This methodology enabled commensals to be separated from parasites, the former belonging to Carapus and the latter to Encheliophis. Carapus species reflect in their morphology the constraints imposed by a diet of hard, mobile, elusive prey, showing predator‐type features: a strong dentition, a wide mouth opening, a robust food intake apparatus. On the other hand, the endoparasitic Encheliophis species show a generally weaker buccal apparatus and narrow mouth opening, in relation to the different constraints of their lifestyle where the diet constraints are less pronounced: they eat body parts of their host. Changes in both generic diagnoses are proposed and three species are transferred from Encheliophis to Carapus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Serial and interval electron micrograph series were used to examine the rostral and anterodorsal nerves of 12.5‐day‐old amphioxus larvae and trace selected fibres to their targets in the nerve cord. The nerves contain a variety of fibre types, including axons from at least two types of epithelial sensory cells and neurites derived from dorsal (Retzius) bipolar cells located within the cord. The rostral epithelial cells form basal synapses with a population of peripheral neurites that probably derive from the dorsal bipolar cells, though other sources are possible. Varicosities containing dense‐core vesicles occur at the tip of the rostrum, indicating the presence of efferent innervation at this site. Within the cord, some peripherally derived rostral afferents terminate at the level of the anterior cerebral vesicle, others synapse directly with both motoneurones and the notochord, but those in the largest bundle target the dendrites of the large paired neurones (LPNs) located in the primary motor centre. LPN dendrites also receive synapses from sensory fibres arriving via the anterodorsal nerves, from the anterior‐most of the dorsal bipolar cells, referred to here as tectal cells, and from a single fibre derived from the frontal eye. This convergence of multiple inputs accords with other evidence that the LPNs are key intermediaries in the sensorimotor pathway that activates the larval escape response. The rostral nerves are much larger at metamorphosis, but the ventral tracts that derive from them are still comparatively small. This is because the majority of rostral fibres are diverted into a late‐developing dorsal tract that travels within the cord to the front end of the dorsolateral neuropile, where most of its fibres disperse and form synapses. The positioning of the dorsal and ventral tracts strongly suggests homology with vertebrate olfactory and terminal nerves, respectively. This, and the question of whether the amphioxus central nervous system has anything comparable to the olfactory bulb, a telencephalic structure, is discussed.",

The bufonoid neobatrachians (corresponding with the Arcifera of some classifications) form a monophyletic assemblage which is characterized by the possession, unique for the Anura, of a conical perforatorium; the rod‐like perforatorium, which is plesiomorphic for tetrapods, is absent. Of the taxa investigated, the myobatrachids appear to be the sister‐group of the remaining bufonoids, here termed eubufonoids (leptodactylids, rhinodermatids, hylids, and bufonids). The spermatozoa of the myobatrachids Limnodynastes, Neobatrachus , and Mixophyes are very similar to each other despite extremely varied fertilization biology. Symplesiomorphies for the Anura which they exhibit include the conical acrosome with subacrosomal material, the elongate, cylindrical nucleus, single flagellum and, paralleling this, an undulating membrane which is supported by a longitudinal element, the axial (major) fibre, the latter being accompanied in the midpiece by mitochondria. A myobatrachid synapomorphy appears to be the presence of a periaxial sheath enclosing the axial fibre of the flagellum. Forward extension of the axial fibre into the centriolar fossa in myobatrachids is seen elsewhere only exceptionally (in the bufonid Nectophrynoides). Bufonids, and most other eubufonoids including leptodactylids, differ apomorphically from Limnodynastes , and Neobatrachus in location of the mitochondria at the axonemal end (and in a collar) rather than the axial fibre end of the undulating membrane. In Mixophyes , mitochondria surround the nuclear‐axonemal junction in a cytoplasmic droplet and are probably shed with this at maturity.",

Comparative biology of oogenesis in nemertean worms. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 82 : 213–230 In order to supplement previous analyses of oogenesis in nemertean worms, this study uses light and electron microscopy to compare the ovaries and oocytes in 16 species of nemerteans that represent various taxa within the phylum. Nemertean ovaries comprise serially repeated sacs with an ovarian wall that characteristically includes myofilament‐containing cells interspersed among the germinal epithelium. Each oocyte can attach to the germinal epithelium by a vegetally situated stalk and resides in the ovarian lumen without being surrounded by follicle cells. In the ovary, oocytes arrest at prophase I of meiosis and contain a hypertrophied nucleus (‘germinal vesicle’) that often possesses multiple nucleoli. Intraovarian growth apparently involves an autosynthetic mode of yolk formation in most nemerteans and generates oocytes that measure ~60 µm to 1 mm. When fully developed, oocytes can be discharged through a short gonoduct and are either spawned freely or deposited within egg cases. In most species, oocytes released from the ovary possess extracellular coats and resume maturation by undergoing germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Such post‐GVBD specimens also form a punctate endoplasmic reticulum that may facilitate fertilization and development.",

The brain has a main subpharyngeal portion and a weak suprapharyngeal commissure. It is circumpharyngeal only in early developmental stages, the dorsal commissure is reduced in the adult stage. Four giant cells and a cerebral cavity are adult features. Although the morphology of the giant cells is elucidated, their function remains unclear, but a sensory function is probable. A septum marks the posterior border of the anterior end and divides a cerebral cavity from a body cavity. A precursor of the septum is present in the first stage observed, but it lies next to the epidermis and does not separate a cerebral cavity. Cuticular structures in the pre‐pharyngeal region of the early stages are interpreted as remnants of the larval boring organ. They are moulted together with the larval cuticle. The morphology of the pharynx and the anterior part of the intestine is shown.",

Wing‐scale terminology is reviewed. Three different types of bilayer wing‐scale covering are recognized; only a few groups have a single‐layer wing‐scale covering. The general scale arrangement is random, but a few taxa have clustered scale arrangements and scattered heteroneurans have scales arranged in transverse rows. Cross ribs are present in all taxa, but only as vestiges in eriocraniid cover scales. Ridge dimorphism is widespread in Neolepidoptera. Surprisingly, ridges and cross ribs on the adwing scale surface are of general occurrence in Neopseustidae and Hepialidae, and are even found on parts of the ground scales of many other Neolepidoptera. Morphological evidence strongly indicates that the fused wing‐scale types found in non‐Coelolepidan Lepidoptera and Neolepidoptera are independently evolved, as evidenced from the presence of vestigial perforations. Absence of perforations is not infallible evidence that a scale is solid. Microtrichia are independently reduced in a number of taxa and probably re‐evolved in at least higher nepticulids. Wing vestiture and scale characters indicate that Tischerioidea may be the sister group of Ditrysia.",

Seven naupliar stages are recognized, based mainly on significant morphological differences between them, but in one case, on size alone. The seven stages range in length from 156 µm to 760 µm. Nauplius 1 is nonfeeding with incompletely developed and nonfunctional feeding structures. Nauplius 2 has apparently functional feeding structures, including a well‐developed mandibular gnathobase, setulate protopodal endites of the antennae, and setules on various setae involved in swimming and food manipulation. Nauplius 3 is morphologically identical to Nauplius 2, but more than 50% larger. In nauplius 4, the coxal endite (naupliar process) of the antennae develops a bifid tip. Nauplius 5 has a lateral pair of primordial carapace lobes, and the first 4–5 pairs of trunk limb buds are weakly developed, making the anterior part of the trunk wider than the posterior. In nauplius 6, five pairs of trunk limb buds are visible externally and a small carapace has appeared, reaching approximately to trunk limbs 2; also, the pair of large buds behind the mandibles in previous stages has become divided into a large, anterior, setose bud and two smaller, posterior buds. The identities of these structures as either paragnaths or maxillules/maxillae remain uncertain. In nauplius 7, about six pairs of trunk limb buds are visible externally. The general morphology of the nauplius larvae of E. braueriana is much like those of the well‐known Limnadia lenticularis (Linnaeus, 1758) and Eulimnadia texana Packard, 1871, including an elongate, lanceolate labrum; however, because of various heterochronies, the correspondence between the larval sequences of these species is not perfect. There is even less correspondence with the 5‐stage larval development reported for Limnadia stanleyana King, 1855, and the spatulate labra of that species and Jmnadia spp. are different from those of other known limnadiid nauplii. The larvae of E. braueriana possess many typical (and synapomorphic) branchiopod features, such as the general morphology of the appendages involved in feeding and the mode of trunk limb development, while the small buds of the first antennae and the exact number and development of the parts of the trunk limbs are typical for the Spinicaudata.",

The smallest of the larvae are round to oval, have 20 longitudinal ridges, a series of transverse ridges, and have two pairs of laterally situated tubuli near the posterior limits. The second larva‐type is dorsoventrally compressed, has a single dorsal and single unsculptured ventral plate each with a prominent midridge near the anterior limits, three infolded lateral plates with a pair of tubuli near the posterior limits. The third and fourth larva‐types remain dorsoventrally flattened; the third larva‐type has less pronounced sculpturing than the fourth larva‐type and is smaller; two pairs of tubuli are situated as in the previous stage. The number and arrangement of scalids on the introvert and pharyngeal teeth differ according to each of the four larva‐types and are described. The ultrastructure of all organ systems is described. All scalids are sensilla equipped with ciliated receptor cells. The cuticle is similar to the cuticle in the adult and differs fundamentally from the cuticle of larval Halicryptus. The trunk is richly supplied with sensory structures. Trunk tubuli contain secretory cells. Posteriorly, a gland complex was found which presumably is the precursor of the equivalent gland in postlarvae and adults. The implications of the first larva‐type's structural similarity to the larva of Tubiluchus are discussed.",

On this basis a re‐investigation of the cephalic nervous system and of the innervation and homologues of the anterior end appendages of these animals appeared necessary: the existing literature proved insufficient for detailed comparisons with other polychaete families and many earlier statements were quite contradictory. In the present paper, the brain commissures and the innervation of, inter alia, the antennae and the palps of Neanthes virens and Nereis pelagica are described. Special attention was paid to the roots of the circum‐oesophageal connectives and the ganglia in this part of the nervous system. The results, summarized in schematic diagrams and tables, are compared with corresponding observations in 14 other polychaete families. In a discussion of the architecture of the polychaete nervous system as a phylogenetic instrument, the supposed segmentation of the polychaete brain is questioned and the idea that the configuration of the polychaete nervous system offers support to the cyclomer theory is rejected. Other conclusions concerning the relationships within the Polychaeta are pointed out.",

The superior cavity is found just underneath the external naris and forms a vestibule both for the principal olfactory organ and the vomeronasal organ. The vomeronasal sensory epithelium is located in the medial region of the inferior cavity and contains ciliated cells and microvillous receptor cells. Inspection of microscopic sections of frogs that had been swimming in fluorescent colorants revealed fluorescence on the surface of the vomeronasal organ, but not on that of the olfactory organ. Observations in vivo show that water enters via the external naris by two fissures, one on each side of the movable nasal lid, passes the middle cavity to flow via the sensory epithelium of the inferior cavity. The design of the frog nose makes it possible for this amphibious animal to sample the chemical composition of its environment; above water the frog can inhale air and expose its olfactory organ to volatile substances; in water the vomeronasal organ samples water‐borne substances. These new findings are discussed in relation to the air/water interface and the position of the amphibians in the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates.",

The period of the microscopic growth increments was shown, by both a rearing experiment and interpolation from fish of known age, to be daily. By rearing sibling chinook salmon at different temperatures (while still maintaining them on the same diet) it was shown that the width of the daily growth increment varies with temperature, but neither multi‐ nor sub‐daily increments appear in the area of regular, daily growth incrementation. Inclusions of the vaterite morph of calcium carbonate crystallizing in the botryoidal habit occur in the otherwise aragonitic otolith. Regularly spaced check rings in the sulcul part of the otolith are homologous with those occurring in the dorsal and ventral growth axis and are. on average, separated by about 28 microincrements.",

A few larval features apparently unique for species of Metopia have so far been documented: base of mouth‐hook with a lateral arm‐like extension and abdominal segments with transverse furrow ventrally.

The presence of an anus is confirmed. However, the chambered organ and glandular axial organ peculiar to crinoids are lacking. The gut lumen sometimes includes partially digested prey items up to several hundred micrometers in diameter, and we propose that Holopus may feed raptorially by rapidly closing its arms over demersal zooplankton. Electron microscopy of the arm reveals a radial nerve and a radial haemal channel, which light microscopy previously failed to demonstrate. The cuticle includes bacteria that are probably symbiotic. The ten brachial nerves of the aboral nervous system unite pairwise to form five calyx nerves. The calyx nerves, one in each radial position, are connected by a pentagonal, interradial commissure and then continue to the attached end of the body where they end blindly without forming an aboral nerve center. The absence of the aboral nerve center and related internal organs strengthens the argument that no basal ossicles are included in the skeleton of the calyx and suggests that Holopus may have evolved from stalked cyrtocrinid ancestors by saltatory loss of major body parts.",

Two types of presumably neuronal perikarya contain small cytoplasmic granules, similar to those in nerve fibre profiles. One of these neurons has a pale nucleus with a prominent nucleolus, the other a rather inconspicuous nucleus similar to that of the tanycytic cells. The neuronal processes of the fibre ring differ in diameter and contain clear and dense core vesicles, small granules (high or medium electron density) or granules with a dense periphery and a light centre. Sometimes neighbouring processes seem interconnected by electrical synapses. Images suggesting chemical synapses are rare. A large intraepithelial nerve lies in the wall of the introvert and ventral body wall close to the musculature, possibly innervated by this nerve.

The stalk is supported by a scries of skeletal ossicles pierced by a central canal: short intercolumnal ligaments connect adjacent skeletal ossicles and central through‐going ligaments run the length of the central canal. At the end of the stalk nearest the calyx, the chambered organ and the closely associated axial organ are histologically similar to those of adult crinoids. Presumed neurosecretory neurons are associated with the intercolumnal ligaments, and the following kinds of nerves run down the central canal: (1) a large stalk nerve in each of the five interradii; (2) smaller coelomic nerves in each of the five radii in association with the epithelium of tubular aboral extensions of the chambered organ; (3) a very small nerve associated with the aboral extension of the axial organ in the stalk axis.

Sensory cells grouped on the ventral surface of the head bear ciliary processes (some with multiple tubules), and are probably in connexion with the central nervous system by their own axons, unlike the sensory cells of the hair fan vibration receptors of head and body. The ventral ganglion is motor to the locomotor muscles of the body, and controls the rhythmic locomotor activity of the animal. Electrical events associated with contraction of these muscles are compound non‐overshooting spike‐like potentials. The ventral ganglion contains several large nerve fibres constant in position and connexions in different individuals. Some of these arise from cells in the ganglia of the head, and pass to the ventral ganglion, others from cells within the ventral ganglion, and probably supply the ciliary hair fan receptors of the body, whilst the motor axons issuing from the ventral ganglion are smaller in diameter. The ganglion is arranged on a ladder‐like plan, and axons of the lateral cell bodies cross the central neuropil transversely before they contribute to the longitudinal tracts or pass out in the radial nerves. Synapses in the neuropil contain 30–40 nm electron lucent vesicles; the transmitter is unknown, but is unlikely to be either acetylcholine or l ‐glutamate. Occasional larger electron dense vesicles up to 70 nm in diameter are also found within nerve fibres of the neuropil. It is concluded that the arrangement of the peripheral nervous system is unlike that of several groups which have been suggested as related to chaetognaths.",

Ossification of epiphyses was rare in the phalanges of the first and fifth digits and in the more distal phalanges of the second, third and fourth digits. Along with the morphology of the first metacarpal and the more distal phalanges this suggested paedomorphosis relative to delphinids. Male and female porpoises showed similar progression of epiphyseal development until approximately the sixth year. From then on, female porpoises showed more progressed development than males. This suggests a higher level of paedomorphosis in the male porpoise. The mechanism behind phocoenid paedomorphosis seems to be progenesis, probably as an adaptation towards a high reproductive rate relative to the delphinids.",

These glands have been recorded for many of the anomalodesmatan families and are used as a key morphological character in recent attempts to unravel the evolutionary relationships within the Anomalodesmata. The glands occur in Laternula elliptica , L. truncata , L. boschasina and L. marilina , discharging from the top of muscular papillae at the distal tip of the siphons. The secretions are laid down as threads organized in longitudinal lines along the length of the periostracum that covers the siphonal walls. This is the first record of arenophilic mantle glands in members of the Laternulidae, a finding that not only broadens our current knowledge of the family's morphology, but assists in the reconstruction of anomalodesmatan evolutionary history.",

Common features are: (a) a fibrillar collagen‐like, 0.2 μm thick, investing capsule continuous with the brain capsule; (b) an inner wall made up of six or more flattened and overlapping parietal cells; (c) a statolith forming cell hanging from the dorsal side down in the lumen, with a large statolith containing vacuole; (d) a bilateral pair of spindle shaped accessory cell groups, adjoining the statolith cell and sending projections to the wall—nerve projections run through the capsule; (e) one accessory cell enveloping the other cells of the group has a filament containing cytoplasm, the filaments coverging into a hemidesmosome making contact with a projection coming from a parietal cell; (f) muscles from the longitudinal body musculature inserting onto the capsule externally.

The ovaries are H‐shaped, extending from behind the stomach and ending at the 1st or 2nd abdominal somite. The male has a pair of testes from which the VD issue and extend over the pereon. For males and females, macroscopic categories of gonad development are defined. Stages of the male gonad are defined as types 1, 2 and 3. Type 1 includes the less developed gonads, and type 3 includes extremely developed testes and completely differentiated VD. The ovaries are classified into four stages according to their colour: I (white), II (yellow), III (orange) and IV (red), beginning with the least developed gonads. The number and size of oogonia and oocytes depend on the stage of the ovary and coincide with the different degrees of development as indicated by ovary colour. In males, the presence or absence of spermatozoa in the testes and VD is determined only for the more developed gonads. Neither spermathecae (female) nor spermatophores (male) were found. The lack of spermatophore in the present species is a rare characteristic among the anomurans.",

In addition, histological sections and cleared and double‐stained autopodia of recently hatched and juvenile specimens representing seven chelid and pelomedusoid species were studied. There is much more morphological diversity in the manus than in the pes. Variation in autopodial skeletons includes: the astragalus and calcaneum are either separated or fused; fusion of distal carpals 3–4−5 or just 4–5; number of centralia in the carpus; and presence/absence of a pisiform and of an accessory radial element. The widespread and probably basal phalangeal formula for Pleurodira is 2.3.3.3.3. Deviations are Pelomedusa subrufa , exhibiting a reduction to 2.2.2.2.2, Pelusios spp. with one phalanx less in digit I and for one species in digit V as well, and Acanthochelys pallidipectoris with an additional phalanx in the fourth finger. Six discrete characters itemizing some of the morphological variation observed were plotted on a composite pleurodire phylogeny, revealing not only homoplastic patterns but also the utility of some characters in supporting the monophyly of several clades. The pisiform is the last carpal element to ossify in Chelus fimbriatus. We hypothesize that the so‐called fifth hooked metatarsal represents the fusion of distal tarsal 5 with metatarsal V. The accessory radial element that was occasionally present in the turtles examined may represent an atavism of the otherwise lost radiale of turtles.",

However, sperm competition and mating systems have been demonstrated to influence variations in the sperm morphology and dynamics. The mating system of Boa constrictor occidentalis is likely to have a high degree of sperm competition. We investigated, for the first time, the ultrastructure of the spermatozoa of B. c. occidentalis and, thus, of the family Boidae. Active mating groups were captured from the field, and the spermatozoa of the males was collected by ejaculation and processed to obtain transmission electron micrographs and fluorescence micrographs. The spermatozoa are filiform and their morphology fits the general model described for snakes, and several synapomorphies belonging to the squamates can be identified in these cells. Nevertheless, the head is 25% longer and the midpiece presents a lower frequency of mitochondrial transformations than that of other snakes. We propose that this last trait, along with the extraordinary elongation of the midpiece and the system of multilaminar membranes covering this section (both synapomorphies of the snake spermatozoa), are adaptive responses to processes of sperm competition and sperm storage.",

In the pigmented colonies, a specialized blood pigment cell type was recognized that, in giant membrane‐limited vacuoles, contained a great number of granules. In general, the granules were similar in size, not individually limited by a membrane and were made up with electrondense material often arranged in concentric rings. Although there could be some variability within the same cell, in each phenotype the granules displayed a characteristic pattern so that the differences in colour of the granules, as seen in vivo , were paralleled by differences in the ultrastructural architecture. In the unpigmented colonies also, granulated vacuolar cells, rare in number but morphologically comparable to the pigment cells, were seen. On the basis of these results, the hypothesis of the existence of a prospective pigment cell and of a common origin for all the pigment cells of B. schlosseri is discussed.",

Members of the sand lizard group exhibit three different modes of burying into sand. The general morphology of the forelimb muscles of those Liolaemus species is analysed. Herein, we present a study of the forelimb musculature of all species considered by Halloy et al . (1998). This study has three principal goals. First, we are seeking myological characters that will be useful in formulating phylogenetic hypothesis about the species of Liolaemus . With these characters, we also wish to compile morphological data that represent the morphological space implied in the diverse locomotor behaviours of these animals. Second, we are looking for derived features that reflect functional changes in the use of forelimb. Third, we wish to provide a cladistic analysis that can be used to test phylogenetic hypothesis derived from other sources of data. We present 48 characters in a data set and analyse it cladistically. We obtained a hypothesis of relationships of the Liolaemus species and compared this with previous hypotheses based on other characters. The trees obtained are not congruent with previously proposed phylogenies. We were unable to identify in our trees nodes that are based on structures reflecting functional changes in the use of the forelimb. The morphological similarities in the forelimb musculature of all species analysed seems to conform a very conservative general anatomical pattern with which Liolaemus sand lizards perform most of their locomotor behaviours.",

Comparative growth in the postnatal skull of the extant North American turtle Pseudemys texana (Testudinoidea: Emydidae). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 88 : 000–000 Postnatal growth is one of the many aspects of developmental morphology that remains distinctly understudied in reptiles. Variation and ontogenetic scaling within the skull of the extant emydid turtle, Pseudemys texana is described based on 25 continuous characters. Results indicate that skull shape in this species changes little during postnatal growth relative to the only cryptodire taxa for which comparable datasets are available ( Apalone ferox and Sternotherus odoratus ). This relative lack of change results in the paedomorphic retention of a largely juvenile appearance in the adult form of P. texana . The skulls of males and females, despite the presence of distinct sexual dimorphism in size, grow with similar scaling patterns, and the few observed differences appear to reflect alteration of the male growth trajectory. Comparisons with A. ferox and S. odoratus reveal a number of similarities and differences that are here interpreted within a phylogenetic context. These preliminary hypotheses constitute predictive statements that phylogenetically bracket the majority of extant cryptodire species and provide baseline comparative data that are necessary for the future recognition of apomorphic transformations. Plasticity of ontogenetic scaling as a response to the homeostatic needs and behaviour of individuals commonly is evoked as a limitation of ontogenetic scaling as a means to inform phylogenetic studies. These evocations are largely unfounded considering that variability itself can evolve and thus be phylogenetically informative.",

Several specimens were recollected at the type locality in Russia. Spicules and radulae were studied by scanning electron microscopy. Semithin sections were prepared and a computer‐based three‐dimensional reconstruction of all major organ systems was made using amira software. Our results show significant differences from the original description, e.g. the nervous system shows paired rhinophoral and gastro‐oesophageal ganglia and large aggregations of precerebral accessory ganglia, whereas the presence of a postulated posterior genital ganglion can be excluded; the radula is asymmetric; the circulatory system includes a small heart; and the reproductive system comprises a sac‐like ampulla and three female glands. The most surprising discrepancy to the original description refers to the complete absence of any mantle cavity. The gonopore, anus and nephropore open separately to the exterior. Instead of being aberrant or basal, A. murmanica fits well with other Asperspina species and comes closest to the Mediterranean Asperspina rhopalotecta . The monotypic genus/family Minicheviella /Minicheviellidae Starobogatov (1983 ) is confirmed as a junior synonym of Asperspina /Asperspinidae Rankin (1979 ).",

Some aspects of spiralian development. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 20–28 Spiralian development is not only a characteristic early cleavage pattern, with shifting orientations of the cleavage planes, but also highly conserved cell lineages, where the origin of several organs can be traced back to identifiable cells in the lineage. These patterns are well documented in annelids, molluscs, nemertines, and platyhelminths and are considered ancestral of a bilaterian clade including these phyla. Spiral cleavage has not been documented in ecdysozoans, and no trace of the spiral development pattern is seen in phoronids and brachiopods. Origin of the spatial organization in spiralian embryos is puzzling, but much of the information appears to be encoded in the developing oocyte. Fertilization and “pseudofertilization” apparently provides the information defining the secondary, anterior‐posterior body axis in many species. The central nervous system consists of three components: an apical organ, derived from the apical blastomeres 1a 111 ‐1d 111 , which degenerates before or at metamorphosis; the cerebral ganglia derived from other blastomeres of the first micromere quartet and retained in the adult as a preoral part of the brain; and the originally circumblastoporal nerve cord, which has become differentiated into a perioral part of the brain, the paired or secondarily fused ventral nerve cords, and a small perianal nerve ring.",

The ecdysis peak for male crabs was at the time of collection while that for female crabs was 2 months later. The epibionts were: the polychaetes Pomatoceros triqueter and Hydroides norvegica , the cirriped Balanus crenatus , the entoproct Barentsia matsushimana , the hydroids Leuckartiara sp. and Clytia sp., and the ciliate protozoans Ephelota plana , Ephelota gemmipara , Chilodochona quennerstedti and Cothurnia longipes . The polychaetes, cirripeds, entoprocts and hydroids, all of them with comparatively larger size, were distributed on the carapace, ventral surface of the cephalothorax and the pereiopods; meanwhile the protozoans, with smaller size, were attached also on pleopods, antennae, eyes and buccal appendages. Chilodochona quennerstedti was the epibiont most abundant on the crab, followed by Ephelota plana . Cothurnia longipes was, in contrast, the least abundant epibiont, followed by Barentsia matsushimana . The anatomical unit most colonized was the left third maxilliped, followed by the left first maxilliped and the ventral surface. The less colonized anatomical units were the left antenna and the ocular orbits. Epibionts on this crab have not been described before. Statistical analyses of the epibiont distribution on the crab were carried out. There were significant correlations between right and left appendages in 66.67% of the cases. Males and females differed significantly with respect to the distribution of epibionts on their anatomical units. The comparison analysis indicated a significant differential distribution of each epibiont species on the anatomical units of the crab. Principal component analysis grouped the epibiont species according to their colonization pattern in three clusters: (1) Ephelota plana , Ephelota gemmipara and Chilodochona quennerstedti ; (2) Leuckartiara sp., Clytia sp., Barentsia matsushimana and Cothurnia longipes ; and (3) Pomatoceros triqueter , Balanus crenatus and Hydroides norvegica . The hierarchical cluster analysis grouped the anatomical units of the crab in relation to their colonization in five clusters.",

A total of 71 ovigerous females were obtained, 28% of which were simultaneously incubating eggs at different developmental stages. This phenomenon can be the result of incomplete fertilization, or may represent a rapid gonadal cycle by this species in this area, which is, to our understanding, the best explanation of this phenomenon. Egg volume decreased 25.6% during the incubation period. The reproductive output based on dry and wet weight was 6.8 and 19.3%, respectively. Water was the prevailing component of the eggs, representing 86.0% of the total weight at initial stage, increasing to 95.1% at the final stage. Ash content increased at the same time as a decrease in the organic content occurred, indicating the consumption of yolk and absorption of salts from the water medium. In conclusion, we hypothesized that this population has the capacity to copulate and deposit another brood even before the release of the larvae from the previous one, intensifying the reproductive effort of these hermit crabs as a strategy of adaptation in a region considered the northern limit of the geographical distribution of this species.",

Using scanning electron microscopy, the morphology of the MTG of Dolycoris baccarum (Linnaeus 1758) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) was studied. The MTG belong to the diastomian type. The two glandular pores located between the mesothoracic and metathoracic coxae are associated with ‘mushroom‐like’ structures. The MTG are composed of a reservoir and a pair of lateral glands is connected to the reservoir by a duct. A groove‐like structure extends downwards from the ostiole. While this structure is long and wide, its ostiole is oval. Extracts of the volatile fractions from male and female MTG secretions were analysed by capillary gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) and exhibited a typical pentatomid composition. Seventeen chemical compounds were detected in female secretions, whereas 13 chemical compounds were detected in the male secretions. Most chemical compounds were similar between the sexes but were different in their quantities. In this regard, the compounds identified were investigated and the biological functions of the glandular secretions were discussed. In the analyses of the MTG of females of D. baccarum , tridecane (50.97%) was a major odour component and (Z,Z)‐4,16‐octadecadien‐1‐ol acetate (0.02%) was a minor odour component. In males, tridecane (50.80%) was a major odour component and 1,2‐benzenedicarboxylic acid (0.02%) was a minor odour component.",

First record of the brachiopod Lingulella waptaensis with pedicle from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 150–162 The organophosphatic shells of linguloid brachiopods are a common component of normal Cambrian–Ordovician shelly assemblages. Preservation of linguloid soft‐part anatomy, however, is extremely rare, and restricted to a few species in Lower Cambrian Konservat Lagerstätten . Such remarkable occurrences provide unique insights into the biology and ecology of early linguloids that are not available from the study of shells alone. Based on its shells, Lingulella waptaensis Walcott, was originally described in 1924 from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale but despite the widespread occurrence of soft‐part preservation associated with fossils from the same levels, no preserved soft parts have been reported. Lingulella waptaensis is restudied herein based on 396 specimens collected by Royal Ontario Museum field parties from the Greater Phyllopod Bed (Walcott Quarry Shale Member, British Columbia). The new specimens, including three with exceptional preservation of the pedicle, were collected in situ in discrete obrution beds. Census counts show that L. waptaensis is rare but recurrent in the Greater Phyllopod Bed, suggesting that this species might have been generalist. The wrinkled pedicle protruded posteriorly between the valves, was composed of a central coelomic space, and was slender and flexible enough to be tightly folded, suggesting a thin chitinous cuticle and underlying muscular layers. The nearly circular shell and the long, slender and highly flexible pedicle suggest that L. waptaensis lived epifaunally, probably attached to the substrate. Vertical cross‐sections of the shells show that L. waptaensis possessed a virgose secondary layer, which has previously only been known from Devonian to Recent members of the Family Lingulidae.",

It presents anatomical details of their eyes and provides an appraisal of the eyes’ optical system. In both species the retinae contain two principal types of cell: photoreceptive and pigmented supportive cells. While only the eye of A. rufus apparently contains neurosecretory neurones, that of D. agreste is the only one equipped with a small additional retina with its own separate lens. Lens shapes vary between ovoid ( A. rufus ) and spherical ( D. agreste ). Our results demonstrate that the camera‐type eyes in A. rufus and D. agreste have optical systems that do not allow the production of a sharp image on the retina. The slugs demonstrate negative visually mediated phototactic behaviour, but no polarization sensitivity. Only one aspect of the visual environment, namely the overall distribution of light and dark, seems to be important for these slugs. As the main role of the slugs’ photoreceptors is to monitor environmental brightness and to assist the animal in orientating towards dark places, we conclude that these slugs do not need to perceive sharp images.",

Whether these hagfish characters are general for all craniates, autapomorphies of hagfishes, or merely a derived state of the general cyclostome condition is still a matter of debate that relates to the question of the monophyly or paraphyly of the cyclostomes. The present cladistic study includes 123 neuroanatomical characters of nine chordate species and supports cyclostome paraphyly, in contrast to most current molecular sequence‐based phylogenies, which support cyclostome monophyly. An understanding of the unique neural characters in hagfishes is critical to inspiring further comparative and developmental studies with regards to these two conflicting results and the very deep divergence between craniates and their presumed sister groups. The recent access to hagfish developmental data may provide exciting perspectives in the understanding and characterization of the basalmost craniate node and the interpretation of hagfish brain structure.",

Head structures of adults of Tipula paludosa, Limonia sp. and Trichocera saltator were examined and described. The results are compared with conditions found in other dipterans and other antliophoran groups, notably Nannochoristidae. Several potential synapomorphies of a dipteran–nannomecopteran–siphonapteran clade are present in Tipuloidea and Trichocera, the labro-epipharyngeal food channel, the loss of the galea and the postpharyngeal pumping apparatus. The sensorial field of the maxillary palpomere 3, a potential dipteran–nannomecopteran synapomorphy, is also present but modified. The presence of M. clypeolabralis, labellae and mandibular stylets are groundplan apomorphies of Diptera, with secondary loss of the mandibles in Tipuloidea, Trichoceridae and many other groups. Tipuloidea is supported by the origin of M. tentorioscapalis anterior on the head capsule, the reduction of M. frontobuccalis anterior and the loss of the ocelli. The reduced tentorium, the origin of two further antennal muscles on the head capsule, the maxillary sensorial field with sensilla in individual pits, the lacking dorsal prelabial concavity and the unpaired salivary channel entering the head are apomorphies of Tipulidae. Closer affinities of Tipulidae and Cylindrotomidae are suggested by pseudotracheae of the advanced type, which have evolved independently in this lineage. The results do neither support a basal placement of Tipuloidea nor close affinities with Brachycera.",

Its wall consists of ependymal, fiber and palisade zones and is surrounded by blood vessels. The lobe is differentiated into distinct dorsal and ventral regions. The dorsal wall is doubly innervated by Gomori-positive axons arising in the anterior hypothalamus and by Gomori-negative fibers of unknown origin. Its surface is covered by an extensive vascular plexus. The ventral wall is innervated only by Gomori-negative fibers and is sparsely supplied with a few fine capillaries. All of the ependymal cells in both regions have the same ultrastructural appearance. The Gomori-positive or Type I axons are identified at the electron microscope level as fibers containing elementary granules with a diameter of 150–230 run. The Gomori-negative or Type II fibers contain dense-cored vesicles that vary from 80–125 nm in diameter. Both Type I and II fibers form synaptic-like complexes with the processes and end-feet of the ependymal cells. Type I axons also abut on the basal lamina bounding the perivascular spaces. It is suggested that the agranular reticulum of the ependymal cells may provide a transport pathway for neural products that are destined for release into the circulation. It is also possible that the ependyma itself is a target of neural activity.",

Among the eight currently recognized genera and 40 species belonging to the brachyuran crab family Grapsidae (Thoracotremata), the complete larval development is only known for three species of Metopograpsus. In this study, we investigated the larval development of Geograpsus lividus originating from Jamaica and reared under controlled conditions in the laboratory. It consists of eight zoeal stages and the megalopa, representing the longest recorded developmental pathway for any brachyuran. Although long developments had been suggested for some species, based on specimens collected from the plankton, these were never confirmed by laboratory culture. In this study, zoeal growth (measured as increase in body size, dry mass, and contents of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen) is quantified, and morphological and meristic characters of the larval stages of G. lividus are described and illustrated. The development from hatching to the end of the zoeal phase took 2 months. During this time span, larval size (cephalothorax length) increased 4.4-fold, while the various measures of biomass increased by factors of 57–72. Morphologically, the larvae present most characters previously established for the family Grapsidae. However, the two last zoeal stages show new features that differ from the typical setation pattern known from grapsid species with only five zoeal stages. These were found in the number of natatory setae on the exopods of the maxillipeds and in the setation of the basis of the first maxilliped. Other characters, which had previously only been described for zoeae of Pachygrapsus and plankton-collected ones attributed to Planes, were observed also in G. lividus and could be confirmed as common features for the Grapsidae. Moreover, the larvae of G. lividus present a spinulation on the lateral and rostral spines of the cephalothorax. This character is recorded for the first time in grapsid crabs. A comparison of these observations is made with those based on terminal zoeal stages of species belonging to other brachyuran families, where similar characters have been documented.",

Degeneration of primordial germ cells was never observed and was extremely rare in oogonia and early oocytes in a cyst phase in juveniles. Previtellogenic oocytes were rarely affected. Three main types of atresia were identified. In type I (subdivided into stages A–D), vitellogenic oocytes are digested by proliferating follicle cells that hypertrophy and become phagocytic. A – germinal vesicle shrinks, nucleoli fuse, oocyte envelope interrupts, and follicular cells hypertrophy; B – follicular cells multiply and invade the oocyte; C – entire vesicle is filled by phagocytic cells; D – degenerating phagocytes accumulate black pigment. Type II is rare and resembles breakdown of follicles and release of ooplasm. In type III, observed in previtellogenic and early vitellogenic oocytes, ooplasm and germinal vesicle shrink, follicle cells do not invade the vesicle, and condensed ooplasm becomes fragmented. The residual oogonia in adult ovaries (germ patches) multiply, but soon degenerate.",

Autoradiographic observations on developing and growing claws of reptiles. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 233–241 The present qualitative autoradiographic analysis aims to present the main features of morphogenesis and growth of claws in reptiles. Lizard embryos treated with tritiated thymidine reveal that epidermal cell proliferation in terminal digits is prevalent in the dorsal side and gives origin to the curved unguis of the claw. Less proliferation occurs in the ventral side of the digit tip where the concave sub‐unguis is derived. Adult claws of a turtle show that thymidine‐labelled cells are present along most of the epidermis of the claw, especially at the claw tip. Also, injection of tritiated histidine and proline, indicating active protein synthesis, confirm autoradiographic labelling along most of the epidermis of claws, in particular at the apical tip. The present study indicates that proximal matrix regions, as have been described in mammalian nails, are absent in reptiles. This pattern of claw growth probably derives from that of terminal digital scales. In fact reptilian (and avian) claws are formed from a modification of scales, a different condition from that present in mammals.",

Histological study of the spermatheca in three thelytokous parthenogenetic ant species, Pristomyrmex punctatus , Pyramica membranifera and Monomorium triviale (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00 :1–8. The evolution of obligate parthenogenesis may induce the degeneration of female mating ability and subsequently affect the morphology of the female reproductive organs related to mating and/or sperm storage. Here, we investigated the size and structure of the sperm storage organ, the spermatheca, in three thelytokous parthenogenetic myrmicine ant species, Pristomyrmex punctatus , Pyramica membranifera and Monomorium triviale , and compared it with that of their related sexually reproducing species. So far, mated individuals have never been found in these three species, which appears to be in line with their parthenogenetic status. Although the spermatheca appears to be useless in these species, we could not find any evidence on the degeneration in size and morphology of their spermathecae. The spermathecal reservoir still has the columnar hilar epithelium, which is one of the major features for a functional spermatheca in ants.",

The southern pine beetle (SPB) (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann) is the most economically important pest of southern pine forests. Beetles carry fungal cells within specialised cuticular structures, called mycangia. Little is known about the mycangia ultrastructure or function. We used cryo-fracturing and scanning electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructural features of SPB mycangia and surrounding tissues. Mycangia, one on each side of anterior portion of the prothorax, are terminated on the dorsal side at a 'mycangial bridge'. This sclerotised mycangial bridge does not appear to provide a passage between the two mycangia, suggesting that each mycangium functions independently. Mycangia are surrounded by abundant tracheoles connecting the structures to the outside via openings within the prothorax. Previously unknown pits overlying the mycangial gland cells were also observed in both the inner wall and anterior fold of prothorax. We hypothesise that these openings and pits may play roles in determining which fungi enter, and grow within, the mycangium.",

    "abstract": "Résumé Les résultats de l'analyse du développement embryonnaire du télencéphale de Polypterus senegalus, ainsi que d'une courte description du télencéphale de l'adulte ont été comparés aux données présentes dans la littérature scientifique, concernant le développement et la structure du télencéphale des Chondrostéens (Ch), des Holostéens (H) et des Téléostéens (T). Par l'organogenèse et la morphologie de son télencéphale, Polypterus présente de nombreux points de ressemblance avec les trois groupes ci-dessus cités. Dans la liste des résultats qui vont être donnés, nous avons adopté le principe suivant: si le processus de développement ou la structure dont il est fait mention concerne non seulement Polypterus, mais aussi les autres groupes de Poissons osseux, les initiales de ces groupes (Ch, H, T) seront ajoutées entre parenthèses. 1 Comme chez tous les Gnathostomes, la morphogenèse du télencéphale du Polyptère commence par une inversion légère de ses parois latérales. 2 Par la suite, cette inversion, disparaît. Les parois de l'ébauche télencéphalique commencent à faire saillie dans la cavité ventriculaire et, corrélativement, les taeniae (c'est-à-dire les deux lignes le long desquelles se rattache le toit télencéphalique originellement étroit) se déplacent latéralement (H, T). 3 Ultérieurement, les taeniae se déplacent en direction ventrale, et l'apparition de sillons externes bilatéraux (sulcus externus) indique les débuts du processus d'éversion (Ch, H, T). 4 Chez les Chondrostéens, les Holostéens et les Téléostéens, c'est l'épaississement des parois télencéphalique qui domine pendant réversion; chez Polypterus au contraire, ces parois croissent bien plus suivant leur dimension dorsoventrale qu'en épaisseur. 5 Les bulbes olfactifs apparaissent au début sous forme d'épaississements des parois télencéphaliques. Plus tard, ils prennent la forme d'évaginations séparées, possédant en propre leur cavités ventriculaires (Ch, H). 6 Outre réversion et l'évagination réelle bulbaire, une pseudoévagination (Kàllén) se produit dans le télencéphale de Polypterus. Ce processus conduit à la formation d'un septum épendymaire étendu (Ch, H). 7 Tôt au cours du développement, deux régions, qui sont respectivement l'area dorsalis telencephali ou pallium et l'area ventralis telencephali ou subpallium, peuvent être distinguées d'après des différences cytologiques (Ch, H, T). 8 La zone périventriculaire de l'area ventralis telencephali se différencie en un nucleus subpallialis dorsalis et un nucleus subpallialis ventralis (Ch, H, T). D'autres cellules de l'area ventralis migrent vers une position subméningée et forment un noyau subpallialis lateralis (H, T). 9 Une colonne de cellules migrantes dirigée rostroventralement, et provenant de la portion la plus dorsocaudale du manteau subpallié, aboutit à la formation du complexe des noyau entopédonculaires (Ch, H, T). 10 Dans l'area dorsalis telencephali du Polyptère, la couche du manteau embryonnaire persiste chez l'adulte sous forme d'une zone étroite de substance grise périventriculaire. Cette zone ne montre ni aux stades larvaires, ni chez l'adulte, de signe de différenciation en territoires distincts. 11 L'area dorsalis telencephali ou pallium du Polyptère montre un stade d'organisation bien plus simple que celui des Chondrostéens, des Holostéens et des Téléostéens. 12 Une couche cellulaire externe étendue se forme dans la partie rostrale évaginée du télencéphale du Polyptère. Comme chez Acipenser, cette couche est en continuité avec la zone glomérulaire et appartient intégralement à la formation bulbaire. Abstract In this paper an analysis of the development of the forebrain of Polypterus senegalus, and a short description of the adult telencephalon of that species has been presented. The results of this study have been compared with data obtained from the literature on the development and structure of the forebrain of the Chondrostei (Ch), Holostei (H), and Teleostei (T). It appeared that, with regard to the embryology and morphology of its forebrain, Polypterus shows many points of resemblance to the three groups mentioned. In the subsequent survey of results these similarities have been indicated as follows: if the process or feature mentioned occurs not only in Polypterus, but also in the other bony fish groups, the initials of these groups (Ch, H, T) are added in brackets. 1 As in all Gnathostomes the morphogenesis of the forebrain of Polypterus commences with a slight inversion of its lateral walls. 2 During further development this inversion disappears. The walls of the telencephalic anlage begin to protrude into the ventricular cavity, and concomitantly the taeniae (i.e. the lines of attachment of the initially narrow telencephalic roof plate) move laterally (H, T). 3 Later the taeniae are displaced ventrally, and the appearance of bilateral external grooves (sulci externi) marks the beginning of an eversion (Ch, H, T). 4 In the Chondrostei, Holostei and Teleostei the thickening of the telencephalic walls continues during the eversion, but in Polypterus these walls increase much more in dorsoventral length than in thickness. 5 The bulbi olfactorii develop initially as thickenings of the telencephalic walls. In later stages they assume the configuration of separate evaginations, with ventricular cavities of their own (Ch, H). 6 Apart from eversion and true evagination, an extensive pseudoevagination (Källén) occurs in the forebrain of Polypterus. This process leads to the formation of an extensive ependymal septum (Ch, H). 7 Early in development two regions, i.e., the area dorsalis telencephali or pallium and the area ventralis telencephali or subpallium can be delimited on account of cytological differences (Ch, H, T). 8 The periventricular zone of the area ventralis telencephali differentiates into a nucleus subpallialis dorsalis and a nucleus subpallialis ventralis (Ch, H, T). Other cells within the area ventralis migrate to a submeningeal position and form a nucleus subpallialis lateralis (H, T). 9 A rostroventrally directed migration of cells, originating from the most dorsocaudal part of the subpallial mantle layer, leads to the formation of a complex of entopeduncular nuclei (Ch, H, T). 10 In the area dorsalis telencephali of Polypterus the embryonic mantle layer persists as a narrow zone of periventricular gray. Neither in the larvae nor in the adult does this zone show signs of a differentiation into separate fields. 11 The area dorsalis telencephali or pallium of Polypterus is much more simply organized than that of the Chondrostei, Holostei and Teleostei. 12 In the rostral, evaginated part of the forebrain of Polypterus an extensive external cell layer is formed. As in Acipenser this layer is coextensive with the glomerular zone and belongs entirely to the bulbar formation.",

The phylogenetic distribution and morphological variation of the ‘pouch’ in female snakes. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 400–408. The urodaeum of female snakes is a chamber that receives the oviducts, urinary ducts, and intestine. Previous studies have indicated that a derived region of unknown function persists between the urodaeum and oviducts in some snakes of the Colubroides. This structure was recently termed the ‘pouch’; however, it is also commonly referred to as the vaginal pouch. A broad sampling of female snakes revealed that the pouch evolved once on the branch leading to Colubroides. The presence of the pouch in Colubroides is not unambiguous, as this feature was lost in some members of the Atractaspididae and Lamprophiidae. Variation was also observed in pouch morphology between taxa of the Colubroides. Variation included the following: (1) whether the pouch was bifurcated and if so, were the arms of the pouch separated caudally, (2) whether separated pouch arms were split by a caudal bifurcation of the urodaeum or through medial septa of the pouch arms, and (3) the absence or presence of oviducal papillae invading the cranial/lateral extremity of the pouch. The variation in pouch morphology observed does not appear to be correlated with the evolutionary history of Colubroides and polymorphism within families is common.",

Experiment I was designed to record underwater sounds and their characteristics.

Each treatment combines larvae of C . cranwelli (predator) with those of R hinella arenarum (prey). The number of live and dead individuals was recorded during 72 h, and the following variables were calculated: time to eat the first and second prey, time without eating, time to eat a congener, and number of events of cannibalism. The results indicate that relative predator–prey availability affects the frequency of predation between conspecifics.

Nous confirmons la validité de cette coloration chez la Tanche, le Poisson-Chat et la Carpe soumise au jeûne, en fonction des réactions de l'interrénal. Divers auteurs ont étendu cette conclusion à d'autres espèces de Téléostéens, un Cyclostome et deux Amphibiens. La réaction est négative chez les Oiseaux; chez les Mammifères, la spécificité de cette technique n'a pas encore été vérifée. Chez quelques Téléostéens, Oiseaux et Mammifères, l'H.Pb semble également utile pour la mise en évidence des cellules sécrétant l'inter-médine. Ces résultats conduisent Solcia et al. (1969) et Nouet et al. (1969) à proposer la technique de l'H.Pb pour la mise en évidence des cellules de la série APUD (Pearse 1969). Les données très fragmentaires obtenues jusqu'ici dans la série des Vertébrés doivent inciter à n'utiliser cette coloration signalétique qu'avec prudence. En effet, chez certaines espèces, les cellules LH-ICSH se colorent intensément, et chez l'Anguille, les cellules à prolactine en état d'hypoactivité se chargent de fines granulations bleu noir. Il est donc indispensable de vérifier les fonctions corticotrope et mélanophorotrope des cellules éventuellement colorables par l'H.Pb par d'autres critères, topographiques chez les Téléostéens, morphologiques, tinctoriaux, mais surtout par une analyse expérimentale. Abstract In 1964, the lead-haematoxylin technique (H.Pb) of MacConaill was introduced for the staining of the corticotrophic cells in various teleost species. Since then, the validity of this staining was corroborated in other teleost fishes (tench, catfish, carp after a longterm starvation), and probably also for a cyclostome and two amphibian species; however, this staining gives negative results in various birds and its specificity has not yet been confirmed in mammals. In some teleosts, birds and mammals, this technique is useful to demonstrate the melanocyte-stimulating hormone secreting cells. According to these results, Solcia et al. (1969) and Nouet et al. (1969) suggest that this staining technique is generally suitable to identify the APUD cells (Pearse 1969). However, H.Pb is mostly a mere histological stain, although it demonstrates the carboxyl groups of proteins (Solcia et al.). Data collected in various vertebrates indicate that great caution is necessary when one wants to give a functional significance to this staining reaction. In some species (dog, Pyromelana) the LH-ICSH cells are deeply stained with H.Pb. In the eel, an accumulation of fine blue black granules occurs when prolactin cells are hypoactive, as in sea water. It appears necessary to verify the function, either corticotrophic or melanophoric, of the H.Pb + cells of the pars distalis with other criteria: topography in teleosts, morphology, tinctorial reactions, but mainly with an experimental analysis, since two other cell types may eventually turn out to react with H.Pb.",

Adult caecilian amphibians eyes are small, covered by skin and sometimes bone, with retinal cells that contain only rod opsins and co‐option of structures usually associated with the visual system used for novel sensory structures and functions. Here, we provide a description of the eye of Rhinatrema bivittatum , the first of any rhinatrematid caecilian, and consider its significance for our understanding of the nature of the eye in the last common ancestor of living caecilians. Characters discovered include zonule fibres, an aqueous humour and the remnants of an attachment that could be a protractor lentis muscle.",

We performed quantitative analyses of all the muscle masses and cross‐sectional areas ( CSA ) of the wings and hindlimbs of five species from two families, C athartidae ( N ew W orld vultures; C athartes aura and V ultur gryphus ) and A ccipitridae ( O ld W orld vultures and raptors; G yps africanus , A quila rapax , and B uteo lineatus ). These species comprise two paraphyletic functional groups, raptors ( A quila and B uteo ) and vultures ( G yps, C athartes, and V ultur ). Our ordination analyses based on all of the muscles of the wings, hindlimbs, and wing and hindlimb muscles combined produced patterns that appeared to be more related to phylogeny, with a hint of a functional signal in wing muscle CSA . However, when wing muscles were grouped according to their functional roles (upstroke, downstroke, and wing stabilization), the percentages of mass and CSA allocated to the upstroke and stabilizing muscles were 1.4–5% greater in the vultures than in the raptors. Conversely, when hindlimb muscles were grouped according to their roles in grasping and terrestrial locomotion, the percentages of mass and CSA allocated to grasping muscles were 5.9–14% greater in the raptors. Our results provide a baseline for future lines of inquiry aimed at understanding how muscle mass and CSA are affected differentially across locomotor modules, possibly in response to differential demands on wing and hindlimb function experienced by these disparate accipitriform clades.",

We found that the more terrestrial species were characterized by larger dorsal and abdominal muscle weight ratios compared with those of the more aquatic species, whereas muscle ratios of the lateral hypaxial musculature were larger in the more aquatic species. The lateral hypaxial muscles were thicker in the more aquatic species, whereas the M. rectus abdominis was more differentiated in the more terrestrial species. Our results suggest that larger lateral hypaxial muscles function for lateral bending during underwater locomotion in aquatic species. Larger dorsalis and abdominal muscles facilitate resistance against sagittal extension of the trunk, stabilization and support of the ventral contour line against gravity in terrestrial species. The more aquatic species possessed a more horizontal prezygapophyseal angle for more flexible lateral locomotion. In contrast, the more terrestrial species have an increasingly vertical prezygapophyseal angle to provide stronger column support against gravity. Thus, we conclude trunk structure in urodeles differs clearly according to their locomotive modes.",

Scientists are capable of reconstructing organ systems and entire architectural physiologies with utmost precision. The pallial eyes of Pectinidae are amongst the most complex visual systems found in molluscs and have aroused scientific curiosity for decades. This investigation presents the most comprehensive description of pallial eye morphology in four major groups of Pectinidae: Aequipectini group, Pectininae, Chlamydinae and Palliolinae. The cornea, lens, retinae and branching of the optic nerve are depicted in topographic detail. Three‐dimensional reconstructions of microtome sections enable the comparison of whole eyes and structures in contrast to single‐section analysis. Here, we demonstrate two significant findings: (i) the morphology of corneae and lenses varies in scallop species and (ii) the retinae are innervated in different ways in different species. Moreover, we show how morphological characteristics such as the hyperbolic shape of the lens can be overlooked if only single sections are investigated.",

In total, 881 museum specimens were examined. These revealed two primary types of anomalies, hyperdontia (extra teeth) and anodontia (loss of teeth), occurring at a rate of 2.4% ( n = 21). Two‐toed sloths, Choloepus , were more likely to have hyperdontia in the anterior dentition, whereas three‐toed sloths, Bradypus , experienced anodontia more frequently with the upper caniniforms. Both genera experienced both anomalies. The majority affected the upper dentition, with only three specimens exhibiting mandibular anomalies. Beyond the patterns of tooth positioning, all anomalies were random with respect to age, sex and geography. A few specimens not counted in the initial assessment expressed incomplete anodontia, indicating that the loss occurred postnatally and was not an embryological anomaly. For Bradypus , the findings provide new support for the hypothesis that the taxon represents a neotenic lineage and opens new possibilities about its relationship to the extinct ground sloths with a suggested rooting above that of the basal position it typically occupies for Folivora.",

Our observations of the tongue reveal a rare terminal reduction of the size of the tongue and microstructures of the lingual mucosa among the investigations of birds published so far. The short, triangular tongue with a pointed tip is approximately 2.5 cm long in the adult and is situated in the caudal part of the oral cavity close to the laryngeal prominence. On the dorsal surface of the tongue, no typical mucosa microstructures like lingual papillae, median groove or lingual prominence are observed. The main structure of the tongue is composed of rostral part of hyoid apparatus, that is, entoglossal cartilage connects with basihyoid. Very thin mucosa is composed of fibrous connective tissue covered with orthokeratinized epithelium. No lingual glands and muscles are observed in the lamina propria of mucosa. Even though the triangular shape of the tongue in the white stork is typical for birds, the inner structure of the reduced organ is composed only of flat cartilagineous entoglossum of hyoid apparatus. During feeding behaviour of the white stork, the food transportation in oral cavity called cranio‐inertial transport is undoubtedly affected by structural reduction of the tongue.",

To investigate the morphology of the antennal, maxillary palp and labial palp sensilla in the five larval instars of the ALB , scanning electron microscopy was used to determine the typology, morphology, number and distribution of the sensilla. The antennae had two types of sensilla: the sensilla twig basiconica (s.t.b.) and sensilla basiconica. Three different types of sensilla were observed on the maxillary palps, which were the sensilla digitiformia, the sensilla chaetica and the s.t.b. The labial palps had two types of sensilla: the sensilla chaetica and the s.t.b. The s.t.b. had seven total subtypes, and the sensilla basiconica had two subtypes. The typology, quantity and distribution of sensilla on the antennae, maxillary palps and labial palps remained constant in the five larval instars, but the dimensions of all sensilla types increased throughout the development. We discussed the mechanoreception and the chemoreception of ALB larvae inside the host tree to provide a theoretical understanding and information for further research on the behaviour and the electrophysiology of this devastating forest pest.",

Germ cells are similar to those of other anuran species, but some characteristics were more marked for R. schneideri , such as the morphological similarity of spermatogonia and oogonia, which may be related to their potential for development into both stem cell types. The presence of lampbrush chromosomes, the extensive variation in number and organisation of the nucleoli and the organisation of the nuclear cortex are also characteristic of this species. All of these features appear to work together, participating in the dynamic growth of the oocyte. In some specimens, previtellogenic oocytes were also observed in the seminiferous tubules, which may be related to anthropogenic changes induced in the study area. In the first study period, reproductive dynamics revealed synchrony between the sexes, with the preparation of the gonads from October to December and the reproductive season from October to January, coinciding with the rainy season. In the second period, reproductive synchrony was also observed, but gonad preparation occurred from February to June and the reproductive season was from August to November, before the rainy season. These changes in the reproductive cycle suggest that urbanisation affects the reproduction of this species.",

Given their remarkable position in phylogeny as basal chelicerates or even basal euarthropods, the structure of their sense organs can reveal important characters, which—in a comparative framework—provide arguments to phylogenetic discussions and help to develop scenarios of evolutionary transformations. This review summarizes current knowledge and presents new original data on the sense organs in pycnogonids, that is, the eyes, the lateral sense organs and the ciliary or sensillar sense organs. Except for the eyes, there are not many detailed studies available. The ultrastructure of the R‐cells of the four eyes located on the ocular tubercle is described as “pseudoinverted”. The eyes are innervated to two visual neuropils located in the protocerebrum. The features of the lateral sense organ, also located on the ocular tubercle, are hitherto not conclusively resolved, a chemo‐ or thermoreceptive function is suggested. Finally, an overview of the various ciliary or sensillar sense organs distributed all over the body is given and the fine structure of branched setae is shown for the first time. The morphology of the sense organs of pycnogonids is compared with that of other arthropod taxa and assessed against the background of current theories of arthropod evolution.",

Middle intestine is winding and positioned to the right of caudal portion of stomach. Caudal intestine is linear and with a median position up to the anus. Intestinal coefficient was 1.39 ± 0.30 cm. Epithelium is simple prismatic with brush border and contains epithelial and goblet cells. Caudal region has highest concentration of goblet cells. Were detected neutral glycoproteins, carboxylated and sulphated acid glycoconjugates for mucous cells and goblet cells, and neutral glycoproteins for the apical region of gastric epithelial cells. Morphological features could be related to piscivorous species feeding habit.",

We present an embryonic table for the oviparous African Sand Snake Psammophis sibilans from the Lamprophidae family, describing its postovipositional in ovo development. Psammophis is a good model of a genus that is widely distributed in Africa and Asia and includes 22 species. We describe ten embryonic stages based on the development of externally visible morphological characteristics such as; pharyngeal arches, facial processes, eyes, scales, body pigmentation and body colour pattern development. This study discusses the development of this snake and compares it with that of the closely related brown house snake Lamprophis fulliginosus (Lamprophidae) and the medically important venomous cobras Naja haje haje and Naja kaouthia from the sister lineage Elapidae. The distantly related basal snake Python sebae, which displays different morphology and behaviour, was chosen for deeper insight into the evolution of body structures within the snake clade. We found interspecific differences in the relative stage of development of embryonic structures at the time of oviposition and during postovipositional embryonic development. One of the outcomes of this study is that embryonic structures such as the pharyngeal processes, eye pigmentation and scales are interspecifically conservative in regard to timing of morphodifferentiation, while body pigmentation, colour and colour pattern are interspecifically plastic in their temporospatial development.",

Here we use the killifish Aphaniops stoliczkanus (Day, 1872; Aphaniidae: Cyprinodontiformes), which is a widespread but poorly known freshwater species in the Middle East, to investigate variability in morphological traits within and between its populations. As otolith morphology is known to evolve on ecological timescales and can signal the presence of cryptic lineages, a special focus lies on otolith variability. Based on samples from six populations in northern Oman, we found that variation in pigmentation, disparities in body shape and otolith variability can be associated with distinctive environmental conditions. The unique otolith shape of A. stoliczkanus from a hot sulphuric spring (Nakhal) suggests that a cryptic lineage may have emerged there. Our new data can serve as a benchmark for future studies on the diversity of Aphaniops and other Aphaniidae and help to clarify whether cryptic diversity is present in some lineages. Moreover, our data can serve as an actualistic model for studies on fossil fishes, in which morphological characters provide the only accessible data source for taxonomic and phylogenetic interpretations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Determination of sex on the base of external morphological features is very difficult in most birds. However, molecular sex identification methods can be used for sexing of these so‐called monomorphic bird species. This study analysed the sexual dimorphism of radiographic morphometric features in rock pigeons whose sexes were determined by the molecular sex identification method. Body weights and 21 radiographic measurements of 43 rock pigeons (18 males and 25 females) were taken. Among cranium measurements, the skull width value was statistically significant in terms of gender ( p &lt; .01). Length of carpometacarpus ( p &lt; .001) was the most statistically significant measurement of the thoracic limb skeleton, and length of tarsometatarsus ( p &lt; .01) was the most statistically significant measurement in the pelvic limb. The body weight showed a positive correlation with all measurements. It was observed that 81.4% of the samples were classified correctly with the measurements used in the discriminant analysis. With this study's results, it can be concluded that sex determination in rock pigeons can also be made by radiographic morphometric methods. In addition, more measurements can be obtained with radiographic images compared to external morphometry.",

In this paper we report the results of ultrastructural studies on the ovarioles of Adelges laricis , a representative of the primitive aphid family, Adelgidae. The ovaries of the studied species are composed of five telotrophic‐meroistic ovarioles that are subdivided into a terminal filament, tropharium (= trophic chamber) and vitellarium. The tropharium houses trophocytes (= nurse cells) and arrested oocytes. The vitellarium consists of one or two ovarian follicles. The total number of germ cells (trophocytes + oocytes) in the ovarioles analysed varies from 50 to 92 and is substantially higher than in previously studied aphids. The centre of the tropharium is occupied by a cell‐free region, termed a trophic core, which is connected both with trophocytes and oocytes. Trophocytes are connected to the core by means of cytoplasmic strands, whereas oocytes by nutritive cords. Both trophic core and nutritive cords are filled with parallel arranged microtubules. In the light of obtained results the anagenesis of hemipteran ovaries is discussed.",

The escal photophore consists of the light gland proper and certain accessory structures. An accessory structure common to all species is a lightproof cup enclosing the light gland and provided with a distal opening, while the escae in a number of ceratioids in addition posses reflecting structures, tubular modifications of which form light guides in some species. The light gland proper is a roughly oval or spherical body, typically consisting of radiating branched glandular tubules arranged around a central escal cavity which communicates with the exterior via the vestibule, a usually slit‐like epithelium‐lined space lying above the distal part of the light gland. All lumina within the light gland contain bioluminescent symbiotic bacteria. The esca is generally thought to function as a lure, prey being attracted by the light emitted from the photophore and movements of the illicium. A possible additional function may be the ejection of a luminous material to confuse predators.",

Among these are specialized junctions that occur between the cells' apical processes and adjacent ciliary band cells near the base of each cilium.

We interpret our observations on these cells in terms of Garstang's hypothesis, which derives the chordate neural tube from a larval ciliary band, and suggest that multipolar cells like those in echinoderm and tornaria bands may be the antecedents of some categories of neurons in the chordate spinal cord.",

Three morphologically different 5‐HT immunoreactive cell types were distinguished: (I) Neuroepithelial cells (NECs), which were abundant along the distal half of the efferent filamental arteries (EFAs), and particularly formed distinct clusters at the individual filamental tips, (II) bipolar neurones running next to the EFAs and (III) multipolar neurones innervating the proximal parts of the EFA. In addition, the study revealed a well‐developed system of nerve fibres, some of which form plexuses in association with the NECs. A relatively rich innervation of the proximal part of the EFAs, in conjunction with the EFA sphincters was also observed. Delicate varicose terminals surround the bases of the efferent lamellar arterioles. The localisation of distinct clusters of NECs at the individual filamental tips and the close connection with nerve terminals suggests a function as external branchial oxygen receptors.",

The linyphiid sheet‐web consists of an unordered meshwork of fibres of different thicknesses. The sheet is connected to the scaffolding by means of attachment discs. Thin threads with globules, which appear similar to the viscid silk droplets of orb‐webs, are present in most webs examined. Webs of M. pusilla had a higher density of these globules than did webs of L. triangularis . Webs of both species possess five types of thread connections and contain no aqueous glue for prey capture. Instead, unlike orb‐webs, the sticky substances produced by the linyphiid aggregate glands cement the different layers and threads of the sheet by drying up after being produced. Due to their function, sheet webs may not require viscid silk, thereby leading to a more economic web. The assumption made in most previous studies, that the globules in linyphiid webs have the same properties and function as viscid silk in orb‐webs, is unfounded.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The utility of sperm morphology in the systematics of polychaetes has been questioned in the past. This doubt stems from a problem with methodology, not with sperm morphology. It is argued that sperm characters used in combination with other morphological features have utility at various hierarchical levels. As a test of this proposition males in species from each of the following 10 fabriciin genera: Augeneriella, Fabricia, Fabriciola, Fahricinuda, Manayunkia, Novafabricia, Parafabricia, Pseudofabricia, Pseudofabriciola and an undescribed new Genus A (Fitzhugh et al. , in preparation), were examined in order to provide new characters for phylogenetic systematic studies. All species were found to have a dorsal sperm duct running beneath the faecal groove of the thoracic region. No sabellin sabellids or serpulids have this duct. The above Fabriciinae have spermatids developing in large clusters of several hundred cells. Serpulids and sabellins nearly always have sperm developing in tetrads or small groups. Fabriciins studied also have a sperm structure distinct from the Sabellinae and the Serpulidae. Proposed synapomorphies for the members of the Fabriciinae, based on sperm structure, include (1) a thick glycocalyx over the plasma membrane; (2) a distinctive nuclear projection, with an anterior thickening of the nuclear membrane; (3) a thickened. spiraling ridge of nuclear membrane; (4) an extra‐axonemal sheath and (5) a unique sheath of mitochondrial material in the midpiece. Within the sub‐family there were differences among species in sperm structure. This variability involves acrosome morphology; the structure of the sperm nucleus and nuclear projection; the spiral of thickened nuclear membrane; the structure of the extra‐axonemal sheath; the mitochondrial sheath. The monophyly of the Fabriciinae ( sensu Fitzhugh, 1991, 1993) is well supported by this analysis. The status of Caobangia is still unresolved and a close examination of this genus is warranted.",

The axial organ is a large axial blood vessel which is infiltrated by hollow cellular tubes lined with monociliated epithelial cells. The spongy body plexus is a tangle of small blood vessels overlain by podocytes and myocytes. The spongy body and the axial organ are situated in the axial coelom, which is confluent with the perivisceral coelom, the water vascular system, and the parietal canals. The parietal canals open to the exterior via ciliated tegmenal ducts and surface pores. The crinoid spongy body is morphologically similar to the axial gland of asteroids, ophiuroids, and echinoids (AOE). Although the axial glands of these three classes of echinoderms are mutually homologous structures, the homology of the crinoid spongy body and the AOE axial gland is questionable because of differences in organization and developmental origin. Alternatively, the crinoid spongy body may be homologous to asteroid gastric haemal tufts, which are podocyte‐covered blood vessels suspended in the perivisceral coelom. The functional organization of the spongy body suggests a filtration nephridium and predicts an excretory function. An alternative hypothesis is that the spongy body is a site of nutrient transfer from the blood vascular system to the perivisceral coelom.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pre‐Cambrian metamerically segmented bilaterians that ultimately gave rise to crustaceans probably arose from unsegmented flatworms. The recent suggestion that early arthropods, far from possessing a capacious segmented coelome of the annelid type, may never have had such, is attractive. Crustaceans were probably derived from small, segmented, surface‐dwelling non‐annelidan marine worms with a haemocoele. Their appendages probably originated as simple outgrowths whose shape was maintained by haemocoelic pressure. Possible routes whereby trunk limbs could have been derived from such rudiments are suggested. Trunk limbs would originally be unsegmented, as in many extant branchiopods and in certain Cambrian crustaceans. The evolution of thoracopodal feeding and some of the factors involved in the differentiation of the cephalic appendages are considered, as is the origin of the nauplius larva and the establishment of its feeding mechanism. Certain features of the cephalic region of the adult reflect changes necessitated as a result of the incorporation of the nauplius into the life cycle. Ontogeny would originally be anamorphic and follow the pattern preserved in its most primitive form in certain extant anostracan branchiopods. A reconstruction of the Ur‐crustacean is attempted. Justification for features not previously associated with such a reconstruction, such as locomotory antennae, a relatively short trunk with only a short series of limbs and a limbless posterior region, and unsegmented trunk limbs, is provided by fossil evidence, functional considerations and the situation in primitive extant forms. Crustaceans were evidently not derived from any known arthropod clade. Stem lineage forms probably arose from the same group of pre‐crustacean ancestors. While the Crustacea appears to be a monophyletic group, the idea that arthropodization must have occurred more than once and that the Arthropoda is a polyphyletic assemblage is supported, and evidence in favour of this view is cited.",

The spermatozoa appear wavy along their entire length. A small acrosome, together with the anterior nuclear region, is surrounded by an extracellular sheath, from which filaments radiate. The nucleus is helicoidal and attached to the flagellum by a centriolar adjunct. The axoneme has the 9 + 9 + 2 microtubule arrangement pitched in a long helix, with the spiralling mitochondrial derivatives coiling around it. Therefore, the spermatozoa of T. dendrolimi are very similar to those of other chalcidoids and different from the first description. It is now possible to affirm that the helical sperm structures are an apomorphic homology for Trichogrammatidae as well as Eulophidae, Pteromalidae, Eurytomidae, Torymidae, Mymaridae and for some other chalcidoids, if not all.",

In all species, the labyrinth contains a single macula and two cristae, in a single semicircular canal. The macula consists of a horizontal, a middle vertical and a posterior horizontal component. Each component is covered by numerous round statoconia. The ring‐shaped cristae have very long kinocilia, but lack a proper cupula. The sensory epithelia show signs of regeneration, indicated by the presence of mitoses and apoptotic hair cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Spermatozoa of the echiurans Bonellia viridis and Hamingia arctica show a similar ultrastructure. They are of a modified type. The head consists of a roughly cylindrical nucleus, which has a cover of electron‐dense material. The acrosome is very large and consists of an acrosomal vesicle and a rod‐shaped perforatorium or acrosomal rod. In close association with the nucleus, one or two mitochondria are found forming an irregular ring around the posterior tip of the nucleus and the centriolar apparatus. There are two centrioles, the proximal one with the conventional triplet microtubular structure. The tail flagellum is about 50 μm long and has the 9+2 axonemal structure. The oblique attachment of the acrosome to the anterior part of the nucleus gives the spermatozoon a bilateral symmetry. However, in the nuclear morphology, the arrangement of electron‐dense material around the nucleus, in the mitochondria, and in the attachment of the tail flagellum, the spermatozoon shows asymmetric organization. The sperm structure in bonelliids is unique but its genesis and the morphology of the mitochondrial midpiece support the theory that the echiurans are related to the annelids. The main results of the study are summarized in Fig. 11.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The white bodies and blood cells of the cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis , were investigated using light microscopy and electron microscopy. Each white body is supplied with arterial blood by two branches of the ophthalmic artery. These two branches arborize into the tissue and form an extensive capillary network that appears to be confluent with a system of thin‐walled venous channels in the white bodies. This vascular arrangement appears to allow maturing cells to leave the white body tissue and enter the general circulation. The putative hemopoietic cells are embedded in an internal connective tissue network. In addition to an extensive extracellular matrix system, this network contains many obliquely striated muscle fibers that probably aid in microcirculation. The white body cells were grouped into four categories that, ultrastructural evidence suggests, represent developmental stages of a single cell line. Morphological similarities between the putative final developmental stage of this cell line and circulating blood cells strongly support the hypothesis that white body cells are hemopoietic in function. Several lines of evidence indicate that proliferation within this cell line occurs at the first two stages of development. Thus a new developmental scheme is proposed. Quantitative analyses have shown that the white bodies are structurally and functionally uncompartmentalized. A comparison of developmental stages suggests that the physiology of the white bodies shifts from proliferation to differentiation as the animals mature. Blood cell densities decrease as the animals mature. Finally, cytological evidence indicates that the white bodies of Sepia officinalis are involved in reticuloendothelial functions in addition to hemopoiesis.",

The accessory glands consist of numerous glandular units, each being composed of four cells: two secretory cells are always joined and surrounded twice by an inner and an outer envelope cell. Both envelope cells take part in forming a cuticular ductule that leads from the secretory cells to the pore plates of the uterus externus. The inner envelope cell produces the proximal part of the canal close to the microvilli of the secretory cells, whereas the outer envelope cell produces the distal part of the canal leading to the pore plate. Close to the pore the latter exhibits prominent microvilli that might indicate additional secretory activity.",

We analysed the evolution of the seven polymorphic characters by mapping them onto a current phylogeny of the species of Tupinambis , using the teiids Ameiva ameiva and Cnemidophorus sexlineatus as outgroups. Our results indicate that sperm ultrastucture characters, although of great value for phylogeny at higher taxonomic levels in reptiles and other groups, are poor predictors of phylogeny when considering the species of Tupinambis studied here. We failed to identify evidences that homoplasy in sperm ultrastructure among the species of Tupinambis is due to convergent adaptation, suggesting that the polymorphism may be selectively neutral in this group.",

Histochemical analysis revealed a temperature‐dependent increase over time in calcium phosphate incorporation into the extracellular matrix (ECM) of adult cartilage concomitant with the incorporation of calcium as detected by gravimetric and radioisotopic methods. Ultrastructural analysis revealed the presence of ECM dense bodies (40 nm average) containing crystalline material which increased in number with increased mineral incorporation but were absent from control cartilage. Additionally, electron‐dense particles (15–20 nm) found in close association with the ECM fibrils in some regions of mineralized cartilage may represent sites of amorphous calcium phosphate. Larval cartilage incorporated much less calcium, less uniformly over time than did adult cartilage. Histochemical and ultrastructural analysis revealed that calcium had accumulated in the chondrocytes instead of the ECM and this proved detrimental, leading to the death of the cells. The discovery that adult lamprey cartilage calcifies in vitro under appropriate conditions, suggests that petromyzonids, or their direct agnathan ancestors, may have possessed mineralized skeletons and that this ability is ‘repressed’ in extant lampreys owing primarily to the environment they inhabit.",

Apart from these characteristics, the spermatozoon of M. merluccius is remarkable because of the mutually parallel arrangement of the centrioles, a rare feature among fishes, which is considered an apomorphic condition for animal sperm cells. Within the superorder Paracanthopterygii, which contains a large diversity of sperm patterns resulting from a high number of apomorphies, a perciform‐type sperm is present only in the order Gadiformes.

The secondary egg envelope appears at the postvitellogenic phase and is composed of a filamentous and undulant material.

The surface of the AO is thrown into folds, the ridges of which bear curved spines. The AO epidermis consists of 10–12 tiers of filament‐rich cells, of which the outer tier cells project spines lined with a thick plasma membrane and bear bundles of tonofilaments (TF). Their cytoplasm contains TF and large mucus‐like granules, but no obvious organelles. A second tier of living cells with spines is present beneath the outer tier and seems to replace the latter when its spines are damaged or shed. The outer tier cells react positively with antibody to cytokeratin. Actin labelling is clearly absent from the outer tier, indicating that keratinization of the outer tier occurs in the absence of actin filaments. In the cells of the third to fifth tiers, the cytoplasm possesses abundant small mucous granules (0.1–0.3 µm), and fewer TF compared to the cytoplasm in the spines. The cells of the innermost tiers and the basal layer possess few TF bundles, but no mucous granules. The potential of AO filament cells to produce both mucous granules and keratin filaments is noteworthy. The observations provide evidence that specific regions of fish epidermis can actually undergo a true process of keratinization.",

Unlike other carapids whose sounds have been recorded ( C. boraborensis , C. homei and Encheliophis gracilis ), these two species have a central constriction in their swimbladder and are unlikely to encounter heterospecific carapids within their hosts. We evoked sound production in Carapus acus and Carapus mourlani by adding several individuals to a tank with a single host and found that their sounds differ substantially from the sounds emitted by other carapids in pulse length, peak frequency and sharpness of tuning ( Q 3 dB ). Unlike the other carapids, C. mourlani and C. acus produce shorter and less repetitive sounds and do not produce sounds when they enter their host. Since sounds produced within a sea cucumber have the potential to be heard by distant carapids and are typically recorded outside the sea cucumber, we examined the effect of the sea cucumber tegument on acoustic transmission. Attenuation by the tegument was negligible at the frequencies within carapid sounds. Therefore, carapids have the potential to call from the relative safety of a sea cucumber without sacrificing the distance over which their transmissions are heard.",

In addition to granular club cells and phagocytic cells, neurons and neoblasts occur in the gastroderm of this turbellarian species. This is the first observation of neurons in the gastroderm of a flatworm. Dense‐core vesicles (70–100 nm diameter), electron lucent cytoplasm and numerous Golgi complexes characterize the neurons. Unpolarized two‐way synapses, neuromuscular junctions and polarized chemical synapses can be observed in the gastroderm. Neoblasts with large nuclei and scanty cytoplasm and differentiating cells containing clusters of basal bodies occur next to the basal lamina of the gastroderm. BPP‐like, FMRF‐amide‐like and vasotocin‐like immunoreactivity is demonstrated in the gastroderm. Both BPP and FMRF‐amide IR is restricted to the basal cytoplasm of the granular club cells, while a different location for IR to vasotocin antiserum is observed.

Spermatid differentiation is characterized by chromatin condensed into thick fibres, nuclear rotation, nuclear fossa formation, cytoplasmic channel formation, mitochondrial fusion producing long and ramified mitochondria, and the presence of several membranous concentric rings around the plasma membrane that encircles the cytoplasmic channel. In Salminus and Brycon , spermatozoa are very similar. They exhibit a spherical nucleus and chromatin condensed into fibre clusters, and a deep nuclear fossa. They show a long midpiece with few elongate mitochondria at the initial region and a cytoplasmic channel completely encircled by one or two membranous concentric rings. The flagellar axis is perpendicular to the nucleus and exhibits the classic axoneme (9 + 2). The very strong similarity observed between Salminus and Brycon spermatozoa supports the hypothesis that these subfamilies are likely to have a monophyletic origin.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In two species of Heterodontus , H. portusjacksoni and H. galeatus , the first scales to develop form two opposing rows along the caudal fin axis on both the left and right sides of the fin. The opposing rows originate from an initial scale located on either side of the posterior tip of the caudal fin, with subsequent scales erupting in a posterior to anterior direction along the tail axis. These scale rows may strengthen tail movements, providing aeration in the egg case, but are lost later in ontogeny. Development of subsequent body scales shows a more irregular origin and arrangement, from anterior to posterior, to cover the dorsal and ventral lobes of the caudal fin. Although the early developmental pattern of the scale associated with the Heterodontus caudal fin has not been previously described, several chondrichthyan taxa, including chimeroids, likewise possess ordered rows of flank scales early in ontogeny that are subsequently lost. These ordered scales contrast with previous suggestions that chondrichthyan scale development is entirely random. Instead, regulated and sequential development of scales may be a plesiomorphic character for both chondrichthyans and osteichthyans, with the less organized arrangement in later ontogenetic stages being a derived condition within Chondrichthyes.",

The ductules of this lizard are extra‐testicular and arise from an extra‐testicular rete testis. A major portion of the ductules is intra‐epididymal and occupies the cephalic end of the epididymis. The ductules differentiate histologically into proximal and distal portions. The epithelium is formed of two major tall columnar cell types, the non‐ciliated and ciliated, and one minor cell type, the basal cells. Dark cells were also identified. The non‐ciliated cells possess microvilli towards the luminal end, tubular coated pits at the bases of the microvilli, coated vesicles in the apical cytoplasm and multivesicular bodies, lysosomes and mitochondria in the supranuclear and perinuclear cytoplasm, which reflects their role in the uptake of the material they are processing. These cells also participate in spermiophagy. The ciliated cells reflect their role in mixing the luminal content and/or its transport to the distal parts of the male tract. The lizard efferent ductules share many features in common with those of mammals and a crocodile and several other features with birds and a turtle. Spermiophagy by the efferent ductules is reported here for the first time in a reptile.",

In all the studied species the posterior aorta leads as a simple tube into the pleon attached to the dorsal diaphragm. The anterior aorta runs from its origin in the anterior part of the second thoracic segment into the cephalothorax. Both pairs of antennae have an arterial supply off the anterior aorta. An overview of previously studied species including our present findings shows the amphipod HVS to be relatively uniform and the gammarid form is discussed as being closest to the ground pattern of Amphipoda.",

Incorporation of tritiated leucine into prolactin was least in prolactin cells from seawater Tilapia incubated in isosmotic medium and greatest in those of freshwater Tilapia incubated in hyposmotic medium.

The mean diameter of the basophil secretory granules increases from 150 nm in October to 220 nm in April and May.

The ultrastructural characteristics of the lead hematoxylin positive cells found sometimes in paraffin sections are unknown. Non-glandular stellate cells are common. They contain microfilaments, are probably contractile, and transform to phagocytes during the last months before spawning. This phagocytosis involves only the basophil cells. It is suggested that the stellate cells in this way destroy excess hormone. All cell types in the pituitary accumulate large irregular lipid droplets during the last month before spawning. These lipid droplets seem to be expelled from residual bodies as an end product of autolysis and phagocytosis.",

Abstract Spermiocytogenesis, Sperms and Spermatophores in Bdellidae (Acari) The four lobules of the testis of Bdellidae are composed of a glandular and a germinal epithelium surrounding a central lumen. The glandular epithelium is built up by ER-rich cells the secretory products of which are extruded into the lumen, where they surround the spermatozoa. The germinal epithelium contains one large and branched somatic cell and germ cells which are located between the branches of the somatic cell. Spermiocytogenesis is characterized by the formation of an acrosome, a long acrosomal filament, a nuclear condensation of the fibrillar type, the formation of a thin, comma-shaped nucleus and evaginations of the plasma membrane. The acrosomal filament is at first to be found in a nuclear canal, later it can partly be found in the cytoplasm. In the lumen of the testis the spermatozoa are surrounded by secrets, organized as a complicated coat. The encysted sperms are found in the spermatophores. In the receptaculum seminis of the female the spermatozoa loose their secretory coat and their regular shape.",

The cells which are characterized by the morphology and sizes of their secretory granules are assumed to secrete prolactin, ACTH and TSH. Prolactin cells occur in two forms which could be separated on account of the sizes of their granules. Intra-peritoneal injections of reserpine had a strong and persistent effect 24 hours after the treatment. The prolactin cells with small granules reacted with a marked release of secretion. The border of the RPD is composed of a so-called double basement membrane in contact with the perivascular spaces and forms extensive ramifications into the rostral neurohypophysis (RNH). Nerve fibers of different categories terminate at the border and its network in the RNH. Substances released from these terminals may influence the endocrine cells of the RPD. The ACTH cells and the prolactin cells are innervated by axons with granules less than 100 nm. The nomenclature of type ‘A’ fibers and ‘B’ fibers is discussed because it was difficult to make a reliable discrimination of the fibers and their nature by the sizes of their granules. However, four types of nerve fibers were distinguished in connection with the RPD although the presence of more types was indicated. In all four types the size variations of the granules are great and overlapping. The average sizes of the granules in these fibers are 157, 114, 119 and 81 nm. The origin of the nerve fibers innervating the RPD is discussed. All morphological data indicate a complex hypothalamic control of the RPD of the roach.",

The residence time of the parasites in the amphioxus gut appears to be in the order of several months, which is considerably shorter than the potential lifetime of the host. The living larvae range in length (when fully extended) from 300 to 850 µm and are approximately cone‐shaped, tapering to a point posteriorly and bearing a single large sucker anteriorly. Toward the anterior end of the body are four hookless bothridia, each indented by three loculi plus an inconspicuous accessory sucker. The larvae initiate the early stages of hook formation when they are cultured for a few days in urea‐saline (mimicking the gut fluid of the definitive host, which is an elasmobranch). The tapeworm larvae are identifiable to genus and species on the basis of correspondences between their nuclear ribosomal DNA genes and those of adult specimens of Acanthobothrium brevissime recovered from the spiral valve of a stingray from the same environment.",

The emergence of the chordate body plan: some puzzles and problems. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 4–10 Rather than being sessile filter feeders, ancestral chordates are now thought to have evolved from more active benthic animals, possibly hemichordate‐like, that took to swimming, to generate something resembling modern amphioxus. This general picture conceals a number of specific problems that underline how little we understand the transition in detail. I will address three. First, and closest to resolution is the issue of dorsoventral inversion, which has implications for understanding how an internalized brain evolved. This is because the mouth, dorsal after inversion, has first to be moved out of the way. Its migration down the left side of the head during amphioxus development may be a recapitulation of this event. Two other puzzles, both further from resolution are: (1) the significance, if any, of the neurenteric canal, which may be telling us something important about the true nature of deuterostomy, specifically whether hemichordates and echinoderms are deuterostomes for a different reason than chordates, and (2) whether the functional digestive tract of chordates is a secondary replacement of an earlier structure whose fate remains unexplained. Resolving these latter two issues will require a better understanding of molecular level events during development in protochordates and their immediate invertebrate relatives.",

This study provides a comparative analysis of gametogenesis of neotropical teleosts Metynnis maculatus , Megalancistrus parananus , Cichla kelberi and Satanoperca pappaterra , through histological, histochemical and histometric techniques. In the ooplasm of C. kelberi and S. pappaterra conspicuous lipid vesicles were observed, which are characteristic of pelagic eggs produced by marine fishes. Perinucleolar oocytes were identified in the testis of S. pappaterra suggesting that this species is protogynous without functional hermaphroditism, an unusual pattern for neotropical fresh‐water fishes. The spermatozoa of the studied species have rounded heads, a characteristic of fish that externally fertilise their eggs. The follicular (granulosa) cells of the vitellogenic oocytes from the studied species were cuboidal or columnar, however, in C. kelberi there were columnar follicular cells at the vegetal pole and cuboidal cells at the animal pole. Variations of the histochemical content were detected in the cortical alveoli and follicular cells of vitellogenic oocytes showing differences in the mechanisms to block polyspermy and egg adhesiveness. Larger oocytes were recorded in species which demonstrated parental care behaviour and smaller oocytes were noted in those species with fractioned spawning.",

Corticotrophs are rapidly degranulated, smaller with a reduction of the nuclear area (14.4%, 18.25 ± 0.3 to 15.61 ± 0.31 μm2, P < 0.001) after 9 injections and up to 28. Growth hormone-secreting cells appear smaller, often degranulated, but no nuclear atrophy is detected. Gonadotrophs are slightly stimulated and more abundant, a result which may be correlated with a picture of activity in the nucleus lateralis tuberis and the beginning of gonadal development (organs of Syrski). Prolactin cells appear very active, thyrotrophs may be less active in some animals. In the pars intermedia, MSH (melanophorostimulating hormone) cells progressively become degranulated, with a reduced nuclear diameter (4.73 ± 0.03 to 4.45 ± 0.03 μm, P < 0.001) after 6 injections and more. Their hypoactivity may play a role in the skin silvering process. There is a tendency towards a reduction of the amount of neurosecretory material in the neurohypophysis of some animals.

Distribution and structure of glandular tissue in the oropharynx and proximal esophagus of the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae). —Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 92: 206–215. The glandular regions of the upper digestive tract in the emu were non-pigmented (except for the tongue in most specimens) and invested by a non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium. The glands found in these regions were exclusively simple in nature and composed of tubular secretory units lined by Periodic Acid Schiff Stain-positive mucus-secreting cells. The naming of the various glandular fields was based on previously identified anatomical features and on nomenclature modified from previous studies on birds. The glands were classified into two main types, namely, simple tubular and simple branched tubular mucus-secreting glands. Simple branched tubular glands were a feature of the regions exposed to the greatest amount of friction during feeding, whereas simple tubular glands were a feature of regions exposed to less friction. The saliva produced by the salivary glands in birds functions to moisturize and lubricate food boli. Mucins in saliva also protect mucosal surfaces from desiccation and mechanical damage, assist in maintaining cellular water balance, provide lubrication and have an antimicrobial action. This study suggests that, in addition to the role of specific gross anatomical features, the type and distribution of glandular tissue in the emu upper digestive tract supports the cranio-inertial feeding method employed by this species.",

The previous description was based on flattened material and was analysed in the context of the few fossils known at the time. Since then, several new forms have been described such as Gogonasus , Tiktaalik and an isolated humerus from the Catskill Formation. The humeral morphology of Panderichthys rhombolepis and its interpretation in this new context are therefore reassessed with the help of a three‐dimensional model produced with the mimics software based on a computed tomography scan of an unflattened specimen as well as comparisons with the originally described material. The humerus of Panderichthys displays a combination of primitive, derived, intermediate and unique characteristics. It is very similar to the morphology of Tiktaalik but when it differs from it, it is most often more derived despite the more basal phylogenetic position that Panderichthys occupies. What emerges from this study is a much more gradual transformation of the humerus morphology from fish to tetrapods and the ability to distinguish autapomorphies more easily. The picture is more complex than previously believed, with many morphological specializations probably reflecting the breadth of ecological specializations already present at the time.",

Interpretation of the caudal complex of adult Tetraodontiformes has proven problematic because of the consolidation of the component elements. Here, we show that an ontogenetic approach offers considerable elucidation of the homology of the caudal complex, resulting in a new understanding of the grundplan of these fishes. The reductions of structures of the caudal complex are interpreted in a phylogenetic context. The caudal skeleton of larval triacanthodids resembles that of many adult percomorphs; however, during subsequent development epural 3 disappears, while epural 2 is reduced so that it can hardly be distinguished from the uroneural remnants. Juvenile triacanthids have an epural 2 that is lost in ontogeny, and the cartilaginous parhypural becomes integrated into the large hypural plate. In ostraciids and diodontids, the parhypural is absent throughout development. The hypural plates of adult balistids, monacanthids and tetraodontids have a conspicuous diastema between the dorsal and ventral portions. However, in early stages of the former two, the dorsal and ventral portions are continuous in cartilage proximally and remain fused in the adults. In tetraodontids, the two hypurals are separate from their initial appearance in cartilage and never fuse, raising the question of homology of the individual hypurals among the different families.",

The study deals with skin pigmentation in the reptile Sphenodon punctatus where neither strong colors nor rapid color changes are present. Dark areas of the skin derive from an intense pigmentation of beta‐keratinocytes of the epidermis. Only epidermal melanocytes are involved in the process of melanosome transfer into keratinocytes. The basement membrane is a structural boundary separating melanocytes from melanophores that are sparse or concentrated in some dermal areas where they contribute to the dark coloration of the skin. In these regions, dermal melanophores give rise to the dark dots or to the irregular spots or to the dark stripes present in the skin. Ultrastructurally only eu‐melanosomes are present, although only molecular studies can detect whether also pheomelanins are synthesized in these organelles. Chromatophores are not organized in functional dermal melanophore units. Xantophores are distributed under the epidermis and store lipid‐containing droplets or lamellated pterinosomes. Their specific yellow‐orange hues become evident on the skin surface. Iridophores are generally localized among the melanosomes and form reflecting platelets that are derived form the endoplasmic reticulum and probably are also elaborated in the Golgi apparatus. The role in color production of the latter cells in the skin remains to be identified.",

The results indicate that there are significant differences in the wing measurements between sexes, females being bigger than males in this respect. While no significant differences in the wing measurements of paired and single males were observed, significant differences were found in their relative weight and fitness, single males being significantly heavier and having a better physical condition. We discuss the implications of SSD for the female of M . myotis in terms of reproductive advantages, trophic niche segregation and a greater ability to move, which may favour gene flow between populations.",

During the formation of the aragonite prismatic layer in the freshwater bivalve H . cumingii , we found that crystal growth was involved in controlling initiation of formation of the interprismatic organic membranes. First, newly formed crystals were embedded in the periostracum. Next, the interprismatic organic membranes of the prismatic layer were produced via squeezing between neighboring crystals. The organic matrix secreted by the mantle continuously self‐assembled into the interprismatic organic membranes as the crystals grew. In the mature stage, the interprismatic organic membranes were shaped by crystal growth. These findings provide evidence to support the squeezing hypothesis and add to the existing knowledge about interactions that occur at the organic–inorganic interfaces during mollusk shell biomineralization.",

Morphology of the cranial skeleton and musculature in the obligate carnivorous tadpole of Lepidobatrachus laevis (Anura: Ceratophryidae). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00 :1–12. Lepidobatrachus laevis (Ceratophryidae: Ceratophryinae) is a bizarre frog endemic to the Chacoan desert of central South America. Its tadpole is an obligate carnivore that can catch and consume live prey nearly its own size. Morphological adaptations associated with this unique feeding mode, including the larval skull anatomy and associated cranial musculature, have only been partly described. We studied the head of Stages 26–27 larvae using gross dissection, immunohistochemistry, and standard histology. Derived features of this tadpole compared to the microphagous, herbivorous larvae of most other anurans include simplified chondrocranial cartilages and very robust jaw muscles. The mm. suspensorio‐ et quadratoangularis do not take their origin from the processus muscularis of the palatoquadrate, as in most other tadpoles, but instead originate from the corpus of the palatoquadrate caudal to this process. The jaw levators are unusually large. The tadpole of Ceratophrys , another member of the ceratophryine clade, also consumes large animal prey, but its morphology is very different. It probably has evolved independently from a generalized, mainly herbivorous tadpole similar to the larva of Chacophrys , the third ceratophryine genus. Most specialized features of the larval head of Lepidobatrachus laevis are adaptations for ‘megalophagy’—ingestion of whole, very large animal prey.",

The overall morphology of Scalibregmatidae is very similar, with thick bodies, small parapodia, and no prostomial appendages or short horns. The only exception is members of the genera Axiokebuita and Speleobregma that most frequently inhabit crevices or gravel and possess extensive ventral ciliated palps and globular adhesive pygidium. Character reconstruction using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods show that ciliated palps and adhesive pygidium are synapomorphies of the Axiokebuita – Speleobregma clade. The most likely transformation series is from horns to ciliated palps, the origin of which correlates with the occurrence of Axiokebuita and Speleobregma in crevices or gravel. The wide spaces among rocks or granules yield high permeability and inertial water flow, preventing deposition of organic matter. Under these flow conditions that differ significantly from those of sand or mud bottom, ciliated palps aid to the collection of suspended particles and an adhesive pygidium provides attachment. With palps being a highly debated character in annelid evolution, it is remarkable that prominent ciliated palps are gained within a lineage of ancestrally nonpalpate annelids, most likely increasing their fitness when colonizing a new environment.",

Adult male A . costata costata lizards were collected, and the reproductive tracts were removed and subjected to histological analyses. Testicular activity commences in M arch with maximum testicular activity and highest sperm abundance (in the epididymides) occurring between M ay and J uly. The testis remains at peak activity until S eptember when a late regression/early quiescent phase is observed. Leydig cells follow this same pattern except these hormone‐producing cells remain at maximum secretory level through S eptember. Sperm are present in the epididymides in A pril– S eptember. This pattern is consistent with the spring recrudescence found in a multitude of male lizard taxa. However, this differs from the continuous cycle observed in some tropical T eiid species and other lizard taxa at high elevation. This study indicates that our knowledge about lizard spermatogenic cycles remains incomplete, and additional studies are required to fully understand the interactions between phenotype, evolution, phylogenetics and environment.",

The feeding habits in captivity are one of the critical steps in the species of commercial interest, strictly related to the morphological characteristics of the oropharyngeal cavity. This study was undertaken, using light and scanning electron microscopy, to analyse the morphology of the dorsal tongue surface to show whether relationships are present between the anatomy and the nutritional habits and choices of this farmed species. Three zones, an apex, a body and a root, can be clearly distinguished, with a pouch partially covering the apex. In the pouch, cylindroid and mucosal ridges were observed. Along the whole tongue surface, from the apex to the root, on the medial and lateral parts, many papillae are present, with a fungiform, cylindroid and cone‐like aspect. Taste buds are showed on the dorsal surface of some papillae.",

To investigate the means by which E . applititus locates and parasitizes H . insularis, we used scanning electron microscopy to determine the morphology and distribution of sensilla on antenna, ovipositor and leg of male and female E . applititus . Eight different sensilla types were found: sensilla chaetica, sensilla trichodea, sensilla placodea, sensilla basiconica, sensilla coeloconica, sensilla pit basiconica, sensilla campaniformia and B öhm's bristles. The sensilla types were differently distributed in the three organs. In addition, differences between sexes were found in the distribution of sensilla trichodea type 2, sensilla placodea and sensilla chaetica type 4. Putative functions of the sensilla are discussed based on the morphological and location data and on previous research. Chemosensitive sensilla are putatively involved in host detection, pheromone detection and host discrimination processes. Mechanoreceptive sensilla likely function as vibrational sensors and are thought to be critical for accurate ovipositor positioning.",

Male P. pelagicus of different sizes were collected from the Palk Bay off Mandapam (9°17′ N, 79°9′ E) and maintained under controlled conditions for the study. Tissues from testis, anterior vas deferens (AVD), median vas deferens (MVD), posterior vas deferens (PVD), ejaculatory duct and penis were fixed in Bouin's fluid and 2.5% buffered glutaraldehyde separately and processed for light and electron microscopic studies, respectively. The reproductive system consisted of testis, commissure, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct and penis. The vas deferens was divided based on the morphology and/or histology into AVD, MVD and PVD. The AVD was further divided based on histology into proximal and distal regions, and the MVD, based on diameter into major and minor coils. The testicular lobe had several lobules with a central seminiferous tubule, which continued till the penis. The seminiferous tubule was lined by a layer of cuboidal or columnar epithelium. The lining of the central tubule of the vas deferens formed several ‘folds’, which at times formed ‘pouches’. High incidence of cell organelles in the columnar epithelial cells, aggregations of vesicles and occurrence of blebs at the luminal periphery and the projection of numerous microvilli containing electron‐dense materials into the lumen from the cell lining denoted high secretory activity of the epithelial cells.",

Testicular structure and sperm morphology were analyzed using light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Anatomically, the testes weighed 0.070 ± 0.01 g and were oval with a yellow‐white color. The G. caparo testis is organized in interstitial and tubular compartments. Spermatogenesis occurs in seminiferous tubules where the germinal epithelium is organized in spermatogenic cystis. Germ cells are seen in different stages of differentiation: type A ( SPGA ) and type B ( SPGB ) spermatogonia, primary ( SPCI ) and secondary ( SPCII ) spermatocytes, and spermatids ( SPD ). Differentiated spermatozoa ( SZ ) are seen within the cysts, characterized by a round head, a short midpiece, and a single flagellum with absence of acrosome. Spermatids were seen in the lumen of the testicular tubules together with spermatozoa, suggesting that spermatogenesis is of the semicystic type. The present study shows that G. carapo has an anastomosing tubular type of testis with an unrestricted distribution of the spermatogonia and semicystic type of spermatogenesis. Sperm structure follows the general pattern described for other teleostei species. These descriptions are important for a better understanding of reproductive biology and phylogeny, particularly of tropical fishes, for which data remain scarce in the literature.",

The non‐hierarchical, non‐uniformly branching topology of a leuconoid sponge aquiferous system revealed by 3D reconstruction and morphometrics using corrosion casting and X‐ray microtomography. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00 :1–12. As sessile filter feeders, sponges rely on a highly efficient fluid transport system. Their physiology depends on efficient water exchange, which is performed by the aquiferous system. This prominent poriferan anatomical character represents a dense network of incurrent and excurrent canals on which we lack detailed 3D models. To overcome this, we investigated the complex leucon‐type architecture in the demosponge Tethya wilhelma using corrosion casting, microtomography, and 3D reconstructions. Our integrative qualitative and quantitative approach allowed us to create, for the first time, high‐resolution 3D representations of entire canal systems which were used for detailed geometric and morphometric measurements. Canal diameters lack distinct size classes, and bifurcations are non‐uniformly ramified. A relatively high number of bifurcations show previously unknown and atypical cross‐sectional area ratios. Scaling properties and topological patterns of the canals indicate a more complex overall architecture than previously assumed. As a consequence, it might be more convenient to group canals into functional units rather than hierarchical clusters. Our data qualify the leucon canal system architecture of T. wilhelma as a highly efficient fluid transport system adapted toward minimal flow resistance. Our results and approach are relevant for a better understanding of sponge biology and cultivation techniques.",

We compared traditional staining methods versus micro‐computed tomography (μ CT ) of 31 specimens representing 10 species of Aldisa , Cadlina and Onchidoris . We found that μ CT offered a nondestructive view of sufficient resolution to study the gross morphology of networks, although images of fine structures were too grainy to allow robust comparisons. Network form did not vary within species and was consistent within genera. The three genera varied in several obvious characters, such as the presence of a pleural sinus channel, large dorsal spicules and multispicular tracts, as well as in relative size, shape and orientation of spicules. These characters, combined with those from the literature, supported recent molecular phylogenies that group Cadlina with Aldisa , and that question the monophyly of the Cryptobranchia. This suggests that these network forms will prove a fruitful source of phylogenetic characters with at least genus‐level resolution.",

Contrary to the anatomical terminology currently employed, the avian maxillare exhibits five rather than four processes. In addition to the praemaxillary, jugal, nasal, and maxillopalatine processes, all palaeognathous and many neognathous birds also have a palatine process. The occurrence of these processes is, however, variable across different clades and only few taxa exhibit a pentaradiate maxillare with all five processes. Within Neognathae, a great morphological variability exists in the shape of the maxillopalatine process, which is more easily studied in juvenile individuals, in which the bones of the beak and palate are not co‐ossified. In some Neognathae, a caudally facing recess is situated in the junction of the maxillopalatine and jugal processes, which is likely to be homologous to the pneumatic recess of palaeognathous birds. Several derived morphologies of potential phylogenetic significance for the characterization of neognathous clades are identified and major morphological transformations in the lineage leading towards modern birds are highlighted.",

The results highlighted growth‐dependent variability in the otolith of A. furcatus , which might be useful to define its certain developmental stages. We underlined those characters that were consistent during fish development, which could be valuable to identify the species. Considering the ontogenetic pattern of otolith in A. furcatus , it was found that the otoliths of young individuals have largely been influenced by sexes and that it was reduced during the fish development. Morphological side dimorphism in the otolith of A. furcatus tends to be increased during fish development.

    "abstract": "Abstract The parasphenoid is located in the cranium of many vertebrates. When present, it is always an unpaired, dermal bone. While most basal vertebrates have a parasphenoid, most placental mammals lack this element and have an unpaired, dermal vomer in a similar position (i.e. associated with the same bones) and with a similar function. As such, the parasphenoid and the vomer were considered homologous by some early twentieth century researchers. However, others questioned this homology based on comparisons between mammals and reptiles. Here we investigate the parasphenoid bone across the major vertebrate lineages (amphibians, reptiles, mammals and teleosts) including both developmental and evolutionary aspects, which until now have not been considered together. We find that within all the major vertebrate lineages there are organisms that possess a parasphenoid and a vomer, while the parasphenoid is absent within caecilians and most placental mammals. Based on our assessment and Patterson's conjunction tests, we conclude that the non‐mammalian parasphenoid and the vomer in mammals cannot be considered homologous. Additionally, the parasphenoid is likely homologous between sarcopterygian and actinopterygian lineages. This research attempts to resolve the issue of the parasphenoid homology and highlights where gaps in our knowledge are still present.",

Therefore, this study aimed to describe the morphology of alloscutal integument of R. sanguineus female ticks in three different feeding stages by means of histological and ultramorphological analysis. Significant differences were observed in all stages, with respect to the size of cells and layers, and to cuticle unfolding throughout the feeding process. Cuticle is divided into two main layers, the epicuticle and the procuticle, and is separated from a unistratified epithelium by a subcuticular layer. Procuticle, in turn, is divided into two layers, the endocuticle and exocuticle. Unfed female ticks showed cuticle with numerous folds, which decrease in quantity as the feeding expansion of the whole animal occurs. Opening of dermal glands and presence of setae also differed among groups.",

Some aspects of the reproductive apparatus and reproduction in C ephalodiscus are reported. The ultrastructure of the spermatozoon is described for the first time. Coelom formation is by schizocoely. The structure of the larva at several developmental stages is illustrated. Not all fertilised eggs are destined to become motile larvae and some develop into zooids omitting the motile stage. The lumen of the oviduct is much larger than previously supposed. Spermatozoa are shed into the cavity of the coenecium. It is proposed that fertilisation takes place within the coenecium. The ultrastructure of the enigmatic black ‘ C omma B ody’ is described and a reproductive function is proposed. Budding takes place from a base common to several zooids. This base probably also serves as an attachment foot. Large masses of yolk have been discovered within the coelom of some zooids and muscle stalks. It is inconceivable that a colony of C ephalodiscus nigrescens could survive unless it spent most of its life outside the coenecium.",

The peak of secondary vitellogenesis occurred during winter–spring (July–December), ovulation in spring (October–December), mating and fertilization in spring–summer (October–February), oviposition in spring–autumn (October–May) and births from late spring to autumn (December–July). The diameter of vitellogenic follicles/eggs was larger in winter–spring than in other seasons. The diameter of the shell glands was also larger in winter–spring. In spite of the clear reproductive peak, gonads only showed reduced activity in the autumn. Therefore, at the individual level, females have a discontinuous cyclical reproduction; in the populational level, the reproductive cycle is seasonal semisynchronous. We support the hypothesis that P. patagoniensis have the ability to produce multiple clutches with long‐term stored sperm. Sexual dimorphism in body size was evident, and females are significantly larger and heavier than males. Larger females were able to produce follicles and eggs in larger amount and size. The maternal body size was positively related to the reproductive effort and fecundity.

    "abstract": "Abstract Adhesive toe pads of geckos house modified components of vascular and/or connective tissues that promote conformity of the setal fields with the locomotor substratum. Similar modifications have been claimed for the digits of Anolis , but evidence for them is not compelling. Angiographic and histological investigations of Anolis failed to identify any evidence of either an intralamellar vascular reticular network or a central sinus. Instead, their vascularity more closely resembles that of lizards in general than that of pad‐bearing geckos. The loose connective tissue of the toe pads likely contributes to their general pliability and flexibility, promoting localized compliance with the substratum. Through the shedding cycle, the lamellae change shape as the replacing setae elongate. The outer epidermal generation lacunar cells on the inner lamellar faces simultaneously hypertrophy, providing for compatibility between overlapping lamellae, enabling reciprocity between them. This contributes to continuing compliance of the setal fields with the substratum. Overall, digital structure and attachment and release kinematics of the toe pads of Anolis are very similar to those of geckos exhibiting an incipient adhesive mechanism. Both lack major anatomical specializations for promoting conformity of the setae with the locomotor substratum beyond those of the seta‐bearing portions of the epidermis.",

After further 8 and 16 days, and 14 and 22 days of regeneration, numerous 5BrdU‐labelled cells are detected in regenerating tail and limb, derived from most stump tissues. In tail blastema cone at 14 days, sparse‐labelled cells remain in proximal dermis, muscles, cartilaginous tube and external layers of wound epidermis but are numerous in the blastema. In apical regions at 22 days of regeneration, labelled mesenchymal cells are sparse, while the apical wound epidermis contains numerous labelled cells in suprabasal and external layers, indicating cell accumulation from more proximal epidermis. Cell proliferation dilutes the label, and keratinocytes take 8 days to migrate into corneous layers. In healing limbs, labelled cells remain sparse from 14 to 22 days of regeneration in wound epidermis and repairing tissues and little labelling dilution occurs indicating low cell proliferation for local tissue repair but not distal growth. Labelled cells are present in epidermis, intermuscle and peri‐nerve connectives, bone periosteum, cartilaginous callus and sparse fibroblasts, leading to the formation of a scarring outgrowth. Resident stem cells and dedifferentiation occur when stump tissues are damaged.",

The study also attempted to explain, on a morphological level, how skin colour changes occur. Samples of leopard gecko skin were collected from wild‐type coloration adult specimens. The morphology of pigmented cells was determined using light microscopy on haematoxylin and eosin ( H &amp; E ) stained sections and in transmission electron microscopy. These studies indicate that skin of E . macularis contains xanthophores and melanophores but lacks iridophores and that this is probably related to nocturnal activity. The number and distribution of xanthophores and melanophores determines the skin colour and pigmentation pattern. The colour changes depend on the arrangement of characteristic protrusions of melanophores and the degree of filling them with melanosomes.",

All species show testes of unrestricted lobular type, characterized by a single germinal compartment, with central lumen, and an external tunica albuginea. The spermatogenesis occurs throughout a process of semicystic type, in which germinal spermatocysts open precociously, so germ cells complete maturation in the testis lumen. Amongst them, aflagellate and flagellate multinucleate cells are recognizable. This type of spermatogenesis may be therefore related to the reduced number of simultaneously mature sperm produced by syngnathids. Only one type of mature sperm has been identified in all examined species. It is always a monoflagellate cell, characterized by an elongated head. Elongated head has generally been correlated with the internal fertilization and/or to the production of spermatophore. As this is not the case of syngnathids, a possible function to explain the particularly elongated head of syngnathids is discussed.",

Furthermore, in the most distal tubule region of the seminal vesicles of E yprepocnemis plorans plorans , a rather characteristic secretory mechanism was found: the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells contained a large vesicle delimited by tightly packed microvilli. Numerous small vesicles open into this large vesicle which gradually dilates to merge with the apical plasma membrane releasing its contents into the lumen. Spermiophagic activity was found in all the species investigated. In the Tettigoniidae, this activity was found only in some epithelial cells of the seminal vesicle wall; in the species of the Acrididae the spermiophagic activity was carried out in the spermiduct lumen by an epithelial‐type cellular group.

Proteinase, lipase and amylase activities were significantly influenced by diet and weight. Specific trypsin activity was significantly higher for crayfish fed with the HL diet. Trypsin activity depended on diet and weight. Protein digestibility showed that HL was the most digestible diet and RF the least. The weight of the animals did not affect protein digestibility. Structural disorganization, hypertrophy of B‐cells and presence of large vacuoles in R‐cells were mainly observed in juveniles fed with HL , indicative of malnutrition. Thus, our data suggest that the HL diet would not be the most appropriate for C. quadricarinatus , while RF diet would be more convenient for culture of this species.",

The otolith materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy and quantitative analyses. The results underlined clear ontogenetic variation in the otolith morphology, which could be valuable to delineate the certain developmental stages of A. hormuzensis . Besides, some otolith features were found to be consistent during fish development and, therefore, appreciated to identify the species. The otoliths of A. hormuzensis demonstrated considerable sexual dimorphism in the adult fishes. Also, morphological side dimorphism was observed more in the otoliths of the females. As a result, the present study designated a clear intrapopulation variation in the otolith of A. hormuzensis , which were mainly influenced by fish development, sexual factors and morphological side dimorphism. The outcomes of the present study provide new basic data on the natural intrapopulation variation of this tooth‐carp during its life history and offered new data to interpret those factors that regulate otolith shape during the development, which has less been considered in previous studies.",

This study provides a detailed description of the early life stages of a threatened freshwater fish species, the Evrotas minnow Pelasgus laconicus , which occupies aquatic ecosystems with extreme seasonal hydrological variation. The study of the embryonic and juvenile stages was conducted in vivo using light microscopy from eggs obtained from acclimatized wild spawners at 20 ± 1°C. Fertilized eggs were spherical and transparent with a mean diameter of 1.24 ± 0.06 mm and the average length of free embryos at hatching was 3.85 mm NL (notochord length). The main morphological changes observed are related to the absorption of the yolk, the increase and distribution of the melanophores and the sequential development of the fins. In conclusion, the Evrotas minnow was identified as a multiple spawner, exhibiting a protracted reproductive period (March to August), a particularly short egg‐hatching period (5–6 days), a short free embryo stage and a rapid onset of exogenous feeding (2 days). The conservation implications of our study, such as safety stock creation, population reintroduction, conservation of fish refugia and breeding habitats and beaver dam analogues, are discussed.",

In M. fuliginosus only the abdominal neuropodia bear hooded hooks, whereas in S. squamata these setae are present in both rami in the abdomen. Here every second seta (the capillary one) degenerates before its formation is complete, leading to a single row of hooded hooks. In the transverse rows new setae are formed in a medio‐lateral formative site in both species. Additionally in each ramus there exists one longitudinal row of capillaries which each possesses its own formative site. Ultrastructure and formation of the hooded hooks in S. squamata is very similar to that of hooded hooks in Capitellidae. The hood is preformed by a certain group of microvilli of the chaetoblast, which soon differentiates two layers of microvilli, raising an inner and an outer hood lamella. The hooded hooks and their arrangement are regarded as homologous characters in Spionidae and Capitellidae. This indicates a closer relationship of Spionidae with a taxon consisting of Capitellidae, Arenicolidae, Maldanidae, Oweniida, Terebellida, Sabellida, and Pogonophora.",

At first, small extensions of the cell membrane appear at the surface of the cell, more or less parallel to the cell surface. As they develop futher, they stand up, and amorphic material begins to appear between them. The extensions then become microvilli and obtain their final shape, with a small subdistal swelling and a narrower distal part. They are situated very regularly on the surface of the cell. After the microvilli have obtained their final form, material between them begins to get its final structure typical of the adult form. During the period when the mature orthonectid begins to leave the plasmodium and emerge from the host, the regular microvilli begin to disappear, and only small irregular extensions are present under the cuticle on the surface of the cell. During the process of cuticle formation a large amount of smooth endoplasmic reticulum develops in the cells, but once the cuticle is formed it gradually disappears.",

Many earlier opinions turned out to be quite contradictory, especially as concerns the morphological value of the anterior end appendages. In the present paper the microanatomy of the brain and the anterior ventral cord, as well as the innervation of, inter alia , the cephalic appendages, the nuchal organs and the alimentary canal of Eulalia viridis (main object of study), Eumida sanguinea, Pterocirrus macroceros, Sige fusigera, Eteone picta, E. foliosa, Phyllodoce groenlandica, P. longipes, P. mucosa, Paranaitis wahlbergi, Notophyllum foliosum and Nereiphylla lutea are described. The results are summarized in schematic diagrams and compared with corresponding observations on other polychaete families. Thereby, some earlier opinions about the nature of the cephalic appendages of the Phyllodocidae are strengthened while others are rejected. Most significantly, it is concluded that the so‐called ventrolateral antennae of phyllodocids are homologous with the palps of other polychaetes and the median antenna found in certain genera is homologous with the nuchal papilla found in most other genera of the family. These partly new or revised characters and character states formed the basis for a reconsideration of earlier ideas about the phylogeny of the Phyllodocidae: a new alternative.",

The deep‐sea juvenile asteroids of the NE Atlantic could be distinguished to species level from a very early stage of development. In all species, except Porcellanaster ceruleus and Plinthaster dentatus , the arms grow faster than the body. In Porcellanaster ceruleus and Plinthaster dentatus , early growth is nearly isometric. In the appearance of the epiproctal cone, the change in form of the furrow and apical spines, the early development of the cribriform organ adjacent to the madreporite and the appearance of sediment in the stomach indicate that Porcellanaster ceruleus is likely to undergo a shift in habitat and diet during the juvenile phase. Porcellanaster ceruleus is probably a predator on meiofauna and small macrofauna during the early stages of life, changing to a burrowing lifestyle ingesting sediment particles. Juvenile sea stars showed wider bathymetric distributions than their adult counterparts, suggesting that events occurring during the early stages of life are important for the maintenance of the local population structure and diversity in the deep NE Atlantic.",

Nine cell types were recognized: vacuolated cells, hyaline amoebocytes, small amoebocytes, granular amoebocytes, macrogranular cells, globular cells, lymphocyte‐like cells, large basophilic cells and large granular cells. Vacuolated cells were found to possess various numbers of vacuoles containing strongly electron‐dense materials and could be divided into at least three subgroups. Granular amoebocytes contained microfilaments and many granules of uniform size. Hyaline amoebocytes and small amoebocytes seemed to be specialized as phagocytes. Macrogranular cells and globular cells were not well characterized. In the blood of adult individuals, hemoblasts were rarely found, although lymphocyte‐like cells were present. Each of two large cells, large basophilic cells and large granular cells, possessed novel granules or vacuoles, whose functions remain to be elucidated.

In this study, we use a polyclonal antiserum directed against Reissner's substance to label non‐neuronal bipolar cells in the ectoneural part of the radial nerve cord in the sea star Asterias rubens . Ultrastructural results show secretory activity in these bipolar cells. Immunolabelled material is released into the extracellular matrix in the hyaline layer as well as in the region of the basal end‐feet. As a first step towards characterising the antigen, a specific protein band of 36 kD was demonstrated with immunoprecipitation. Cells of this type: (1) traverse the epithelium to full extent from the outer surface to the basal lamina; (2) carry a single apical cilium; (3) contain conspicuous bundles of intermediate filament; (4) produce a secretion which is, at least in part, homologous to the Reissner's substance which is produced by a primitive radial glia cell type in chordates. It is concluded that the bipolar cells in the ectoneural part of the surface epithelium of the sea star Asterias rubens are secretory radial glia, which evidently have a common origin to the radial glia which secretes Reissner's substance in chordates.",

The circumoral ciliary band is known to be innervated in part by fibres from the apical plate and adoral nerve centres. Within the band itself, however, the only neurones we could find were multipolar cells, an unusual cell type with apical processes that traverse the surface of the band. Similar cells occur in the circumoral bands of echinoderm larvae. The tornaria telotroch has a much larger nerve, but no neurones were found either in the band or nearby, so the source of the fibres in the telotroch nerve remains unknown. In addition to having different innervation, the two bands also respond differently to cholinergic agonists, which elicit telotroch arrests but have no visible effect on the circumoral band. The oesophagus has a well‐developed musculature and an extensive nerve plexus. During feeding, the oesophagus repeatedly contracts, forcing excess water out along two lateral channels prior to swallowing. These channels are also sites of gill slit formation, so there is evidently a continuity between the water bypass mechanism of the larva and that of the postmetamorphic juvenile.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study provides a new classification of shark pharyngeal muscles, leading to a re‐interpretation of the evolutionary history of these muscles. It begins with Edgeworth's developmental classification but also incorporates phylogenetic and functional information. The two basic groups of pharyngeal muscles are (1) branchial (including deep interbranchials and superficial constrictors) and (2) spinal (including epaxial and hypobranchial muscles). Most of the branchial muscles are also present anteriorly in the mandibular and hyoid segments, indicating that these were once typical branchial segments. The extrabranchial cartilages and gill septa are used as landmarks for dividing the interbranchials from the superficial constrictors. These landmarks reveal that the most important expiratory muscles in the anterior pharynx (most parts of “constrictor hyoideus”, interhyoideus, levator palatoquadrati, spiracularis, and intermandibularis) are actually enlarged interbranchial muscles that have taken on a surface location. “Shrinking” these enlarged interbranchials and returning them to a deep location produces a simple, metameric reconstruction of the pre‐gnathostome pharynx that fits what is known about thelodonts and other fossil agnatha related to gnathostomes. Finally, the pharyngeal muscles of bony fishes are considered, and concluded to have evolved from a sharklike condition through an acanthodian‐like intermediate. © 1997 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Special attention was paid to the mechanisms of acquisition of nutrient, organelle differentiation, yolk formation and relationships between oocyte and its complex investment. In the gonadal blastema of young buds, small oocytes are recognized early, partially covered by a few primary follicle cells, the presumptive source of all the cellular envelopes of the fully grown oocyte. Some oocytes are seen in the zygotene–pachytene phase, characterized by synaptonemal complexes, but most are found at the end of the diplotene, when oocytes commonly stop meiosis, grow and migrate through blood vessels into blastozooids of successive generations. In laboratory animals, only 1–3 oocytes per blastozooid can reach complete maturity. Detailed observations on the time of appearance and development of organelles, microvilli and endocytotic activity in growing oocytes are also reported. Ultrastructural differentiation and the relationships between oocytes and their envelopes all indicate that both auto– and hetero–synthetic mechanisms for yolk formation occur in B. schlosseri. These mechanisms and the possible role of egg envelopes in the process are discussed, comparing the large yolky eggs of B. schlosseri with those of solitary species.",

Larvae have not previously been described for any species in the large genus Microcosmus. Besides a difference in size (larvae of H. momus are about 40% larger than those of M. exasperatus ), larvae of the two species differ primarily in the number and arrangement of sensory structures. Both species possess a well‐developed statocyte but only H. momus has an ocellus. The absence of an ocellus in M. exasperatus is unique among pyurid ascidians. An auxiliary vesicle was found situated on the left side of the cerebral vesicle in both species. However, unlike the larvae of H. momus and other pyurid species, there is no apparent communication between the auxiliary and cerebral vesicles of M. exasperatus. Epithelial cells in the auxiliary vesicles of both species carry modified cilia about 2 μm in diameter; auxiliary vesicles of H. momus also have simple cilia with axonemes in a 9 + 0 microtubule configuration. In H. momus the membranes of the epithelial cells are highly convoluted and extend into the lumen of the auxiliary vesicle. Morphological arrangements of auxiliary vesicles and globular cilia reported so far in ascidian tadpoles are contrasted and discussed.",

A comparison of the microstructure of the encrusting sponges Dysidea avara (Dendroceratida) and Crambe crambe (Poecilosclerida) is performed. The species co‐occur in sublittoral habitats of the western Mediterranean. Histological techniques, image analysis and corrosion castings are used in order to quantify thickness, degree of development of the aquiferous system, relative amount of structural and cellular materials, and size of the choanocyte chambers in both species. The fine structure and cellular types are described and analysed through SEM/TEM. These sponges are known to feature contrasting ecological strategies: D. avara has higher growth and clearance rates than C. crambe , it is more susceptible to predation and uses a more opportunistic strategy of space acquisition and maintenance. C. crambe grows slowly, it is chemically protected from predation and it competes successfully for space with other invertebrates. These differences in biological strategies are here shown to have clear structural correlates: D. avara is structurally simpler, with fewer cell types and very scarce matrix material. Most of its section is occupied by the highly developed aquiferous system. Its construction is much looser than in C. crambe . In the latter species, structural complexity is higher, it produces long‐lasting structures such as the spicules, and it is more compact and thinner. It is concluded that there is wide scope for microarchitectural patterns, even in species with similar growth form, and that structural and cytological characters may prove to be useful descriptors of biological strategies in sponges.",

Comparisons with other bufonids and with outgroup taxa suggest that the following chondrocranial characters may represent synapomorphies for the Bufonidae: free (or absent) ceratobranchial IV, a reduced or absent larval crista parotica, the lack of a larval otic process, and late development of thin, poorly chondrified orbital cartilages. The presence of an elongated processus anterior dorsalis of the suprarostral alae and the absence of a chondrified commissura quadratoorbitalis appear to be unique in Melanophryniscus among bufonids.

    "abstract": "Abstract The spermatogenesis of the free‐living marine nematode Metachromadora itoi was studied with electron microscopy. Spermatocytes and early spermatids have no cytoplasmic components specific for nematodes, i.e. membranous organelles (MO) and fibrous bodies (FB). The late spermatids are subdivided into the residual body and the main cell body with a centrally located nucleus devoid of a nuclear envelope. A pair of 9 × 2 centrioles is associated with the nuclei of spermatids and spermatozoa. The nucleus of the mature spermatid is surrounded by a thick mass of radially arranged FB delimited externally by a discontinuous layer of mitochondria, which underlie a thin ectoplasm. Sperm development is accompanied by transfer of FB matter through the mitochondrion layer into the ectoplasm. The immature spermatozoa from the testis have the centrally located nucleus surrounded by a transparent halo with remnants of FB. The halo is delimited by a sphere of mitochondria that underlie the thick fibrous ectoplasm, a derivative of the FB. In the mature spermatozoa the ectoplasm is transformed into the prominent unpolarized pseudopod. The central nucleus is surrounded by a transparent halo and a sphere of mitochondria, which underlie the pseudopod. MO were not found throughout spermatogenesis . In general, spermatogenesis in M. itoi differs from that observed in many nematodes but resembles in some details the sperm development in some chromadorid and tylenchomorph nematodes. The phylogenetic importance of this sperm development is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pit organs (free neuromasts of the mechanosensory lateral line system) are distributed over the skin of elasmobranchs. To investigate phylogenetic trends in the distribution and abundance of pit organs, 12 relevant morphological characters were added to an existing matrix of morphological data (plus two additional end terminals), which was then re‐analysed using cladistic parsimony methods ( paup * 4.0b10). Character transformations were traced onto the most parsimonious phylogenetic trees. The results suggest the following interpretations. First, the distinctive overlapping denticles covering the pit organs in many sharks are a derived feature; plesiomorphic elasmobranchs have pit organs in open slits, with widely spaced accessory denticles. Second, the number of pit organs on the ventral surface of rays has been reduced during evolution, and third, spiracular pit organs have changed position or have been lost on several occasions in elasmobranch evolution. The concentrated‐changes test in macclade (version 4.05) was used to investigate the association between a pelagic lifestyle and loss of spiracular pit organs (the only character transformation that occurred more than once within pelagic taxa). Depending on the choice of tree, the association was either nonsignificant at P = 0.06 or significant at P &lt; 0.05. Future studies, using species within more restricted elasmobranch clades, are needed to resolve this issue.",

The main cutting action appears to result from a scissoring movement brought about by the rapid interlocking of the three sharp and stout cusps of the transverse lingual lamina with large grooves on the rear face of the supraoral lamina. The movement of excised flesh back through the oral passage to the pharynx would be facilitated by the action of the pair of strongly cuspid longitudinal lingual laminae. The unique oral disc teeth of G. australis are apparently adapted to allow the disc to slide forward over the host and yet restrict any tendency to slip backwards.",

The unique combination of primitive and advanced features as well as specific peculiarities (e.g. neural sexual dimorphism) prevents an inclusion of Melanodrymia aurantiaca in any of the known archaeogastropod groups.

The wheel organ cells are tall and strongly ciliated and have dark, heterochromatin‐rich nuclei. Dorsally, and slightly paramedially, the organ is further specialized, forming the so‐called Hatschek's groove (pit), which consists of two ciliated cell types. The first type synthesizes a dense granular material, the granules being approximately 95 nm in diameter. This is stored basally and apparently it is also released through the basal cell membrane into the blood cavities. The cells at the bottom of Hatschek's groove have peculiar rod‐shaped apical cellular regions. Each cell bears one tall cilium surrounded by microvilli and it is apparently involved in the production of secretory material into the groove. It is evident that the histology, and probably also the function, of the wheel organ and its groove is much more complex than hitherto believed.",

The ovary is the place where oocytes mature, embedded in a supporting tissue composed of two cell types: somacells 1 and somacells 2. The lyrate organ has a nutrimentary function and is comprised of two components: supporting cells and nutritive tissue. The supporting cells are similar to the somacells 2 in that they contain abundant microtubules. The nutritive tissue is an extensive syncytium. It is connected with the oocytes via intercellular bridges, the nutritive cords. Oocytes and nutritive tissue are thought to have derived from common stem cells. From fine structural evidence it is concluded that ribosomes are one of the most important components to be transported via the nutritive cords into the oocytes. However, an increase in number of mitochondria in the middle‐stage oocytes may also be a consequence of transport of these organelles from the nutritive tissue into the oocytes. Further characteristics make plausible that the interdependences of oocytes and nutritive tissue are comparable to those found in meroistic ovarioles of insects. The somatic components do not seem to be as important as the follicle cells of insects, however. It is assumed that the evolution of a nutrimentary oogenesis speeds up embryogenesis. Thus, the differentiation of the female gonad of Varroa jacobsoni may have facilitated the species' adaptation to a development completed in a short and limited time within the shelter of the covered brood cell of the bee.",

In each reproductive phase, testicular responsiveness to subjected photoperiods was determined by comparing the gonadal status in corresponding groups of control or natural photoperiodic fish. The values of testicular weight, gametogenic index, as well as testicular activity of two steroidogenic enzymes (Δ 5 3β‐, and 17β‐hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), and the serum titre of testosterone were considered as the indices of functional status of the testis in the fish concerned. During the prespawning phase, exposure of fish to a daily long photoperiod schedule resulted in precocious maturation of testis, while retardation of testicular growth was noted under the influences of short photoperiod. However, none of the employed photo‐schedules could influence the gametogenic and steroidogenic functions of the testis in the remaining part of the gonadal cycle. Collectively, the present study provides evidence for the first time that in the case of a commercially important carp, Catla catla , artificial, long photoperiods may be used for advanced testicular maturation, while reductions in maturation‐associated growth and deterioration in flesh quality may be avoided by submitting the fish to shorter day lengths during the prespawning phase of the reproductive cycle.",

Their fate within the brain was followed autoradiographically. Especially after injection of 3 H‐noradrenaline, considerable amounts of radioactive material were found closely associated with the liquor fibre (Reissner's fibre; LF) which is produced by the subcommissural organ. In frogs which survived 3 or 12 hours after injection, the association of radioactive material with the LF appeared to be restricted mainly to the cerebral ventricles, whereas in frogs which survived 24 hours, the radioactivity associated with the LF was most abundant well into the central canal of the spinal cord. The results indicate that the LF is able to pick up, from the cerebrospinal fluid, and bind certain catecholaminergic substances (especially noradrenaline, but not dopamine) and/or their metabolites by rather strong binding forces. The attached material is then transported by the LF into the central canal of the spinal cord, with its practically stagnant fluid content. These results confirm data known from the literature. which are indicative of the LF being involved in regulation of the composition of the fluid within the central canal, e.g. by providing this canal with catecholaminergic substances and/or by removing them from it.",

Both average absolute and relative fecundities estimated for A. antennatus were statistically higher than those estimated for A. foliacea ; the average absolute fecundity of A. foliacea was 151 936 oocytes/female and that of A. antennatus was 200 472 oocytes/female and the average relative fecundity of A. foliacea was 5477 oocytes/g and that of A. antennatus was 9386 oocytes/g. Fecundity in both red shrimp species is linearly related to carapace length, body and gonad weight, although, the most precise estimation is provided by the relationship of body weight and fecundity. In the present study, the oocyte size (diameter, volume) of both species could be considered very large. In conclusion, A. foliacea shows lower fecundity than A. antennatus , having a lower ovogenetic activity, but it produces larger oocytes. This is in accordance with the highest value of the gonad weight and gonad volume of A. foliacea exhibited in relation to A. antennatus .",

The latter extend between the granulated cells and often form a layer beneath the capsule and at the zone of contact between adenohypophysis and neurohypophysis. Study of cultured hypophysial tissue provides unequivocal evidence for the phagocytosis of cytoplasm of granulated cells by non-granulated cells. In short-term cultures (1.5 h), non-granulated cells envelop small portions of granulated cell cytoplasm and their processes extend into intercellular spaces and contact tissue fragments located there. In longer term cultures (6—120 h), large areas of cytoplasm belonging to presumptive prolactin and somatotropic cells are engulfed by non-granulated cells; these phagosomes undergo progressive breakdown to form residual bodies. It is suggested that an accumulation of cellular debris and/or stale secretory material may be important factors promoting phagocytic activity in cultured non-granulated cells.",

Myochamid spermatozoa are considerably less modified than those of the Lyonsiidae or Laternulidae, and may prove a basal type within the non‐septibranch anomalodesmatans. In contrast, C. latesulcata differs from other examined anomalodesmatans in having an anterior acrosomal complex and radial midpiece mitochondria (classic aquasperm features). Sperm data for the Anomalodesmata are limited but congruent with the most recent phylogenetic analyses that recognize distinct ‘thraciid’ and ‘lyonsiid’ clades.

The total gill area, expressed in terms of body weight, of both larval (1462–2717 mm2 g–1) and adult (1402–2337 mm2 g–1) L. fluviatilis are greater than those previously recorded in the rather meagre literature on lamprey gill measurements and are comparable with those found in the most active teleosts. The gills of the two Lampetra species are apparently identical in the larval stages and those of metamorphosing and adult L. planeri are similar to those of metamorphosing L. fluviatilis. Although the pharyngeal arrangement of lampreys differs greatly from that of teleosts, there are many features of the gills indicative of convergence between the two groups. Thus, in a given stage in the life cycle of lampreys, the secondary lamellae on either side of the filaments also alternate, become more widely spaced as the filament length increases and increase in area as the body weight becomes greater. Furthermore, the fractional cumulative increase in secondary lamellae area along a line following the presumed direction of water flow is also represented by a sigmoid curve. While at metamorphosis the pharynx becomes considerably modified to accommodate the change from a unidirectional to a tidal respiratory water flow, the total gill areas of the ammocoete are similar to those of metamorphosing stages which have attained adult characteristics. However, there are clearly differences in some of the components that influence and contribute towards the total gill area. Thus, in terms of body weight, the number and total length of the filaments and the total number of secondary lamellae, together with the number of secondary lamellae found on a given distance of filament, are greater in late metamorphosing stages, while the reverse is true for the average bilateral area of the secondary lamellae which is considerably greater in ammocoetes.",

In Myxine circifrons the well developed valve is supposed to act alone, whereas the smaller valve in the two species of Eptatretus studied is supposed to act together with the horizontal extensions of the median olfactory lamina. No significant differences were found between the investigated species by ultrastructural examination. In the olfactory epithelium the supporting cells are provided with microvilli and generally contain a great amount of light secretory granules. Both ciliated olfactory receptor cells and microvillous olfactory receptor cells are present. The cilia show a 9 + 0 arrangement of the microtubules with a tendency for a dislocation of one pair of the microtubules toward the center of the cilium. These remarkable features of the olfactory receptor cells, not yet seen in other vertebrates, appear to be a character common to the myxinoid cyclostomes.",

The Pseudomyrmex spermatozoa are long and slender with similar morphology. The head region has an acrosome and a nucleus. In all the studied species, two morphologically distinct types of acrosomal vesicles were observed, a long structure, as observed in all known ants, and a pear‐shaped one, never before observed in ants. The nucleus is elongated and both condensed and loose chromatin are present. The flagellum has an axoneme, a centriolar adjunct, two mitochondrial derivatives and two accessory bodies. The centriolar, the mitochondrial derivatives and the accessory bodies are similar to observations in most ant species that have been studied. The axoneme presents an uncommon 9 + 9 + 1 microtubule arrangement and the central microtubule has 13 protofilaments. The acrosomal dimorphism and the different levels of chromatin organization are exclusive characteristics of Pseudomyrmex . Furthermore, the 9 + 9 + 1 microtubule arrangement is different from all Hymenoptera, as well as from most insects, which present a 9 + 9 + 2 arrangement. These new morphological characters that are specific to Pseudomyrmex , are valuable synapomorphies of the genus and can be used in taxonomic characterization of the Pseudomyrmecinae subfamily and in phylogenetic analyses in Formicidae family.",

The mandibular stream appeared well developed in R. temporaria at a time when the embryo was still spherical, the neural folds were elevated, and the neural plate was wide open, thus earlier than known from any frog species so far. The appearance of the second stream and its division into hyoid and branchial portions was clearly accelerated in R. temporaria relative to other embryonic events when compared to S. nigrovittata . For example, in R. temporaria , the hyoid and branchial portions of the cranial neural crest cell streams were separated before the neural folds had started to fuse, whereas in S. nigrovittata this event took place only after the neural folds had fused completely. Such ostentatious heterochronies related to the characters used herein have formerly only been reported from comparisons between species belonging to different higher taxa.

The investigation of two species of the subfamily Lampyrinae, Aspisoma maculatum and Photinus sp. (aff. pyralis ), showed the diploid number 2 n = 19 and an X0 sex determination system in males. These observations are similar to those already described for all the Lampyrinae species previously studied. In contrast, Bicellonycha lividipennis (Photurinae) revealed the karyotype 2 n = 16 + neoXY, which has not yet been registered for any firefly species. The neoXY sex determination system encountered in this species probably arose through fusion between an ancestral X sex chromosome, belonging to the X0 system, and an autosomal element. This event also reduced the diploid number from 2 n = 19, which is more frequent in the family Lampyridae, to 2 n = 18 in B. lividipennis . The analysis of meiotic cells showed that the neoXY sexual bivalent of B. lividipennis exhibited a prominent terminal chiasma, indicating that the sex chromosomes are not wholly differentiated and still retain a region of homology. A review of the cytogenetic data known for the family Lampyridae was also documented in this work, as well as a discussion on the main trends of chromosomal evolution that seem to have occurred in this group.",

Sexual dimorphism in Leptodactylus latinasus (Anura, Leptodactylidae): nasal capsule anatomy, morphometric characters and performance associated with burrowing behavior. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 57–67. In anurans, the ability to burrow has been associated with the characteristics of external morphology, with modifications in the musculoskeletal system and even in some brain regions. Male Leptodactylus fuscus construct subterranean chambers with the snout, where the eggs are deposited and early larval stages develop. Leptodactylus latinasus , a member of the L. fuscus group, is a good model to test the relationship among digging behavior of males, sexual divergence in the morphology of the nasal region, cranial‐dimensions, and performance as digger. The goal of this work is to provide a detailed morphological description of the olfactory region, which allows detecting sexually dimorphic characters, to evaluate sexual divergence with head dimension data, and to test whether differences exist in the digging performance of each sex. Our data do not clearly indicate sexual dimorphism in head size, nasal region morphology or digging performance that can be linked with the burrowing behavior. Thus, the only unequivocal sexually dimorphic character associated with the construction of the nuptial chamber by males would be the rigid, chisel‐like snout, present exclusively in males.",

In the hindlimb, the femur is small and slender, and articulates distally with a series of ossified amorphous and extremely reduced elements that correspond to a fibula, tibia and proximal and distal tarsals 4 and 3. The pelvic girdle consists of ischium, pubis and ilium, but its two halves are widely separated; the ilium is the least reduced element. We describe the ossification and development during postnatal skeletal ontogeny, especially of epiphyseal secondary centres, ossifications of carpal elements, apophyseal ossifications and sesamoids. Compared to other squamates, B. bicolor shows an overall reduction in limb size, an absence of skeletal elements, a fusion of carpal elements, an early differentiation of apophyseal centres, and a low number of sesamoids and apophyseal centres. These observations suggest that the reductions are produced by heterochronic changes during postnatal development and probably during embryonic development; therefore the appendicular skeleton exhibits a pattern of paedomorphic features.",

The traces include evidence of parasitic fixation and penetration as well as dwelling traces. Pathologies are developed as (1) round fossulae on the external surface of bones and scales; (2) oval fossulae with a slight elevation in the centre of the pit; (3) hollow swellings (possible galls); (4) openings (perforations) that have been repaired to various degrees; (5) variously shaped buttresses on the visceral surface of sarcopterygian scales; and (6) porous spongy formations on the non‐overlapped surface of sarcopterygian scales. The round fossulae in sarcopterygian, placoderm and psammosteid skeletal elements could be produced by parasites that are similar to copepod crustaceans. Gall formation in Asterolepis is most likely to be caused by a larva, possibly of a trematode. The perforations of scales (and dermal bones) might arise from the attacks of ectoparasites (copepods?) or different worms. The spongy formations on the Holoptychius scales could be the result of invasion of a unicellular parasite.",

In this contribution, we review recent attempts to contribute phylogenetic information on the Chaetognatha by analysing structure and development of their nervous system (neurophylogeny). Analysing this group of organisms also has a major impact on our understanding of nervous system evolution in Bilateria. We review recent evidence from this field and suggest that Urbilateria already was equipped with the genetic toolkit required to build a complex, concentrated central nervous system (CNS), although this was not expressed phenotypically so that Urbilateria was equipped with a nerve plexus and not a CNS. This implies that in the deep metazoan nodes, concentration of the ancestral plexus occurred twice independently, namely once after the protostome–deuterostome split on the branch leading to the protostomes (resulting in a ventrally positioned nerve cord) and once along the chordate line (with a dorsal nerve cord).",

Acetylcholinesterase activity in the developing and regenerating nervous system of the acoel Symsagittifera roscoffensis. —Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 92: 383–392. The use of the cholinergic system is widespread in the animal kingdom. It controls different processes, including reproduction and neural transmission. However, its evolutionary history is not yet well understood. For instance, the role played by the cholinergic system in the nervous system of basal bilaterian taxa, where the first signs of architectural complexity appear, is still unknown. Here, we describe the structure of the cholinergic system during the development and regeneration of the acoel flatworm Symsagittifera roscoffensis, using acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity as a marker. In this species, AchE activity is observed at all developmental stages, including in the early embryos. The juvenile and adult patterns reveal the presence of a complex nervous system that includes three pairs of longitudinal neurite bundles, which are connected to an anterior centralized mass of neurons and neural processes formed by two pairs of connectives and four commissures. The power of the technique also allows the detection of newly born neurons as they are incorporated into the growing nervous system (during regeneration).",

At this time, the lateral margins of the AER convert to the fin fold leading to subsequent development of the dermal fin skeleton. Thorogood's (1991 ) fin fold model predicts that the AER should persist longer in Neoceratodus than it does in actinopterygians because of the comparatively extensive endochondral skeleton in lungfish. While the AER does persist into early chondrogenesis and is extended compared to actinopterygians (lost before fin radial chondrogenesis) it does not persist into further stages of chondrogenesis, providing partial support for Thorogood's model. Fgf8 appears in the lungfish fin epithelium during the initial period of fin outgrowth before a physical AER forms, when Fgf8 is restricted to the AER plus the preaxial and postaxial epithelium immediately adjacent to the AER. Fgf8 is no longer detected after the AER is replaced by a fin fold. Neoceratodus appears to provide a halfway point between ray fins and limbs during very early development as Thorogood proposed, but not precisely for the reasons his model suggests.",

The scorpionflies are considered as ideal model animals for the study of mating systems in insects. The males generally offer both prey and salivary mass as nuptial gifts to the females during copulation. Our field observations show that Panorpa liui is peculiar because the males offer only prey rather than salivary secretions as nuptial gift. Through anatomical and histological examinations, the salivary glands of P. liui were found to be devoid of sexual dimorphism in Panorpa for the first time. Both the male and female P. liui bear simple salivary glands, which are only composed of a common duct and two short sac-like glands. This is the first attempt to explore the relationship between the salivary glands and the mating tactics from the structural aspect in Panorpa, speculating that the simple structure of the male salivary glands in P. liui might be responsible for its failing to produce salivary mass as a nuptial gift during copulation. Compared with Boreidae, Meropidae, Bittacidae and Panorpidae, we presume that the absence of sexual dimorphism of the salivary glands might represent a plesiomorphy in P. liui. The origin and evolutionary process of the nuptial gift behaviour are tentatively speculated in Panorpa.",

Two hundred and ninety seven nests were obtained. They were constructed more often during the summer (from December to April). The nests were built only in araucaria forest and consisted of a linear series of cells, divided by mud partitions, whose number varied from 1 to 7. Normally they have only one vestibular cell. The inner cells had been provisioned, usually with spiders of Anyphaenidae family. Sex‐ratio was strongly female biased. Its main natural enemies included Chrysididae, Ichneumonidae and Tachinidae.",

The specimen displays an elasmobranch‐like braincase, but lacks unambiguous elasmobranch and even chondrichthyan characters, although its peculiar tooth‐bearing ‘labial’ elements evoke certain stem‐holocephalans. Its endoskeletal elements seem lined with either perichondral bone or non‐prismatic calcified cartilage, but show no evidence of endochondral bone. Although devoid of large dermal bones and scales, R. boliviana shares with certain ‘ostracoderms’, placoderms and holocephalans the lack of an otico‐occipital fissure, but lacks a hypophysial fenestra. Certain features (elongated braincase, ‘labial elements’, sharp denticles and teeth) are also suggestive of the equally enigmatic coeval stensioellids, once regarded as either primitive placoderms or stem holocephalans. The jaws are armed with platelets that bear blunt to pointed and sharp teeth, in which synchrotron radiation microtomography yields evidence of a large pulp cavity, a possibly osteichthyan‐like character. No character clearly supports affinities of R. boliviana to any of the currently known major gnathostome groups. Tenuous hints suggest a relationship to the enigmatic fossil Zamponiopteron , from the Eifelian of Bolivia, known by peculiar calcified ‘fin plates’ and isolated shoulder girdles.",

They exhibit the iniopterygian synapomorphy of dorsolaterally placed pectoral fins. They also display a laterally compressed head and body, a homocercal tail, and a single aspinous dorsal fin originating at approximately mid‐body. These taxa differ in upper dental elements, bony cranial plates, body squamation, buccopharyngeal denticles, cranial linking cartilages, palatoquadrate shape, pterygoid articulation, pectoral axis and pectoral girdle shape, and in the robustness of branchial and suprascapular cartilages. The neurocranium is unique among known chondrichthyans in presenting anterior ethmosphenoid and posterior otico‐occipital units separated by an intracranial joint. A complete otico‐occipital fissure is found posteriorly. One to two pairs of upper parasymphysial whorls and one median lower premandibular symphysial whorl are present. Symphysial whorls were mobile and the cranial complex appears to have been kinetic.

The range of morphology within known iniopterygians supports rapid diversification and niche specialization in this group of atypical chondrichthyans.",

The new binomen Baphetes orientalis is created for a skull referred to Baphetes bohemicus by later authors. A previously undescribed baphetid specimen from Nýřany is referred to B. orientalis despite differences in skull proportions. It comprises a skull in dorsal aspect, mandibles and some associated postcranial elements. The skull possesses sclerotic ring elements within the orbital region of the dorsal fenestration of the skull, confirming the eye location. The elongate gastralia are arranged perpendicular to the interclavicle edge in contrast to the condition in temnospondyls and colosteids. Cladistic analysis of 24 characters of 11 baphetoids was carried out using Acanthostega and Crassigyrinus as outgroups. Eucritta was the most primitive baphetoid, with Spathicephalus being the sister‐taxon to the remaining taxa, justifying a monotypic Spathicephalidae as a sister‐taxon to the Baphetidae. The Baphetidae are divided into a subfamily Baphetinae nom.nov. containing two Baphetes species; and a subfamily Loxommatinae with Loxomma as a paraphyletic grade leading to a Megalocephalus + Kyrinion clade. The Linton taxon ‘ Baphetes ’ lintonensis is transferred to the genus Loxomma to give the new combination Loxomma lintonensis .",

Gonads of males and females of the mangrove tree crab Aratus pisonii (Grapsidae: Brachyura: Decapoda): a histological and histochemical view. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00 :1–9. This study describes the microscopic anatomy of the male and female gonads and the spermatogenesis and oogenesis of the mangrove tree crab Aratus pisonii . Males and females were captured in a mangrove marsh in Guaratiba (23°04′S, 44°10′W), Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The testes are composed of spermatogonia I (7.82 ± 0.84 μm), spermatogonia II (6.12 ± 0.72 μm), spermatocytes I (5.62 ± 0.71 μm), spermatocytes II (5.00 ± 0.42 μm), spermatids (4.01 ± 0.33 μm), and spermatozoa (2.58 ± 0.18 μm). The spermatozoids are sent to the vas deferens, which is divided into three regions: anterior vas deferens, middle vas deferens and posterior vas deferens. There are no indications of development as the production of male gametes was continuous throughout the study period. In the females, there are four ovary development stages: previtellogenesis, early‐stage vitellogenesis, mature vitellogenesis, and postspawning. Five types of cells were found in the gonads: oogonia (5.23 ± 1.31 μm), oocytes in early development (19.84 ± 5.16 μm), previtellogenic oocytes (49.49 ± 6.87 μm), vitellogenic oocytes (87.51 ± 10.23 μm), and mature oocytes (174.78 ± 29.46 μm). The findings of this study indicate that A. pisonii females lay eggs on multiple occasions throughout the study period.",

Ultrastructure of the mycangium of the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae): Complex morphology for complex interactions. —Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00:1–9. The southern pine beetle (SPB) (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann) is the most economically important pest of southern pine forests. Beetles carry fungal cells within specialised cuticular structures, called mycangia. Little is known about the mycangia ultrastructure or function. We used cryo-fracturing and scanning electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructural features of SPB mycangia and surrounding tissues. Mycangia, one on each side of anterior portion of the prothorax, are terminated on the dorsal side at a ‘mycangial bridge’. This sclerotised mycangial bridge does not appear to provide a passage between the two mycangia, suggesting that each mycangium functions independently. Mycangia are surrounded by abundant tracheoles connecting the structures to the outside via openings within the prothorax. Previously unknown pits overlying the mycangial gland cells were also observed in both the inner wall and anterior fold of prothorax. We hypothesise that these openings and pits may play roles in determining which fungi enter, and grow within, the mycangium.",

In this study, the reproductive tract of the Cardisoma guanhumi was described both macroscopically and microscopically. The maturation stages of the reproductive system were defined, and the development of germ cells was described. The reproductive tract is made up of a pair of testis, a pair of vas deferentia, and a pair of ejaculatory ducts. The germ cells were classified in the order of development as spermatogonia (diameter: 10.5 ± 0.11 μm), spermatocytes (9.7 ± 0.07 μm), spermatids (initial phase: 5.5 ± 0.06 μm; final phase: 4.3 ± 0.05), and spermatozoa (SPZ) (4.0 ± 0.03 μm). The testis is made up of a germ zone, a maturation zone and collector ducts, which lead to the anterior vas deferens (AVD), containing solely SPZ. The spermatophores (SPH) start to be formed in the AVD, through the secretion of spermatophoric and protein matrices. In the median vas deferens, the SPH, already fully formed, are stored, while in the posterior vas deferens, a large production of a glycoprotein matrix is observed. Based on macroscopic and microscopic description of the male reproductive tract, three maturation stages are proposed: immature, maturing, and mature.",

This study uses scanning electron microscopies to investigate and describe the microstructural diversity of dermal denticles in the family Sphyrnidae, which comprises all living hammerhead shark species, comparing them to other related taxa (i.e. Carcharhinus dussumieri , Carcharhinus plumbeus , Carcharhinus acronotus , Rhizoprionodon acutus , Negaprion brevirostris and Hemigaleus microstoma ). The results reveal that sphyrnids present noticeable microstructures in the dermal denticles, distinguishing them from the other related species investigated. Additionally, scale patterns are the same in three distinct body regions (i.e. cephalic, branchial and dorsal fin). Species of Sphyrnidae that reach bigger total lengths and that are widely distributed (i.e. Sphyrna lewini and Sphyrna mokarran ) presented more, smaller and nearly hexagonal microstructures that do not cover the entire scale surface, unlike species reaching smaller sizes and restricted to coastal habits (i.e. Sphyrna tiburo , Sphyrna tudes , Sphyrna media and Eusphyra blochii ). The sphyrnid scales are similar to R. acutus and C. dussumieri rather than to the other species, but it is not possible to identify the sphyrnid species only by scale features. It is clear that a similar morphology of scales is not necessarily related to similar life habits, and that they are candidates to provide new characters in phylogenetical studies among sphyrnids.",

In this work, morphology of two types of spermatozoa produced by L argus rufipennis was reported for the first time in the L argidae family. For this, techniques including optical and transmission electron microscopy were used. Spermatozoa measured, on the average, 260 and 200 μm, and both types possessed a nucleus measuring on the average 65 μm. No ultrastructural differences were observed between the two spermatozoa types from L . rufipennis . The head region is composed of an acrosome, a nucleus, and part of the centriolar adjunct. The centriolar adjunct is in parallel with the nucleus and followed by mitochondrial derivates. The flagellum consists of an axoneme (9 + 9 + 2 microtubules) and two mitochondrial derivatives; no other accessory bodies were observed. The mitochondrial derivatives are symmetric in size and diameter. A similar quantity of the two spermatozoa types was observed in the seminal vesicle (57% of the large type and 43% of the small type), while in the spermatheca of the female, the larger spermatozoa were preferentially stored (87%). These results permit discussions concerning of the species biology reproduction, most specifically sperm competition strategies.",

A new species of cheilostome bryozoan, Reteporella rosjoarum sp. n., belonging to the family of Phidoloporidae is described from the Weddell Sea (Antarctica) and illustrated with binocular microscope and SEM micrographs. SEM has been used to observe the essential characters to describe the new species and to compare it to similar species. Three samples from three different stations were collected at 332–597 m depth during the ANT XXI/2 cruise of the R/V Polarstern (AWI, Bremerhaven, Germany) using a bottom trawl. The new species is characterized by the presence of giant vicarious spherical avicularia. The distinctive morphology of these avicularia discriminates this species from Antarctica congeners. The variability in avicularian morphometrics demonstrates that intraspecific variation between localities (Austasen and Drescher Inlet) may exist. It is also interesting to relate the morphology of the avicularia with the possible functions in Cheilostomata.",

For that, tissue samples from different regions of the ovary at various stages of maturation were subjected to light and electron microscopy, and based on the changes revealed and the differences in ovarian morphology, the ovary was divided into five stages such as immature (previtellogenic oocytes), early maturing (early vitellogenic oocytes), late maturing (late vitellogenic oocytes), mature (vitellogenic oocytes), and spent (resorbing oocytes). The ovarian wall comprised of an outermost thin pavement epithelium, a middle layer of connective tissue, and an innermost layer of germinal epithelium. The oocytes matured as they moved from the centrally placed germinal zone toward the ovarian wall. The peripheral arrangement of nucleolar materials and the high incidence of cell organelles during the initial stages indicated vitellogenesis I. Movement of follicle cells toward oocytes in the early maturing stage and low incidence of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum in the ooplasm during late vitellogenic stage marked the commencement and end of vitellogenesis II, respectively. Yolk granules at various stages of development were seen in the ooplasm from late vitellogenic stage onwards. The spent ovary had an area with resorbing oocytes and empty follicle cells denoting the end of one reproductive cycle and another area with oogonial cells and previtellogenic oocytes indicating the beginning of the next.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The embryonic osteocranium of the elapid snake, Naja haje (Egyptian cobra) has been studied. The osteocranium of the 166‐mm embryo has been graphically reconstructed and described in detail. Those of younger and older embryos as well as the just‐hatched young have been also investigated. The membrane‐bones make their appearance before any sign of ossification in the cartilaginous cranium. The maxillary, palatine and pterygoid premordia have an earlier appearance than the other bony premordia. The fused premaxillae arise beneath the antero‐medial part of the solum nasi of the nasal capsules. They send dorsally the rudiment of the processus nasalis and posteriorly two small processes. The nasal develops as a protecting bony roof for the cartilaginous nasal capsule. It possesses a median descending portion which penetrates deeply between the capsules. The frontal arises at first over the fenestra olfactoria advehens and the planum antorbitale, then extends posterioly. Its median descending portion has not yet ossified. The prefrontal embraces the posterolateral surface of the nasal capsule. It is perforated by the foramen of the lacrymo‐nasal duct, the lacrymal bone is completely absent. The parietal is very long forming the incomplete roof and the side wall of the temporal region. It is quite apart from the frontal. The cranial roof between the two frontals and two parietals is bridged by connective tissue. Both the frontal and parietal bones form well developed lateral down‐growths. The postfrontal is present, lying just lateral to the anterior part of the descending process of the parietal, but the postorbital is completely lacking. There is only one temporal bone which is regarded as the supra‐temporal. This bone arises just lateral to the auditory capsule, its posterior part is intercalated between the quadrate and the capsule. The squamosal, tabular, jugal and quadratojugal are totally absent. The maxilla arises directly below the anterior half of the eye. It sends inwards a well developed palatal process. The rudiments of the maxillary teeth, including those of the poisonous fangs, have not yet been attached to the bone. The prevomer forms the medial wall and floor of the bony capsule which surrounds Jacobson's organ. It consists of a medial portion which extends nearly vertically and a ventral one which extends horizontally. The septomaxilla forms the lateral wall and a part of the floor of Jacobson's organ bony capsule. It possesses a very long posterior projection. The palatine arises medial to the maxilla, posteriorly it is about to touch the anterior tip of the pterygoid. The pterygoid is very long, occupying about half the total length of the palate. Both the palatine and pterygoid carry teeth which have not yet been completely attached to the bones. The ectopterygoid arises lateral to the hind extremity of the palatine and the anterior half of the pterygoid. The parasphenoid is a narrow elongated bone which arises in between the anterior halves of the trabeculae cranii. It is completely separate from the lateral down‐growths of the frontals and from the basisphenoid. Other than the cartilage‐bone, the articular, each ramus of the lower jaw is composed of the following membrane‐bones: dentary, splenial, angular, and the combined supra‐angular and prearticular. The fusion between the supra‐angular and prearticular takes place in late embryos. As regards the cartilage‐bones, the basioccipital ossifies perichondrally in the posterior part of the basal plate, behind the basicranial fenestra. The exoccipital ossifies in the occipital arch, and spreads medially forming a center in the posterior part of the tectum synoticum. The basisphenoid ossifies in the anterior region of the basal plate (including the crista sellaris) and the posterior ends of the trabeculae cranii. The basicranial fenestra is still present in its center. The supraoccipital arises from a pair of perichondral lamellae formed on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the anterior part of the tectum synoticum. Laterally, on either side, it extends slightly in the roof of the auditory capsule, but this lateral part must not be considered as an epiotic since its independent ossification is not observed. The opisthotic arises from two perichondral lamellae on the outer and inner surfaces of the postero‐lateral part of the auditory capsule. It is quite separate from the exoccipital. The prootic ossifies perichondrally in the anterior portion of the auditory capsule, as far backwards as the anterior margin of the fenestra ovalis. The epipterygoid is completely lacking. The quadrate bone is formed by the perichondral ossification of the quadrate cartilage and the intercalare. The stapes and the shaft of the columella auris ossify perichondrally, but the processus dorsalis is still cartilaginous. The laterosphenoid bone is wedged between the auditory capsule and the basisphenoid, it is completely fused with the prootic. It is of double origin; its ventral part arises by the perichondral ossification of the laterosphenoid cartilage while its dorsal part arises without cartilaginous preformation. The articular arises perichondrally round the hind part of Meckel's cartilage, it is distinct from the combined supra‐angular and prearticular. No ossification occurs in the hyoid apparatus.",

The fibrous capsule is also enriched for phosphotyrosine suggesting a potential signal‐transducing capability is present in this structure. Videomicroscopy analysis of live explant cultures demonstrated that rodlet cells are immobile and that interior structures are highly dynamic. Rodlet sacs can undergo extension and retraction, while intracellular particles can move rapidly within these cells. Fish scale tissue explants provide a useful system for analyzing the molecular composition and dynamic behavior of rodlet cells.",

Using W estern blot tested antibodies, the ultrastructural immunolocalization of specific keratin‐associated beta‐proteins in the epidermis of different lizard species reveals that glycine‐rich beta‐proteins ( H g G 5) localize in the beta‐layer, while glycine–cysteine‐medium‐rich beta‐proteins (Hg GC 10) are present in oberhautchen and alpha‐layers. This suggests a new explanation for the formation of different epidermal layers during the shedding cycle in lepidosaurian epidermis instead of an alternance between beta‐keratins and alpha‐keratins. It is proposed that different sets of genes coding for specific beta‐proteins are activated in keratinocytes during the renewal phase of the shedding cycle. Initially, glycine–cysteine‐medium‐rich beta‐proteins with hydrophilic and elastic properties accumulate over alpha‐keratins in the oberhautchen but are replaced in the next cell layer with glycine‐rich hydrophobic beta‐proteins forming a resistant, stiff, and hydrophobic beta‐layer. The synthesis of glycine‐rich proteins terminates in mesos and alpha‐cells where these proteins are replaced with glycine–cysteine‐rich beta‐proteins. The pattern of beta‐protein deposition onto a scaffold of intermediate filament keratins is typical for keratin‐associated proteins and the association between alpha‐keratins and specific keratin‐associated beta‐proteins during the renewal phase of the shedding cycle gives rise to epidermal layers possessing different structural, mechanical, and texture properties.",

Tendons transmit tensile forces generated by muscles and are a crucial part of the musculoskeletal system in vertebrates. Because tendons and tendon cells respond to altered mechanical load by increasing collagen synthesis, we hypothesized that a correlation between tendon morphology and the loading regime imposed by locomotor style or habitat use exists. This makes tendons an interesting model for studying the relationship between morphology and environment. In this study, we compare the general morphology of the palmar flexor plate, the length of the digital tendons, and the length of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon in species of lizards that exploit a variety of structural habitats. The results from statistical analyses show that phylogenetic relatedness has a major impact on our ability to detect differences between habitat groups, and no differences in tendon length could be detected between iguanian species occupying different habitats when taking into account the relatedness between species. Our data for lizards diverge from the general mammalian paradigm where variation in tendon is often associated with habitat use or locomotor style.",

To categorise LL scale structural types, and determine their distribution, an analysis of original data was undertaken using light and scanning electron microscopy in combination with a literature survey from over 1,000 species representative of most orders of bony fishes. Our categorisation of LL scales is based on the relationship between the tube, or ossified trunk canal segment, and associated scale. Tubular‐Scalar LL scales consist of a distinguishable tube and elasmoid scale in scale pockets. Four types occur only in species with elasmoid scales. Integrated LL scales do not develop in scale pockets, and their tube is enclosed or extended by a non‐elasmoid scale or spines. Integrated 1 and 2 LL scales co‐occur with ganoid and calcidermoid scales, and Integrated 3 LL scales occur when common scales are absent or elasmoid. Tubular LL scales are tubes only, occurring mainly in scaleless species or with calcidermoid and elasmoid scales. Non‐Tubular LL scales are composed only of a scale, co‐occurring mainly with cycloid scales. There is consistency of LL scale type in many orders, families and genera and the presence of different types within taxa can be meaningful.",

Microscopic studies in particular focus on the outer mantle epithelium, but few studies address this epithelium in a histochemical way. In this study, the outer mantle epithelium in adult specimens of Haliotis tuberculata is studied, that is, in specimens involved in maintaining and repairing the shell rather than in generating it. The epithelial cells are studied by scanning ( SEM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ), and by histochemical techniques, including the use of lectins for their biochemical characterization. The epithelium is composed of pigmented epidermal cells with small microvilli and junctional complexes. It furthermore contains a few ciliated cells, as well as two types of secretory cells which differ in the ultrastructural appearance of their secretory granules and their glycoconjugate content. Histochemical study shows secretory cells containing sulphated glycoconjugates such as glycosaminoglycans or mucins rich in N‐acetylgalactosamine and N‐glycoproteins rich in fucose. Furthermore, the apical regions of the epidermal cells are positive for lectins that label fucose, mannose and N‐acetylglucosamine. The role of epithelial cells in the synthesis of structural components of the shell is discussed.",

Hinge regions of scutes in alligator and turtle carapace derive from an initial waving and invagination of the epidermis that contains 5‐bromo‐deoxy‐uridine‐labelled cells. This suggests that down growth of the epidermis into the dermis is driven by local proliferation in addition to dermal anchorage and stabilization of hinge regions. Few keratinocytes migrate into suprabasal layers 1 day after injection of 5‐bromo‐deoxy‐uridine and keratinocytes reach the precorneous layer in about 5 days. Proliferating keratinocytes are randomly distributed in the outer scale surface of symmetric scutes but are more numerous in the outer scale surface of asymmetric or overlapped scutes indicating epidermal expansion. Higher localization of proliferating cells along hinge regions of embryonic turtle and alligator scutes is maintained in adult scutes where most growth occurs. In snake, skin proliferation becomes prevalent on the elongating outer side of the asymmetric scale. Comparison between proliferation sites in turtle–alligator–chick scales with lepidosaurian scales indicates that placodes are present only in turtle–alligator–chick scales. Conversely, scale primordia detected only using gene markers are found in most crocodilian and lepidosaurians embryonic skin.",

Females from San Pancho Island were larger in all measured morphological variables than females from Biological Field Station Chamela ( BFSCH ) on the mainland, and those also reproduced at smaller body size (snout‐vent length, SVL : range = 35–44, = 39 mm) than females on San Pancho Island (range = 40–47, = 43 mm). Egg mass and egg volume were also greater on San Pancho Island, but clutch frequency was higher on BFSCH during breeding season; in this place, one egg every 8 days over a period of 4 months (123 days) versus one egg every 10 days over a period of 4 months (130 days) on San Pancho Island. Thus, we conclude that certain characteristics related to reproduction (e.g. size at sexual maturity, egg mass and egg volume) in A. nebulosus with populations inhabiting islands and mainland, vary primarily in accordance with female SVL . These variations are most likely a response to the different pressures where A. nebulosus inhabits on environments the islands and mainland near the Pacific Coast of Mexico.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During ontogeny, complex adaptations undergo changes that sometimes entail different functional capabilities. This fact constrains the behaviour of organisms at each developmental stage. Rodents have ever‐growing incisors for gnawing, and a powerful jaw musculature. The incisors are long enough, relative to their diameter, to be affected by bending stresses. This is particularly true in the subterranean Ctenomys that uses its incisors for digging. We measured bite force ( BF ) in individuals of different ages using a force transducer. We estimated incisor section modulus Z , a geometrical parameter proportional to bending strength. A relative strength indicator was calculated as S = Z / BF incisor length. We found that ontogenetic BF scales to body mass with positive allometry. However, an anova showed non‐significant differences in S , neither between sexes nor among age classes. This result implies that during growth, incisors might have a rather similar ability to withstand bending stresses from increasing masticatory forces, what may be considered evidence of ontogenetic integration of force production (by muscles) and force reception (by the incisors). This fact well correlates with the observation that pups and juveniles of C. talarum incorporate solid foods shortly after birth, and they are able to dig burrows early in life.",

In this study, we investigated seven populations of swallowtail S ericinus montelus G ray, 1798 ( L epidoptera: P apilionidae), a non‐migratory species, to explore the latitudinal variation of morphological characteristics in adults. The results showed that body size and the development of dark pigmentation on wings in this species responded strongly to latitude. The body size of both male and female adult of S . montelus was negatively correlated with latitude. These findings provided solid evidence to support the converse Bergmann's rule. We considered that the observed variation in morphological characteristics was most likely mediated by the seasonal length and thermoperiod to adapt to different latitudinal environment (e.g. shortened developmental time of immature stages for smaller body size at higher latitude). Moreover, the tendency towards progressively darker colour patterns (only in adult males) at increasingly low latitudes was consistent with Gloger's rule. We suggested that the observed colour variation was most likely associated with thermoregulation. Slight variation in the morphology of the W ‐shaped stripe on the forewing of adult females was also found, and we presumed that the functions of sexual preferences, mimicry and thermoregulation might be involved.",

Swingle (tree of heaven) and the variety Ailanthus altissima var. Qiantouchun. These beetles attack healthy trees and bore into roots and trunks during the larval stage. We studied the typology, distribution and morphostructure of the sensilla on the antennae, maxillary palps and labial palps of E. scrobiculatus and E. brandti larvae using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed the following: (i) the antennae of the two weevil larvae had two types of sensilla, sensilla basiconica (S.b.1 and S.b.2) and sensilla twig basiconica (S.tb.1‐S.tb.3), with S.tb.4 observed only on the antennae of E. brandti larvae; (ii) the maxillary palps had three types of sensilla, S.b.2, S.tb. (S.tb.2, S.tb.3 and S.tb.5) and digitiform sensilla; (iii) the labial palps had two types of sensilla, S.b.2 and S.tb.

Based on the microstructure of the cuticle wall and dendrite, we hypothesized that these sensilla functioned as olfactory, gustatory and hygro‐/thermo‐receptors, respectively. We discuss the relationships among types of sensilla and the types of damage caused by the larvae inside the host tree to understand olfactory and gustatory receptor mechanisms. The results of this study will provide a firm basis for future electrophysiological studies.",

Here, we provide evidence for morphological changes in the late planulae of Lophelia pertusa that have implications for their dispersal potential. Three weeks after spawning, the planulae gain functional cnidocysts, indicating that they are competent to settle at this time. Cnidae have been shown to be used for primary anchoring during settling, and before this time point, the larvae most probably do not have the ability to attach to a substrate in high flow conditions. The appearance of functional cnidae coincides with larvae gaining a flexible mouth that can be opened to the full width of the larva. The larval isorhizas differ the most from the adult polyps isorhizas, while the p‐ and b‐mastigophores bear more resemblance to the adult homologues of similar size. The external and internal morphology of late planulae is further described with demonstration of long apical cilia and its effect on swimming agility, morphological changes of the ciliated cells in the larval mouth region and an internal nerve plexus. This study also indicates that L. pertusa planulae seek out cryptic spaces for settling.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Being able to utilize many different food resources is probably an important aspect of the success of decapod crustaceans which fill a wide range of various ecological niches worldwide. The phenomenon is facilitated by the complex mouth apparatus found in this group, whose representatives possess six pairs of mouthparts– mandibles, maxillae 1, and maxillae 2 and three maxillipeds, the first three pairs of thoracic appendages which are also specialized to food manipulation. These six pairs are able to perform a number of movements for transporting, aligning, crushing and cutting. Studies into the functional morphology of mouthparts have already been carried out in some decapod species. This study focuses on L ithodes maja , a species of the hitherto understudied king crabs ( L ithodidae), chosen on the grounds of their remarkable evolutionary history as ‘derived hermit crabs’. Individuals were filmed while being presented with different kinds of food. To obtain structural information on the individual mouthpart elements as naturally arranged in relation to one another, the shape of the mouthparts was 3 D ‐reconstructed from micro‐ CT scans. These data were complemented by scanning electron microscopy, to analyse the surface structures in detail. There is evidence that the various elements of the mouthparts of L . maja can be sorted into six functional groups: (i) transporting mouthpart elements, (ii) aligning/sorting mouthpart elements, (iii) clutching/holding mouthpart elements, (iv) tearing/cutting/crushing mouthpart elements, (v) current‐generating mouthpart elements and (vi) grooming mouthpart elements. According to our 3D reconstruction, there only seem to be minor differences in morphology and relative position between the mouthparts of L . maja and those of the closely related species, P agurus bernhardus .",

However, these eyes have primarily been investigated in only two subgroups of Errantia, but data on the third main taxon, Eunicida, are available for only two taxa. In the present investigation, the eyes in two additional species of Eunicida, the dorvilleids P rotodorvillea kefersteini and Schistomeringos neglecta, were studied. In P. kefersteini, usually described as possessing one pair of small eyes, two pairs could be detected, whereas in S. neglecta only one pair was found. Each eye is made up of rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells, pigment cells and unpigmented supportive cells. Lenses or vitreous bodies are absent. From their structure most likely all eyes represent adult eyes and even the small anterior eyes in P. kefersteini structurally resemble miniaturized adult eyes. Neither persisting larval eyes nor unpigmented rhabdomeric ocelli were found in the two species. The observations in Dorvilleidae confirm the hypothesis of a common origin of adult eyes in Errantia.",

This study investigates sensory organs in the leg of atympanate cave crickets ( Troglophilus neglectus KRAUSS , 1879) by neuronal tracing. Previously, the subgenual and the intermediate organs were recognised in the subgenual organ complex, lacking the tympanal membranes present for example in the tibial hearing organs of Gryllidae and Tettigoniidae. We document the presence of the accessory organ in T. neglectus . This scolopidial organ is located in the posterior tibia close to the subgenual organ and can be identified by position, innervation and orientation of the dendrites of sensory neurons. The main motor nerve in the leg innervates a part of the subgenual organ and the accessory organ. The dendrites of sensory neurons in the accessory organ are characteristically bent in proximo‐dorsal direction, while the subgenual organ dendrites run distally along the longitudinal axis of the leg. The accessory organ contains 6–10 scolopidial sensilla, and no differences in neuroanatomy occur between the three thoracic leg pairs. Hence, the subgenual organ complex in cave crickets is more complex than previously known. The wider taxonomic distribution of the accessory scolopidial organ among orthopteroid insects is inconsistent, indicating its repeated losses or convergent evolution.",

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were utilized to analyse the otoliths’ characteristics. Twenty‐one distinct features were defined to describe their shapes. Among these, 8 characteristics were consistent across both juvenile and adult otoliths, while 13 features exhibited developmental variation. The results reveal four types of variations: ontogenetic, interspecific, intraspecific, and sexual dimorphism. A comparison with previously documented otoliths of these species from different regions indicates a uniformity intraspecifically across extensive geographic ranges, suggesting that these characteristics are valuable for identification purposes. The diagnostic features of the otoliths can aid in confirming species identity. Additionally, a SEM‐based iconography of the otoliths for all studied species is provided.",

This study investigated the population structure of Periophthalmus waltoni in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman using landmark‐based geometric morphometrics (GMM) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) methods on sagittal otoliths. The objectives were to (i) examine otolith shape variation across different populations and (ii) compare GMM and DWT methods for resolving population differences. Both methods distinguished populations based on general otolith shape, with DWT revealing finer details due to its high accuracy in detecting otolith margins. Interestingly, populations from Sistan‐Baluchestan and Hormozgan, despite geographical separation, showed minimal variation in shape, suggesting environmental factors may influence otolith morphology. Distinct otolith shapes in the Khuzestan population, likely due to geographic isolation, may be influenced by the mangrove forests near Qeshm Island acting as barriers to larval dispersal. This aligns with molecular data and indicates that the relatively young eastern Persian Gulf may also contribute to these differences. Our findings revealed distinct geographical patterns in otolith shape, highlighting the influence of local environmental factors and larval dispersal on population differentiation. These results provide valuable insights into P. waltoni 's population structure and evolutionary history, advancing our understanding of its adaptation to the diverse environmental conditions of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea.",

Males and females of E. munoai becomes sexually mature from 3 to 4 years of age, and presents a life expectancy of up to 9 or 10 years. The breeding cycle at the individual level is cyclical and discontinuous, and seasonal at the population level, with breed season from late winter to late spring.

Twenty‐one characteristics were designated to investigate the ontogenetic (when comparing the otolith characteristics of fishes of different sizes, interspecific variation (comparing the otolith characteristics of the studied species with those of related species), and intraspecific variation (comparing the otolith characteristics of the studied species with those of the same species from different localities, i.e. geographical variation). This investigation concluded that the sagittal otoliths exhibited ontogenetic disparities based on the shapes recorded by different age groups. Otoliths of the young individuals belonging to fish total length groups GI and GII have shown differences in shape from those of the older individuals in the other seven length groups surveyed. An assessment of previously available otolith descriptions of A. anguilla collected from other areas revealed differences between species across larger geographic areas, making some features unsuitable for further investigation. However, other otolith traits were found to be reliable across different length groups and could be considered species‐specific features for identification. These traits include otolith width, otolith thickness, the shape of the mesial and lateral surfaces, the shape of the sulcus acusticus, the presence or absence of ostio‐caudal differentiation, and the shape, size, and thickness of the rostrum.",

The article points out that rodents, as mammals, play a critical role in various ecosystems, with many mammalian species being rodents. They contribute to agriculture, sanitation, food, medicine, ecology and religion. Rodents play a vital role in vegetation dynamics by spreading plant seeds and influencing predator distribution. However, preying on crops can also cause losses in different ways, depending on the plant type and biotope. The study focuses on eight research stations in the Souf region, describing their characteristics and vegetation. The methods used for rodent inventory include fingerprinting, burrow counting and random trapping using different techniques. Statistical methods are then applied to analyse the collected data. The study identifies ten rodent species in the Souf region, belonging to two families, three subfamilies and five genera. The sex distribution varies among species. The study results reveal variations in rodent abundance across different stations and months, with Rattus rattus and Mus musculus being the most common species in certain stations. The diversity and equitability values indicate a relatively balanced distribution among recorded species in the sample period. The study provides comprehensive insights into rodent ecology, behaviour and distribution in the Souf region, emphasizing their importance and potential impacts on agriculture and ecosystems.",

Otolith width was greatest in specimens from the Yamuna River (96.42), followed by those from the Ganga River (92.52), and was lowest in specimens from the Gomti River (72.52). Additionally, the study found that the asymmetry value increased with the total length of the fish across the three locations.

The grubs of B. coriacea were identified by examining the raster pattern. There was variation in the morphology and biology among different populations of B. coriacea in Himachal Pradesh. The morphological parameters and biological differences were also recorded, such as fecundity rate and damage potential among different ecotypes of B. coriacea collected from various locations. A total of 102 morphologically distinct bacterial isolates were isolated from the gut of different populations of B. coriacea . The gut microbial diversity and abundance were recorded as maximum in the hind gut, compared to other gut compartments. A total of 11 cellulolytic bacterial isolates were identified using morphological, biochemical and 16S rRNA molecular methods. The cellulolytic index of bacterial strains ranged from 0.33 to 2.0. The 11 gut cellulolytic bacteria were identified by using morphological, biochemical and 16S rRNA gene analysis. Staphylococcus haemolyticus was isolated from the Nauni population of B. coriacea , and it is the first report from the gut of scarabaeids. This is an opportunistic human pathogen but a useful endosymbiont in the grubs of B. coriacea . Bacillus thuringiensis as a biological agent, Staphylococcus cohnii , Ralstonia mannitolilytica and some Bacillus sp. were reported for the first time from B. coriacea grubs in India.

We evaluated acetabular traits from dry bone museum specimens of Vulpes lagopus , Vulpes vulpes , Nyctereutes procyonoides , Urocyon cinereoargenteus , Canis lupus familiaris and Canis latrans . The same was done from Procyon lotor (Procyonidae), Taxidea taxus (Mustelidae) and Lynx rufus (Felidae). We assessed intra‐articular structures as: (a) acetabular fossa; (b) medial articular margin; (c) lateral articular margin; and (d) articular surface. Each scoring category included multiple subcategories. The primary observed traits across taxa included variably shaped mineralized foci, bony rimming of articular margins and rough‐surfaced or worn articular bone. These traits occurred in a very similar fashion across taxa. We then evaluated only the most frequently occurring 80% of the data within the scoring category, observing only minor differences among taxa. The consistency of trait expression supports broad conservation and intersection of development and response capacities. The exact phylogenetic nature of the trait relationships requires further evaluation across development and growth; usually undetected early life damage; degrees of parallel responses across multiple diarthrodial joints within taxon; and the extent of morphological similarity across other carnivorans and non‐carnivorans.",

However, the organization of the muscular and nervous systems in the mantle of rhynchonelliform brachiopods, as well as the sensory mechanisms of the mantle setae, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a morpho‐functional analysis of the neuromuscular system of the mantle in the brachiopod Hemithiris psittacea, using transmission electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and in vivo video recordings of mantle movements. The mantle contains numerous thin muscles extending from its central region to the periphery, but not reaching the mantle edge. The contraction of these muscles allows the mantle with setae to retract into the mantle cavity. Additionally, the mantle is innervated by numerous radial nerves that connect to the marginal mantle nerve. We demonstrate that mantle contraction may occur independently of the central nervous system. However, the subenteric ganglion plays a role in maintaining the mantle in a pre‐contracting state during rest, thus enhancing the sensory selectivity of the setal sensory complexes.",

Treating such infestations is important for sustainability. Knowledge about the sub‐lethal effects of commonly used acaricides on drone reproductive health, particularly sperm quality, is limited. The effect of in vitro and in vivo acaricide (amitraz) exposure was evaluated using Cape honey bee ( Apis mellifera capensis ) drone body size and sperm quality. For the in vitro study, semen samples were exposed to three concentrations of amitraz (125, 250, 500 μM). The in vivo study entailed in‐hive Apivar treatment as per commercial recommendations. Adult drones were harvested following three weeks of treatment. Drone body weight (determined in the in vivo study only) was significantly higher in amitraz‐exposed drones. No correlations were found between drone weight, sperm volume or concentration. In both studies, amitraz exposure had statistically insignificant effects on sperm motility and structure, while vitality significantly decreased in the 500 μM amitraz‐exposed in vitro group. Sperm structure remained unaffected in both studies. This study highlighted the absence of sub‐lethal effects of high doses of amitraz on sperm functionality. When used as advised, amitraz exposure does not have a detrimental effect on drone sperm quality.",

The fluorescence microscopic examination of the three silk gland parts showed nuclear ramification with an increasing pattern during the 4th and 5th instars. Light microscopic study of the PSG and MSG showed a tight secretory nuclear structure with a distinct epithelium and an unorganised, thin epithelial structure with large secretory vesicles, respectively. The ultrastructural study of the 5th instar matured larval PSG displayed a uniform and thick layer of basement membrane. MSG showed similar characteristics with the occurrence of sparsely distributed infoldings.

This study provides insights into longevity, sexual maturity and growth curves in closely related casque‐headed treefrogs distributed across distinct Brazilian biomes. Age estimation based on the counting of lines of arrested growth (LAGs) in bone tissue revealed a longevity of 6 years in Trachycephalus nigromaculatus and T. atlas , which is uncommon among Neotropical species. T. mambaiensis exhibited a distinct pattern of sexual maturity compared to the other species, suggesting divergent developmental strategies within the clade and possibly reflecting a higher reproductive investment at younger ages. A correlation between estimated age and snout–vent length (SVL) was observed in two of the three analysed species ( T. nigromaculatus and T. atlas ); however, this correlation may vary depending on the sampled locality and sample size. The growth model revealed distinct patterns within the clade: T. nigromaculatus exhibited a decline in growth rate corresponding to the age of sexual maturity, whereas T. atlas showed a non‐stabilised growth pattern.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The red palm weevil ( Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier) is a highly destructive pest that severely threatens palm trees due to the feeding activity of its larvae and adults. The concealed lifestyle of R. ferrugineus , with larvae developing inside palm trunks and adults tunnelling through tissues, has led to specialised morphological and physiological adaptations that facilitate their survival and proliferation. Understanding these adaptations is critical for developing effective management strategies. This study investigates the external morphology of both larval and adult stages, along with their sensory structures, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The analysis revealed distinct sexual dimorphism, particularly in the structure of the rostrum and sensory organs. Additionally, the mouthpart morphology of larvae was examined, highlighting adaptations suited for wood boring. Various sensillae were identified across both sexes, including infrared sensilla, spicules, and spiracles elevated above the thoracic and abdominal surfaces, surrounded by protective spines. Five distinct morphotypes of sensillae were characterised: multiporous peg sensillae, sensilla coeloconica (Types I, II, III), bifid trichoid sensilla, and sensilla trichoidea (Types I, II), with no significant differences observed between males and females. Furthermore, SEM analysis documented the presence of phoretic mites, specifically deutonymphs of Uroobovella sp., on both male and female weevils and pupae. Notably, fungal spores associated with these mites were detected, suggesting a potential role in pathogen transmission that may contribute to palm tree deterioration. These findings provide valuable insights into the morphological adaptations of R. ferrugineus and the ecological interactions that may influence its impact as an invasive pest.",

The correct taxonomic identification and taxonomic status of the Puntius complex have been challenged due to their minor morphological differences. This study investigates the morphological variation and taxonomic validity of 10 species within the Malay Puntius complex using an integrative approach. In the traditional analysis, a one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that 28 out of 30 traits (20 morphometric and 10 meristic characters) were significant. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) indicated significant morphological variation among morphotypes, particularly in meristic traits. This analysis correctly classified 82.8% of the originally grouped and 74.5% of the cross‐validated groups based on meristic characters. Truss analysis indicated that 14 out of 22 characters were significant ( p &lt; 0.05). The geometric morphometric analysis was largely consistent with the morphometric and truss analyses, confirming the validity of the distinct species. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial COI gene sequences confirmed the validity of all species. However, consistent with morphological data, they also supported the non‐monophyly of the genus Barbonymus .",

The new larvae were obtained from females sampled in Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Alpheus bouvieri zoea I shares a combination of characters with most larvae in the genus, but with some diagnostic characteristics: endopod of the maxillule and maxilla with 3 and 4 setae, respectively, the base of the first maxilliped with 9 setae, endopod of the second and third maxilliped with 5 and 6 segments, respectively. In our review, 23 species were analysed from five groups: edwardsi (thirteen), sulcatus (four), brevirostris (three), macrocheles (two), and obesomanus (one) group; the zoea I of species from diadema and crinitus groups are unknown. Based on this review, many issues regarding mistakes in the zoea I description of Alpheus are pointed out, and the hypothesis that the morphological groups proposed for adults are supported by larval data has been rejected.",

We plot growth in body weight, shoulder height and bone dimensions against individual age, assessing sexual dimorphism and regional differences in growth from birth, the timing of cessation of growth and adult size. This variation can be related to differences in habitat, feeding, population density and season of death between the two populations. We highlight the biases inherent in body weight comparisons and contrast them with size comparisons based on postcranial bones. We also identify potential differences in bodily dimensions between the colour morphs of European fallow deer. Finally, we generate predictive equations enabling the estimation of sex, shoulder height and body mass from isolated metapodials, of value for relating fallow deer remains to palaeoenvironmental variation at archaeological and palaeontological sites.",

This study investigates the morphological structure of the adult female reproductive system using stereomicroscopy, light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The reproductive system comprises two ovaries, lateral oviducts, a common oviduct, a spermatheca, and a genital chamber. Each ovary contains five telotrophic meroistic ovarioles, which are divided into four regions: a terminal filament, a germarium with trophocytes and early‐stage oocytes, a vitellarium containing previtellogenic, vitellogenic, and choriogenic oocytes, and a long pedicel. Choriogenic oocytes display distinct endochorion and exochorion layers. Each pedicel contains 2–3 pale yellow, oval eggs with brown respiratory horns. Pedicels connect to the common oviduct via the lateral oviducts. The spermatheca, composed of a distal reservoir and a proximal duct, also opens into the common oviduct. The reservoir is cuticle‐lined and surrounded by longitudinal muscles and glandular cells. Features such as ovariole number and the presence of respiratory horns differ among aquatic heteropterans. These findings offer valuable insights into the comparative morphology of female reproductive systems in aquatic Heteroptera.",

Furthermore, it examined whether these morphological characterisations could differentiate between domestic breeds and Mallard, and whether they exhibited allometric effects. In this study, the skulls of 59 one‐year‐old male ducks were analysed after slaughter. The skulls were modelled in 3D and subjected to geometric morphometric analysis.

While overall shape differences were found among the duck groups, no statistically significant shape differences were observed between the Pekin and Mallard groups. The Orvia displayed broader skulls, whereas the Pekin and Mallard groups exhibited narrower and more elongated skull shapes. Additionally, a significant size‐shape relationship was observed in the Pekin and Mallard groups, but no significant allometric relationship was found for the Orvia group.

The results show that P. sulcatus contains a short oesophagus with numerous goblet cells, a stomach with the muscularis mucosae and gastric glands, and an intestine with long and complex mucosal folds, corresponding to its omnivorous habit. The boundaries of hepatic lobules are indistinct, and the size of hepatocytes is large. The cerebellum is small, which is in line with its benthic living habits. The barbels of P. sulcatus have numerous taste buds while having fewer goblet cells. In addition, all the eggs of P. sulcatus collected in this survey are at stage III of development, indicating that it has the univoltine ovary. There is no significant difference in the kidney compared with other teleost fishes. This study enriches the basic biological content of P. sulcatus and provides basic data for its artificial reproduction and resource protection, thereby effectively protecting this species and the biodiversity of the Binglangjiang.",

A small and variable volume of milt was collected per male; the samples exhibited a high sperm concentration (55.84 ± 8.25 × 10 9 spermatozoa mL −1 ) and high viability (94.38% ± 2.78%). Spermatozoa had a total length of 26.9 ± 0.63 μm and consisted of an elongated head lacking an acrosome, a short mid‐piece with ring‐shaped mitochondrion, and a relatively short flagellum. The nucleus contained a deep nuclear fossa occupying almost the entire head, from which the flagellum emerged. The flagellum exhibits the classical 9 + 2 axoneme structure and consists of a long main piece and a short end‐piece. The main piece presents a pair of side‐fins of variable length, oriented in the plane of the central microtubules. This study provides the first detailed description of sperm ultrastructure in G. maculatus , revealing similarities with various fish families. This information could be valuable for future research on reproductive physiology, sperm evolution and potential applications in assisted reproduction and conservation.",

In the duplex retina, four morphologically different cone types are observed: unequal and equal double cones, long single cones and triple cones. In the light‐adapted state, five different cone patterns occur: row, twisted row, square, pentagonal and hexagonal patterns. High double cone densities are found ventro‐nasally, ventro‐temporally and dorso‐temporally. Throughout the retina the double cone/single cone ratio is 2 : 1, in the ventral part, however, a 1 : 1 ratio occurs. In the vitreous body we found a curtain‐like intraocular septum dividing the retina into two morphologically different regions. In most areas of the dark‐adapted retina the cone patterns are absent at the ellipsoid level, with long single cones standing more vitreally in the light path than double cones. The mosaics are retained, however, in the outer nuclear layer. Typical dark adaptation, i.e. the retinomotor movements of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors in response to the dark adaptation (light change) is not present in the peripheral ventral and parts of the central ventral area. In both regions we found a twisted row pattern of cones having a vitreal position. The findings are discussed with respect to the photic habitat and feeding habits of this species.",

In the seminal vesicle, both sperm types occur, either as free cells or organized into spermatozeugmata. It is shown that the elongate (120–140 μm), flagellum‐like component of the paraspermatozoon is in fact a tubular extension of the plasma membrane which encloses granular material but no axonemes or microtubules. This structure, here termed the pseudotrich, shows no evidence of motility and its function remains obscure. The main body region of the paraspermatozoon (length 32–36 μm) contains numerous spherical vesicles, scattered mitochondria, one or two large, rod‐shaped bodies (length 20–24 μm) and a fusiform, granular body (containing DNA; probably a modified nucleus). The rod‐shaped bodies, granular body and surrounding matrix are contained by a common membrane, and are therefore separated from other contents of the paraspermatozoon. In each spermatozeugma, euspermatozoa are attached via the tips of their acrosomes to the paraspermatozoan body at the opposite end to the pseudotrich. Euspermatozoa exhibit a conical acrosomal complex (with axial rod and basal plate), a tubular nucleus sheathing the axoneme, a midpiece (5–6 helical mitochondrial elements sheathing the axoneme), an annulus (with two rings), a glycogen piece and an end piece (total sperm length 268–272 μm). The euspermatozoa of L. articulata are similar to those of most littorinids and many other caenogastropods. The presence of a pseudotrich in the paraspermatozoon appears to be restricted to the subgenus Palustorina.",

In both Tubificidae and Naididae, the male duct comprises a funnel, a vas deferens and an atrium. There may also be a prostate gland (diffuse or compact) in association with the duct. The funnel and vas deferens, in all four species, originate from the peritoneal (mesodermal) cells in the posterior septa in the testes segment, whereas the atrium develops from an epidermal (ectodermal) invagination. The prostate glands have different origins in different taxa; in S. lacustris it differentiates from the peritoneal (mesodermal) cells surrounding the atrium, but in H. costata and T. benedii it develops by a multiplication of the atrial (ectodermal) cells; C. arenarius lacks a prostate gland. The development of the spermathecae and the female duct is also studied. The spermatheca is an epidermal invagination. The female duct is of mesodermal origin. However, the position of the duct differs; in S. lacustris the female duct is lateral and the pore is in the ovarian segment, while in the tubificids studied the duct is ventral with the pore in the segment behind the one containing the ovary.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Echinocardium cordatum is a detritus‐feeder. Its digestive tract has three functional parts: the mucus‐secreting oesophagus where lubrication and sediment compaction occur, the protein‐secreting stomach and gastric caecum where extracellular digestion occurs, and the absorptive non‐secretory siphon, intestine, intestinal caecum and rectum. Each region harbours typical enterocytes. Acinar mucous glands occur in the posterior oesophagus prior to the incurrent aperture of the siphon; their secretions prevent sediment grains from entering the siphon and may be stimulated by epineural nerves running in the connective tissue layer. The siphon is a sucking organ, and its cytological features indicate that it is a site for absorption of dissolved organic matter. Enterocytes of the intestinal caecum show basal specializations, suggesting that it is a site of active exchange between coelom and gut. This caecum contains symbiotic sulphide‐oxidizing bacteria. Collagen fibres are well developed in organs subjected to severe deformations (e.g., oesophagus and siphon); elastic‐like fibres are conspicuous around haemal lacunae and at the attachment areas of gut‐suspending mesenteries. Circular muscles are seen along the whole gut, whereas longitudinal muscles may be absent in areas such as the siphon. The bulky alimentary bolus that occurs in the ascending segments of the gut is transported by peristalsis; the scattered sediment grains that occur in horizontal segments are presumably moved by the contractions of the gut‐suspending mesenteries.",

This is the first ultrastructural study of the nervous system in flatworms of the endemic Geocentrophora group from Lake Baikal. The neurons are characterized by invaginations of the plasma membrane with extracellular material (ECM) extending deep into the neuronal cytoplasm. Two types of neuron are distinguished on the basis of the character of the cytoplasm and the content of neuronal vesicles. Several more vesicle types are observed in the nerve processes in the neuropile. The following kinds of neuronal release sites are distinguished: single synapses, shared synapses, nonsynaptic release sites characterized by omega profiles and neuromuscular contacts. Special features of the synapses in the species of Geocentrophora are pronounced local thickenings of the presynaptic membrane connected to paramembraneous densities. The ECM‐filled invaginations and the local presynaptic thickenings are features that distinguish the neurons of Geocentrophora spp. from previously described turbellarian neurons.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The formation and cytodifferentiation of egg envelopes were studied at the ultrastructural level in blastozooids of Botryllus schlosseri. The process was divided into five recognized stages of oogenesis. First, the small young oocytes (stage 1) are contacted by scattered cells (primary follicle cells—PFC) which adhere to the oolemma at several junctional spots. PFC extend all around the growing oocyte, acquire polarity, and form a layer covered externally by a thin basal membrane (stage 2). At stage 3 isolated cells are recognizable between the PFC layer and oocyte. They never form junctions with the oocyte and represent prospective inner follicle cells (IFC) and test cells (TC), the latter being progressively received in superficial depressions in the oocyte. The layer of PFC, which maintains junctions with the oolemma, represents prospective outer follicle cells (OFC). PFC are considered to be the source of the three cellular envelopes because a contribution from mesenchymatous elements was not observed. At the beginning of vitellogenesis (stage 4), the vitelline coat (VC) becomes recognizable as a loose net covering the oocyte and TC. It is crossed by the oocyte microvilli and OFC projections which meet and form numerous small junctional plaques, some of them resembling gap junctions. IFC, VC and TC show marked signs of differentiation with approaching ovulation. OFC differentiate completely before ovulation (stage 5) and are engaged in intense synthesis of proteins which may be transferred and taken by endocytosis into the oocyte for yolk formation. Experiments with injected horseradish peroxidase also revealed that proteins present in the blood may reach the oocyte via the intercellular pathway, overcoming OFC and IFC. The possible roles of all the egg envelopes are discussed.",

Reductions or losses of larval feeding structures include pluteal arms, their supporting skeleton and the ciliated band that borders them. The barrel‐shaped lecithotrophic larva of Heliocidaris erythrogramma has, at its posterior end, two or three ciliated band segments comprised of densely packed, elongate cilia. These cilia may be expressions of the epaulettes that would have been present in an ancestral larval form, represented today by the feeding echinopluteus of H. tuberculata . We compared the development and cellular organization of the larval ciliary structures of both Heliocidaris species to assess whether the ciliary bands of H. erythrogramma are expressions of the feeding ciliated band or epaulettes of an echinopluteus. Epaulette development in feeding larvae of H. tuberculata involves separation of specific parts of the ciliated band from the rest of the feeding ciliated band, hyperplastic addition of ciliated cells and hypertrophic growth of the cilia. Like epaulettes, the ciliated bands of H. erythrogramma are composed of long spindle‐shaped cells arranged in a cup‐shaped collection that bulges into the blastocoel; and these cells have elongated cilia. In their developmental origin and topological arrangement however, the ciliated bands of H. erythrogramma correspond more closely with parts of the pluteal feeding ciliated band than with epaulettes. The larvae of this echinoid appear to develop epaulette‐like bands from parts of the original (but reduced) feeding ciliated band. The evolution of development in H. erythrogramma has thus involved both conservation and change in echinopluteal ciliary structures.",

A novel feeding position enables B. major to use flowers that open to the side as additional nectar sources. The new horizontal feeding position is enabled by the prolonged ventral base of the proboscis. Bombylius major exploits deep corolla tubes with an elongate proboscis, and an increased efficiency in both the suction pumps and the sealing mechanisms of the proboscis. The exploitation of narrow corolla tubes is made possible by the shift from a sponging feeding mode, exhibited by H. morio , to the exclusively sucking mode in B. major . Besides quantitative changes in the proportions of the different proboscis components, labellar movements as well as the structures of saliva distribution are changed along with this shift. The labial musculature of B. major does not significantly differ from the plesiomorphic state, since both examined species do not only feed on nectar, but also on pollen.",

The floor plate begins immediately behind the infundibular cells. It consists for the most part of a single file of midline cells, but adjacent lateral floor plate cells occur in some places. The floor plate is interrupted at one point, in the posterior part of the cerebral vesicle above the tegmental neuropile. A class of early developing axons crosses the midline at this point, which suggests that the floor plate may have a developmental role in axon guidance. The structural integrity of the cord is maintained by ependymal and ependymoglial cells that attach to its sides. Two other glial cell types were found in larvae. Both appear to originate adjacent to the floor plate and hence are referred to here as midline glia. Those in somites 1 and 2 remain connected to the central canal; they appear to be a mixed population that may include precursors of midline support cells which are present later in the juvenile. Those caudal to somite 3 detach early from the central canal and develop an extensive network of axial processes; they are referred to here as axial glia and treated as a subcategory of midline glia. Based on their site of origin and the absence of glial filaments, their closest counterpart among vertebrate glia may well be the oligodendrocyte. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a possible amphioxus homologue of this important vertebrate cell type.",

The cytoplasm interposed between the nucleus and acrosome was remarkably reduced in volume and displayed a membranous lamellar complex, few mitochondria, and a centriole.

The pattern of actin fluorescence varies between the spermatozoa of the four species, with Maja and Cancer showing intense fluorescence in the acrosome vesicle and in elements of the sperm cell involved in the acrosome reaction.

In most cases the fluorescence is sufficiently specific to indicate in which region of the mature sperm cell the actin and tubulin occurs.

Non‐caridoid ancestral malacostracans have not materialized, and recent proposals by Schram (Schram, F. R. 1986. Crustacea ), according to which the Phyllocarida should be removed from the Malacostraca and transferred to a re‐defined class Phyllopoda, was found to be built upon false premises. Manton (Manton, S. M. 1953.— Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology 7: 339–376), discussing a hypothetical malacostracan ancestor, was of the opinion that in such an ancestor walking preceded swimming, an opinion which has received considerable support. This also implies that the Malacostraca were originally epibenthic, retaining a number of primitive features. The hypothetical ‘generalized malacostracan’ envisaged by Calman (Calman, W. T. 1909. A treatise on zoology , Part 7, pp. 1–346) was also presumed to be epibenthic, representing what Calman called a caridoid facies, thereby emphasizing an important aspect of the eumalacostracan structural and functional plan.",

Proboscis musculature in the butterfly Vanessa cardui (Nymphalidae, Lepidoptera): settling the proboscis recoiling controversy. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 81 : 259–266 The proboscis of Vanessa cardui (Nymphalidae) contains two basal galeal muscles and two different series of numerous oblique muscles. Both muscle series extend from the proximal region up to the tip‐region; the individual muscles of each series run a constant course throughout the proboscis. In contrast to other butterflies, the knee bend region does not have additional types of muscles. The analysis of shock‐frozen proboscises reveals that the dorsal wall is arched outwardly in the uncoiled, feeding position whereas in the coiled, resting position the dorsal proboscis wall is flat or concave. This results in a significantly greater cross‐sectional area due to the significantly greater dorso‐ventral diameter in uncoiled proboscises. After freezing the proboscis in its distal region, it can still be uncoiled, however, it cannot be fully recoiled. These morphometric and experimental results indicate that the oblique proboscis muscles are responsible for recoiling the proboscis to the resting position.",

The appearance of multiple nucleoli suggests that the extrachromosomal amplification of ribosomal DNA may take place in the oocytes of Nannochorista . The results show that in the structure of the ovariole and the course of oogenesis nannochoristids share noteworthy derived features with boreids, but differ significantly from all other mecopterans.

The prevalent ‘classical’ hypothesis describes the protocoel as being homologous with the diverticula of Hatschek, which, on the left side, develop into the preoral pit, subsequently into Hatschek’s pit and groove (in part). This hypothesis is based mainly on the position of Hatschek’s diverticula anterior to the rest of the mesoderm during their enterocoelic origin. It is shown here that during development the mesodermal segment that develops into Hatschek’s nephridium is the most anterior one prior to formation of Hatschek’s diverticula, and this segment assumes an anteriormost position after differentiation of Hatschek’s diverticula. Additional similarities between this segment and protocoels are: (i) presence of endomesodermal cells with podocytic extensions, (ii) excretory function, (iii) relatively early ontogenetic origin, (iv) probable lack of association with nervous structures, (v) probable ectodermal origin of a portion of the canal, and (vi) position relative to the mouth opening. Therefore, homology between the protocoel and the segment that becomes Hatschek’s nephridium is proposed. It is concluded that a glandular structure homologous to the diverticula of Hatschek and anterior to the protocoel/Hatschek’s nephridium is a synapomorphy of notochordates or chordates.",

The frequent occurrence of Sargasso weed consumed by Eurypharynx indicates a lack of prey‐item discrimination. The forward directed eyes appear to enable stereoscopic prey localization, possibly aided by the well developed lateral line. The huge gape is unsuitable for suction feeding. It is proposed that prey engulfing is accomplished by a forward thrust of the head by which the produced water pressure will expand the buccal cavity to a volume several times that of the fish itself. When ripening, males especially show morphological changes in some characters, indicating that the pelican eel breeds only once, a condition which seems to be the rule among eels.",

Aggregations of cells with large cytoplasmic vacuoles, called bladder cells, appear in the subepithelial connective tissue near the tops of the intestinal ridges. The bladder cells are suitably positioned to bolster the integrity of the ridges. Striated muscle of the intestine occurs in inner longitudinal and outer circular layers. The inner longitudinal layer consists of six strips, with one strip associated with the base of each intestinal ridge. The outer circular layer is essentially complete, but there are periodic apertures in this layer on the left and right sides of the intestine, providing nerves and haemolymph vessels with access to the interior of the gut.

Pilidium brachiatum from Florida is re‐described to highlight differences from Hubrechtella larvae, which are superficially similar, and an assortment of tropical forms is included to illustrate the predominance of the compressed gyrans‐type larva in this location. Pilidium larvae have typically been categorized by their shape as seen in lateral view. This account emphasizes the importance of three‐dimensional shape, pigmentation, overall architecture and behaviour in distinguishing between the larvae of different species.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We have analyzed morphological changes affecting the lympho‐hemopoietic organs of the anadromous sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus throughout its life span. For this analysis, ammocoetes (2–4 years), premetamorphosing lampreys (nearly 5 years), metamorphosing lampreys, macrophtalmia stages (young adults) and parasitic adults (nearly 7 years) were used. The principal lympho‐hemopoietic organs in the ammocoete are typhlosole, larval opisthonephros and nephros‐associated adipose tissue. After metamorphosis, these organs degenerate, and their lympho‐hemopoietic tissue is replaced by dense connective tissue. The supraneural body and to a lesser degree, the definitive opisthonephros, are the main blood‐forming organs in adult lampreys. During larval life, lympho‐hemopoietic cells appear in the branchial area, associated with pharyngeal epithelium. These loci are not morphologically homologous to the thymus gland of jawed vertebrates. These results are discussed, with special emphasis on the importance of cell microenvironments in eluciding changes in different blood‐forming loci throughout the life cycle and their significance for the lamprey's immune capacity.",

Slow‐tonic (ST), fast‐twitch oxidative‐glycolytic (FOG) and fast‐twitch glycolytic (FG) fibers were approximately equal in number and distribution in the emu pectoralis examined. In the ostriches, both predominantly FG and approximately equal areas, were present.

In the male ostrich ST fibers were smaller ( P ≤ 0.05) than FG fibers, neither of which were significantly ( P ≥ 0.05) different from FOG fibers. The ratites have the greatest percentage and widest distribution of ST fibers found in any avian pectoralis studied to date. This could represent the ancestoral avian pectoralis, neoteny or an effect of flightlessness. ST fibers are used in the maintenance of posture, which is probably the main role of the pectoralis in the emu. The predominantly FG areas of the ostrich are indicative of an additional function, namely, behavioural display. Sexual dimorphism in the ostrich pectoralis is strongly suggested.",

Its morphology is very similar to the previously known members of the family Chthamalophilidae (Rhizocephala, Akentrogonida). Like Boschmaella balani and Bocquelia rosea it has an internal root system within the host. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the ‘incubatory cavity’ in previous descriptions of the Chthamalophilidae is lined by a thin cuticle, and it is therefore homologous to the mantle cavity found in other Rhizocephala. The development of the male structure resembled events in Chthamalophilus delagei . It is evaginated from the mantle into the mantle cavity as a free‐floating, epithelium‐lined capsule, ‘the spermatogenic island’, which later fragments into numerous secondary spermatogenic islands, where spermatogenesis takes place. Based on new morphological evidence and a comparison with other rhizocephalans, it is suggested that all species of the Chthamalophilidae are gonochorists, in which male cyprids implant spermatogonia directly into the mantle of female externae. The larvae of Boschmaella japonica hatch as cyprids which, like those of other chthamalophilids, lack a thorax and thoracic cirri. This larval feature is thought to be an important factor limiting dispersal of these species. The incidence of multiple‐infested hosts is very high in Boschmaella japonica .",

Two categories of presumptive secretory inclusions are readily distinguished. Exocytosis of ‘storage granules’ is widespread in the neuropile, and involves probable peptidergic terminals as well as more conventional terminals. Plasma membranes at such sites of release are apparently unmodified. In contrast, ‘synaptic vesicles’ are aggregated adjacent to membrane thickenings and specialized clefts, and signs of their fusion with the presynaptic membranes have been observed rarely. The presence of coated pits surmounting omega profiles involving storage granules may indicate that membrane is retrieved in the form of microvesicles from the site of exocytosis. Coated pits associated with synapses have only been observed in areas of membrane adjacent to presumed sites of vesicle exocytosis. The incidence of dual sites of release, often relating to individual terminals, may be indicative of the segregated storage and independent secretion of distinct active principles. Materials released by granule exocytosis may have the role of neuromodulators.",

In Microstomum ECM is well developed and connective tissue filaments abundant in conspicuous extracellular spaces. It is uncertain whether basal laminae exist. The finding of basal lamina structures as the only ECM component present in Stenostomum makes it now possible to establish a complete ECM and connective tissue hierarchy in turbellarians, ranging from a purely cellular type with no ECM present to systems dominated by ECM and very similar to loose connective tissue in vertebrates. Comparative aspects of ECM and connective tissue systems in turbellarians are discussed in addition to the difficulties and ambiguities regarding definition and nomenclature of basal matrices as basal laminae and subepidermal membranes.",

Although the testis organization conforms to the ‘unrestricted’ spermatogonial type, the species has a rare type of spermatogenesis not previously described among catfishes, ‘semicystic’, in which the cyst ruptures before the spermatozoon stage. Spermiogenesis also involves some peculiar features such as condensation of the chromatin in the posterior part of the nucleus to form a compact electron‐dense mass with some irregular electron‐lucent lacunae, while the uppermost part of the nucleus is a loose electron‐lucent area, absence of the nuclear rotation and, as a consequence, the centriolar complex and the initial segment of each flagellum arise directly in a position perpendicular to the basal pole of the nucleus, and occurrence of numerous vesicles in the midpiece. In addition, spermiogenesis includes migration of the diplosome and mitochondria to the basal pole of the nucleus, formation of two moderate nuclear fossae, each of which contains the centriolar complex, development of two independent flagella and elimination of the excess cytoplasm. The mature spermatozoon has a more or less round head with no acrosome or acrosomal vesicle, a long midpiece with numerous mitochondria and vesicles and two long tails or flagella having the classical axoneme structure of 9 + 2 microtubular doublet pattern and with no lateral fins and membranous compartment. These findings suggest that the ultrastructural features of spermiogenesis and spermatozoa of M . electricus are synapomorphies of types I and II spermiogenesis and spermiogenesis is closely similar to the type described in the Nile catfish Chrysichthys auratus .",

The study was mainly conducted on the epidermis of the carapace, plastron and nail. Epidermal differentiation resembles that described for other reptiles, and the embryonic epidermis is composed of numerous cell layers. In the early stages of differentiation of the carapacial ridge, cytoplasmic blebs of epidermal cells are in direct contact with the extracellular matrix and mesenchymal cells. The influence of the dermis on the formation of the beta‐layer is discussed. The dermis becomes rich in collagen bundles at later stages of development. The embryonic epidermis is formed by a flat periderm and four to six layers of subperidermal cells, storing 40–70‐nm‐thick coarse filaments that may represent interkeratin or matrix material. Beta‐keratin is associated with the coarse filaments, suggesting that the protein may be polymerized on their surface. The presence of beta‐keratin in embryonic epidermis suggests that this keratin might have been produced at the beginning of chelonian evolution. The embryonic epidermis of the scutes is lost around hatching and leaves underneath the definitive corneous beta‐layer. Beneath the embryonic epidermis, cells that accumulate typical large bundles of beta‐keratin appear at stage 23 and at hatching a compact beta‐layer is present. The differentiation of these cells shows the progressive replacement of alpha‐keratin bundles with bundles immunolabelled for beta‐keratin. The nucleus is degraded and electron‐dense nuclear material mixes with beta‐keratin. In general, changes in tortoise skin when approaching terrestrial life resemble those of other reptiles. Lepidosaurian reptiles form an embryonic shedding layer and crocodilians have a thin embryonic epidermis that is rapidly lost near hacthing. Chelonians have a thicker embryonic epidermis that accumulates beta‐keratin, a protein later used to make a thick corneous layer.",

The zone of differentiation contains the two centrioles, each with one thin root, being orientated in the same plane only when a single intercentriolar body (ICB) appears between them. A median cytoplasmic process (MCP) develops distally to the two flagella, which are of unequal length, get longer and rotate towards the MCP. The nucleus penetrates into the spermatid body after the fusion of both flagella with the MCP has started. Flagellar roots occur occasionally in some spermatids.

The microbial flora of the contents of the intestine of larval lampreys, as well as of the water and substrate in the ammocoetes' habitat, have been cultured on Trypticase Soy Agar. The bacteria have been separated into taxonomic groups, using the scheme of Cowan and Steele (1974) and the API 20E system. The microbial flora of the gut contents of larval lampreys closely parallels that found in the environment in which the ammocoetes live. Bacillus, Aeromonas and Aeromonas-like organisms were by far the most abundant bacteria identified, followed by Pseudomonas and members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The only anaerobic components of the bacterial flora in the gut contents and the environment were Clostridium and a relatively uncommon and unidentified Gram-negative organism. Estimates of abundance of the microflora indicated that the concentration of bacteria was much greater in both the gut contents and the substrate than in the water overlying the animals' burrow.",

Conventional karyotypes and nucleolar organizer region (Ag‐NOR) phenotypes of two samples of M. microlepis from the headwaters of the Iguaçu River (southern Brazil) were compared both with each other and with other local populations of the species in the coastal drainage of southeastern Brazil. Additional molecular data (RAPD markers and genetic diversity) were obtained from specimens from coastal and continental regions of southern Brazil. The same diploid number (52 chromosomes), karyotypic formula and Ag‐NOR phenotype were found for both analysed samples from the Iguaçu River. A genetic discontinuity was discovered in the comparison of the karyotypical formula of the Iguaçu samples with those from coastal drainages of the region. Polymerase chain reaction‐RAPD markers revealed strikingly different molecular profiles between coastal and continental samples and indications of a high degree of genetic variation. Based on these results, we provide some comments on the biogeographical patterns and evolutionary trends for M. microlepis from coastal and continental regions of southeastern/southern Brazil.",

After peripheral drug effects during the first 6 hours, the eels became darker for 2 or 3 days, whereupon the melanophore index (MI), in most cases, decreased. Darkening was accompanied by significant nuclear hypertrophy and moderate degranulation of the MSH (melanophore‐stimulating hormone) cells. Probably only some of the adrenergic nerves in the neural lobe were affected. The blood supply to the brain was decreased for several days after each injection. The results support the assumption that in the eel catecholamines released from nerve endings in the neural lobe inhibit the release of MSH from intermedia cells by their own action as an inhibiting factor, or by affecting an MIF (MSH‐release inhibiting factor) and/or an MRF (MSH‐releasing factor).",

The dorsal velar apparatus projects downward from the roof of the buccopharynx and consists of three mucosal pads and three vanes on both sides of the midline. At least four functions may be ascribed to the dorsal velar apparatus. 1. Each pad and its complementary vane fit so flush into each of the three bilateral filter cavities that exhalent water must flow in thin sheets over the filter plates before its exit via the pharyngeal clefts. 2. Like hydrofoils, the vanes deflect water and prevent strong currents from disorganizing the mucous food cords. 3. When tadpoles cease water pumping, the plugging effect of the dorsal velar apparatus in the filter cavities helps to occlude the pharyngeal clefts. 4. Secretions of dorsal velar glands, especially on the surface of the velar pads, may assist the mucus of the ventral velum to entrap suspended food. Other findings concern the M3b muscle, which helps to elevate the buccopharyngeal floor during expiration; the lack of cilia, but presence of low glandular elevations on the ventral velum; the reduction of the exits from the pharyngeal clefts 2 and 3 into a single valvular exit controlled by the B2b and B2c muscles; and the probable absence of a mechanical feeding function for the oral tentacles.",

On the basis of the last-mentioned resemblance, the shape of the prenasal sinus, the construction of the biting mechanism, the lack of a pineal foramen, the presence of a common external aperture for the ipsilateral gill-slits, and the probable existence of a paired longitudinal row of mucous glands, it is further suggested that heterostracans and myxinoids are immediately related.

All the species studied bear synapomorphies of Squamata and Serpentes. Among scolecophidian snakes, we identified eight polymorphic characters. Previous analyses of molecular and somatic morphological data provide equivocal solutions to the relationships among Anomalepididae, Leptotyphlopidae and Typhlopidae. A close relationship between Anomalepididae and Typhlopidae is corroborated by two characters of sperm ultrastructure, presence of an electron‐dense structure inside the proximal centriole and rounded mitochondria in transverse sections of T. reticulatus , Li. beui and R. waitii , whereas the absence of the ridge on the acrosome surface of Le. koppesi and T. reticulatus support a closer relationship between Typhlopidae and Leptotyphlopidae. The differences observed in sperm ultrastructure within Typhlopidae suggest the existence of snake intrafamilial polymorphism. The sperm characters of blindsnakes contain significant phylogenetic information and may provide important data for snake phylogenetic reconstructions.",

The growth phases are initiated during that migration, but not until the lateral pouches are reached does the oocyte grow considerably. A Balbiani body consisting of numerous mitochondria, and various vacuolar inclusions are formed, and at the same time the oocyte bulges out into the hemocoel. Some wall cells form a stalk and cover part of the oocyte towards the hemocoel. During later stages of oocyte growth they withdraw, and the oocyte is separated from the hemocoel only by an extremely thin basement membrane. It seems that the young oocytes obtain nourishment from the ovarial lumen by way of the wall cells. The contents of the lumen in its turn seems to be derived from the hemocoel through the activity of mid-ventral secretory cells. The older oocytes are provided with numerous microvilli, and material for the growth of the oocytes must be taken up directly from the hemocoel. A very dense egg shell is secreted by the oocyte. In nearly mature oocytes the microvilli withdraw from penetrating this shell, and a mucopolysaccharide layer is formed beneath the shell. The mature oocytes in some unknown way make their way to the ovarial lumen whence they are transported to the uterus.",

The glands consist of distinct clusters of class 3 secretory cells accompanied by their duct cells, located in the upper lateral portion of the thoracic wall. Ultrastructural observations reveal numerous mitochondria, a well‐developed Golgi apparatus and vesicular smooth endoplasmic reticulum, indicating a cytoplasm with intensive metabolic activity. The gland is reported to occur in Microcerotermes strunckii , Cornitermes cumulans and Nasutitermes minor , three species comprising an interesting morpho‐behavioural gradient, respectively, from only mechanical, through mechanical–chemical, to only chemical defence systems. The extent of such a gradient allows speculations that this gland would be related to the general needs of termites, rather than to some specificities of a single group.

The validity of the new genus is established by a discussion of the reasons for the invalidity of the previous assignments. Heddleichthys is characterized by a combination of derived and primitive tristichopterid features. Derived features include the presence of symphyseal dentary fangs and premaxillary pseudofangs, a diamond‐shaped symmetric caudal fin, a low posterodorsal expansion of the maxilla, and a posteriorly positioned kite‐shaped pineal series. Primitive features include a postorbital and jugal contribution to the orbital margin and a parasphenoid with a ventral keel. External dermal bones are rather poorly preserved in the referred material, with few easily discernible sutures. The holotype specimen, a three‐dimensionally preserved skull, was scanned by computed tomography to reveal well‐preserved internal dermal bones, including entopterygoids, vomers and parasphenoid. There is no preserved endoskeletal material. As the first representative of derived tristichopterids described from Britain, Heddleichthys lends support to the idea that faunal dispersion between Gondwana and Laurussia in the Late Devonian was widespread. Derived tristichopterids have been described from all continents except South America. In contrast, the basal tristichopterids Eusthenopteron and Tristichopterus are still only described from Laurussia.",

Variation in sperm morphology of a murine rodent from South-East Asia: the Greater Bandicoot Rat, Bandicota indica.—Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 92: 201–205. In most mammals the male gamete, the spermatozoon, has a fairly consistent, species-specific shape although in a few species some variability is evident. The present study set out to determine the extent of sperm variability in a population of a South-East Asian murine rodent, Bandicota indica, that was sampled during both the breeding and non-breeding periods. We found that, regardless of the time of year when the animals were obtained, males had sperm present in the cauda epididymides but a high degree of variability was always evident including the presence of some grossly abnormal forms. The abundance of abnormal sperm tended to be greater during the non-breeding period. These animals also have relatively small testes, thus the occurrence of the variable sperm populations is consistent with the hypothesis that depressed levels of intermale sperm competition result in a relaxation of the genetic control of male germ cell maturation during spermiogenesis and thus the production of polymorphic sperm populations.",

A paleohistological study of the endoskeletal bones of the dorsal and pelvic fins shows that Eusthenopteron foordi had true long bones that grew in length and thickness through endochondral and periosteal ossification, respectively. Endochondral ossification required cartilaginous epiphyses with a growth plate system whose presence is confirmed by both calcified cartilage and thin endochondral bony trabeculae that overlaid the erosive bays located in hypertrophic calcified cartilage. Articulations between axial mesomeres in paired fins were diarthroses. This microanatomical organization, i.e. longitudinal growth of diaphysis and articulations between epiphyses, can be considered an exaptation for terrestrial locomotion as it can produce skeletal elements able to support strong mechanical stress.",

    "abstract": "Résumé L'étude histologique de diverses glandes endocrines et du rein est réalisée chez l'Anguille après autotransplantation de l'hypophyse dans la musculature dorsale et après hypophysectomie. La glande thyroïde est fortement hypoactive dans 25 pour cent des Anguilles greffées comme chez celles hypophysectomisées; elle est d'aspect subnormal ou normal chez les autres animaux où les cellules thyréotropes sont présentes dans le greffon. Malgré une variabilité plus grande que chez les témoins, dans aucun cas on ne peut parler d'une hyperactivité similaire à celle observée chez Poecilia . Comme le nombre des cellules thyréotropes est toujours réduit dans le transplant, il semblerait qu'une sécrétion basale de cette hormone suffise à maintenir une activité thyroïdienne notable. La fonction thyréotrope serait donc plus indépendante du contrôle hypothalamique que chez les Mammifères, sans que la notion de TIF (facteur inhibiteur) paraisse valable chez l'Anguille. L'interrénal est aussi très atrophié après hypophysectomie. Au contraire, après autogreffe, il conserve une structure proche de celle des témoins dans tous les cas, bien que moins homogène, malgré la réduction du nombre des cellules corticotropes dans le greffon. La vacuolisation cytoplasmique parfois notable pourrait indiquer un léger ralentissement de l'activité fonctionnelle de l'interrénal. Le contrôle hypothalamique ne semble donc pas s'exercer étroitement sur l'axe hypophyso‐surrénalien de l'Anguille. Les organes de Syrski restent très peu différenciés, en accord avec la régression des cellules gonadotropes dans le greffon, montrant la nécessité d'une stimulation d'origine hypothalamique pour le maintien de la fonction gonadotrope. Les corpuscules de Stannius sont similaires pour les 3 groupes d'Anguilles, l'hypophysectomie n'ayant pas d'effet net chez le mâle après 2 mois. L'atrophie rénale consécutive à l'hypophysectomie est fortement atténuée chez les Anguilles autogreffées, donnée qui suggère l'idée d'une sécrétion de prolactine par le transplant hypophysaire dont les cellules à prolactine apparaissent stimulées. En général, l'hypophyse déconnectée de l'Anguille conserve une autonomie fonctionnelle beaucoup plus marquée que chez les Vertébrés supérieurs, sauf pour la sécrétion gonadotrope. Abstract Histological structure of some endocrine glands in the eel after auto‐transplantation of the pituitary gland. The histological picture of various endocrines and of the kidney is described in control and hypophysectomized eels ( Anguilla anguilla L.) and after autotransplantation of the pituitary in the dorsal muscle. The thyroid gland is greatly hypoactive in 3 grafted eels as well as in the hypophysectomized ones. It keeps a normal or subnormal picture in the other animals where thyrotrophic cells are still present in the graft. Although a higher variability is detected compared with control animals, in no case one can speak of a hyperactivity similar to that occuring in Poecilia . As the number of the thyrotrophic cells is always reduced in the transplant, it would seem that a basal secretion of this hormone would be sufficient to maintain some thyroidal activity. The thyrotropic function would appear more independent of a hypothalamic control than in mammals, however the concept of a TIF (inhibiting factor) does not seem to apply to the eel. Also, the interrenal is greatly atrophic after hypophysectomy. On the countrary, after autotransplantation, it keeps a structure less homogeneous, but closely similar to that of control eels in all cases, in spite of a reduction of the corticotrophic cell number in the graft. The cytoplasmic vacuolization which sometimes may occur in the interrenal cells might indicate a slowing down of the functional activity. In the eel, the hypophyso‐interrenal axis does not seem to be strictly dependent of a hypothalamic control. The organs of Syrski (male gonads) remain poorly differentiated in agreement with the regression of the gonadotrophic cells in the graft, indicating the necessity of a hypothalamic stimulation for the maintenance of the gonadotrophic function. The corpuscles of Stannius are similar in the 3 groups, and within 2 months, they are not yet affected by hypophysectomy. In grafted eels, the histological picture of the kidney is intermediary between that of intact and hypophysectomized animals. As ovine prolactin partly prevents the renal atrophy induced after hypophysectomy, and as prolactin cells appear very active in all the transplants despite their reduced number, some prolactin secretion probably occurs. In summary, the disconnected pituitary of the eel keeps a functional autonomy much more important than in higher vertebrates, the gonadotrophic function being excluded, in agreement with the cytological study of the transplant.",

This is the southernmost occurrence of this species in the Cisurals area. Its presence suggests a biogeographical link for this species between the Cisurals and Japan. Residue obtained from chemical preparation of the sample included numerous scales and several teeth, which are tentatively assigned to Helicoprion . This assumption is based upon morphological similarity of the scales to those known in other eugeneodontiforms. Campodus ‐like teeth might be part of the lateral dentition of Helicoprion . A new reconstruction of the interaction of the lower tooth whorl with the upper jaw dentition is suggested and its function is discussed. It is proposed that there was no symphysial whorl in the upper jaw but its role was played by a rigid cover formed by a series of small teeth at the palatoquadrates. Microscopic study of the tooth crown surface revealed scratch marks, which might have resulted from pressing the food object against the upper jaw. Using extant odontocetans as an ecological model led to a conclusion that helicoprionids most likely fed on cephalopods and to some extent on fish. This assumption is based upon the concentration of functional dentition in the area of the lower jaw symphysis in both groups of animals.",

Ultrastructural study of spermiogenesis in the Jamaican Gray Anole, Anolis lineatopus (Reptilia: Polychrotidae). — Acta Zoologica ( Stockholm ) 91 : 484–494. Abstract As the number of spermatozoal characters being described in reptiles increases, it is important to detail the ontogeny of the features leading to the mature morphology of the spermatozoa which may give rise to more comprehensive data matrices for future phylogenetic analyses within the Reptilia. Therefore, spermiogenically active testes from Anolis lineatopus were investigated ultrastructurally to describe the intracellular changes that occur throughout spermiogenesis. The primary events of spermiogenesis (acrosome formation, nuclear condensation, and elongation) seen in A. lineatopus are similar to those previously described for other amniotes. Characters including a round perforatorium tip, stopper‐like perforatorial base plate, open pits of nucleoplasm during condensation, and protein layers within the acrosome complex corroborate trends from previous studies in squamates. However, uniquely defined in A. lineatopus are the excessive amounts of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complexes that contribute to cellular secretions during mid elongation of the spermatids and the lack of a manchette. During acrosome formation, the acrosome granule is found in a basal rather than an apical position, which has been observed in previous studies. These similarities and differences observed during spermiogenesis may be helpful in elucidating the development of mature spermatozoal characters as well as aid in future phylogenetic analyses.",

The eggshell external morphology of Anastrepha species of different taxonomic intrageneric groups was determined by light and scanning electron microscopy. The eggs of Anastrepha alveata Stone and A. consobrina (Loew) are described for the first time, and a more detailed description of previously studied eggs from A. amita Zucchi, A. pickeli Lima, A. bistrigata Bezzi, A. grandis (Macquart), A. obliqua (Macquart), A. pseudoparallela (Loew), A. striata Schiner, A. suspensa (Loew), and A. zenildae Zucchi is presented. Several relatively plastic morphological characters of the eggs were discerned, such as length, width, tapering, curvature, chorion ornamentation, respiratory lobes, and position of the micropyle. Scores were attributed to these characters, allowing a comparison of egg morphology among 17 species of Anastrepha . A cluster analysis based on these scores did not group the eggs according to the taxonomic intrageneric groups of the species. Nonetheless, this analysis indicated that the egg of each species can be described by a set of morphological scores. The possibility of species identificaton using immature stages will be of great help for the taxonomy of Anastrepha fruit flies.",

The spermiogenesis and the mature spermatozoon of Schistocephalus solidus (Cestoda: Diphyllobothriidea) are described using transmission electron microscopy. Spermiogenesis in S. solidus begins with the formation in the spermatid of a differentiation zone surrounded by cortical microtubules and delimited by arching membranes. This conical area presents two centrioles associated with striated rootlets and a median cytoplasmic extension between them. The centrioles are separated by an intercentriolar body composed of three electron‐dense plates dividing four electron‐lucent plates. The centrioles give rise to two flagella that undergo a rotation and later fuse proximodistally with the median cytoplasmic expansion. The presence of an electron‐dense material in the distal part of the differentiation zone is observed in the early stage of spermiogenesis. This pattern corresponds to Type I spermiogenesis according to the classification proposed by Bâ and Marchand ( Mémoires du Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle 1995; 166 : 87). The mature spermatozoon of S. solidus presents the Type I pattern defined by Levron et al. ( Biological Reviews 2010; 85 : 523). It consists of five regions that exhibit two axonemes, parallel cortical microtubules, nucleus and electron‐dense zones. The anterior tip of the spermatozoon possesses only a few singlets. The axonemes are of a 9 + ’1’ trepaxonematan pattern and do not reach the posterior extremity of the mature spermatozoon.",

A comparative study of lateral line scales ( lls ) in nine teleost species was undertaken to trace their ontogenetic structural changes. Three universal characters were used to describe and classify definitive and developing lls . The four main structural types in teleosts are represented. In adult fish, lls are the same structural type in all parts of lateral line in any one specimen, but number of tubules and their orientation may vary. In juvenile fish, except for one species, the structural type of every lls changes with growth, and this process progresses along the lateral line in the direction of development typical for the species. Definitive structural type of the lls is not determined by common scale type and size, presence or absence of nerve foramen on lls , scale overlapping or time of initiation of scales and trunk canal. Development pathways are proposed in which terminal states correspond to the final development of the most complex lls type in Cyprinus carpio , Carassius carassius , Oncorhynchus mykiss , Diplodus annularis and Mullus barbatus . The intermediate states of these pathways correspond to other types of lls as examples of pedomorphosis in Perca fluviatilis , Sander lucioperca , Symphysodon aequifasciatus and Hippoglossoides platessoides .",

The genitalia resemble the primitive dysderoid genitalia supporting the hypothesis that the subfamily Oonopinae contains more basal oonopids. In O. kilikus, the anterior receptaculum is reduced to a sclerite. Spermatozoa are stored in a PRe. The receptacula of Pseudotriaeris sp. are reduced to sclerites. Spermatozoa in the uterus internus indicate that fertilization happens there or in the ovary. The anterior sclerite might serve females to lock the uterus during copulation as suggested for other gamasomorphines. The male palp of O. kilikus is simple, whereas the palps of O. pulcher and Pseudotriaeris sp. appear more complex. Complicated structures on the palp of Pseudotriaeris sp. indicate that males exert copulatory courtship.",

The vertebrate cornea functions in either aquatic or aerial environments and in some cases in both. In terrestrial and aerial vertebrates, the cornea contributes most of the refractive powers of the eye because of the large variation in refractive index between the air and the cornea. The present study aimed to examine and compare the main features of the corneal epithelial surface of three reptilian species related to three different families (Caretta caretta, Varanus griseus and Mabuya quinquetaeniata) and inhabiting different environment, by light, scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy. The mean epithelial cell densities of the species of the study were 8.670 ± 3.134, 5.945 ± 2.144 and 2.124 ± 713 respectively. The corneal epithelium of the three species observed by SEM showed a similarity to one another indicating that the apical cell surfaces possess regular polygonal cells with varieties of microprocesses. These microprocesses were represented by microplicae, numerous microvilli and some long microridges in C. caretta, microplicae and minute microholes in V. griseus and microplicae intermingled with short microvilli in M. quinquetaeniata. According to the densities of these microprocesses, three polymorphic cell types (light, medium and dark) appeared in C. caretta, light and medium cell types were observed in V. griseus and medium and dark cell types were noticed in M. quinquetaeniata. Different types of tight adhesions were observed by transmission electron microscopy between the cell borders of the epithelial cells which differ according to environment where the species occupy. In conclusion, variation in the structure of the corneal epithelial cells appears to be related to the living environment, such as aerial, terrestrial and aquatic ones, which is occupied by every species.",

These are expanded tips of digits and show modifications of their ventral epidermis for adhesion. The outer cells of toe pad epidermis ( TPE ) bear surface microstructures (0.7 × 0.2 μm), which are keratinized. Their cytoplasm contains no organelles, but pleomorphic nuclei and mucous granules (0.4–0.5 μm) that glue the keratin filaments. In the intermediate cell layer of TPE , similar keratinized microstructures as in the outer cells are present, so that when the outer layer is shed, it is ready with features for adhesion. These cells contain more keratin than the outer cells. The basal cell layer contains thin keratin bundles and usual cell organelles. The dermis contains mucous‐secreting glands, whose ducts open in the outer epidermal cell layer in channels. The dorsal epidermal cells lack surface microstructures and keratin bundles. Ultrastructural features suggest that toe pads utilize the surface microstructures for adhesion aided by mucus, in which the intermediate cell layer seems to bear the shear stress generated during locomotion. Further, TPE can expand and fit into an increased contact area of the substrate. The long, surface microstructures may also help in mechanical interlocking with rough surfaces on plants.",

Male coleoid cephalopods produce elaborate spermatophores, which function autonomously outside the male body during copulation, undergoing a complicated process of evagination. In order to contribute to the understanding of this unique structure, this study investigated the morphology of the spermatophore of Doryteuthis plei applying several microscopy techniques. A hitherto unreported, much more complex structural arrangement was revealed for the loliginid spermatophore, the most striking findings being: (1) the complex, layered structure of the middle membrane, which bears an additional, chemically distinct segment surrounding part of the cement body; (2) the presence of a space between the inner tunic and middle membrane filled with a fine reticulated material; (3) the presence of stellate particles not only embedded in the spiral filament, but also closely applied to the inner membrane at the level of the cement body; (4) the presence of a pre‐oral chamber in the cap region; and (5) the complex organization of the cement body, formed by two distinct layers encompassing contents of different chemical and textural properties. Careful literature reassessment suggests several of these features are common to loliginids, and to some extent to other squids. Their possible functional implications are discussed in light of our knowledge of the spermatophoric reaction mechanics.",

Spermatozoon ultrastructure of Xenoturbella bocki (Westblad 1949). —Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 92: 109–115. Here, we report on the sperm ultrastructure of Xenoturbella bocki (Westblad 1949), which we studied for the first time in detail using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The mature spermatozoa are of the bilaterian primitive type, also called aquasperm and develop as uniflagellate sperm consisting of a round head with distinct mitochondria at the base and a 9+2 flagellum of approximately 42 μm in length. The acrosomal complex consists of a small, round electron translucent acrosomal vesicle and a subacrosomal base. There is no separate midpiece, and the mitochondria surround the proximal and distal centriole in the posterior part of the head. The primitive structure of the spermatozoa suggests that these fertilize the egg by free spawning, probably the ancestral mode of fertilization in early bilaterians. When compared to the spermatozoa of other metazoans, we find that the arrangement of organelles in the Xenoturbella sperm shows similarities to a wide range of protostome and deuterostome taxa and does not seem to indicate any particular phylogenetic relationship.",

The mandibular glands of queens of different age stages and mating status were examined at the light microscopical as well as the ultrastructural level. The results clearly show a high activity of the gland at the time of hatching, followed by a rapid degeneration independent of the queens' mating status. We therefore hypothesize the glandular secretion serves to stimulate workers to remove the queens' pupal skin. Experiments to compare hatching ability of isolated pupae and pupae assisted by workers confirmed the necessity of worker assistance, which is even more crucial to allow proper wing formation in queens and males. Together with the histological data, this suggests that the mandibular gland may indeed play a role in the social facilitation of hatching, although bioassays are required to give decisive answers about the mandibular gland's function.",

The goal of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the reproduction biology of this species by describing the macroscopic anatomy, the histology of the female reproductive system and the reproductive cycle of U . cordatus . A total of 367 females were obtained from O ctober of 2002 to M arch of 2005 during monthly collections in the B aía de A ntonina, P araná, B razil. Specimens were submitted to necropsy and their reproductive systems (ovary and spermathecae) were analysed histologically. Permanent slides were stained with H arris' hematoxylin and eosin, M allory's trichromic and the periodic acid‐ S chiff reaction. Ovarian analysis allowed for the determination of five developmental stages based on the prevalence of oocytes in different phases of vitellogenesis. During stage V , when ovaries recover from spawning, the presence of oocytes in advanced stages of vitellogenesis was detected, suggesting that there could be more than one spawning in a single reproductive period. Females in stage IV were most common in the spring (November through February), whereas females with their egg mass exposed were most frequent from November through March. The reproductive period of U . cordatus in mangroves of the study region occurred from O ctober to M arch. The reproductive events observed in the present study suggest that spermatophores acquired during copulation, which takes place during the ‘andada’, are only used in the reproductive period of the following year.",

General organization of the tentorium follows the groundplan previously proposed for adult Staphylinidae, although some taxa have reduced or lost the dorsal (all Aleocharinae studied, Agathidium mandibulare [Leiodidae]) or anterior ( Omalium rivulare [Omaliinae], Anotylus sculpturatus [Oxytelinae]) tentorial arms. All species investigated have premental and hypopharyngeal sclerites that are partly homologizable across taxa. We clarified that Musculus praementopalpalis externus originates from the premental sclerite, resolving its unclear origin reported in our previous publications. Eight of 13 investigated Aleocharinae species are spore/pollen feeders, six obligatorily. Three of these six ( Eumicrota , Gyrophaena fasciata , G. gentilis ) have grinding pseudomolae and a fully developed hypopharyngeal suspensorium with posterior bridge and anterior elongations; the remaining three ( Oxypoda, Pagla, Polylobus ) lack pseudomolae and suspensorial bridge, but have the suspensorium elongated anteriorly. The dorsolateral side of the hypopharyngeal sclerite interacts with the pseudomola. Obligate sporophagy/pollinivory apparently arose at least three times in Aleocharinae, not always involving the pseudomola–hypopharynx grinding mechanism.",

Branched microridges, comprised of single ridges that appeared continuous with each other, extended to over 150 μm in some cases. The actin‐binding proteins α‐actinin and cortactin were distributed in a dot‐like pattern along the length of individual ridges, consistent with bundled actin cores described in earlier studies.

Statistical tests and Poisson regression models with robust standard errors were used to investigate differences and relationships between moult and the size and gender of the animals. The appearance of the calcium carbonate deposits on the pereon sternites during the premoult stage was documented in detail, and three main substages were identified. The average duration of the premoult and of the biphasic ecdysis was about 12 and 1.5 days, respectively. This observation period, however, did not allow to establish a determined average duration of the intermoult stage, which was extremely variable. This stage lasted for 2 months or more in most of the cases observed, but about 1‐month‐long intermoult stages were also recorded. No statistically significant association was found between the number of moults and gender and size of the animals.",

Egg hatching occurs between the end of December and beginning of January. The complete cycle of maternal care, from oviposition to independent, self‐sufficient offspring lasts about 3 months. After eclosion, the altricial young feed on the mother's specially modified skin (maternal dermatophagy) and are also supplied by a fluid released from coming from the maternal cloaca.

In this context, we describe the ultrastructure of spermatozoa of species of the Calappidae, Aethridae and Menippidae to elucidate the relationships among taxa. The vasa deferentia were submitted to routine protocols for transmission electron microscopy. Our results indicate that the morphology of the spermatozoa of Hepatus pudibundus supports its exclusion from the Superfamily Calappoidea due to the presence of the apical striated layer. The spermatozoa of Menippe nodifrons is very similar to H . pudibundus and corroborates the recent phylogenetic analysis using sequence data of nuclear genes. Moreover, our results evidence two morphological patterns of spermatozoa within Calappidae. Calappa ocellata and C . cinerea show spermatozoa with a wide acrosome vesicle, a thick operculum shaped as a shallow “W” and a large thickened ring. Calappa gallus and C . hepatica show spermatozoa with a longer acrosome vesicle, a pointed operculum and a slender thickened ring. Our ultrastructure results conform with previous molecular proposal and show that spermatozoa ultrastructure can be an effective tool to adjust phylogenetic relationship when used in association with molecular data.",

Innervation of most muscles as well as the ganglion of C. eburnea is described, and several new details are reported, for example, on the additional and branched ectodermal muscles of the cystid, the presence of subtentacular muscles, the retractor muscles being distinctly striated and the presence of an additional pair of lateroabfrontal nerves in the proximal part of the tentacles. The serotonin-like immunoreactivity in the nervous system of C. eburnea shares many features with those of the other bryozoans studied so far, which probably reflects a common ancestry of the neural architecture. However, the nervous system shows somewhat less complexity compared to that of the sister clade, Eurystomata, and contains fewer cells and nerves compared to the cyclostome Cinctipora which has much larger zooids and more than eight tentacles. No interzooidal neural connections were found in C. eburnea, which is in agreement with the individual response of the zooids.",

Thick submembranous smooth muscle‐like cortex, or fibrous capsule, envelopes the rodlet cell. The cortex undergoes contraction resulting in the expulsion of intracellular contents through an apical pore and out into the extracellular environment. The present study evaluated the distribution of tropomyosin in rodlet cells. In addition, distribution of alpha‐actinin was revisited in a previous study using a modified immunostaining protocol. Alpha‐actinin was localized to the fibrous capsule predominantly in a partial fibrillar pattern reminiscent of dense plaques of smooth muscle. In contrast, tropomyosin was localized as dot‐ and patch‐like accumulations within the cortex. Tropomyosin was also found as a closely packed arrangement of intensely stained dots at the apical pore of rodlet cells, distinct from its location in the cortex. The findings support a smooth muscle‐like nature to the rodlet cell cortex and suggest a novel role for tropomyosin in capping the apical pore.",

Inside the testis lumen, together with mature sperm, two types of large mono‐nucleate cells, flagellate and aflagellate, were present. Both types of cells were interpreted as developing germ cells precociously released inside the testis lumen, where their maturation was completed. According to the different morphological features of the nuclei, such as chromatin condensation degree, aspect of the nuclear fossa and others, the flagellate cells were unquestionably developing spermatids. On the contrary, the developmental stage of the aflagellate was more difficult to interpreted. They could be secondary spermatocytes or young spermatids.

Nerve fibre size in the ostrich and emu was larger than that reported in domestic poultry. There were a significantly higher number of myelinated nerve fibres in the N. ophthalmicus R. medialis in the emu by comparison with the same nerve in the ostrich, or by comparison with the N. intramandibularis of either species. As myelinated nerve fibres supply Herbst corpuscles, and these structures have been demonstrated in this region in these two species, this may indicate that the upper bill of the emu is more sensitive to vibrational stimuli than the upper bill of the ostrich or the lower bill of both species. The large size of the nerve fibres, the high nerve fibre count and the particular distribution of the nerves in the bill tip support the existence of a well‐developed sensory area in this region of the ostrich and emu.",

In anurans, sperm morphology is associated with reproductive modes and mating systems. Here, we describe the sperm morphology of 11 frog species in the genus Leptodactylus and that of Lithodytes lineatus and discuss the relationship between sperm morphology and species' mating systems. We observed two distinct sperm morphotypes among the leptodactyline species, which differed mostly in head morphology. Type I sperm had triangular head, discrete acrosome vesicle with posterior margin not clearly visible; type II sperm had elongated head, clear acrosomal vesicle with posterior margin clearly visible. These sperm types do not seem to be associated with phylogeny; instead, type II sperm was observed in all polyandrous species analysed and in species with evidences of polyandry. Moreover, sperm of all species presented tail with undulating membrane connected to the axial fibre. We suggest that differences in sperm morphology might be associated with sperm competition to what polyandrous species are subjected. However, natural history observations on polyandrous mating in some species presenting type II sperm and phylogenetic comparative studies are need to elucidate the role of mating systems in the evolution of sperm morphology in leptodactylines.",

In all of the specimens, the system is bilaterally sy, consisting a pair of ovaries and of genital ducts. Also, genital ducts have four components: oviduct, seminal receptacle, vagina and gonopore. Ovaries may be connected to seminal receptacle through dorsal or ventral region. In the Heterotremata studied, both types are observed, while it is only ventral in Thoracotremata. Seminal receptacle has two regions in all species: ventral – simple columnar secretory epithelium, apical region covered with cuticle, and middorsal – epithelium could be columnar secretory or stratified. Vagina is concave in all analysed Thoracotremata and simple in Heterotremata. An operculum was observed in all the Thoracotremata. Observed morphological patterns are consistent throughout Thoracotremata, while varying in Heterotremata, that is the way ovary and receptacle are connected and the kind of epithelia that forms the receptacle.",

The hyena assemblage counts no siblings, 37% cub, 33% early adult/subadult and 30% adult/senile individuals. A senile scavenged individual demonstrates the cannibalism within the cave. About 10% of the 3569 megafauna bones are from hyenas which larger amounts are typical at communal/prey depot den sites. This site is different to three other larger natal/birth and communal or prey depot hyena den cave sites in Czech Republic. The Chlum–Komín Cave hyena prey bone assemblage (= NISP ) consists, similar as at two other Czech Republic sites, mainly of Equus ferus przewalskii (50%), including pregnant females being hunted in spring/early summer. The fewer amounts of Coelodonta antiquitatis (4%), Bison priscus (2%), Rangifer tarandus (15%), and alpine Rupicapra rupicapra (2%) or Capra ibex (1%) and the absence of mammoth correlate to hyena den bone assemblages in middle high elevated mountain regions of northern/central Europe. The rareness of cave bears in the Bohemian Mountains, on which hyenas specialized to feed additionally in European mountain regions, explains predominant predation on horses.",

In this study, we describe an easy quantitative method for estimating the dietary habits, and apply it to extinct raccoon dogs ( Nyctereutes ) species (Carnivora, Mammalia). The method is based on the lower molar ratios (M 2 /M 1 size) that reflect the species diet (carnivorous and omnivorous tendencies) in Canidae. Among the species statistically compared, Nyctereutes sinensis showed a lower M 2 /M 1 score similar to that of Nyctereutes procyonoides albus (Hokkaido, Japan), whereas Nyctereutes tingi had a higher M 2 /M 1 score similar to that of Nyctereutes procyonoides viverrinus (Honshu and Kyushu, Japan). These scores suggest that the diets of N. sinensis and N. tingi were similar to those of N. p. albus (relatively carnivorous) and N. p. viverrinus (relatively omnivorous), respectively. Other extinct raccoon dogs also showed varied M 2 /M 1 score, suggesting dietary difference. These results suggest that raccoon dogs underwent dietary transitions or exhibited dietary plasticity during evolution, while their range of diets might have remained the same as those of different populations of extant species Nyctereutes procyonoides .",

Here, we explored morphological differentiation in tooth‐carp Aphaniops hormuzensis from three ecologically diverse habitats (Khurgu sulphuric spring, Shur high‐salinity river and the urban canal) in the Hormuz riverine system, southern Iran. The evidence of sexual dimorphism was found in fish and otolith traits mainly in the Khurgu spring. The extreme conditions of the Khurgu spring could lead to the microhabitat segregation by fish individuals with different ages and spatial sexual segregation, and caused high intrapopulation differentiation in this site. However, the most diverged population belonged to the urban canal, which had more elongated pre‐ and post‐dorsal lengths, as well as a deep otolith. In sum, the observed phenotypic variations in A. hormuzensis are mainly influenced by sex‐dependent factors such as sexual dimorphism and the specific ecological condition of the Khurgu sulphuric spring (extreme sulphur‐rich habitat) and the urban canal (high food availability and hybridization event). This study provides the basic opportunity to explore the relative roles of ecological divergence and habitat differences in the morphological differentiation of A. hormuzensis .",

Fish individuals belong to 20 species belong to 13 genera, and four families were collected from the Caspian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Makran zone of the Oman Sea. Overall, seven otolith morphotypes were distinguished, that is lanceolated (45%), fusiform (20%), boot‐like (15%) and clamp‐like, pentagonal, elliptic and rectangular (each 5%, respectively). The univariate analysis showed that all variables except shape index [sulcus area (SS)/otolith area (OS)] and ROx (roundness) were significantly different among the clupeid species. The interspecific relationships of the otoliths were analysed based on the data of otolith morphology and otolith shape indices. Both dendrograms showed somehow an obvious separation among the studied species. However, the interspecific relationships in the dendrogram based on the otolith morphology have a better resolution. These phenotypic relationships based on otolith morphology among the studied clupeids are largely consistent with the previous hypothesis on the systematics of these fishes and emphasized that the morphological and morphometric features of the otolith, which are highlighted in this study, could be adequately used as diagnostic features for the identification of clupeids diversity.",

Here, we present the results of our histological and ultrastructural study of the central nervous system in two distantly related amphinomids: Euphrosine foliosa (Euphrosinidae) and Eurythoe complanta (Amphinomidae). We provide detailed morphological information, aiming to set up the groundwork for future comparative studies and to gain insight into the evolution of annelid nervous systems. We not only compare our observations among the two species but also discuss their implications for annelids in general and more specifically for the sipunculan affinity. The central nervous system in Amphinomida differs both from other errantian annelids and also from Sipuncula and shows no clear synapomorphies that would argue for or against their current phylogenetic placement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Gonad development stages ( GDS ) and, subsequently, the reproductive cycle are described by performing histology of some gonad portions. In polyplacophorans, gametogenesis is not enough to define GDS ; further anatomical gonad features are relevant. In most adult polyplacophorans, the gonad is a simple anatomical structure that resembles and operates as one single gonadal acinus without glandular structure. These features have gone unnoticed causing inaccurate GDS assignment and, consequently, imprecise reproductive season in polyplacophorans. Here, dissection protocols that allow extracting a compact gonad are established. Emphasizing the anatomical structure of the whole gonad and the displacement of gametes, five GDS were assigned to both sexes of Chiton (Chiton) articulatus : I‐goniogenesis, II ‐development, III ‐ripe, IV ‐spawning, V‐rest. Tissue platelets contribute importantly to GDS assignment and even help distinguishing between males and females. Neither a randomly selected portion of gonad nor a longitudinal section are recommended because it leads to misinterpretation higher than 50% in determining GDS and besides ignores displacement of gametes. A panoramic sweep across a complete transverse‐section of each gonad was validated as the best option for establishing GDS . This new methodology was tested on several polyplacophorans species, and seems generally applicable for histological assessment of reproductive cycle and reproductive season in polyplacophorans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sex dimorphism is found in many organisms and is an important source of intraspecific variation. Among freshwater fishes, all members of the Aphaniidae (killifishes, Cyprinodontiformes) are known for their pronounced sex dimorphism, and it has been proposed that sexual selection has played a role in their diversification. However, few studies have assessed their sex dimorphism in detail. Here, we use Aphaniops stoliczkanus (Day, 1872) to analyse morphological variability within and between sexes and within the total sample using statistical analyses of body morphometry, meristic traits and otolith data. We found that sex dimorphism (i) is significant in many body morphometric variables, but (almost) absent in meristic traits and otolith morphometry, (ii) is most marked in anal‐ and dorsal‐fin lengths (larger in males), and in anal‐ and dorsal‐fin positions (more anteriorly positioned in males) and (iii) does not alter the overall variance of the population unless the character concerned is highly divergent. Our data also suggest that anal‐ and dorsal‐fin lengths in males of A. stoliczkanus are sexually selected traits. Together with literature data, this reinforces the idea that sexual selection plays a role in the diversification of aphaniid species. Our results are also relevant to work on fossils, in which morphological variability is often difficult to interpret.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Since the beginning of the 1990s, palaeontologists have been interested in understanding biological processes recorded within the bone microstructure of deinonychosaurian theropods, the group comprising Troodontidae and Dromaeosauridae. Several studies were published on this subject, and the growing database requires the first revision of used terminology and older interpretations. Furthermore, a platform correlating the developmental characters of all investigated taxa is missing. Hence, we lack a perspective to evaluate the potential of deinonychosaurian osteohistology for understanding their evolution and that of their close relatives, including avialans. This study aimed to fill in this gap by offering a comprehensive review of the previous osteohistological investigations published on deinonychosaurians and Archaeopteryx . Four significant evolutionary phenomena are assumed from the investigated deinonychosaurian taxa: (1) it is likely that troodontids evolved general osteohistology closer to basal avialans than to dromaeosaurids, (2) in troodontids, reticular vasculature is correlated to maturation timing, (3) the first growth deceleration occurs later in smaller deinonychosaurs (e.g. Changyuraptor , Sinornithosaurus ) than in larger forms (e.g. Buitreraptor ), and (4) the growth rate of the deinonychosaurs' hind limbs might be correlated with a specific type of locomotion.",

There was significant osteological damage has been revealed by the mammography of these deformed specimens. The saddleback anomaly is in the anterior part of the spinous part of the dorsal fin that showed no missing spines. In addition, the lateral line was deformed in both specimens examined. In addition, there were several minor skeletal abnormalities. These anomalies have been considered an important indicator of environmentally induced stress on the wild fishes.

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study aims to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of the vertebral column, fin structure and caudal skeleton of 21 species of Pseudophoxinus and Egirdira nigra (Family: Leuciscidae) collected from various freshwater locations across Türkiye. Using mammographic imaging, eight distinct characteristics of the vertebral column and caudal skeleton were examined: the structure of the vertebral column, vertebral column regionalization, interdigitation of the pterygiophores with the neural spines of the dorsal fin, interdigitation of the pterygiophores with the haemal spines of the anal fin, the caudal fin formula, distribution of the dorsal procurrent caudal fin, distribution of the ventral procurrent caudal fin and the description of the caudal fin skeleton. These features were documented for all species studied. The findings reveal that osteological data vary among the species examined, highlighting that the structure of the vertebral column and caudal skeleton can serve as valuable tools in the taxonomic classification of Pseudophoxinus species and E. nigra . Additionally, this study introduces a novel approach for defining the regions of the vertebral column, dividing it into four distinct regions: postcranial, middle (comprising both anterior and posterior sections) and caudal regions. Furthermore, the research identifies specific osteological features that could serve as effective taxonomic criteria to differentiate E. nigra from the species within Pseudophoxinus . This new anatomical data contributes to a deeper understanding of the taxonomy and systematics of these species in Türkiye.",

The purpose was to compute the asymmetry level of the otolith length (OL), otolith width (OW) and otolith weight (OWe). The asymmetry estimated for otolith length was greater than that of otolith width and otolith width. The asymmetry estimation of the three otolith traits augmented with the upsurge in the fish's length. The feasible reason for asymmetry in the otolith features explored has been linked to the inconsistency in growth provoked by natural stress associated with the discrepancy in water temperature, salinity, depth and contaminants present on the coast of Muğla province.",

The main aims were: (1) to provide new and additional observations on pectinariid external and internal anatomy, (2) to test the usefulness and limitations of micro‐CT against other techniques and 3) to explore for characters with potential taxonomic value to be studied in the future. Micro‐CT provided good images of several external relevant taxonomic characters such as paleae, cephalic veil, scaphe, scaphal hooks and anal lobe, but was especially useful for the examination of internal anatomy. The best visualized organs were those of higher tissue density (i.e. body musculature, digestive tract, main blood vessel, glands), whereas less electrodense tissues (i.e. peritoneal lining/septa, nephridia, nervous system) were less evident. Images of internal organs showed heterogeneous results: micro‐CT may serve well to assess regionalization of digestive system and its variability across taxa, together with musculature and glands, while images of circulatory and nervous systems only show good results in their more electrodense components (main blood vessels/heart and ventral nerve cord/brain, respectively).",

Development of C. partellus pupae completely arrested at 5°C and 35°C. The duration of the pupal developmental period was short and the developmental rate faster in both male and female pupae with an increase in temperature from 10°C to 30°C. Percent emergence of male and female adults also increased from 10°C to 25°C, and declined thereafter at 30°C. Several phenological parameters were assessed by fitting the development rate data to two linear and seven non‐linear models. Ikemoto and Takai model accurately computed the lower thermal thresholds as 10.20°C and 10.38°C, and thermal constants as 328.2° and 395.28°‐days for male and female pupae, respectively. The Lactin‐2 non‐linear model was considered best, as it estimated thermal thresholds ( T min , T max and T opt ) similar to those of the observed values. Analytis model also computed the accurate estimations of T max and T opt , but failed to compute the correct estimations of T min . In a nutshell, Ikemoto and Takai and Lactin‐2 are useful and effective models for describing temperature‐dependent development and estimating the temperature thresholds of male and female pupae of C. partellus .",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to discuss the influence of the environment on the macro–microstructure features of the eyelids of two birds: hooded crow, Corvus cornix , and Muscovy duck, Cairina moschata , which also show lymphoid follicles, lymphocytes and some immune cells in the eyelid mucosa and their effect on healthy eyes. In both birds, numerous lymphocytes were distributed within connective tissue in the tarsal and orbital regions of the lower eyelid, and lymphoid follicles were located mostly beneath the conjunctival tissue near the tarsal plate to form a part of diffuse conjunctiva‐associated lymphoid tissue. There were no lymphoid follicles in the upper eyelid or nictitating membrane of the crow. However, they appeared in the nictitating membrane of the duck. In the crow, CD1a‐positive cells were marked in the skin and CD20‐positive population was detectable as a small patch in the intrafollicular, while in the duck, few CD1a‐positive cells were scattered in the stroma and there was a weak reaction around the feather follicle, while a densely positive CD20 was found in the paracortex and medullary regions of the follicle and in the stroma beneath the skin, also around blood vessels and HEV in both birds. CD138+ cells are scattered in the stroma and their population increases around blood vessels and HEV. In the third eyelids, CD20+, CD138+ and CD1a+ show an increase in concentration around blood vessels, with plasma cells having the highest density, while the lowest population of CD20+ is dispersed as singular cells between the two membrane surfaces. Thereby, these changes in the morphology of the upper, lower and third eyelids were strongly related to the lifestyle of the birds.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The Pleistocene wolves ( Canis lupus ) from Sicily represent one of the few known insular populations of this species from that time period. Despite their potential relevance for understanding carnivore adaptations in insular contexts, no dedicated study has previously investigated their morphology and evolutionary significance. This study presents the first detailed analysis of Pleistocene wolf remains from Sicily, providing new insights into their morphometric variability and paleobiological implications. Fossil specimens from seven deposits in the north‐western region of the island were analysed using a detailed morphometric approach, including log‐ratio diagrams and principal component analysis (PCA). Estimates of body mass and shoulder height were also obtained through multiple regression equations. The results reveal considerable variability in size and dental proportions among the Sicilian specimens, which span the range documented in coeval peninsular Italian populations. Notably, some individuals from Arena Cave display divergent dental patterns and pronounced tooth wear, possibly reflecting ecological specialisation or early domestication processes. While preliminary, these findings underscore the complexity of wolf populations in Pleistocene Sicily and provide a foundation for future investigations into their evolutionary history and ecological adaptations.",

The propodi and dactyli of the claws were analysed in males and females of both species, using geometric morphometric techniques to identify subtle shape differences and analyse the integration between the components. The analysis of morphological integration assesses the coadaptation between two correlated traits, whose modifications may result in improvements in functional performance. The crusher claws, associated with agonistic interactions and breaking prey with hard tissues, showed greater robustness than the cutter claws, which are specialised in cutting tasks and agile capture. Despite these functional differences, a high degree of morphological integration was found between the propodus and dactylus in both types of claws, regardless of sex or species. Statistical analyses confirmed significant differences in the shape of the structures between crusher and cutter claws, highlighting variations in robustness and proportions of the components. These findings indicate that, even though each type of claw is frequently used to acquire different resources, they do not differ in terms of morphological integration, as they are coadapted to perform different functions with high efficiency.",

Furthermore, we provide the first descriptions for Philander pebas , P. canus and Didelphis imperfecta . No intraspecific variation was found in cuticle morphology or its relationship with habitats. However, conoidal and lozenge cuticular patterns may be associated with arboreal and terrestrial habits, respectively. While the microstructure of guard hairs is useful for genus‐level identification of mammals, species‐level identification in the diverse Amazonian marsupials remains challenging due to pattern repetition and the reliance on more subjective characteristics.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Weapons are morphological structures used by animals in various contexts, especially in intra‐specific contests and visual displays. In snapping shrimps of the genus Alpheus , particularly the monogamous species Alpheus brasileiro , both sexes bear enlarged chelipeds, potentially conferring advantages in mate competition or territorial defence. However, little is known about sex‐specific weapon investment value (WIV) in socially monogamous species. This study investigated WIV in males and females of A. brasileiro through monthly sampling from April 2015 to March 2016 in a southeastern Brazilian estuary. Shrimps were measured for carapace and chela (propodus + dactyl) dimensions, and allometric analyses were performed to assess relative growth patterns. WIV was quantified by comparing the dry weight of the major chela to total body dry weight. Both sexes showed positive allometry for weapon growth, indicating increased energy allocation to chela development. However, males invested significantly more (≈26%) of their body weight in weaponry compared to females (≈20%). These findings suggest that males face stronger selective pressures favouring larger weapons, possibly due to intra‐sexual competition, predatory defence or display behaviours. Our results provide new insights into sex‐based differences in weapon development in Alpheus , emphasising the relevance of investigating morphological traits in socially monogamous crustaceans.",

Our results showed that populations of female S. grammicus could be classified based on their morphological and reproductive traits. The first discriminant function, which corresponded to large heads and short forearms, was negatively correlated with environmental temperature. However, there was no relationship with precipitation or aridity index. Therefore, our results support the converse of Allen's rule, where short‐limbed lizards are favoured in warm climates, whereas long‐limbed lizards confer advantages in cold climates.

In Granicorium this layer forms low commarginal ribs while in Samarangia it forms more prominent radial features. Sand grains are cemented to the shell and to each other with growths of a crystalline aragonitic cement similar in morphology to inorganic marine cements. Both species secrete mucus layers at the growing shell margin which initially hold the sediment grains together and form a substrate for the nucleation and growth of calcium carbonate crystals. The ribs of Samarangia are formed by the accretion of successive sheets of spherulitic growths. In G. indutum , the middle and outermost of two inner mantle folds are large, glandular and capable of considerable extension beyond the shell margin. Mucus secreted by the folds contains abundant bacteria and small calcium carbonate crystals. It is proposed that initial nucleation of the calcium carbonate cement takes place within this biofilm possibly mediated by the bacteria. The function of the sand layers is unknown but predation resistance and protection of the shells from endobionts are the most likely possibilities.",

This outer layer surrounds an inner core region of the tooth, which only reaches the surface through a small window zone on the anterior surface and which contains large amounts of iron and phosphorus presumably in the form of iron(III) phosphate. The organic matrix, on which the teeth are constructed, consists of a zone of densely packed fine fibres at the surface of the tooth, underlain by larger fibres which become sparser deeper into the cusp. The core region is characterized by the presence of densely packed short fibres. In contrast to the situation found in most other species of chiton, large fibres of the organic matrix extend throughout the region of magnetite mineralization, leading to the suggestion that the matrix exerts more control over the mineralization of magnetite than has previously been thought.",

The posterior part of the testis is devoid of spermatogenic tissue and contains numerous efferent ducts filled with mature sperm. Cells in germinal cysts develop synchronously, sperm nuclei and flagella become oriented parallel in the late stages of spermiogenesis. In the caudal portion of the aspermatogenic part all sperms are arranged into unencapsulated sperm bundles — spermatozeugmata. Two types of spermatozeugmata are found both in the caudal portion of the testis and in milt. In the larger, spindle–shaped type, sperm flagella form the spindle tips. In the smaller ones, which have approximately a length of spermatozoon, the sperm are parallel and approximately in register. In both types sperm heads are arranged parallel. A mature spermatozoon is flail–shaped. The sperm head is highly elongated and situated alongside the flagellum, the tip of the head is directed backwards. Large mitochondria are situated on one side of the elongated nucleus only and form the tip of the head. Live spermatozoa move with the centriolar part ahead. Both testis and spermatozoon structure as well as formation of spermatozeugmata in M. barberi are highly derived features which perhaps evolved as adaptations to internal fertilization.",

Venom biosynthesis involves the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi stacks. The secretory product first appears at the hind‐limb larval stage in the form of aggregates of small granules or larger, more elaborate structures, both contained in Golgi stacks. Maturative evolution proceeds through the merging of these secretion storage bodies and leads to the remarkable morphological heterogeneity characteristic of the venom of premetamorphic larvae and juveniles. However, large structures, resulting from the aggregation of small granules arranged in a repeating pattern become the only secretory accumulation bodies found in fully developed glands. In juveniles, discrete amounts of venom were seen to be discharged through exocytosis into the exiguous gland lumen, which lies just beneath the intercalated tract. These findings strongly contrast the traditional pattern of holocrine release characteristic of anuran serous glands. The merocrine release of tiny venom particles is consistent with the regulative roles—relevant to the skin physiology—performed by component molecules of anuran cutaneous venoms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The blood supply to the interventricular septum of the heart was studied in a sample of 1634 specimens belonging to four rodent families, Cricetidae, Arvicolidae, Gliridae, and Muridae. Most specimens ( n = 1604) were examined using a corrosion‐cast technique, while the remaining 30 were studied by histological techniques. In 1417 cases the coronary artery pattern was normal, and the interventricular septum was fundamentally supplied by one or rarely two septal arteries arising from the right and/or left coronary arteries. In 72 specimens the right and left coronary arteries were normal, while the septal artery arose from a separate ostium in the aorta, behaving as a third coronary artery. The remaining 145 animals possessed anomalies in the origin of the coronary arteries, and the septum was also principally irrigated by a septal artery. In 5 of these 145 anomalous cases the septal artery originated from a separate ostium in the aorta. In all specimens examined a less important vascularization of the septum was established through thinner penetrating vessels originating from the right and/or left coronary arteries. Existence of one or rarely two septal arteries is the most constant feature of the coronary artery arrangement in rodents with intramyocardial coronary arteries.",

A central duct and a large blood vessel run close to each other along the length of these glands and both are surrounded by a layer of muscle cells. Three cell types form the glandular epithelium: granular cells, vacuolated cells and mucocytes. The granular cells possess cilia and spherical secretion granules, located primarily in the apical region. The granules of immature cells have a low electron density and are mainly formed by neutral polysaccharides with small amounts of proteins. The granules of mature cells are larger, have a high electron density and are mainly formed by proteins with lower amounts of neutral polysaccharides. Transition stages between immature and mature granular cells are observed. The vacuolated cells are large and frequently pyramidal in shape, but after the application of histochemical techniques almost all vacuoles remain uncoloured. The numerous vacuoles contain flocculent material in a clear background and the mitochondria possess large crystalline structures in the matrix. A pyramidal shape is also typical of the mucocytes, which are filled with vesicles containing granular masses surrounded by a network of secretion material. These large cells are strongly stained by Alcian blue, revealing the presence of acidic mucopolysaccharides. This is the first ultrastructural study of the salivary glands in opisthobranch gastropods.",

Since it is present in the most primitive vertebrates, the cyclostomes, it is of interest to look for a possible invertebrate anatomical equivalent, or precursor, for clues as to its evolution. We have found in six species of amphioxus, members of an invertebrate group (cephalochordates), considered to be closest to the vertebrates, that there is a morphologically equivalent neuro‐epithelial complex, that in many ways resembles the hypothalamo‐hypophyseal system of vertebrates. In the six amphioxus species described here the nervous element is a ventral lobe of the brain, the infundibulum, that extends downward along the right side of the notochord, and ends near the dorsal surface of a Rathke’s pouch‐like structure known as Hatschek’s pit. This part of Hatschek’s pit has been found earlier to contain a vertebrate LH‐like gonadotropin. Therefore, the infundibulum‐Hatschek’s pit system of amphioxus may be involved in regulating the seasonal reproductive cycle, and it appears to be a direct homologue of the vertebrate hypothalamo‐hypophyseal neurosecretory system functionally as well as morphologically.",

Additionally, in the dorsal region, multiple cone arrangements consisting of up to five members occur. Long single cones and triple cones were observed only sporadically throughout the retina. The incidence of short single cones as a regular element of the cone mosaic is restricted to the ventrotemporal area. The dominant pattern in the Osmerus retina is a pure or a twisted row pattern occurring in all regions. Ventrotemporally, however, square patterns were found as well. The highest cone densities occur in the peripheral ventrotemporal retina. These results indicate that the ventrotemporal region plays an important role in the vision of the smelt. The findings are discussed with respect to the photic habitat conditions and behavioural ecology of the smelt in Lake Hiidenvesi.",

As in the genital papilla of Mastotermes darwiniensis , a ventral sclerite pair is present, the gonopore is located ventroterminally on the phallic lobe, and the genital area is entirely symmetrical – suggesting that this may be the groundplan condition of Isoptera. The relations of the phallic lobe to surrounding components like the subgenital plate, paraprocts, and certain muscles and nerves indicate that the lobe of S. inopinus is homologous with the phallomeres of other Dictyoptera. The bilateral symmetry and simple structure, however, are in strong contrast to the asymmetry and high complexity found in male genitalia of Blattaria and Mantodea. The postabdominal nervous system of S. inopinus resembles that of the cockroach Periplaneta americana .

SEM studies of five vestimentiferan species reveal intraspecific and interspecific variation in the number of chaetigerous segments and the arrangement of uncini within a given segment. The portion of an uncinus that extends beyond the epidermis comprises two opposing groups of teeth that probably correspond to the capitium and subrostral process of polychaete uncini, and a distinct protuberance between them, interpreted as a rostrum. In Ridgeia piscesae , the uncini are formed by chaetal follicles, consisting of a chaetoblast, a follicle cell and an epidermis cell. The chaetal shaft is elongate and composed of up to 40 hollow cylinders that are invaded at their base by microvilli from the apical part of the chaetoblast. Opisthosomal chaetae in perviate Pogonophora are usually restricted to four per segment and are of a rod‐shaped type. It is hypothesized that the rod‐shaped chaetae represent reduced hooked chaetae probably derived from a condition such as found in Monilifera. Uncini of Pogonophora, Sabellida, Terebellida and Oweniida are considered homologous but details of chaetal design may be due to functional adaptations and thus do not represent reliable characters for phylogenetic studies on higher taxonomic levels than genera or potentially families.",

As many externae drop off, their number is continuously reduced; the survivors reach sexual maturity and ovulate after 2.5 months and complete embryonic development after 2 more months. At the next moult a new and more numerous generation of externae appears, and this is repeated until the crab dies. Presence of externae significantly prolongs the host's normal intermoult period and minimizes its growth. The parasite has little effect on the host's sexual characters although females are normally sterilized. The cuticle of the externa is moulted once, leaving a distinct annulus around the stalk. Spermatogonia are presumably injected by male cyprids into the female externa and develop into sperm within one or more vesicular spermatogenic bodies in its mantle. The eggs are laid through a single oviduct into the mantle cavity where they become fertilized and develop into cyprids that are liberated at the disintegration of the externa.",

They become vacuolated and later occupy the perivitelline compartment of each egg and embryo. In some species, their vacuoles contain submicroscopic granules or filaments called ‘ornaments’ and acidic glycosaminoglycans. These test cells deposit their products on the surface of the larval tunic in late embryogenesis. In these species, the test cells are lost at hatching. In other species, the test cell vacuoles contain acidic glycosaminoglycans, but no ornaments. In these species, the test cells attach to the larval tunic and probably secrete acidic glycosaminoglycans. We deprived the embryos of seven species of ascidians of their test cells and vitelline coats during midembryogenesis. After completing their development, the larvae of both kinds of species were hydrophobic. They easily become trapped on the surface of sea water in cultures. Normal larvae (controls), bearing test cell secretions, are hydrophilic and never become trapped. We infer that negatively charged secretions of the test cells make normal larvae hydrophilic. Some molgulids with direct development have no test cells, no fins and no swimming larva. We reason that the test cells of these species may have been lost during evolution because they no longer had an important role in preventing hydrophobicity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The strengths and weaknesses of phylogenetic analysis using computers are reviewed from the viewpoint of understanding crustacean evolution. Computerized methods require the explicit presentation of characters and character state homologies. New techniques allow investigators to design evolutionary models into a character data matrix, or to use evolutionary models that make minimal a priori assumptions. The computer analysis relieves the investigator from the highly repetitious testing of trees, allows the concentration on the character state data, and provides objective methods for comparing trees, primarily their length. These are regarded as the strengths of computerized methods. The weaknesses of these methods include the relatively inscrutable nature of the character data matrix compared with the overall ‘gestalt’ of resulting trees, the difficulties of defining discrete homologies within the Crustacea, especially for counts of segmentation, the lack of clear intermediate character states in some multistate segmental characters, and the inability to define evolutionary polarity. These difficulties may be overcome by analysing the data using the minimal assumption models of character evolution, and by a recognition that the trees are a result of the input data, and therefore the data should be criticized, rather than the trees themselves. A ‘consensus’ character data set, including most extant major groups of the Crustacea as well as several key fossils, was assembled and revised by the participants in the workshop. An artificial taxon, ‘ur‐crustacean characters’, was introduced to root the tree. Three observations may be made from parsimony analyses using several weighting and tree rooting methods. (1) The currently accepted large scale phylogeny and classification of the Crustacea is not corroborated. (2) The number of supposed plesiomorphic traits possessed by a taxon is not a good index for early derivation in crustacean evolution. (3) The taxon Maxillopoda is not supported by the arrangement of any of the trees.",

However valuable these earlier works may be, in some respects they proved to be insufficient for detailed comparisons with other polychaete families and some of their statements are quite contradictory. This prompted a re‐investigation of the central‐most parts of the nervous system of representatives of the families Polynoidae, Sigalionidae, Aphroditidae and Acoetidae. In the present paper, the brain commissures and the innervation of, inter alia , the antennae, the palps and the ommatophores (when present) in Lepidonotus squamatus, Harmothoe longisetis, Leanira (Sthenolepis) tetragona, Laetmonice producta benthaliana , and Panthalis oerstedi are described. Special attention is paid to the much‐debated question about the presence or absence of a palp ganglion. The results, summarized in schematic diagrams, are compared with corresponding observations of the brains of, above all, the ‘spiomorphic’ polychaetes. Using the first Remanian criterion for identifying homologies, equivalents in the aphroditacean brain and the central nervous system of ‘sedentary’ families are proposed. By this a broader base is established for the discussion regarding the fundamental constitution of the anterior end of the polychaetes and the structure and homologues of their cephalic appendages.",

The unpaired seminal receptacle is lined by a heavily ciliated epithelium and a non‐ciliated epithelium with short and broad microvilli. Euspermatozoa only are stored in the receptacle. They are densely packed and orientated with their heads towards the non‐ciliated epithelium. In this position they develop numerous extremely fine microvilli from the acrosome which apparently serve to attach them to the epithelial microvillar surface. Stored sperm may presumably remain functional for at least six months. A possible function of paraspermatozoa could be to clump sperm into sperm bags to keep them in suspension.",

Secretory differentiation causes the adenomere to assume the structure of a syncytium and triggers biosynthesis of the serous product (poison), consisting of granules with peculiar repeating substructure. The secretory granules resemble glomerular‐like aggregates of randomly orientated tubular subunits. This complex substructure derives from the rearrangement of the dense, compact material released by the Golgi apparatus in the form of small, membrane‐bounded particles. Both early and advanced features of P. biligonigerus poison closely resemble those found during serous gland development in the Italian treefrog Hyla intermedia . The similar aspects described during serous biosynthesis in these leptodactylid and hylid frogs suggest they are phylogenetically informative. On the other hand, the peculiar features of their poisons may reflect the differential patternings of their secretory repertories along the divergent phylogenetic paths, which led these frogs to be currently included in different families.",

The axoneme exhibits a 9 + 9 + 2 pattern with accessory tubules formed by 16 protofilaments and intertubular material. However, spermatozoa of A. formicaria show some remarkable features. The sperm cell is short for an insect, being only 50 µm in length. The nucleus is characterized by the presence of two lateral grooves which are filled with numerous infoldings of the nuclear envelope. In a cross‐section the chromatin has the configuration of the Leonardo da Vinci’s ‘Vitruvian man’. Each mitochondrial derivative has a peculiar structure with peripheral cristae and four crystalline bodies in its matrix; two of these crystalline bodies are large and have differently orientated cristal planes. At the end of spermiogenesis, sperm bundles are stored in the proximal part of the testes. Secretions from the epithelial wall of this region give rise to large globular structures. These include sperm bundles intermingled with dense granules, forming the so called ‘spermatolophids’. These formations descend along the deferent duct and are stored in the expanded seminal vesicle. Atelura spermatozoa do not pair as in some Lepismatidae, nor do they fuse as in Tricholepidion (Lepidotrichidae). Thus, sperm aggregation in Zygentoma is realized according to different modalities and can hardly be considered as a synapomorphic trait of its subtaxa.",

The orientation of hair cells was found to be similar to the general pattern for this macula described previously from fish to mammals. The calyceal hair cells, characterized by their embracing afferent nerve endings, are distributed in a single belt running parallel with the anterior and lateral borders of the macula in the examined reptiles. The number of hair cells in a large number of calyces was counted for some of the examined reptile species, and the total number of hair cells calculated in two specimens of a turtle, crocodile and snake utricular macula. In the turtle and snake maculae, the calyceal hair cells form about 10% of the total hair cell number, while the crocodiles, which were very young, only had 2% calyceal hair cells. The total number of hair cells was found to be much higher in the crocodiles than in the other reptiles examined. The presented data, as well as data from the literature of the avian and mammalian inner ear, indicate that the number of this very sensitive hair cell type in the utricular macula is independent of locomotion type.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The bizarre watering pot shells of the clavagellid bivalve Brechites comprise a calcareous tube encrusted frequently with sand grains and other debris, the anterior end of which terminates in a convex perforated plate (the ‘watering pot’). It has not proved easy to understand how such extreme morphologies are produced. Previously published models have proposed that the tube and ‘watering pot’ are formed separately, outside the periostracum, and fuse later. Here we present the results of a detailed study of the structure and repair of the tubes of Brechites vaginiferus which suggest that these models are not correct. Critical observations include the fact that the external surface of the tube and ‘watering pot’ are covered by a thin organic film, on to the inner surface of which the highly organized aragonite crystals are secreted. There is no evidence of a suture between the tube and the ‘watering pot’ or that the periostracum of the juvenile shell passes through the wall of the tube. Live individuals of B. vaginiferus are able to repair substantial holes in the tube or ‘watering pot’ by laying down a new organic film followed by subsequent calcareous layers. Brechites vaginiferus displays Type C mantle fusion, with the result that the whole animal is encased by a continuous ring of mantle and periostracum, thereby making it possible to secrete a continuous ‘ring’ of shell material. On the basis of these observations we suggest that watering pot shells are not extra‐periostracal but are the product of simple modification of ‘normal’ shell‐secreting mechanisms.",

The spermatheca, which is the only gland in the cloaca, consists of a mass of exocrine, acinar tubules which empty individually and dorsolaterally into the posterior part of the cloacal tube and all but the most posterior part of the cloacal chamber. Stored sperm are most abundant in the spermathecal tubules during the peak of the breeding season (in May and June); during their period of storage, the sperm do not appear to make intimate contact with the epithelial cells lining the spermathecal tubules. Longterm storage of viable sperm from one breeding season to the next is probably absent in the smooth newt. Sperm storage by and multiple insemination of females both occur in this species and are necessary preconditions for competition between the sperm of different males for the fertilization of eggs. However, sperm competition has not been demonstrated in the smooth newt.",

On the other hand, ripe functional eggs appear in the ovary in May, i.e. the breeding season. The eggs deposited into the nest do not develop even when the hybrids display the same mating behavior as their parents. Functional sperms are found in the testis of the hybrid between female landlocked and male marine forms at the period of breeding. However, only a single female lived until March. In the ovary of this female, all eggs reaching vitellogenesis (= primary yolk globule stage) are collapsed, while the younger oocytes appear in healthy condition.

    "abstract": "Abstract The olfactory organs of craniates appear to derive from an anterior pair of erstwhile branchiothyria and their adjacent epidermal, neurogenic placodes. The organ is termed saccus nasalis if its source is the ectobranchial invagination of the branchiothyrium, and the saccus rhinalis if its source is the entobranchial evagination of the branchiothyrium. Nasal sacs occur in gnathostomes and lampreys, and rhinal sacs in hagfish. It is difficult, therefore, to avoid the conclusion that the olfactory organ has evolved more than once. The rhinal sac has only one aperture, the postica, which represents an internal branchiothyric orifice. Partial fusion of the right and the left rhinal sac led to the development of a postica communis. The nasal sac has either one, two or three apertures. Altogether there are nine different aperturae sacci nasalis, viz. the naris, the foris, the tremiscus, the two nariculae, the rimilla, the portula, the opiscus and the janua. The janua represents an external branchiothyric orifice and occurs in lampreys. The naris and the foris arose by subdivision of the orifice from which the janua emanated; they are found in osteolepipods. The naris is also found in urodeles, porolepiforms and some teleosts. The incurrent and excurrent naricules resulted from bipartition of a naris and are present in actinopterygians, coelacanthiforms, brachiopterygians, dipnoans and elasmobranchiomorphs. Of the four remaining openings of the nasal sacs the rimilla results from an inpushing of the epidermis, the portula from an outpocketing of the nasal sac, and the tremiscus from a combination of two such movements, the one inward and the other outward. Rimillae occur in cyprinodonts, anurans, urodeles, caecilians and porolepiforms, portulae in uranoscopids and bathydraconids, and tremisci in urodeles and porolepiforms. The opiscus, finally, is the opening through which the vomeronasal organ communicates with the oral cavity. It occurs in most lizards and snakes and probably also in some mammals.",

Both the SCO and the IFO are areas of specialized secretory ependymal cells. Recently the SCO‐secretion of many vertebrate species has been studied immunocytochemically by use of different antisera against RF‐material from cows. The present investigation with the PAP‐technique showed that these antisera give a positive immunocytochemical reaction with the secretion of the IFO of amphioxus. The results indicate molecular similarities of compounds present in both the SCO‐secretion and the IFO‐secretion. The conception that the SCO and the IFO are descendants from a single large glandular area in the brain vesicle of an ancient chordate ancestor is emphasized by these findings",

By day 20, the mouth and anal openings appear. The cuticular lining in the anterior part of the gut rudiment has an endodermal origin and differentiates before the mouth is formed. The rest of the gut lining is composed of enterocytes typical of holothuroid intestine. At the early stages of development, mitotic figures are encountered among nonspecialized cells of the gut primordium. In more developed digestive epithelium, vesicular enterocytes are capable of mitotic division. Dividing enterocytes retain secretory vacuoles; thus mitosis occurs in actually differentiated cells. After mouth and anus formation, the oesophagus, stomach, intestine and rectum can be distinguished. In the wall of the stomach, powerful musculature is formed.",

The ductus epididymidis of this lizard is differentiated along its length into four histologically distinct zones, initial segment, caput, corpus and cauda.

The epithelium consists of six different cell types, principal, narrow, apical, clear, basal and intraepithelial leucocytes as in the mammals. Principal cells, basal cells and intraepithelial leucocytes are present along the entire length. Narrow cells and apical cells are confined to the initial segment whereas clear cells occur in the cauda only. The principal cells from the initial segment to the corpus produce biphasic secretion granules measuring 1–2 µm in diameter.

    "abstract": "Abstract In molluscan taxa inhabiting marine environments oviparity and reproduction via planktonic larvae is predominant while incubation and viviparity is most frequently found in taxa inhabiting brackish or freshwater aquatic habitats. Brooding has evolved repeatedly and independently in several limnic taxa among Bivalvia and Gastropoda. However, among basommatophoran gastropods no such cases were yet known. We here report on a unique reproductive strategy involving brood care in the lacustrine freshwater limpet genus Protancylus , endemic to the ancient lakes on central Sulawesi (former Celebes), Indonesia, namely the Lake Poso and the Malili lake system, because this constitutes the first known case of this behaviour among the Basommatophora. Protancylus live exclusively as epizoans on those pachychilid gastropods of the viviparous genus Tylomelania , also a Sulawesi endemic species, that inhabit mostly soft substrates. We found that the two known species Protancylus pileolus from Lake Poso and P. adhaerens from the Malili lake system both retain gelatinous egg strings underneath their outer mantle, where up to 15 (mostly eight or nine) shelled juveniles are brooded. Nourishment is provided within the egg capsule only. Thus, brood care in Protancylus resembles the reproductive strategy found recently among pachychilid gastropods Jagora from the Philippines, but differs from euviviparous (i.e. matrotrophic) incubation among thiarid gastropods possessing a brood pouch with juveniles being nourished via a ‘pseudoplacenta’ in several taxa.",

The neurons are innervated by dopaminergic “boutons en passant” often very active with a high number of electron translucent vesicles as well as dense-core vesicles (90 nm).

    "abstract": "Abstract The male reproductive tract of Leucoptera coffeella was processed for light and transmission electron microscopy. In the testis, the eupyrene cells are arranged in individual cysts, while the apyrene cysts form aggregates, never observed in other Lepidoptera. Both cysts contain 128 spermatozoa, which differ from the typical pattern. In the seminal vesicle, both types of spermatozoa are dispersed in the lumen, also different from other Lepidoptera. The apyrene spermatozoa are similar to those observed for other Lepidoptera. They present an anterior region covered by a dense cap and the flagellum is composed of a 9 + 9 + 2 axoneme and two mitochondrial derivatives. The eupyrene spermatozoa, however, differ from the typical pattern for Lepidoptera. Their anterior region contains a nucleus, an acrosome and a peculiar arc of eight accessory microtubules connected to the plasma membrane by dense bridges. In the nucleus–flagellum region, the ninth accessory microtubule is assembled between both mitochondrial derivatives, to participate in the axoneme. The flagellum comprises a 9 + 9 + 2 axoneme and two mitochondrial derivatives with paracrystalline cores. External to the plasma membrane and close to the accessory microtubules, there are tufts of an amorphous material, suggesting reduced lacinate appendages, while the reticular ones are absent. The reduction of lacinate appendages and the absence of sperm bundles in the seminal vesicle support the concept that the appendages of other Lepidoptera could be associated with the eupyrene aggregations. The characters ‘number of spermatozoa per cyst’ and ‘absence of bundles’ should be considered plesiomorphic, supporting the position of this taxon in the base of the Ditrysia.",

While spermiogenesis was similar to that described for other insects, some differences were noted. For example granular material did not assemble around the centriole to form a centriolar adjunct but did accumulate in the cytoplasm of early spermatids adjacent to a region of the nuclear membrane where nuclear pores were aggregated. In late spermatids this material accumulated anterior to the mitochondrial derivatives in a developing postero‐lateral nuclear groove. While this material has been named the ‘centriolar adjunct’ by previous authors, its formation away from the centriole raises questions about its true identity. Second, during acrosome maturation an ante‐acrosomal region of cytoplasm develops. Although present in later spermatids, this region is lost in spermatozoa. Interspecific variations in chromatin condensation patterns and the number of microtubule layers encircling the spermatid nucleus during spermiogenesis were noted.",

Statistical analyses of the measurements of these characters show that this hypertrophy has only very little correlation to the size of the individual, and that the above sex characters have marked variation in a population having the same body length. The hypertrophy of these structures is more linked with the extent of development of the androgenic gland. Also, in such individuals, the androgenic gland shows signs of increased secretory activity as evidenced by increase in size of the cells, vacuolisation of cytoplasm and presence of degenerative areas. It is suggested that there is a direct relation between the secretory activity of the androgenic gland and the hypertrophy of these structures i.e. there is a “cause and effect” relation between the androgenic gland and the primary and secondary sex characters.",

The functions of the gland and its fate during the larva‐to‐juvenile metamorphosis have long been controversial. Here we use a fixative including ruthenium red to preserve extracellular secretions (presumably glycoproteins) in late pre‐metamorphic larvae. This procedure reveals reddish, fibrogranular material in the lumen of the club‐shaped gland and in the pharynx adjacent to the gland's inner opening. This finding strengthens the idea that secretions of the club‐shaped gland are exported to the pharyngeal lumen to help form a mucous trap for capturing food particles entering the mouth. We also use the terminal desoxynucleotidyl transferase‐mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay to study apoptosis in the tissues of metamorphosing larvae. One of the earliest events of metamorphosis is the massive apoptotic destruction of the club‐shaped gland. Therefore, despite some previous opinions to the contrary, the cells of the gland do not survive to participate in the genesis of the definitive endostyle or any other post‐larval structures.",

Although early anatomical studies confirmed the cerithioid organization of this clade, their close relationship to other lake species was not consistently recognized. In several recent cladistic analyses based on molecular data, the higher taxonomic placement and sister group relationships of syrnolopsines have been unstable. The present analysis confirms that syrnolopsines possess a spermatophore‐forming organ – a synapomorphy of the Paludomidae – corroborating their placement in this family. Consistent with the molecular data, syrnolopsine monophyly is supported by two characters that occur exclusively in this group (salivary gland ducts that bypass the nerve ring and a linear albumen gland). Several characters in Martelia tanganyicensis – the most diminutive syrnolopsine – are only evident in the smallest lake species thus far investigated ( Bridouxia , Stormsia ) namely reduction of ctenidial leaflets, sorting area, intestine length and number of statoconia. These features are interpreted as being correlated with reduction in size. Nevertheless, close examination reveals differences in detail that allow more refined hypotheses of homology and are consistent with their independent origin.",

The Discodorididae species investigated shared a cobweb‐like network and papillae supported by a ring of spicules, while the Porostomata showed consistent characters leading to a lattice‐like network with larger spicules in the central notum.

The salivary glands display a distinct sexual dimorphism. The female has only two small sac‐like glands located in the prothorax, while the male possesses six long tubular glands extending into the sixth abdominal segment. The male salivary glands can be divided into five distinct regions. The apical long, thin secretory region possesses numerous secretory cells containing large secretory vesicles; the salivary reservoir expands in diameter, accumulating and temporarily storing the saliva in addition to secreting saliva; the constricted region contains prismatic cells with complex infolded plasma membrane; the sac has an internal brush border to absorb water and ions; the common salivary duct contains longitudinal muscles in the male, but not in the female. The salivary pump possesses independent strong dorsal muscles and abundant internal palm spines near its orifice.

This work describes the foregut ossicles of Aegla uruguayana , which have been proposed to impart trophic characteristics. In addition, stomach contents were analysed using Index of Relative Importance and Weighted Result Index to characterize the diet. The Pearre index was applied to analyse trophic selectivity. We found A. uruguayana has a morphological foregut typical of macrophage organisms. Stomach contents included items typical of omnivorous, generalist and opportunistic feeding modes. Vegetal remains included algae (filamentous, unicellular and colonial morphotypes), insect larvae, oligochaetes, microcrustaceans (copepods and cladocerans), mites, tardigrades, juveniles of A. uruguayana and rotifers. Morphological descriptions of the foregut can reveal feeding habits and provide data on the possible trophic profile of a species, while guiding the selection of appropriate methodology for subsequent analysis. Our stomach content data corroborated the foregut description, but the presence of small prey suggested A. uruguayana utilizes both predation and detritivory trophic strategies.",

Ces transformations cycliques se produisent deux fois en 24 heures. Le passage des cellules d'une forme cubique à une forme étoilée a été décrit. Cependant la destinée des cellules libérées reste encore hypothétique et le problème d'une fonction exocrine ou d'une fonction endocrine de la glande est posé. La tunique fibreuse associée à la membrane entourant les lames glandulaires a été décrite et son rôle dans le transfert à la glande de granules de neurosécrétion en provenance des extrémités axoniques a été envisagé. Abstract The neural complex of Ciona intestinalis has been fixed every two hours between 2 a.m. and 12 p.m. During this period, the neural gland undergoes morphological changes, turning from an epithelial structure (reticulate stage) to a mesenchymal structure (compact stage). After the elimination of part of the cellular material which had been disrupted and accumulated in the central area of the gland, it recovers an epithelial structure, starting from the periphery (peripheric reticulate stage). These cyclic changes occur twice in 24 hours. The ultrastructural changes that characterize the transformation from cubic to stellate shape of the glandular cells have been described. However the fate of the loose cells is still hypothetical and the question of the exocrine or endocrine function of the gland remains unanswered. The fibrous tunic associated with the membrane around the glandular laminae has been described and its possible role in the transfer of neurosecretory granules from the axonic endings to the neural gland is discussed.",

Molluscs, especially bivalves, represented the most important item on the diet of this species, followed by organic matter. The characteristics of the digestive tract as well as the dietary pattern, suggest that L. lentiginosa is able to explore bottom food resources, being classified as benthophagous with a tendency to malacophagy, and utilizing organic matter as an associated or additional food resource. Loricariidae species are able to use not only algae, sediment and detritus, but also plant and invertebrate items.",

The spermiogenesis of Anonchotaenia globata starts with the formation of a differentiation zone with two centrioles associated with thin striated roots. One of the centrioles gives rise to a free flagellum followed by a slight flagellar rotation and a proximodistal fusion of the flagellum with the cytoplasmic protrusion. This pattern corresponds to Type III spermiogenesis in cestodes. The spermatozoon consists of five distinct regions. The anterior extremity possesses an apical cone and a single helically coiled crested body. The cortical microtubules are spirally arranged. The axoneme is surrounded by a periaxonemal sheath and a thin layer of cytoplasm filled with electron‐dense granules in Regions I–V. The periaxonemal sheath is connected with the peripheral microtubules by transverse intracytoplasmic walls in Regions III and IV. The nucleus is spirally coiled around the axoneme. Anonchotaenia globata differs from Dilepididae (where paruterinids have previously been classified) in the type of spermiogenesis, the lack of glycogen inclusions and the presence of intracytoplasmic walls. The pattern of spermiogenesis is similar to that in Metadilepididae and Taeniidae, which are considered phylogenetically close to Paruterinidae.",

The anterior oesophagus of Bulla striata was investigated with light and electron microscopy. In the most anterior region, the ridges of the oesophageal wall are covered by a ciliated columnar epithelium forming large apical blebs which are released into the lumen, an activity that is particularly intense in the oesophageal pouch. In the last two‐thirds of the anterior oesophagus, the epithelium is covered with microvilli embedded in a cuticle, but apocrine secretion and cilia are absent. Subepithelial secretory cells are very abundant in the oesophageal wall, except in the roof of the pouch. They have a long neck that crosses the epithelium, whereas the cell body containing the nucleus is embedded in the connective tissue. Large electron‐lucent secretory vesicles and many Golgi stacks fill most of their cytoplasm. The histochemical and cytochemical assays show that these cells secrete acid mucopolysaccharides. With the current and future studies we aim to obtain data for the establishment of relationships between morphofunctional features of the digestive system and food types in cephalaspideans. Additionally, the new data about the oesophageal pouch of B. striata may be useful for the establishment of eventual homologies with the oesophageal diverticula of other opisthobranchs.",

Spermatogenesis in Boccardiella hamata (Polychaeta: Spionidae) from the Sea of Japan: sperm formation mechanisms as characteristics for future taxonomic revision. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 477–456. To characterize novel features that will be useful in the discussion and validation of the spionid polychaete Boccardiella hamata from the Sea of Japan, the successive stages of spermatogenesis were described and illustrated. Spermatogonia, spermatocytes and early spermatids are aflagellar cells that develop synchronously in clusters united by a cytophore. At the middle spermatid stage, the clusters undergo disintegration and spermatids produce flagella and float separately in coelomic fluid as they transform into sperm. Spermatozoa are filiform. The ring‐shaped storage platelets are located along the anterior nuclear area. The nucleus is cupped by a conical acrosome. A nuclear plate is present between the acrosome and nucleus. The nucleus is a cylinder with the implantation fossa throughout its length and with the anterior part of the flagellum inside the fossa. There is only one centriole, serving as a basal body of the flagellum, situated in close vicinity of the acrosomal area. A collar of four mitochondria is located under the nuclear base. The ultrastructure of B. hamata spermatozoa from the Sea of Japan appears to be close to that of B. hamata from Florida described by Rice (Microscopic Anatomy of Invertebrates, Wiley‐Liss, Inc., New York, 1992), suggesting species identity of the samples from the two regions. However, more detailed study of Florida’s B. hamata sperm is required for a reliable conclusion concerning the similarity of these two polychaetes. In addition to sperm structure, features such as the cytophore‐assigned pattern of spermatogenic cell development, the synchronous pattern of cell divisions, the non‐flagellate early spermatogenic stages, and the vesicle amalgamation that drives meiotic cell cytokinesis and spermatid diorthosis will likely be useful in future testing of the validity of B. hamata and sibling species throughout the world.",

The postanal tail of the enteropneust Saccoglossus kowalevskii is a ciliary creeping organ without distinct similarities to the chordate tail. —Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 92: 150–160. The postanal tail of chordates is one of the key characters in chordate evolution and it has been suggested to be homologous to the postanal tail of harrimaniid enteropneusts. We present electron microscopic data of the ontogeny of the postanal tail in the enteropneust Saccoglossus kowalevskii. The postanal tail develops as a ventral posterior allometric outgrowth with a ventral extension of the telotroch. Transmission electron microscopy of serial sections reveals the epidermal organization of the postanal tail with the exception of short, bilaterally symmetric extensions of the paired metacoels. The epidermis cells are connected by apical junctions, rest basally on the extracellular matrix surrounding the mesoderm, and possess a basiepidermal nerve net. The ventral cells in the postanal tail are multiciliated and used for creeping. Dorsal cells are monociliated with numerous microvilli. Two types of glandular cells are present among the epidermis cells. The mesoderm cells contain myofilaments. We were unable to detect anatomical structures similar to the ones present in the postanal locomotory tail of chordates, such as notochord, neural tube, or endodermal strand. Thus, results of our anatomical study do not support homology of the postanal chordate tail and the postanal tail of harrimaniid enteropneusts.",

Hemidactylus mabouia is a common species in Brazil, which facilitates its use in research in several areas and allows display it as a benchmark for studies with reptiles. To study the morphology of the stomach of H. mabouia, we carried out anatomical, histological and histochemical analysis. The stomach of H. mabouia is 'J' shaped and can be divided into oral fundic (OF), aboral fundic (AF) and pyloric regions. The surface epithelium is composed of mucosecretory cells (MC) containing neutral mucins. In the lamina propria of the OF region, are large ramified tubulo-acinar glands, which become smaller, less ramified and more tubular towards the AF region, and are simple tubular and short in the pyloric region. The fundic glands contain differentiated neck and pit. The neck is composed of MC containing neutral mucins and the pit is made of oxyntopeptic cells (OC). The OC of the OF region contained many zymogen granules, while those of the AF region contained few zymogen granules and many mitochondria, which suggests the existence of a gradient of pepsinogen and hydrochloric acid secretion. Pyloric glands consisted of MC containing neutral mucins and both argyrophil and argentaffin endocrine cells.",

We identified a proliferation phase and an epithelial morphogenesis in mid‐gestational fetuses, an intermediate period of cell differentiation in at‐term fetuses and a posterior stage of physiological maturation in adults. According to histochemistry, the diverse GP s elaborated and secreted into the duodenum show a high degree of histochemical complexity related to the multiple functions of mucus in the digestive tract.

Compared to other species, S. rostrum is characterized by the absence of several longitudinal and circular muscles (e.g. musculus longitudinalis capitis, corona sphincter and pars coronalis). A reconstruction of the mastax musculature revealed a total number of seven paired and two unpaired mastax muscles.

Four anatomically distinct regions compose the oviduct of E. miliaris including the anterior and posterior infundibulum, glandular uterus, non‐glandular uterus and pouch. The cells of the oviductal epithelium secrete material by apocrine and merocrine processes, which vary between the anatomical regions and according to each phase of the reproductive cycle. The infundibular epithelium secretes electron dense vacuoles, which suggests the production of lipids, whereas the epithelial secretion of the glandular uterus, non‐glandular uterus and pouch creates lucent and slightly electron dense vacuoles, indicating the production of glycoproteins. The timing of mating, vitellogenesis and sperm storage directly influences the morphofunctional alterations in the oviducts of E. miliaris . Sperm storage occurs only in the infundibular receptacles with increased production of the neutral carbohydrates in the presence of male gametes. Sperm storage happens in vitellogenic, non‐vitellogenic and pregnant females of E. miliaris . Thus, females may be able to produce multiple clutches at different seasons of the year regardless of mating during autumn.",

Anatomically, the uterus has two horns each one continued with a short cervix devoid of glands. The structure of the uterus is like that of other species; however, the proportion and size of its glands varies according to the physiological state. In viscacha, there is no uterine body and cervices cannot be differentiated externally. The formation of two sack bottoms is determined by the presence of a middle raphe in the cranial portion of the vagina. The so‐described anatomy is different from that described in other hystricognathi such as guinea pig and coypu. The cervix presents two microscopically differentiable regions: the endocervix and the ectocervix lined by epithelia with different characteristics. The general characteristics of the uterus of L. maximus do not show specific differences with those of other mammals that might explain its peculiar gestation.",

External and internal features of the female postabdomen of Nannochorista neotropica are described in detail. The conditions found in females of Nannochoristidae come closest to the ground plan of Mecopterida. This lineage is characterised by telescoping postabdominal segments, a presumptive autapomorphic feature that is modified in some antliophoran groups, but displayed by the nannochoristid species in a typical manner. More potential autapomorphies of Mecopterida, all present in Nannochoristidae, are the neo‐formation of an intersegmental muscle, a transverse muscle spanning between the genital appendages of segment VIII, a muscle connecting these appendages and the genital chamber and the loss of an intersegmental muscle. Plesiomorphic features of Nannochoristidae are the presence of paired genital appendages on segments VIII and IX. Information on the egg‐depositing substrates of the females is not available. The telescoping postabdomen is suitable for oviposition in soft substrates such as moist soil, or rotten plant materials in the riparian zone, and this is possibly a ground‐plan feature of Mecopterida. The results of recent phylogenetic analyses based on morphological data support a placement of Nannochoristidae in Antliophora, whereas the exact position of the group remains ambiguous. No characters of the female postabdomen were found supporting the monophyly of Mecoptera as conventionally circumscribed, that is Nannochoristidae + Boreidae + Pistillifera.",

Each ovariole is subdivided into an anterior trophic chamber (tropharium) containing six or seven large trophocytes and a posterior vitellarium harbouring one oocyte which is connected with the trophic chamber via a nutritive cord. No terminal filament is present. Late‐stage adult females show synchronized development of the ovarioles, while in undernourished females, a small proportion of ovarioles proceed to maturity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Epidermal rodlet cells were evaluated after treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate. Treatment of sunfish explant cell cultures with the inhibitor triggered a contraction of the rodlet cells and expulsion of cell contents. Time‐lapse video differential interference contrast ( DIC ) microscopy was used to evaluate rodlet cell contraction and rodlet discharge. Three general steps in pervanadate triggered discharge were identified. First the rodlet cell undergoes a constriction of the midsection. Constriction is followed by a rapid forward movement of rodlets and sacs to the apical end of cell, culminating in discharge of rodlets and other cellular contents, including the nucleus. A ring‐shaped structure around the apical pore was identified with DIC microscopy. Fluorescent‐labeled phalloidin and antibodies to alpha‐actinin and phosphotyrosine strongly stained the apical ring. A diffuse granular staining for both antibodies was also observed throughout the fibrous capsule. The results suggest that tyrosine kinases play a role in rodlet cell contraction. Alpha‐actinin is a known substrate for tyrosine kinases and is a potential target for triggering rodlet cell contraction and rodlet ejection. Modification of alpha‐actinin tyrosines could also be a mechanism for regulating the structural integrity of the fibrous capsule.",

Both at an early and a late larval stage, the oesophageal goblet cells reacted more intensely than those of the rest of the digestive tract, and only the oesophagus exhibited metachromasia with toluidine blue techniques at different pH s, thus revealing diverse GP s at different concentrations. The GP s histochemical composition in the intestine varied with the developmental stage and the intestinal zone. The absence of goblet cells characterized the foregut; however, they started differentiation at an advanced stage in the midgut. These cells could be detected in the hindgut both at the beginning and at the end of development. The attached glands showed a varied glycoprotein composition. The digestive tract of E . anchoita presented a high level of complexity, related to the multiple functions of mucus in the digestive tract, such as lubrication, protection, antimicrobial function and ionic and osmotic regulation.",

Prior to gonadal differentiation, germ cells and enveloping support cells reside within an inpocketing of the coelomic epithelium. Separation of the germinal and interstitial compartments of the gonad by a basement membrane is apparent from early gonadal development. Upon ovarian differentiation, oogonia undergo cyst‐forming divisions leading to the formation of clusters of interconnected cystocytes that synchronously enter meiosis, becoming oocytes. At the pachytene step, each oocyte becomes individualized by cytoplasmic extensions of prefollicle cells, thereby developing as an ovarian follicle. Subsequent somatic reorganization leads to the formation of the ovarian lumen in a cephalo‐caudal gradient. As a result, the germinal epithelium becomes internalized and lines the ovarian lumen. As defined by its origin from the germinal epithelium, the ovarian follicle is composed of an oocyte and the surrounding follicle cells. Thecal cells derived from the stroma encompass the basement membrane outside the follicle, thus forming a follicle complex. A common basement membrane is shared by the germinal epithelium and the follicle complex along a small portion of its surface. This point of attachment represents the site at which the oocyte would be released to the ovarian lumen during ovulation.",

In this study, we identified various haemocyte types and their distribution in the common salp Thalia democratica by comparative observations under light and electron microscopy and by histochemical, histoenzymatic and immunohistochemical techniques. By comparing specialisations with those of ascidian haemocytes, we detected an undifferentiated cell type (lymphocyte‐like cell) and three categories with four cell types, that is, (i) phagocytic line (hyaline amoebocyte and amoebocyte with large vacuoles), (ii) mast cell‐like line (granular cell) and (iii) storage cells (nephrocyte). Both phagocytes and granular cells appear to migrate in the tunic. Phagocytes adhere to the tunic which internally covers the oral siphon, where they probably function as sentinel cells of the pharynx. Results show the variety of haemolymph cells in the salp similar to phlebobranch ascidians.",

Histology and electron microscopy show that dark‐grey areas of the skin derived from dermal chromatophores localized in specific areas present underneath the epidermis. A dynamic chromatophoric unit in the dermis is absent. In the darkest areas of the skin, the accumulation of melanosomes in cells of the beta‐layer contributes to increase the black intensity. In the orange‐pink areas, the superficial dermis contains xantophores storing numerous carotenoid vesicles, rare or absent lamellated pterinosomes and a variable number of melanosomes. These xanto‐melanophores predominate over the remaining chromatophores and form a continuous stratum underneath the epidermis. Beneath this lipoid‐rich stratum, iridophores are infrequent and do not form a continuous layer in the dermis. In the paler areas of the skin, melanophores are sparse in both superficial and deeper part of the dermis where irregularly oriented bundles of collagen fibrils are present. The prevalent xanto‐melanophores localized in the pink‐orange areas of the skin contribute to an effective sunlight protection in desert conditions in addition to the darker regions occupied by melanophores.",

The jaw apparatus and suspensorium of adult Tetraodontiformes are well adapted to a durophagous feeding habit. Anatomical indicators are the short, stout jaws and a suspensorium in which the quadrate lies in the same vertical plane as the autopalatine. In contrast, the palatoquadrate of larval Tetraodontiformes generally resembles that of larval percomorphs – a more posteriorly positioned quadrate and a slender and long Meckelian cartilage. Among Tetraodontiformes, the Triacanthodidae retain a protrusible upper jaw and a versatile suspensorium. The jaws of the Balistoidei have greater mobility achieved by a reduced autopalatine that has lost its bony contact with the suspensorium. In contrast to the Balistoidei, the beak‐like jaws of the Tetraodontoidei lack individual teeth in the biting part of the jaws. The autopalatine is enlarged, which results in immobilization of the ethmopalatine articulation. The Ostraciidae are exceptional in having the distal part of the autopalatine reduced, while the proximal part remains attached to the suspensorium.",

The photocytes have an elongated, thin and flattened shape and are located inside a cup‐shaped structure, made up of the reflector and the pigmented layer.

    "abstract": "Abstract Spatial and temporal shifts in biometric features were examined in three common deep‐water pennatulacean corals (sea pens) from the Northwest Atlantic: Anthoptilum grandiflorum , Halipteris finmarchica and Pennatula aculeata . These three species show different morphological characters and adaptations to their environment. Analyses of colony length, ratio of peduncle to colony length, weight/length ratio, polyp size and density as well as sclerite shape, location and abundance indicate that their phenotype is modulated by environmental factors (e.g. food availability, currents and sediment type) and antipredator strategies. Moreover, the three species had different carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures that could be explain primarily by their different polyp diameters and colony shapes, suggesting that they rely on slightly different food sources (varying proportions of phytodetritus and zooplankton). Finally, sclerites were found only in H. finmarchica and P. aculeata and are not known to occur in A. grandiflorum , except for minute oval bodies inside the peduncle. The Mg/Ca ratio of sclerites differed between the two species and, for P. aculeata , among types of sclerites, evoking different biomineralization pathways related to their functional roles (structural support or defence). Overall, this study provides new information on the ecology of poorly known species, which are ubiquitous and suspected to play an important ecological role in deep‐water ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A human‐mediated invasion of a temperate rodent Microtus rossiaemeridionalis on the High Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard in the first half of the 20th century provides an opportunity to explore extent and rate of morphological divergence over decades of isolation. We studied dental size and morphology in 124 voles captured on Svalbard (Spitsbergen) in 1997–2005 and compared the data to mainland conspecific populations across northern Eurasia. Both dental and cranial sizes in the Svalbard population fall within the limits of natural variation of the species. Dental morphology suggests that the population experiences strong effects of isolation as indicated by the significant increase in the frequency of rare dental morphs, possibly caused by inbreeding. No evidence for directional shift towards increased or decreased complexity of the morphotype dental patterns is revealed. Although the population on Svalbard is phenotypically different from the mainland populations (due to increased frequency of rare morphs), those differences are not enough to support the idea of initial rapid evolution related to colonization. The limited spatial extent and environmental homogeneity of suitable habitats on the island allowed the species to initially multiply but not to diversify so that the species exhibits phenotypic conservatism but suffers the consequences of small population size.",

We found axial receptor cells confirming the previously assumed sensory function of epidermal organs. Our analyses also revealed six types of secretory cells. Some secretory cells types are capable of secreting filamentous and amorphous secretion in two different ways simultaneously (bimodal secretion). The high diversity of cell types, the complex pattern of acinar units, and the absence of a common gland pore make epidermal organs of Phascolion unique amongst sipunculans ( Phascolion type). Our reconstruction of the evolution of the epidermal organs of Sipuncula revealed that Phascolion ‐type epidermal organs may have derived from either Golfingia‐, Sipunculus‐ or Phascolosoma‐ type epidermal organs. The oldest known sipunculans were Golfingia ‐like and had epidermal organs, which might resemble the architecture of the Golfingia ‐type epidermal organs in extant taxa. Thus, it can be hypothesized that bimodal secretory cells (e.g. basophilic secretory cells) were part of the sipunculan ground pattern. Moreover, bimodal secretory cells of Phascolion look strikingly similar to those found in various annelid glands and thus might even be part of the ground pattern of stem species of Sipuncula + Pleistoannelida.",

Surprisingly, eagles lack a deep layer to the pectoralis found in other soaring species. Additionally, the pectoralis as well as other shoulder muscles had few to no slow muscle fibers. The lack of functionally meaningful numbers of slow muscle fibers in eagle flight muscles indicates that they must rely on fast fibers for posture; these can function in that role due to their high aerobic capacity and also perhaps a \"tuning\" of muscle contraction frequency to function more efficiently at isometric contractions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The bat Corynorhinus mexicanus provides an interesting experimental model for the study of epididymal sperm maturation because after spermatogenesis and the regression of the testes, this bat stores sperm in the epididymal cauda for several months. Earlier research conducted by our group suggested that sperm maturation in this species must be completed in the caudal region of the epididymis. One of the major signal transduction events during sperm maturation is the tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm proteins. The aim of the present study was to comparatively evaluate tyrosine phosphorylation in spermatozoa obtained from the caput, corpus and cauda of the epididymis during the sperm storage period. The maturation status of the sperm was determined by the percentage of capacitation and tyrosine phosphorylation in sperm obtained from the epididymis. The highest proportion of tyrosine phosphorylation was registered after the sperm had reached the cauda epididymis during the middle of the storage period. In conclusion, in Corynorhinus mexicanus and most likely in other chiropteran species with an asynchronous male reproductive pattern, epididymal sperm maturation ends in the caudal region of the epididymis and is related to the time that the sperm remains in the epididymis before mating activity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mental glands are sexually dimorphic glands found in the skin of the submandibular region in males of many species in the salamander family Plethodontidae. These glands have been demonstrated to secrete pheromones that increase female receptivity to courtship and mating. A number of studies exist on the morphology of mental glands at the light microscopy level, but ultrastructural studies on the glands exist for only two species, Eurycea quadridigitata and Hydromantes italicus . In this study, ultrastructure of the mental gland is described from seasonal samples of the eastern North American plethodontid Plethodon cinereus . The mental glands are most hypertrophied in males examined in mating condition (i.e. sperm in their Wolffian ducts) in October and April. In these specimens, 6‐ to 8‐μm electron‐dense secretory vacuoles are found in the apical cytoplasm (October) or throughout the entire epithelial cells (April). Mental glands from June and August contain only condensing vacuoles, and the cytoplasm is otherwise packed with stacks of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The ultrastructure of the mental gland of P. cinereus agrees with earlier descriptions for E. quadridigitata and H. italicus . Two other sexually dimorphic skin glands, the caudal courtship gland and the cloacal vent gland, were previously examined from males in this sample of P. cinereus . Although all three glands show similarities in histology and histochemistry at the light microscopy level, they are dissimilar in ultrastructure. Whereas the secretory vacuoles of mental glands are uniformly electron dense, those of caudal courtship glands are smaller (1.2–1.5 μm), oblong and biphasic, and vent glands have spherical biphasic secretory vacuoles (1.8–2.1 μm). This indicates a difference in secretory product and function for the three glands and needs further investigation. Whether other plethodontids show similar variation among sexually dimorphic glands is another topic for future research.",

The capsule surrounding the gland and the medial septum is composed of dense connective tissue and has elastic and reticular fibres. The epithelium of the adenomers can be divided into different strata: germinative, intermediate, secretory and degenerative stratum. The adenomers can be divided into three zones; from zone III , adenomers lead to secondary chambers that converge into a primary storage chamber. Histochemical techniques showed that the uropygial gland synthesizes different types of mucins and it was also positive to some lectins demonstrating the presence of a variety of glycoconjugates. The RGM in this species is smaller than that found for other Falconidae. These differences may be attributed to a negative allometric relationship. The general histological description is similar to other birds. The histochemistry and lectin histochemistry analysis showed a variety of glycoconjugates as part of the uropygial gland. Uropygial secretions have been proposed to have protective functions against bacteria and fungi. The presence of carbohydrate residues is linked to glycoconjugates with antimicrobial functions in many vertebrates associating our results with this species′ habits.",

Nine sexually mature males were euthanized and the complexes, testes–epididymis, were dissected. For each animal, one epididymis was processed by flotation method and the other was processed by retrograde flushing method, both using a TES ‐based buffered media. After recovery, we evaluated the sperm for motility, vigour, viability, functional membrane integrity and morphology. Morphometric data from the different sperm regions were evaluated by using an appropriate software. After recovery, both methods provide similar values for all the sperm parameters, aiming the recovery of more than 300 × 10 6 sperm, presenting &gt;50% motile sperm, with normal morphology and functional membrane. The total sperm length in this sperm was 48.87 ± 0.1, and the sperm head presented 9.4%, on average. A notable characteristic was the prominent acrosome found in the G. spixii sperm. In conclusion, we demonstrate that either flotation or retrograde flushing methods are suitable for the recovery of sperm from cauda epididymis of Spix's yellow‐toothed cavies.",

However, the sex‐ and age‐related differences in dog olfaction due to biological system are still poorly understood. We examined c‐fos expression in dog olfactory bulbs by immunohistochemistry approaches. The c‐fos is mainly expressed in the olfactory glomerular layer ( GL ), mitral cell layer ( ML ) and granule cell layer ( GRL ). We found that a higher density of c‐fos ‐positive cells could be detected in the ML of olfactory bulbs of adult female dogs compared with that in males and the c‐fos ‐positive cells in females' olfactory bulbs are more distinct. Sex‐related differences in c‐ fos expression also appeared in the GL of olfactory bulbs in juvenile dogs. We also discovered that the density of c‐fos ‐positive cells in the GRL of adult dogs was much higher than that in the GRL of juvenile dogs. Our results indicate that cells in the olfactory bulbs of female dogs are more active than those in males and female dogs may have much stronger ability for long‐time memory of odours than male dogs. Furthermore, our results also suggest that adult dogs may have much stronger ability for long‐time memory of odours and can deal with more complicated odour information than juvenile dogs.",

We analysed 18 morphometric variables of the pectoral girdle's ventral region across 19 anuran species, encompassing diverse locomotion modes (jumping, hopping, walking, and swimming) and habitats (arboreal, bushy, terrestrial, and aquatic). Our findings, predominantly explained by the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck model, reveal evolutionary adaptations in pectoral girdle morphology driven by habitat‐specific demands. Notably, bushy and walker‐jumper species exhibit large clavicles, coracoids, and sternums, along with a broad medial pectoral girdle and bigger epicoracoid. Terrestrial and arboreal‐ jumpers have a larger omosternum area compared to predominantly swimming species. Arboreal walkers show shorter epicoracoid horns and narrower coracoids. Interestingly, bushy and terrestrial species have a higher proportion of bone tissue in their pectoral girdles. This indicates a potential adaptation to support the additional to adaptation to participate in shock absorption. The patterns recovered underscore the intricate relationship between anatomical evolution and environmental adaptation in anurans.",

In recent studies, a preclinical imaging model based on large ostrich eggs was introduced in a clinical research centre using imaging systems designed for humans, thus bypassing the need for dedicated small animal imaging systems. Ostrich eggs are only laid during the season with increased daylength, which limits its year‐round availability. The current study focuses on large emu eggs instead of ostrich eggs and aims at investigating its suitability for preclinical imaging research. Physiological development of emu embryos was observed by serial weightings and serial CT scans until developmental day (DD) 46. Differences between fertilized a non‐fertilized eggs were analysed. In fertilized eggs, the embryo was identified on CT scans as early as DD 13. As expected, CT scans showed continuous embryonal development and growth over time, comparable to ostriches. Neither the eggs' volume and weight nor the weight loss nor the radiodensity provided significant differences between fertilized and non‐fertilized eggs. Despite inferior incubation success in emus compared to ostriches, suitability of emu eggs for artificial incubation and subsequent research was confirmed. Hence, emu eggs represent an alternative model for preclinical imaging and allow a year‐round use for research purposes if combined with ostrich eggs.",

The structure of the skin and superficial micro‐ornamentation in the slow worm Anguis fragilis , a limbless lizard with a fossorial activity, was examined using histology, immunofluorescence, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The scales, with a triangular to trapezoidal shape, are very overlapped and interlocked to form a smooth surface and are reinforced by osteoderms. The epidermis shows a thin Oberhautchen layer merged with a thicker beta‐layer that contains corneous beta‐proteins. The SEM survey detects a smooth surface made of tile‐like patterned Oberhautchen cells with irregular perimeters that form an interlocking surface. Disk‐like sensory organs of 15–20 μm diameter are observed only on the head scales, the first to sense the environment and contact the ground. Numerous Oberhautchen denticles, namely corneous thorns of about 0.2–0.3 μm, adorn the caudally directed perimeter of Oberhautchen cells in the ventral scales of the trunk and tail. This microstructure may determine gripping and increased friction with the substrate during the lateral undulating and forward movements of the slow worm. TEM observations reveal sparse short serrated protrusions of Oberhautchen cells that are largely merged with the underlying beta‐cells. Altogether, the scale surface of the slow worm efficiently suites this limbless lizard to its environment and lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Regeneration varies largely among metazoans. Aside molecular processes, this epiphenomenon depends on the biological complexity and evolutive history of each species during the adaptation to their specific environment. While most species adapted to marine or freshwater conditions can extensively regenerate, those adapted to terrestrial conditions and parasitism lost the ability to regenerate. They are mainly represented from ascelmintes evolving eutely and numerous arthropods and amniotes. High regeneration can only occur in water‐adapted species and requires high tissue hydration, indirect development through metamorphosis and often also presence of asexual propagation. Metamorphosis allows the anatomical‐physiological transformation of a larva in an adult through an initial destructive phase followed by a constructive (regenerative) phase. Invertebrates and vertebrates that possess genomes including metamorphic genes can re‐utilize in part or largely similar genes for the regeneration of lost organs. I submit that during land adaptation in both invertebrates and vertebrates the initial larval stages and metamorphosis were lost or altered as some key genes, including those for telomerases, could no longer be expressed in the dry environment. Consequently, also the initial regenerative ability was lost while other epiphenomena were gained, including complex immunity and behaviour but also an evident process of ageing.",

It plays an important role in the ecology of these organisms, and specialised structures, such as tactile corpuscles, are crucial in the sensing of a wide variety of stimuli. This study, by examining the presence, localisation and colocalisation of serotonin, substance P, PGP 9.5 and tubulin, wants to demonstrate the sensory role that these structures play in the ecology of the Green whip snake Hierophis viridiflavus (Lacépède, 1789). This study presents the first evaluation of nerve and immune molecules (TLR2) in the tactile corpuscles of H. viridiflavius ventral skin, indicating a potential defence role of these structures. These findings provide valuable information on the ecology of snakes, their defence systems, and their evolutionary morphostructural adaptations. Additionally, the identification of these corpuscles could provide valuable support for taxonomic recognition. Furthermore, this study expands the knowledge about stimuli sensing in snakes.",

However, many aspects of the evolution of snapping claws remain unknown. We evaluate the degree of intra‐ and interspecific variation in the shape of the snapping claw in different snapping shrimp Alpheus species. For this, we used a geometric morphometric tool. We investigated the variation in snapping claw shape from two perspectives — interspecific variation and sexual shape dimorphism — in three species: Alpheus angulosus , A. carlae, and A. estuariensis , from three locations along the southern coast of Bahia state in northeastern Brazil. Our results revealed interspecific variation in the shape of the snapping claw among A. angulosus , A. carlae, and A. estuariensis . In addition, sexual shape dimorphism was confirmed in A. angulosus and A. carlae . However, in A. estuariensis , our results reveal sexual monomorphism in the snapping claw. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both ecological context and phylogenetic relationships when analysing the morphology of the snapping claw in Alpheus snapping shrimps. We suggest further investigations to better understand the interspecific variation and sexual dimorphism in snapping claws and their implications for the evolutionary history of these shrimps.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Calcareous skeletal structures are common among different invertebrate groups, including Porifera, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Mollusca, and Echinodermata. They appear externally as shells, plates, or scales, or internally as subepidermal spicules. Although typically formed outside of the cells, in one class of gastropod molluscs, the Heterobranchia, subepidermal and intracellular spicules are found—a rare case, at least for the molluscs. This type of spicules is present in several phylogenetically distant groups of heterobranch molluscs (Rhodopemorpha, Acochlidimorpha, and Nudibranchia), each different in terms of morphology and autecology. This raises questions about the origin and homology of subepidermal spicules in heterobranch molluscs. To answer these questions, understanding the process of spicule formation is crucial. This is impeded by insufficient data on the fine structure of the subepidermal spicules and adjacent epithelia. To address this problem, we carried out a comprehensive morphological study of subepidermal spicules and the body wall in one species of Acochlidimorpha. We revealed variations in the cellular composition of the epidermis, musculature organization, and spicules' arrangement, which most likely reflect the different functional roles of the spicule complex within Heterobranchia representatives. However, the obtained data are insufficient to answer the question of the origin of spicules and their homology within Heterobranchia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Spermiogenesis and sperm structure of the primitive acoel Paratomella rubra from the Ligurian Sea, Italy, were investigated by several methods. During spermiogenesis, after flagellar incorporation by formation of two longitudinal lateral grooves, spermatid elongation is characterized in Paratomella by the presence of four membranes encircling each axoneme plus two membranes encircling both the axonemes and the nucleus. These structures were interpreted as being three cytoplasmic canals situated one inside the other. The filiform spermatozoon has two incorporated axonemes of 9+2 type, a nucleus almost as long as the sperm cell itself, a single elongate mitochondrion, and two types of membrane‐bound granules, respectively, small and gastrula‐shaped, and large. Organelles are highly ordered, the sperm is bilaterally symmetrical with a single long mitochondrion on the ventral side and a regular row of large granules, for some length embedded in the nucleus, on the dorsal side. Immunocytochemical studies and the use of fluorescent nuclear dyes reveal the spatial relationships of the axonemes with the nucleus. The granules were shown by Thiéry, PTA and enzyme digestion tests to contain glycoproteins and/or polysaccharides and very little protein. Glycogen particles were detected in the cytoplasm. Cells containing coiled spermatozoa undergoing resorption were found in the parenchyma. New apomorphies of the taxon Paratomella based on sperm structure are proposed: a very long nucleus, a highly bilaterally symmetrical pattern of organelles, a single long mitochondrion. These characters are not found in other Acoela, and particularly in Hesiolicium , sometimes considered closely related to Paratomella . © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The differentiation of the epidermis during scale morphogenesis in the lizard Anolis lineatopus has been studied by autoradiographic and immunocytochemical techniques and by electron microscopy, in relation to mitotic activity and to the distribution of glycogen. The flat embryonic epidermis of the early embryo is transformed into symmetric epidermal papillae which progressively become asymmetric and eventually form scales with stratified epidermal and peridermal layers. Papilla asymmetrization and epidermal stratification derive from cell hypertrophy and multiplication in the “basal hypertrophic layer of the forming outer side of scales” (BLOS). Glycogen is scarce or absent during early stages of epidermis development. In the dermis no glycogen is found at any stage of scale morphogenesis. Glycogen particles 25–40 nm in size accumulate in hypertrophic basal cells and peridermal cells during scale development. Conversely cells in the forming inner side of scales do not accumulate glycogen, divide less frequently than in the outer side and do not form a β–keratinized layer. It is suggested that an osmotic effect related to glycogen deposition causes increased hydration of the BLOS, whose cells become swollen and contribute to the asymmetrization of the epidermal papillae. Glycogen decreases in suprabasal differentiating cells and disappears from the BLOS at the stage of complete keratinization of the scale, around the period of hatching. Terminal differentiation in the peridermis and suprabasal epidermal layers takes place by cell flattening and condensation of the nucleus and cytoplasm as typical for apoptotic cells.",

In the peripheral nervous system, antibodies raised against acetylated α–tubulins mark a pair of rostral nerves arising from 8 to 10 sensory cells in the trunk epithelium, and a pair of tail nerves. In the sensory vesicle of the trunk, a pair of antennal cells is associated with the statocyte, and a tuft of ca. 150 cilia is labelled inside the hypophysial duct. A dorsal bundle of fibres forms a plexus over the surface of the sensory vesicle which extends caudally over the visceral ganglion. The latter contains somala that were back‐filled by Co 2+ –lysine through the cut tip of the tail. Antibodies directed against the transmitter candidates: peptides substance P, FMRFamide, somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, CGRP, VIP, and the amines: 5‐HT, dopamine, noradrenaline and GABA, all failed to demonstrate immunoreactivity anywhere in the nervous system. The trunk epithelium is ciliated uniformly but lacks papillae; this is remarkable given the presence of rostral nerves. The latter are presumed to be sensory, and can be compared with those in larvaceans and the larva of amphioxus. Sensory cells in the tail nerve, if present, lack cilia. The tail nerves are lateral in this species and presumed to be motor. © 1997 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd",

All species, regardless of larval shell type (inflated or non‐inflated), showed a similar basic pattern of shell muscles. The larval retractor muscle (LRM) differentiates prior to hatching and its fibres insert on epithelia of the velum, apical plate, stomodeal region, or mantle fold. Many fibres also connect with subepithelial intrinsic muscles of the cephalopodium. Most but not all LRM fibres Project to left‐sided targets and are innervated from the left cerebral ganglion. Two pedal muscles, which are innervated from the pedal ganglia, differentiate during the post‐hatching larval stage and both insert primarily on pedal epithelium attached to the operculum. The left pedal muscle is anchored to the shell immediately adjacent to the attachment plaque of the LRM and consists of basal and distal tiers of muscle cells. The right pedal muscle arises on the ventral rim of the shell aperture and consists of a single tier of muscle cells. Ontogenic changes in larval retraction behaviour correlate with developmental change in the muscle effectors. Although some interspecific differences were noted, the presence of a common ground plan for larval shell muscles in these five species contrasts with previous indications of marked variability for nudibranch larval shell muscles.",

Formation of free flagella correlates with tight arrangement of cells in the testes and small size of the zone of differentiation and vice versa . In both cases the axonemes elongate within the growing shaft, so that the organization of the resulting spermatids is different only with regard to the distal end. In late spermatids, the nucleus occupies the proximal half, the two mitochondria and the axonemes directed distally lie in the distal half. After detachment of the spermatid, a migration of the nucleus takes place. In the resulting mature sperm, the proximal (anterior) half is occupied by the mitochondria and axonemes the basal bodies of which lie at the anterior end of the spermatozoon; the nucleus occupies the distal (posterior) half. Because of the distal orientation of the axonemes and a peculiar mode of the migration of the nucleus, the spermiogenesis of Notentera should be classified as a new variant of the type characteristic of the Neodermata (parasitic Platyhelminthes). Based on the analysis of the available morphological and other relevant data it is argued (i) that a high‐ranked taxon, the Fecampiida, should be established within the Neoophora to include Notentera and the closely related Fecampiidae and (ii) that all the Platyhelminthes with neodermatan‐type spermiogenesis form a monophyletic taxon, the Revertospermata, which includes the sister groups Fecampiida and Mediofusata.",

The slender body spicules form inside complex sheaths in the body wall and branchial basket, where they remain for the life of the animal. The much smaller tunic spicules form inside the tunic blood vessels and then migrate to the tunic surface, where they become anchored by their spiny base. This paper is an ultrastructural investigation of the formation of the body spicules; the tunic spicules, which apparently form quite differently, will be the focus of a future study. The body spicules are composed of rows of closely packed acicular spines which form completely extracellularly. The spine tips are covered by flattened, highly pseudopodial sclerocytes bound together by tightly interdigitating cell processes. The basal regions of contiguous spines are covered by very thin sclerocyte cell processes. An organic matrix is present within the spines; its exact nature is not clear. A very dense extracellular inter‐spine matrix is located between the spine tips and the contiguous basal regions. Presclerocytes within the sheaths between the spicules are probably responsible for formation of the extracellular structures of the sheaths. The presclerocytes appear to aggregate and transform into sclerocytes at the apical end of the spicule. New spines are added at the apical end of the spicule as well as between larger spines. Comparisons are made between body spicule formation in H. momus and skeletogenesis in echinoids.",

Spermiogenesis involves elongation of the spermatid in which the nucleus elongates, but remains close to the common cytoplasmic mass. Flagella first grow in opposite direction and at a right angle to the cytoplasmic shaft, and centrioles show associate structures. Later, the two centrioles rotate and the flagella emerge parallel, but still perpendicular to the shaft. An apical process elongates at the extremity of the spermatid shaft. The spermatozoon shows active flagellar beating and undulations of the sperm body. The spermatozoon comprises an anterior ‘corkscrew’ region, the flagellar insertion region, a cytoplasmic region and a posterior nuclear region. The corkscrew contains an electron dense structure, not membrane‐bound, originating from the apical process of the spermatid. The flagella show the 9+‘1’ pattern, usual in Platyhelminthes. The cytoplasmic and nuclear regions show a cortical row of about 50 twisted longitudinal microtubules surrounding a row of electron dense, and not membrane‐bound, 25‐nm granules. These granules are original structures and seem to be known only in a few Platyhelminthes species in which a non‐flagellar movement of the spermatozoon occurs. Thus, it is hypothesised that the 25‐nm granules play a role in cellular motility. Sperm ultrastructure in Troglocaridicola shows major differences to that in the temnocephalids. It is therefore concluded that the phylogenetic position of the scutariellids within the Temnocephalidea should be reinvestigated.",

Thus, we distinguish sensilla with sensory hairs, sensilla with sensory bulbs, cone‐shaped sensilla. sensilla with sensory bristles, and sensilla of the lips. They are composed of up to 15 cells, which can he separated into four cell types. The most frequent cell type is the bipolar receptor cell that occurs in all sensilla. The apical surface of this primary receptor cell is characterized by one or two partly branched cilia with a basal 9 × 2 + 0 pattern of microtubules. A modified bipolar receptor cell was found in all sensilla bearing a sensory peg except for the sensilla equipped with sensory bristles. The apical dendrite extends to a long pale process which exclusively contains mitochondria and single microtubules. In all sensilla examined in this study at least one supporting cell occurs which is characterized by parallel microvilli. An additional function of this cell type as a part of the stimulus‐conducting system is possible. In the sensillum with a sensory bulb two kinds of supporting cells occur. A unique cell type with an upside down position has regularly been found in all sensilla bearing a sensory peg. Apart from the sensilla they also occur within the labial epidermis. Since most sensilla contain several different receptor cells, they can be considered as complex sense organs. © 1998 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, there is no information concerning this morphogenetic process in fishes. A study carried out in embryos of the dogfish ( Scyliorhinus canicula ) showed that, in this elasmobranch species, the precursors of the epicardium originate from two mesothelial anlagen, the right and left, that initially lie at the ventrolateral parts of the liver. These two anlagen, which will be referred to as the proepicardium, later shift to the right and left parts of the pericardial aspect of the transverse septum. The proepicardium comprises numerous spheric, smooth‐contoured cells and a relatively small amount of extracellular matrix. The proepicardium is not covered by an epithelial layer. Cells detaching from the proepicardium adhere to the surface of the heart and develop into epicardial cells. They firstly ensheathe the atrioventricular groove as well as the dorsal and lateral aspects of the ventricle, and the ventral and lateral aspects of the atrium. Both the sinus venosus and conus arteriosus become lined later. In spite of the phylogenetic distance between elasmobranchs and mammals, the mechanism by which the epicardium develops is similar in both groups. This similarity relies principally on the arrangement and location of the proepicardium and the way in which the epicardial precursors reach and invest the heart.",

The patellar apophysis locks the pedipalp in the female epigastric furrow. In T. denticulata this is accomplished by the retrolateral tibial apophysis that gets hold at the female scape.

A comparison with previously investigated agelenids shows a surprising diversity in the function of the retrolateral tibial apophysis.",

In the ghost shrimp Lepidophthalmus louisianensis. structures associated with this juncture include an elongate posterior midgut caecum (PMGC) extending into the abdominal hemocoel, a massive swelling of acinar glands encasing the juncture, and a dorso‐lateral valve complex involving cuticularized lumenal surfaces of the anterior hindgut. Vivisection, histological studies (LM, TEM) and paraffin‐carving (SEM) have been applied to reconstruct morphology of these components and characterize constituent tissues. The lumen of the PMGC is lined by very elongate columnar cells underlain by a thin layer of circular muscle. The hemocoelic surface of the PMGC is covered by cells richly endowed with unique lamellar bodies. The acinar glands are composed of multiple rosettes of secretory cells, from which products appear to empty into the anterior extreme of the hindgut. The dorso‐lateral valve complex of the hindgut consists of anterior and posterior components, differing in strength of lumenal ridging and microdentition of the cuticular lining. Unique features of these structures may relate to behavioral, feeding and metabolic adaptations in this obligate fossorial crustacean.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The anatomy and embryology of the dipnoan snout and olfactory organ play a major role in the discussion about the phylogenetic position of Dipnoi and the question of ancestry of Tetrapoda. This is primarily due to the fact that an internal nostril is regarded as an important preadaptive organ of the ancestors of tetrapods. Two conflicting scenarios of phylogenetic change were proposed in favour of different hypotheses of relationship. One emphasizes the similarities between Dipnoi and Chondrichthyes concerning this complex of characters. The other supports the idea of a close relationship of Dipnoi and Tetrapoda and a common origin of a ‘choana’ from the posterior external nostril of fishes. Accordingly, there is need for a detailed embryological and anatomical study which could help to clarify homologies and the basis of character evaluation. This, in the first place, concentrates on Neoceratodus forsteri. A plate reconstruction of the larval head provides many new insights which are important for comparison with the lepidosirenid lungfishes Protopterus and Lepidosiren and with other vertebrate taxa. The value of the peripheral nervous system as a topographical reference is critically reviewed. The results support the hypothesis that lungfish form a ‘primitive’ teleostomate group, closely adjoining Chondrichthyes in many characteristics of the snout formation. The relations between cranial nerves in the snout and the developing nasal sac, however, do not support the conclusion that the recent selachian condition is the exceptional ancestral character state of the lungfish snout. Dipnoi lack a ‘choana’, but nevertheless a closer relationship to tetrapods is not excluded. A vestigial and transitory naso‐buccal connection in larvae of Neoceratodus might indicate such common ancestry, but has a completely different functional significance among fishes. It is shared with several plagiostomes and is, therefore, probably not useful as a synapomorphy of Dipnoi and Tetrapoda.",

Calcium enters the epidermal cells from the moulting fluid, probably through their apical microvilli and is either incorporated into intracellular calcium granules or exits the cell via the basolateral membranes to be used in formation of two other granule types. Intracellular granules (0.4–2 μm long) form in large masses in the apical cytoplasm of the epidermal cells. They are formed as membrane‐bound vesicles by the Golgi, and calcium and organic matrix material are added from the surrounding cytoplasm. As development proceeds, lamellae appear and calcium carbonate is deposited in the matrix. Granule masses move basally and are stored in the connective tissue. Calcium is also incorporated into extracellular large granules (0.8–3.8 μm long) which are formed in narrow intercellular channels between epidermal cells. A third granule type (small granules, 0.26 μm diameter) is formed in subepidermal connective tissue cells and released into the haemolymph in very large numbers. Calcium was identified in the two larger granule types using X‐ray microanalysis and significant amounts of phosphorus and potassium were also present in the large granules.

Yet, much of the basic biology of these species remains unknown. In an ongoing effort to understand the evolution of Tanganyikan gastropods, we here describe Stanleya neritinoides . Alcohol‐preserved material of the soft parts is rare, consequently, the systematic position of the species, and a repeated suggested affinity to Tanganyicia rufofilosa , have been based primarily on features of the shell. However, features of the radula and operculum are unique and do not suggest an affinity to any other Tanganyikan species. Thus, S. neritinoides has remained a particularly poorly known and enigmatic member of the species flock. This investigation confirmed that several aspects of internal and external anatomy are shared between S. neritinoides , T. rufofilosa , and other Tanganyikan gastropods, but that S. neritinoides is unique in features of the radula and seminal receptacle. Moreover, S. neritinoides differs from T. rufofilosa in features of the foregut, midgut, hindgut, kidney, nervous system, reproductive system and reproductive strategy. These new data are inconsistent with an interpretation of identity of Stanleya and Tanganyicia. In addition, given the pervasive differences between the two, a sister‐group relationship between the two is unlikely. More precise systematic placement of S. neritinoides awaits the establishment of a phylogenetic framework for all Tanganyikan gastropods.",

The walls of both vessels are made up of the basement membranes of surrounding epithelia, lacking an endothelium. No definite limits between the vessel lumen and the skeletal rods inside the bars can be seen. Furthermore, the blood seems to penetrate into the rods of both primary and secondary gill bars. In the secondary bars such a phenomenon gives rise to the so‐called ‘lateral vessels’ reported in the light microscopical literature.

The strong ciliary currents produced propel water past the tentacles, increasing the probability of prey capture. The ciliated cells are unusual in having many (up to about 500) cilia per cell, where most cnidarian ciliated cells have only one. The cells are also peculiar in containing numerous axonemes without membrane coverings, lying loose in the cytoplasm. Tentacles show independent, rhythmic, slow flexions in the oral direction and groups of tentacles show coordinated, slow flexions as part of a regularly repeated fishing cycle. In both cases, these slow, graded movements are mediated by a slowly conducting system, probably the network of small neurons present in the ectoderm, and are accompanied by ciliary arrests. Much faster, more powerful, coordinated contractions of the tentacles occur in the context of escape behaviour; these are mediated by giant axons which run down the tentacles and are also accompanied by ciliary arrest. Ciliary and muscle effectors evidently share a common motor innervation. Electron microscopy shows that the giant and non‐giant nerves both synapse with muscle cells. The latter are joined to the ciliated cells by gap junctions, and it is suggested that whenever the muscles are excited depolarizations spread to the ciliated cells through the gap junctions and cause ciliary arrests. Neuronal control of ciliary activity has not previously been reported in the Hydrozoa.",

A method for synthesizing phylogenetic results that are interpreted from cladistic analyses with phenetic results that are obtained from morphological space analyses is presented here; in particular, points that represent forms typifying taxa in morphospace are assigned as terminal nodes for appropriate cladograms that are mapped into morphospaces by positioning nonterminal nodes and orienting internodes according to a geometric algorithm. Nonterminal nodes may be interpreted as ancestors in phylogenetic hypotheses and occupy positions that represent particular organism forms in morphospaces.

Water‐moving cilia (type II cilia) are exclusively located at lateral epithelia of branchial bars, giving rise to the water current through the gills. They have two basal centrioles, proximal and distal, and a complex system of ciliary rootlets made up of a principal rootlet, a secondary or accessory rootlet and a ‘fan’ rootlet. The tips of type II cilia have a long process with some tubules inside. All basal structures are precisely orientated in order to assure a good coordination of ciliary beat. The possible functional significance of ciliary substructure is also discussed. From these observations a model for mucus and water currents through gill slits is postulated.",

This 1: 1 ratio may have implications for the structure of the vanadium complex. Quantitation of bromine is less reliable, but levels of this halogen in vanadocytes are significant.

The latter range from short extensions of the cell apex that contact the opposite side of the cord via junctions, but go no further, to elongate processes with slender branches that project to the contralateral dorsal tract. The morphology indicates that translumenal cells play the same role in amphioxus as internuncial neurones in vertebrate spinal cord. Their axons can be ipsilateral or contralateral; some synapse with motoneurones directly while others innervate other interneurones, including other translumenal cells. From the circuitry, the cells appear to be chiefly involved in integrating sensory input from peripheral mechanoreceptors. This could include acting as a filter that amplifies some input patterns over others, or that normalizes input, so that CNS circuits are not overloaded as new sensory cells differentiate during development. The functional importance of the translumenal system to the organism is reflected in a massive increase in size and cell numbers during the larval phase. The anterior, brain‐like integrative centres of the cerebral vesicle, in contrast, are initially small and change very little.",

The rectangular pores of the filter are around 3.3 × 0.57 μm. These measured values from filters that have suffered shrinkage (to an uncertain degree) during preparation are considered to indicate that the actual pore size in life is some 4.0 × 0.7 μm. The mucous‐net feeding filter of salps differs from that of other tunicates since flow through it results from muscular activity. Calculations based on the estimated pore size and filtering rate suggest that during part of the filtering cycle, the pressure drop across the filter is considerably greater than that across other tunicate mucous‐net filters.",

However, in the procerebrum of the cerebral ganglion the glial cells only had a reticular distribution throughout the cellular area. These observations provide morphological evidence of glial cell functions. These cells are probably involved in the support of neurones, the uptake and/or degradation of neurotransmitters, the transfer of metabolic substrates to neurones, as well as the regulation of ionic constituents of extracellular space.

In both species the spermatozoon is made up of a long sperm body which bears at one extremity two free flagella of the 9+‘1’ flatworm pattern. The sperm body contains the nucleus, mitochondria, dense bodies and parallel, cortical, longitudinal singlet microtubules. Along a part of the sperm body the palissade of the microtubules displays a spiral pattern in transverse sections. A part of the perimeter of the cell is thus lined by two overlapping rows of microtubules. This spiral pattern of the singlets is considered as a synapomorphy of the family Temnocephalidae. The singlet microtubules are interconnected by two kinds of links: tangential links between neighbouring singlets in the same row and radial links between singlets belonging to two rows.

The ooecial coelomic cavity communicates with the zooidal coelom through a pore‐like canal or canals remaining after the closure of an arch‐shaped slit. The slit forms during ovicellogenesis. The communication canals are normally plugged by epithelial cells, however incompletely closed canals were also found in Callopora lineata. SEM‐studies of noncleaned, air‐dried specimens showed a relationship between membranous and calcified parts during early ovicellogenesis.

The laterally budded zooids curve inwards as they grow to form a triad with their distally budded sibling zooid. ‘Mature’ multiserial colonies growing on flat substrata consist of a series of radially diverging sectors. Each sector has an axis, generally of 3 parallel rows of zooids, flanked by wings consisting of rows of zooids originating as lateral buds from the section axis which infills the area between the axes. Occasional colonies occur with uniserial or semiuniserial growth patterns. These resemble colonies of the obligatory uniserial species Pyripora catenularia and poorly fed colonies of the related Conopeum tenuissimum , which is normally multiserial like E. pilosa. The ‘composite multiserial’ colonies of E. pilosa differ in several respects from ‘unitary multiserial’ colonies characteristic of most sheet‐like cheilostomes, including the well‐known Membranipora membranacea.

The determination of the reproductive condition was based on histological and histometric analyses of testes and external characteristics of gonads. The volume of the testes, diameter of the seminiferous tubules and depth of the seminiferous epithelium were measured. Akodon montensis showed a seasonal annual reproductive cycle divided into four stages (recrudescence, activity or proliferation, regression and rest) with the reproductive activity mainly occurring during the rainy season. In contrast, B. lasiurus presented reproductive activity during almost the whole year. For both species the volume of the testes was an effective indicator of their reproductive condition. We suggest that the histological and histometric analysis of the gonads of males, together with the observations of external characteristics of gonads of males and females, may assist in identifying the reproductive condition of these animals.",

The colour of the pancreas is either yellowish or pinkish, depending on endocrine activity. Islets are present throughout the gland and range from individual cells to small or large clumps, depending on the seasonal cycle. Splenic islets are dense with more blood capillaries and nerve innervations irrespective of sex and season. The endocrine cell mass forms irregular patches without connective tissue capsule. β cells occupy the inner region of the islets, being surrounded by other cell types. Lissemys punctata exhibits higher β‐cell activity during hibernation. Most insulin‐secreting cells acquire a larger size during the regressive period. An analysis indicates that β cells outnumber the non‐β endocrine cell mass in both number and per cent volume. There is negative correlation between islet mass and animal weight. Between the periods of reproductive cycles, a difference exists with respect to fasting plasma glucose and β‐cell volume.",

The autozooid peristomes support erect branches identical in budding and structure with the branch emanating from the erect peristome of the ancestrula. Thus, the complete crisiid colony consists of an adnate system of ancestrula and autozooids, which form erect branches from their peristomes. The adnate zooid system is comparable in autozooid morphology and budding pattern with simple uniserial stomatoporids. The tentative hypothesis is proposed that the crisiid group has developed from primitive stomatoporids; the adnate zooid system of the stomatoporids apparently evolved peristomial budding to produce the erect colony branches characteristic of crisiids.",

The epibionts found were the following: (1) protozoans: the suctorian ciliates Ephelota plana , Acineta compressa , Conchacineta constricta , Corynophrya anisostyla ; the peritrich ciliates Cothurnia mobiusi and Zoothamnium plumula ; the chonotrich ciliate Chilodochona quennerstedti ; and (2) hydrozoans: the species Leuckartiara sp. and Clytia sp. The morphological characteristics of the epibionts were analysed, as well as their taxonomic position. The distribution of epibionts on the crab surface and its shell was studied, and the density and biomass of epibionts were calculated on each anatomic unit. There was a differential distribution according to the type of epibiont: hydrozoans dominated in biovolume and were present mainly on the shell, meanwhile protozoans represented the highest fraction of density and they were found exclusively on the crab (principally on eyes, antennulae, antennae, maxillipeds, pereopods and uropods). The anterior area of the cephalothorax was the most colonized. On this area, the maxillipeds and second pereopods showed the highest densities. The location of each epibiont species was described. There was a correlation between the length of the crab and the total number of hydrozoans. There was a significant correlation between the right and the left units of the crab, taking into consideration the mean densities of epibionts on each anatomical unit. The shell was colonized by the same species of hydrozoa that appeared on the crab, although in a much higher density (mean 3024.38 per shell; 6.9 per crab). There was a significant difference between both species of hydrozoan epibionts with respect to the mean densities on the different areas of the shell. The zone of the shell more occupied by Clytia sp. was the apical zone of the shell, while the highest densities of Leuckartiara sp. were registered near the aperture of the shell. The hydrozoan and protozoan epibiont species found on P. bernhardus in this study represent the first mention of their presence on this hermit crab.",

The only relatively constant features are the number of chaetigers anterior to the anal depression and the branchial crown‐to‐body length ratio. A branchial skeleton extension of the radiolar appendages of the dorsal lips was found for the first time within Euchone , and this character has been added to the diagnosis of Euchone . Oriopsis liefdefjordensis and small specimens of E. analis agree in all characters, and O. liefdefjordensis is proposed to be a junior synonym of E. analis .

The refractive components are formed by the cornea and the cone. The latter is built up by two cone cells. In addition, there are two accessory cone cells confined to the distal part of the cone. The eight pigmented retinular cells extend from the cornea to the basement membrane. Proximal to the cone, they form a fused continuous rhabdom, which in cross section has a rectangular outline. In the middle part of the rhabdom, the microvilli are arranged perpendicular to the long axis of the rhabdom when seen in cross section. The microvilli outside of this area can be arranged either parallel or perpendicular to the microvilli of the middle part. Other irregularities occur in the ommatidium, e.g. the position of the retinular cell nuclei, which are found at different levels. Extensions from the cone cells fuse and form a mesh proximal to the rhabdom. Between the mesh and basal lamina is a basal cell type enveloping the proximal parts of the retinular cells and their axons. These cells also form the basal lamina, which delimits the compound eye from the haemocoel. No special pigment cells are present in the compound eye of Tanais cavolinii.",

During oocyte differentiation in the meroistic telotrophic ovarioles, gametes are connected to discrete nurse cells by trophic cords. In B. rhodani , each ovariole contains several eggs arranged in sequence, whereas in C. dipterum each contains a single egg. Follicle cells are competent for vitelline and chorionic envelope synthesis. Baetis rhodani is an oviparous species and the chorion is fairly thick, formed by an alveolate endochorion and a fibrillar exochorion delimited by a honey‐comb roof. Cloeon dipterum stands out among Ephemeroptera for being ovoviviparous. In B. rhodani , ovulation starts in the older nymphs with dark wing‐pads, whereas in C. dipterum choriogenesis ends in the imaginal stage. Here the chorion is very thin and laid eggs hatch almost immediately, allowing the larvulae to move out. The maturation of a single egg per ovariole is synchronized with the achievement of the adult stage. The acquisition of ovoviviparity has led to remarkable changes in the ovariole organization along with a simplification of the eggshell structure.",

Since beard worms depend on the organic compounds produced by the bacteria for nourishment, the bacteriocytes should be efficient in exchanging various substances with body fluids. For this reason, it is important to determine how the bacteriocytes are organized in the trophosome. As the first step of the present study, the appearance of bacteriocytes was examined in routinely stained paraffin sections. Second, visualization of the actual distribution of the bacteriocytes was attempted using whole‐mount in situ hybridization with a probe of the 16S rRNA nucleotide sequence of the bacterium. After routine haematoxylin &amp; eosin staining, the bacteriocytes appeared to be aligned in cell cords accompanied with nutrient‐deposit cells that extended from both sides of the trophosome toward the dorsal side and folded up in the coelomic spaces. In whole‐mount preparations, however, bacteriocytes with intense signals of 16S rRNA were seen three‐dimensionally as many irregular leaves arranged from both sides of the ventral vessel toward the dorsal vessel. We will discuss the physiological significance of this characteristic distribution of the bacteriocytes in the present species.",

Previously unreported features include cells with fibril‐filled paraciliary processes in the recessed (pit) portion of the preoral organ, which probably assist in generating the mucus string produced by this structure, and the cell responsible for driving the current through the club‐shaped gland, which appears to depend on a mechanism analogous to Archimedes’ screw. Pharyngeal structures are dramatically repositioned during larval growth and metamorphosis. Mapping these changes shows that they are most easily explained if the positioning of the mouth is not directly controlled by the mechanism used to pattern the rest of the ventral pharynx. This accords with the predictions of the dorsoventral inversion hypothesis, which requires that an originally dorsal mouth in the inverted chordate ancestor be secondarily shifted to the ventral surface. It is argued here, on this basis, that the repositioning of the larval mouth in amphioxus, from the left side to the ventral midline, represents a partial recapitulation of past evolutionary events.",

A General Linear Mixed Model was used to test the effect of year, sex, age and age–sex interaction, on each parameter. The morphological results differed from those of other introduced populations because of their different origin and their adaptation to different environments. Differences in sex and age were found, pointing to sexual dimorphism both in adults and subadults. The degree of dimorphism was lower than that of other populations, probably because of a lack of trophic niche separation between male and female mink because in the study area only small prey animals were available.",

Their axons form two types of secretory release structure. First, possible axon collaterals synapse upon slender “dentritic twigs” in the core of the brain. Secondly, two tracts descend to the brain floor to form a “neurosecretory neuropile” (or storage and release complex) in contact with the inner surface of the brain capsule. Other neurosecretory fibres penetrate through the capsule, branch extensively, and terminate in contact with its ventral surface in close association with the “infracerebral gland”. The gland is derived from the pericapsular epithelium and exhibits signs of specialization for glandular function. In contrast to certain other polychaetes, it does not contain secretory neuron perikarya. The secretory end-foot system is poorly developed. Its terminals are located adjacent to the neurosecretory neuropile, which they encircle. The cell bodies are probably represented by four e cells which, like the terminals, contain many mitochondria.",

The lateral‐line system is constructed of neuromasts arranged in pit fields instead of pit lines as in most amphibians. The neuromasts are unusual, because the sense cells are arranged in a single row through the long axis of the organ and a few of the sustentacular cells contain “orange granules.” During aestivation, the neuromasts are either shielded by a secreted cocoon, or occluded by proliferated skin epithelium. Those organs occluded by epithelium undergo dedifferentiation which continues through postaestivation. Loss of the lateral‐line system by amphibians was apparently late in amphibian evolution. Gradual loss of the system suggests that retention and/or protection of the lateral‐line system proved maladaptive and physiologically too expensive. Thus the system was abandoned by most amphibian taxa at metamorphosis.",

On Hymenochirus , a new type of aglossal batrachians. – Annals of the Magazine of Natural History Series 7: 122–125) is unusual among anurans in having seven (or more) appendicular ossicles in each hind limb. Sesamoids are often associated with muscles and tendons, and their development is usually regarded as mediated by or correlated with function. This study investigated the effects of paralysis (loss of function) on development of ossicles in the hind limb of Hymenochirus . Complete denervation of the right sciatic nerve was performed at developmental stages 63 and 66, and the animals maintained for a further 6–7 or 12–13 weeks. Specimens were cleared and double stained for cartilage and bone. There were no gross morphological differences between control and sham operated groups. The lunulae were not affected by paralysis, whereas the fabella arose later and/or regressed in some specimens. The distal os sesamoides tarsalia (OST) was shorter in paralysed individuals, and both the distal OST and cartilagines plantares showed delayed maturation. Denervation of the hind limb thus affected the timing of appearance, maintenance and rate of maturation of some sesamoid bones in Hymenochirus, but had no effect on others.",

Although autotomy and subsequent regeneration of lizard tails has been extensively studied, there is little information available on ultrastructural changes that occur to the muscle fibers at the site of severance. Thus, in the present study, we examine the ultrastructure of the musculature of the remaining tail stump of the lizard Hemidactylus mabouia immediately after autotomy. Our results show that exposed portions of the skeletal muscle fibers of the stump that are unprotected by connective tissue bulge to produce large mushroom‐like protrusions. These exposed portions show abnormal structure but suffer no leakage of cytoplasmic contents. Many small and large vesicular structures appeared between myofibrils in the interface at this disarranged region (distal) and the other portion of the fibers that remain unchanged (proximal). These vesicles coalesce, creating a gap that leads to the release of the mushroom‐like protrusion. So, our results showed that after the macroscopic act of autotomy the muscular fibers release part of the sarcoplasm as if a second and microscopic set of autotomic events takes place immediately following the macroscopic act of autotomy. Presumably these changes pave the way for the formation of a blastema and the beginning of regeneration.",

The goal of this work was to describe the morphology of the reproductive system and the gross anatomy of the musculature of adults of the species Tanaisia bragai and Tanaisia inopina by means of confocal scanning laser microscopy. The helminths were found parasitizing the kidney collection ducts of Columba livia , in the municipality of Juiz de Fora, Brazil. These helminths were stained with Mayer's carmalum, mounted on permanent slides and observed through a confocal scanning laser microscope. The tomographic images showed the morphology of the organs and glands of the reproductive system, along with the general morphology of the musculature of the body wall, oral sucker, acetabulum, pharynx, intestinal caeca, oesophagus and reproductive system ducts. The present work is the first re‐characterization of the reproductive tract of T. bragai and T. inopina . We also present the first description of the general morphology of the gametes and cells of the glands associated with the reproductive apparatus of these species.",

The laryngeal skeleton consists of three bilaterally symmetrical cartilages: the cricoid and two arytenoids. Internally, each half‐larynx has an anterior and a posterior chamber. The first chamber is delimited by the epithelium covering the arytenoid cartilage and the anterior membrane. The latter consists of fibro‐elastic tissue and contains blood capillaries that, judging by their location and distribution, might serve to maintain vocal cord turgidity. At the level of the cricoid cartilage, two structures are reported here for the first time: the posterodorsal and the anteroventral processes. Both processes are associated with the insertion of the posterior membrane. A cartilaginous rod is located at the free margin of the posterior membrane. This rod appears to support the membrane when the air flows. The distal portion of the larynx communicates with the proximal region of the lung. The epithelium of the laryngeal mucosa contains ciliated cells, goblet cells, secretory cells with short microvilli and neuroendocrine cells immunopositive to PGP 9.5. The results obtained in this study provide new information about the internal organization of the larynx in anurans, which could serve as additional morphological characters for phylogenetic relationships.",

We also present the first detailed morphological study on the genus, describing for the first time its spinneret spigot morphology and its tracheal system, which are crucial for reconstructing the cladistic relationships of araneoid families. Some aspects of the male and female genitalia are also discussed. New diagnostic features are proposed for the genus. The respiratory system of Trogloneta resembles that of the mysmenid genera Maymena and Isela , with reduced booklungs and only one posterior spiracle leading to tracheae. The spinneret spigot arrangement in Trogloneta conforms to the typical araneoid spigot composition, with one major ampullate spigot separated by a deep furrow from the piriform field, and piriform spigots with reduced bases and interspersed with tartipores in the anterior lateral spinnerets. A third distinct field in the anterior lateral spinnerets comprising modified setae of unknown function is present in Trogloneta . This field seems to be unique for the genus. The typical shape of the male palpal cymbium, as well as the shape of the cymbial conductor could be synapomorphic for Trogloneta . Also, females of Trogloneta present accessory glands as part of their genitalic conformation, which have never been reported for mysmenids, and therefore might be also synapomorphic for the genus. This is the first mysmenid genus proposed to be haplogyne, further suggesting additional synapomorphies for the genus.",

Newborns from 3 to 60 days postparturition were studied. After formation of symmetric and round outgrowth in digits the epidermis becomes thicker in the dorsal with respect to the ventral digit tip. The claw elongates forming the unguis and a shorter subunguis. Spinosus keratinocytes in both unguis and subunguis accumulate tonofilaments that fill their cytoplasm. Keratohyaline‐like granules are formed in early stages of differentiation in both unguis and subunguis but they later disappear in highly cornified corneocytes. Tonofilaments become electron‐dense in keratinocytes of the precorneous layer in the large corneocytes of the unguis and in narrow corneocytes of the subunguis. Keratin bundles transform into an amorphous corneous material that embeds or masks the original keratin intermediate filaments. Nucleated corneocytes are accumulated in the unguis while thinner corneocytes are present in the subunguis. The latter contain a dense material, possibly containing high sulphur keratin associated proteins, as occurs during cornifcation of the cortex and cuticle hair cells and in the nail. The process of cornification of mammalian claws is compared with that of reptilian and avian claws.",

Specimens were collected, borrowed and/or purchased, and cleared and stained for bone and cartilage. Data collected include snout-vent length (SVL), tail length (TL), vertebral counts and centrum lengths. Eurycea species with biphasic life cycles had TLs that surpassed SVL following metamorphosis. Tails in paedomorphic species elongated but rarely exceeded body length. Larger TLs were associated with more vertebrae and longer vertebrae in all species. We observed that rates of postsacral vertebral addition varied little amongst species. Regional variation along the tail becomes prominent following metamorphosis in biphasic developers. In all species vertebrae in the posterior one-half of the tail taper towards the tip. We suggest a developmental link might exist between the ability to continually add vertebrae and regeneration in salamanders.",

In the present study, we investigated the ultrastructural variations of specialized epidermal structure of Indian porcupines (Hystrix indica and Atherurus macrourus) and hedgehog (Hemiechinus collaris) as well as the variation in the fatty acid composition of total lipid fraction. Scanning electron microscope images reveal the usual scaly structure in surface view and network of channels in cross-section but with different orientation of partition walls. The lipid profile reveals the presence of free sterol, long-chain alcohol, free fatty acids, wax ester and sterol ester in all the three cases and trace amount of triglyceride, diglyceride and monoglyceride. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of fatty acid methyl ester of total lipid fraction indicates the presence of C8-C22 fatty acids in Hystrix indica, C8-C18 in Atherurus macrourus and C8-C20 fatty acids in Hemiechinus collaris. It is interesting to note that the total lipid fraction of hedgehog shows no branched-chain, unsaturated and odd-carbon fatty acids. Odd-carbon fatty acid and branched-chain fatty acids detected in the adult H. indica but were absent in juvenile H. indica as well as in A. macrourus. With the exception of C18:1, the other unsaturated fatty acids were also absent in both juvenile H. indica and A. macrourus.",

Geometric morphometrics was applied to the mandible of fossorial water voles (Arvicola terrestris monticola) to determine size and shape variations in this structure during post-weaning ontogeny. The sample consisted of collection specimens obtained in the Aran Valley (Spain), which were grouped into six age classes. Mandible size and shape did not differ significantly between sexes, but between age classes. Mandible size accounted significantly for the shape variation. After the size-related differences were removed, the mandible shape did not show significant sexual dimorphism but differences by age remained significant. The main shape changes occur between the third and tenth weeks of life and are related to the shift from suckling to a herbivorous diet. Although mandible shape was less remodelled after that age, an appreciable variation also occurs during adulthood. Age-related changes lead to enhancing the digging potential of the mandible, which in adults becomes a robust structure with an increased surface and stronger crests for muscle insertion. As part of the mandible shape variation was not related to the size-dependent adjustment and diet does not vary significantly between juvenile and adult voles, shape changes that occur during adulthood can be related to the mechanical stress derived from digging activities.",

Spermiogenesis begins with the formation of a zone of differentiation containing two centrioles. One of the centrioles develops a free flagellum that later fuses with a cytoplasmic extension. The nucleus migrates along the spermatid body after the proximodistal fusion of the flagellum and the cytoplasmic extension. During advanced stages of spermiogenesis a periaxonemal sheath and intracytoplasmic walls appear in the spermatids. Spermiogenesis finishes with the appearance of two helicoidal crested bodies at the base of spermatids and, finally, the narrowing of the ring of arched membranes detaches the fully formed spermatozoon. The mature spermatozoon of R. micracantha is a long and filiform cell, tapered at both ends, which lacks mitochondria. It exhibits two crested bodies of different lengths, one axoneme of the 9 + ‘1’ pattern of trepaxonematan Platyhelminthes, twisted cortical microtubules, a periaxonemal sheath, intracytoplasmic walls, granules of glycogen and a spiralled nucleus.

This study reviews the ontogenetic variability of the head, the first segments and the uncini in Terebellidae, based on primary literature and development series of four terebellid species. We test hypotheses on character homologies and indicate informative characters for future phylogenetic analyses. The prostomium, identified as the region above the prototroch band of the larva, in addition to being the region of origin of the buccal tentacles, contains a series of nerves originating from the cerebrum. The peristomium, which contains the mouth, is innervated by the stomogastric nerve and consists of upper and lower lips and an internal pharynx. The loss of the first notochaetae and neurochaetae in the course of development is a recurrent pattern in terebellids. The claviform chaetae disappear with age and growth, and can be used to define the larval stage. Chaetogenesis shows that the long shaft‐shaped manubrium and posterior process develop from different regions. The uncini terminology ‘double rows’ was reinterpreted and renamed ‘inverted rows’, which better reflects the inversion of chaetal positions during ontogenetic development.",

One of the few preserved caudal fins belongs to the Early Devonian pteraspidid Errivaspis waynensis from the Welsh Borderland, UK. There are two different reconstructions of the tail: (1) strongly asymmetric, with a considerably longer ventral lobe, and a rather concave posterior margin (e.g. White 1935); and (2) almost symmetrical with an only slightly longer ventral lobe and a small notch in the posterior margin (e.g. Blieck 1984 ). A new reconstruction of the Errivaspis caudal fin, based on a detailed study of White's specimens is presented here. The ventral lobe is longer than the dorsal one but not so much as in White's reconstruction, and the notch in the posterior margin of the fin is less deep. The comparatively massive ventral lobe and ‘en echelon’ arrangement of three digitations, supporting the fin web and branching off from this lobe, indicate the hypocercal condition of the asymmetrical tail. The same internal structure is present in other heterostracans with nearly symmetrical caudal fins (e.g. Doryaspis , Nahanniaspis , Dinaspidella and Athenaegis ) where all, or most, of the intermediate digitations branch off from the ventral lobe.",

We observed a morphological distinction between the ovaries of both species: A. planirostris presents the primordial follicles located in a cranial portion of the ovary and the interstitial gland cells are not distinctive, while in E. furinalis , the primordial follicles are located throughout the cortex, and there is an abundance of interstitial gland cells. Both species present binovular or triovular follicles. Artibeus planirostris is a monovular species , with a preferential ovulation in the left side. Some females of E. furinalis exhibited two corpora lutea in the same ovary, and others presented a corpus luteum in both right and left ovaries at the same time; thus, E. furinalis is a polyovular species. Our results express the variation between two Neotropical species, reflecting the great variation in the reproductive aspects in Chiroptera.",

Emphasis was placed on characterising the glands and glandular cells and their distribution throughout the digestive tract. The use of classic histological and histochemical techniques revealed two morphological types of glandular cells: granular and mucous. Moreover, the histochemical analysis indicated specialisation of mucous glandular cells in the buccal mass, the submandibular gland and the caecum for secreting acid and neutral glycoconjugates. The cells of the anterior salivary glands are specialised for secreting neutral glycoproteins, and those of the posterior salivary glands are specialised for granular and mucous secretion. The oesophagus, crop and stomach lack glandular cells, but both granular and mucous glandular cells are found in the intestine. An unusual structure resembling the typhlosole of bivalves is described for the first time in the intestine of O. vulgaris . The highly ciliated epithelium and location of the structure in the anterior part of the intestine suggest a possible role in bypassing the caecum, stomach and intestine. We discuss how these cells and organs contribute to the process of digestion in the light of the present histological and histochemical data and of previously published information on the morphology and physiology of digestion in the octopus.",

It is short and broad, with enlarged muscle attachment sites and pronounced articulations compared to non‐fossorial sister taxa and other mammals. Both condyles are rotated in opposite directions, resulting in a torsion which is unique among eutherian mammals. The development of this exceptional bone was studied in embryonic stages of the fossorial Iberian mole ( Talpa occidentalis ) from mesenchymal condensation to incipient ossification based on histological serial sections using 3D reconstruction methods. For comparison, embryonic stages of the semi‐fossorial Japanese shrew mole ( Urotrichus talpoides ) as well as a sister taxon of moles, the terrestrial North American least shrew ( Cryptotis parva ), were studied. Results show that the humerus of Talpa already shows its derived anatomy with broadened muscle attachment sites and distinct articulations at early cartilaginous stages, when ossification has just started in the mid‐diaphyseal region. The torsion takes place simultaneously with the medial rotation of the forelimbs. The supracondylar foramen is closed in all studied Talpa embryos, but patent in Cryptotis and Urotrichus . This is an example of developmental penetrance, suggesting that variation of adult elements can be found at early stages as well.",

The distribution of these cells is usually uneven throughout the long axis of the planula. The majority of these cells are located in the anterior half of the planula body. Scyphozoan planulae, as well as anthozoan planulae, have a sensory structure at the anterior pole called an apical organ, which is believed to take part in metamorphosis induction. Hydrozoan planulae also possess sensory cells. It has been previously shown in several cnidarian larvae that their neuronal cells contain the neurotransmitter, serotonin. The present study describes the peculiarities of serotonin‐like immunoreactive cells in A urelia aurita (Scyphozoa) and G onothyraea loveni (Hydrozoa) planulae. We show that several cells in the presumptive apical organ of A. aurita are immunoreactive to antibodies against serotonin, while G . loveni planulae have an accumulation of serotonin‐positive cells near the anterior pole. Additional serotonin‐like immunoreactive cells are found in the lateral ectoderm of both planulae. Treatment of A . aurita and G . loveni planulae with serotonin or its blockers show that serotonin is likely involved in the initiation of planula settlement.",

For example, the effect of abiotic factors is frequently attributed to explain intra‐ and interspecific variation in SSD . Rensch's rule, which states that males vary more in size than females when body size increases, has rarely been tested in bats. Therefore, whether bats follow Rensch's rule remains unclear, particularly when females are larger than males. We investigated whether four bat species presented SSD , as well as whether their body sizes varied within each sex across localities, testing the hypothesis that intraspecific SSD varies substantially depending of sampling localities. We finally examined whether bats followed Rensch's rule by simultaneously using intraspecific and interspecific approaches. Although SSD was not observed for most bat species within each locality, the females of three of the four captured species exhibited differences in body size between particular localities. Usually the females varied more in size than did males across localities, mostly exhibiting a female‐biased SSD . Significant differences in SSD were observed (i.e. mean values of the sexual dimorphism index), even though Rensch's rule was not followed.",

To investigate the arboreal adaptation, we studied the osteological morphology of the forelimbs and the third metacarpals of arboreal frogs (Rhacophoridae and Hylidae) and non‐arboreal frogs (Bombinatoridae, Bufonidae, Megophryidae, Ranidae, and Microhylidae) using transparent specimens or X‐rays of skeletons. Our results revealed that the bony knob on the third metacarpal, which formed by a dilated and elongated lateral articular cartilage ( AL ) through endochondral ossification, occurred only in species of Rhacophorinae. The results of the phylogenetic comparative methods and correlation analysis strongly supported the conclusion that the bony knob is a phylogenetic independent evolution trait and had a significant correlation with the arboreal habitat. Furthermore, anatomical observation showed that a muscle adhered to the bony knob. Therefore, we speculated that the bony knob might act as an enlarged attachment point for larger or more musculatures to help with grasping. In addition, the relative length of the hand showed a significant difference between arboreal and non‐arboreal species ( p = .007), suggesting that longer hands might be an arboreal adaptive trait. Overall, this study leads to a deeper understanding of the arboreal adaptation.",

Males of this species present nuptial excrescences, which are keratinized spines on the surface of some fingers and internal metacarpal tubercles. Although these spines are usually associated with male adulthood, no details of their development are available. To investigate the sequence of spines' appearance, we correlated the number of spines with size and age, which was estimated by skeletochronology. We studied individuals collected from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. There was significant correlation between size of individuals and number of spines and between age and number of spines in the callosities. The first spines appeared in metacarpal–phalangeal articulation of finger II , when specimens were 1 year old. The estimated growth curve did not show stabilization at any age. We considered the degree of development of the nuptial excrescences as a proxy for sexual maturity and so individuals may already be sexually active by 1 year of age. Estimated longevity of T. miliaris is similar to that estimated for other tropical species of frogs. Although growth in anuran species is considered to be undetermined, in T. miliaris, it seems to fit either undetermined or determined models.",

Transcriptome data show upregulation of genes stimulating hyaluronate production in the tail and limb blastemas. The distribution of hyaluronate in the tail and limb blastemas has been studied using alcian blue at pH 2.5 and 1.0 and by immunohistochemistry for hyaluronate receptors. Both tail and limb blastemas initially contain hyaluronate, but this glycosaminoglycan disappears in the scarring limb blastema at 25‐ to 30‐day postamputation after intense inflammation. The regenerating tail tip moves distally during regeneration but conserves hyaluronate that is replaced by sulphated glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins in proximal regions of the regenerating tail. Hyaluronate receptors are diffuse among blastema cells and ependyma of the tail, intense in wound epidermis but low to absent in the scarring limb. The electron microscope shows that an amorphous extracellular matrix likely containing hyaluronate surrounds mesenchymal cells, ependyma and wound epidermis in the tail but is scarce to absent in the limb, whereas collagen fibrils prevail. Extracellular matrix containing hyaluronate may shield blastema cells from circulating immune cells preventing deleterious immune reactions in the tail but not in the limb, a process leading to scarring.",

Therefore, anatomical and histomorphological aspects of A. schlegelii DT were examined by light and scanning electron microscope ( SEM ). Anatomically, DT of A. schlegelii was mainly formed of oesophagus, well‐developed stomach and fingers like pyloric caeca (four in number), intestinal regions and rectum. Histomorphologically, oesophagus occurred as a shorter tube‐like organ presenting a longitudinal folded mucosa that connects oropharynx cavity to stomach. Stomach was a muscular thick‐wall organ that included three regions, thickly longitudinal folds were observed in the first (cardiac) and last (pyloric) regions, whereas the second (fundic) region showed folds in different directions. Long villi were observed within pyloric caeca and anterior intestine. Tunica muscularis appeared narrow in the anterior intestine, whereas thicker in the posterior part of the intestine. Collectively, anatomical and histomorphological aspects of A. schlegelii DT are consistent with the carnivorous habit of this species. These data could be a potential source to modify better methods of nutrition and identify the DT pathogenic conditions in farming of this fish.",

To this end, the tail muscles of 18 specimens representing the three subfamilies of Falconidae were dissected, weighed and their percentage to the body mass calculated. The possible differences in tail muscle mass between Falconinae and Polyborinae were explored with a Bayesian statistical approach. In all species, the muscles depressor caudae and levator caudae had the highest mass values (0.028%–0.329% and 0.120%–0.274%, respectively), in accordance with the key movements performed during flight, that is, the tail depression and elevation. The total muscle masses of Falconinae and those of Polyborinae were significantly different ( p &lt; 0.05). This difference can be related with the different flight behaviour of falcons and caracaras, that is, fast and erratic flight, respectively.",

GI tracts from 12 adult animals were used for this study. Results found the small intestine made up 65.9% of the GI tract, and the stomach was simple with a prominent caecum. Histologically, the oesophageal mucosa was non‐keratinized and glands were found throughout the oesophagus. The large intestine showed a great number of goblet cells, the jejunum possessed well‐developed villi, and Peyer's patches were absent in the ileum. The absence of keratinization of the epithelial lining of the oesophagus and stomach and a high lymphocytic infiltration throughout the small and large intestine reflected a more carnivorous diet, whereas the presence of a well‐developed caecum in the large intestine indicated the ability to digest plant matter. Overall, the morphology of GI tract of D. m. insularis displayed both carnivorous and herbivorous features, allowing us to conclude that it is an omnivorous animal.",

We found that ontogenetic size progression departs modestly, but significantly, from growth at a constant rate and that size at hatching contributes considerably to determine the size of the individual at all subsequent stages. As for the shape, ontogenetic allometry is much more conspicuous than static allometry, the latter in many cases being close to isometry. Analysis of developmental timing revealed a stage of apparently more effective developmental control at stage 3, supported by both the relatively small variance in cumulative developmental time up to stage 3 and by the pattern of correlation between duration of single stages. While presenting detailed quantitative aspects of growth in P. brassicae , in particular with respect to individual variation, this study and the associated dataset can provide a basis for further explorations of the post‐embryonic development in this insect and contribute to the ongoing investigations on growth regulation and control in insects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Orthonectida is a small group of parasites, which, according to recent studies, may be phylogenetically close to Annelida. Here, we describe the musculature and serotonin‐like immunoreactive (SLIR) nervous system of male adults of Intoshia linei (Orthonectida) using immunohistochemistry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The whole muscular system consists of four outer longitudinal and eight pairs of inner semicircular muscle fibres. Immunohistochemistry revealed six serotonin‐like cells at the anterior part of the body, and two backward lateral longitudinal nerves, merging at the posterior end. Compared to females, the organization of the nervous system is modified and its progenetic origin seems unlikely. The general neuromuscular organization corresponds to the pattern of small‐sized annelids, suggesting their possible phylogenetic affinity. Free‐living males and females of the orthonectid I. linei may present a good example of a highly simplified Bilaterian with fully functioning nervous and muscular systems. This simplicity is secondary and is caused by two factors—the parasitic life style and miniaturization of free‐living sexual stages.",

The dimorphism was found in a new species, Sphenoderes neptunus sp. nov., from the Gulf of Naples, Italy, and a formal description is provided. While dimorphism between adult life stages of kinorhynchs so far have been restricted to differences in the two posteriormost segments, the dimorphism in the new species is expressed in spine lengths throughout the entire trunk, as well as in presence or absence of cuspidate spines. The implications for comparative kinorhynch morphology and taxonomy are discussed, and it is concluded that adult dimorphism and the occurrence of more than one adult life stage always should be considered as a possibility when exploring kinorhynchs of the orders Kentrorhagata and Xenosomata. Despite the comparative challenges prompted by the adult dimorphism, species of Sphenoderes can still be distinguished by differences in shape of midventral placid and distribution of sensory spots. Conversely, spine patterns as differential characters should be used with caution, and only after ensuring that specimens belonging to the same adult stage are compared.",

The study was carried out on five tongues collected from four adult animals and one young animal. There was variation in the shape of the filiform papillae. Few conical papillae were observed on the caudo‐lateral surface of the tongue. The gustatory papillae included fungiform papillae on the entire lingual surface and three vallate papillae, with the largest papilla located centrally. The foliate papillae were present on all the studied tongues and consisted of parallel folia on the right and left caudo‐lateral side of the tongue, which were divided into five to eight sulci. Numerous openings of the lingual glands were present on surface of the root of the tongue. Histochemical studies of the cells of the lingual glands showed the differences between young and adult animals. Thus, the composition of the secretion of these glands depends on age of animals. An aggregation of lymphatic cells was observed beneath the surface of the root epithelium. Keel (enlargement of mucosa) was present on the ventral surface of the tongue medially and was composed of the connective tissue and epithelium.",

Our results indicated differences in ovary structure between P. buchholzi and the externally fertilizing species, as well as a considerable disparity in oocyte organization in all studied species. All species possess ovaries of the cystovarian type. In P. buchholzi , the epithelium lining the lumen was columnar and formed crypts with ciliated and microvillus cells as well as deep invaginations with secretory cells, whereas in the remaining species epithelium was squamous. The organization of oogonia and one‐nucleolus oocytes did not differ between species, there were variations in oocytes at subsequent steps of primary growth, including symmetry/asymmetry of the inner cell structure, differences in Balbiani body formation, presence/absence of zonation of the ooplasm, and differences in the order in which cortical alveoli and oil droplets appeared. These differences may be caused by a long and separate evolution of the families as well as adaptation to insemination in the family Pantodontidae.",

In the Western Atlantic Ocean, M. leidyi are commonly infected by larvae of American Edwardsiella lineata anemones. It was questioned whether the parasitic larvae came across the Atlantic with the invasive ctenophore, or whether they belonged to the native E. carnea anemones. However, recent molecular investigations identified E. carnea and E. lineata as different species and the Swedish larvae from M. leidyi as E. carnea . Present morphological investigation supports the distinction of E. carnea anemones from E. lineata by a changeable rounded to flattened physa without rugae and by white pigmentation on basal outer tentacles. One Swedish larva developed into a juvenile with this characteristic column differentiation, identifying our larva as E. carnea and confirming its ability to produce parasitic larvae. Cnidome descriptions of E. carnea anemones and larvae reveal three similar cnidae in E. carnea and E. lineata anemones and larvae, and cnidae specific to either anemone or larval stages. Cnidome characteristics support our parasitic larvae as an Edwardsiella member, but further comparable studies of E. lineata cnidomes are warranted for evaluating their taxonomic significance.",

This approach is independent from small animal imaging devices as ostrich eggs provide good image quality on computed tomography (CT), MRI or PET scanners used in clinical routine examinations. However, questions regarding physiological development and systematic evaluation of image quality are open. This study aims at describing physiological development of ostrich embryos on serial CT scans. One hundred eggs (63 fertilized and 37 non‐fertilized) were artificially incubated for 37 days. On developmental days (DD) 0, 10, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34 and 37, CT scans were performed using a Siemens Biograph mCT40. Density of yolk, albumen and shell as well as volumes of air cell, egg content and egg shell were determined. In fertilized eggs, the size of different osseous structures was investigated. Detection of embryonal development was technically successful in 100%. Distinguishing of fertilized and non‐fertilized eggs is achieved as early as DD 22. After that, continuous development is depicted and osseous structures become visible on DD 25. Ostrich eggs might open the door for preclinical imaging studies if small animal imaging devices are not available. This study contributes to the implementation of ostrich eggs as an alternative to common animal testing.",

Based on the obtained results, sagitta morphology could be considered as diagnostic characters distinguishing the genera Alticus , Antennablennius , Istiblennius , Omobranchus and Parablennius showing differences related to general shape, that is, elliptic/oval to triangular; shape of antirostrum and its degree of development; the degrees of convexity of ventral and dorsal margins, and shape of ostium. The common/general otolith characters shared in the all studied combtooth blennies, is the heterosulcoid condition, which is a shared character with Perciformes and Gobiiformes. The type of sulcus is ostial, and it can be considered as a plesiomorph character shared with a basal group of actinopterygian fishes. The obtained results could be useful in taxonomical, paleontological, ecological and food and feeding habits studies.",

The abundance and distribution on the copepod surface were analysed, taking into account the sex of the crustacean, revealing some preference for females and also a different attachment point in both sexes. The morphological study allowed us to identify a new species of this Suctoria epibiont as Pelagacineta hebensis . Moreover, the 18S rRNA gene was partially sequenced to inspect the phylogenetic position of Pelagacineta hebensis within the subclass Phyllopharyngea. The maximum‐likelihood ( ML ) tree obtained was consistent with the morphological and with previous molecular studies and showed that P. hebensis belongs to the order Endogenina, as a sister clade of the few taxa sequenced within this order. Including new genetic data to the Endogenina will allow building new hypothesis about the evolution of the most derived clade of suctorians.",

Individuals from the populations differed in the carapace size, in this case, we observed the largest individuals in the Iguaçu river basin, followed by Ribeira do Iguape and the Coastal basin. Carapace shape also differed between the populations of A. schmitti , with the exception of the Mato Grande and Piraquara rivers: populations from the Iguaçu River presented a larger and rounder carapace when compared with the slenderer carapace of the Coastal basin, and the Ribeira do Iguape animals presented intermediate shapes.

A free larval stage is absent, despite this, T. lebruni is widely distributed along the south‐western Atlantic. At Puerto Deseado, T. lebruni has a marked seasonality in the reproductive cycle, reproducing only once a year. The reproductive period is quite short and defined in time: spawning and brooding take place during the late austral winter and beginning of spring. Recovery of the female gonad starts very soon after spawning. Oogenesis takes about 10–11 months for completion. Brood size is correlated with length of maternal individual. The number of embryos per brood varied between 785 and 5945. Extensive resorption of abortive eggs is viewed as related to limitation of space available for brooding. The egg hull is formed by a large number of minute pentagonal or hexagonal plates each one bearing a short spine bent onto the egg surface. The morphology and the surface of the hull could contribute to the cohesiveness of the brooded egg mass within the pallial grooves.",

Spermatogenesis occurred during late autumn–winter (June–September) and spermiogenesis occurred in spring–summer (October–March). The volume of the testes was smaller (quiescent) in winter, while the tubular diameter and the epithelial height of the seminiferous tubule were larger in summer (January–March). The ductus deferens presented spermatozoa all over the year and had no seasonal variation in diameter. The length of the kidney was larger in winter–spring (July–December), although the tubular diameter and epithelium height of the sexual segment of the kidney ( SSK ) were larger only in winter (July–September). Total testicular regression was observed in late autumn (May), simultaneously with the peak in SSK . Therefore, at the individual level, males exhibit a discontinuous cyclical reproduction. Considering the population level, the reproductive cycle is seasonal semisynchronous, with most of the individuals showing a reproductive peak in spring–summer (October–March). Here, we present evidence to support the importance of the microscopic approach to reproductive cycle studies. Finally, we discuss the intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing P. patagoniensis reproductive patterns.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The optical light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques have proven to play a key and noteworthy role in the advancement of morphological studies in general, and in investigating fish scale morphology in particular. These techniques have illustrated several hidden architectural structures in scales that contribute effectively to fish identification and classification. The scale morphological and topological characters such as type, size, shape, lateral surface, focus position, circuli appearance, radii type, lepidonts, and posterior and anterior margin shapes were obtained using macro‐ and microscopic analysis in six body regions for three size classes of Garra sharq , a cyprinid endemic fish of the Arabian Peninsula. The general scale type in the studied G. sharq species was a basal elasmoid cycloid and a sectioned type. As a protective structure, the scales display several specific characteristics including firm attachment to the fish body, overlapping, and thin structure with a high surface area and high strength. These characteristics improve scale resistance to penetration, increase protection against mechanical injury and microbial infection, enhance scale flexibility, reduce fish weight (reduce friction drag), and increase scale transparency. The scales demonstrate plasticity in focus shape, size, and position in the six fish body parts and fish size groups. The examined scales displayed narrow or wide grooves (radii) in three types including primary, secondary, and tertiary present in all four scale fields (anterior, posterior, and laterals), thus a tetra‐sectioned type that is almost specific to the genus Garra . This characteristic also increases scale flexibility. The rostral margin of scales was characterized by the presence of waved and striate types. The lepidont shape and size varied being blunt, flat, pointed, tiny, sharp, short, and long. Some of these scale characters and their morphologies could be used as an alternative tool for identification, classification, and phylogenetic interpretation among the different freshwater fish species and genera.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rodents can present a large number of morphophysiological variations of the digestive system, allowing them to feed on different diets. In this context, the objective was to describe the morphology of the major salivary glands of Galea spixii . Gross dissection, light microscopy and transmission and scanning electron microscopy assessments of 12 specimens were carried out. The results demonstrate that the G. spixii has four pairs of major salivary glands (parotid, mandibular, zygomatic and sublingual). The glands are lobulated, composed acinar, consisting of mucous and serous acini, with the predominant parotid gland being serous and the zygomatic gland mucous. The mandibular and sublingual glands are mixed. The glands secrete acidic and neutral mucins and commonly present intercalary, striated and excretory ducts. The ultrastructure of the acinar cells suggests the presence of great cellular activity, with a cytoplasm taken by a rough endoplasmic reticulum, many mitochondria, vesicles of electrolucent nature and dispersed chromatin. In conclusion, the major salivary glands of G. spixii are constituted of mucous and serous acini, with serous acini predominant in the mandibular areas. The data also suggest that these rodents may adopt different types of diets, which may explain their adaptability to semi‐arid environments.",

The objective of this study was to test the effects of temperature during embryonic development of Palaemon serratus on the phenotypic plasticity of hatching larvae. We incubated egg‐bearing females from eggs laying to hatching at four temperatures (10, 15, 18 and 20°C). Weight, carbon and nitrogen contents were measured on newly laid eggs and on freshly hatched larvae. The duration of embryonic development was negatively correlated with incubation temperature. At 20°C, all females abandoned their eggs during development. Incubation temperature had no effect on the weight and the percentage of N of the larvae at hatching, while it did affect their percentage of C and their C/N ratio. Embryos incubated at 10°C seemed to produce larvae with fewer lipid reserves than those incubated at 15 and 18°C. They probably overconsumed their lipid reserves to compensate for the metabolic losses due to the low temperature. These results provide information on the link between maternal investment per egg and larval development in P. serratus .",

Contrary to lizards, salamanders can fully restore their tails, including the neural spine and components of the vertebral column. The axolotl ( Ambystoma mexicanum ) is the vertebrate model organism for regeneration research due to its ease of breeding in captivity. However, axolotls are paedomorphic, retaining larval somatic features throughout adulthood and do not naturally undergo metamorphosis, a transition phase from aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults with profound morphological and physiological changes. We investigate the influence of metamorphosis on salamander tail regeneration after conspecific biting in the metamorphosing sister taxon Ambystoma tigrinum using histological analysis to answer two key questions: (1) Does regeneration continue during metamorphosis, or is it halted? (2) How does regeneration differ histologically among larval, metamorphosing and postmetamorphic individuals? Our findings demonstrate that regeneration continues even during metamorphic climax, indicating the simultaneous coordination of metamorphosis and regeneration. Additionally, notable distinctions were observed between developmental stages concerning the speed of regeneration and structural differences in the formation of an apical epithelial cap (AEC). While the approach taken in this study necessarily restricts sample size, it offers valuable insights into regeneration in a metamorphosing species under natural conditions.",

This approach has proven valuable in confirming taxonomic revisions based on molecular or adult morphology analyses. Therefore, the present study aimed to compare larval traits (e.g. development time, morphology, and larval size) between Macrobrachium amazonicum and M. pantanalense , two closely related species that are separated by a low genetic distance. The first five zoeal stages of each phenotype and species were analysed. Differences in larval development time, morphology, and size were observed. M. amazonicum exhibits faster development during the early larval stages compared to M. pantanalense . The main morphological difference between the two species is related to the stage at which pereiopod five develops as a functional appendage, namely zoea IV in M. amazonicum and zoea III in M. pantanalense . In addition, size variation was observed, with M. pantanalense larvae being larger in the early stages. The differences found between the two species corroborate that M. amazonicum and M. pantanalense are distinct lineages. Even though these groups are separated by a low genetic distance, the existing differences are conclusive, and therefore, these organisms can be considered as two distinct taxonomic entities.",

The calcitic interior walls of both H. robusta MacGillivray and H. squamosa Hutton have a laminated structure. Walls are extended at distal growing edges where the formation of new crystallites is concentrated and wall fabric is nacreous or semi‐nacreous. New crystallites are seeded on the surface of existing crystallites as six‐sided rhombs. At the centres of the rhombs in H. robusta there are often three ‘spikes' which point towards alternate sides of the rhomb. Screw dislocations resulting in spiral overgrowths are also common at these distal wall edges. Wall thickening occurs further proximally where walls develop a regularly foliated structure of imbricated laths growing towards the colony base. Although often thought to be ubiquitous in cyclostomes, the division of walls into three layers (an inner, primary layer flanked on both sides by secondary layers) is absent in Hornera. Wall ultrastructure contrasts strongly with the lamellar–fibrous–lamellar structure recently described from cinctiporid cyclostomes. The c‐axes of the crystallites are orientated perpendicular to the wall surface in Hornera , unlike cinctiporids in which they are orientated within the plane of the wall. Apparent similarities in ultrastructure suggest that Hornera may provide a good model for wall growth in extinct trepostome bryozoans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The bacterial symbiosis in 13 different species of the gutless phallodriline genera Inanidrilus and Olavius (Tubificidae, Oligochaeta) from Carrie Bow Cay (Belize), Florida and Bermuda is structurally compared. The result is an essentially consistent symbiotic pattern regarding the position and ultrastructural design of the prokaryotic partners and their integration in the anatomy of the animal hosts. Based on numerous micrographs, it is calculated that the endobacteria comprise about 25% of the host's volume. This corresponds to at least 0.6 × 10 6 bacterial cells per worm of (fixed) 6 mm length, a figure that underlines the high nutritive importance of the bacteria in this symbiotic association. This importance is also endorsed by the percentage of bacteria in digestion (on average 8–10%, up to 24%) by the phagocytotic epidermal cells of the host. The symbiosis always involves two different morphological types of bacteria, apparently without intermediate stages. Detailed biometrical analyses demonstrate the significantly different size ranges of the two morphotypes, even though in two of the species, the normally rod‐shaped Type S‐bacteria are much longer than usual. About 1% of the larger, oval ‘Type L’ is regularly found in division; in some sections, this value can reach 11%. Formation of sulfur‐containing globules in this type was proven by histochemical analysis. The trophic relevance of the symbiosis is considered. Zoogeographical and evolutionary implications of the observed consistency in the symbiotic pattern in all the species studied are discussed.",

Each sensillum is composed of a mostly solid bothridial seta and a very complex socket, the bothridium. The setal base bends sharply as it passes through the six chambers of the bothridium, which are arranged in an S‐shaped configuration. The proximal end of the seta is an elongated oval and inserted into a thin socket membrane provided with radiating suspension fibres. This peculiar shape of the setal base proper and probably also the existence of connecting pieces are assumed to provide directionality to the sensillum. Two differently shaped tubular bodies are found under the setal base, of which only one is in contact with the seta. The tubular bodies are surrounded by peculiar ‘dense tubes’, i.e. derivatives of the dendritic sheath. The rather thick, outer dendritic segments curve through an extensive receptor lymph cavity and terminate with ciliary regions. The inner dendritic segments are only short. Perikarya and axons as well as the enveloping cells do not show any peculiarities. The trichobothria of moss mites most probably represent vibration receptors reacting to substrate and/or air‐borne stimuli. The variety of shapes and the complexity, which is not found to this extent in any other arthropod group, are discussed in relation to ecophysiological demands.",

Ciliated canals, the enteronephridia, embedded in the intestinal epithelium, open into the stomach near its border to the intestine. The ventral pharynx comprises a muscle bulb connected to a tonguelike organ by an investing muscle. The whole alimentary canal is ciliated except for the intestine of T. mobilis. The stomach is built up of absorptive cells and posteriorly also of secretory cells, whereas the intestine consists of only one cell type which is considered to be mainly absorptive. A typical microvillar brush border is present only in the intestine of T. mobilis ; elsewhere the density of microvilli is low or the cells have irregular apical processes. In N. troglochaetoides the intestine has a ventral ciliary gutter laterally bordered by cells with highly specialized microvilli. The enteronephridia — 3 in N. troglochaetoides and 13 in T. mobilis — are unicellular tubes up to 130 μm long with a microvillar brush border and other cytological features typical for nephridial ducts.

There is no male organ for sperm transfer which inserts into the receptacula seminis. Sperm secretion is only brushed over the openings of the receptacula by cuticular projections of the anterior gonopods (‘brush’). Other parts of the gonopods (projections of the cheirites, podosternite) bring the brush and the openings of the receptacula in the proper position. Examination of the gonopods from series of Craspedosoma from locations near Vienna showed that there are intermediary specimens between the nominal species C. transsilvanicum and C. alemannicum Verhoeff, 1910. Obviously, a mechanical isolation mechanism, as supposed by Verhoeff, does not exist between these nominal species. At the beginning of a copulation, the male forces the female into the mating position. When touched by males, the females try to evade them by rolling up. The possibilities are discussed that females thereby test the actual fitness of males, and that males use their clasper‐like copulatory organs to prevent females from escaping.",

In this study, four specimens are examined to determine if the morphological requirements for warming the brain and eyes are present. A well‐developed arterial orbital rete lies within a venous sinus on both sides of the cranium. Cool, oxygenated blood from the gills can pass through the vessels of this exchanger before reaching the brain or eyes. Since venous blood in the sinus flows opposite the arterial blood, counter‐current heat exchange can occur. A vein originating in the red swimming muscle likely contributes to the warmth of the venous sinus by supplying blood directly from the warmest region of the shark. Before collecting in the orbital sinus, this red muscle vein bathes the brain in warm blood. These morphological data suggest the salmon shark has a significant capacity to warm the brain and eyes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ultrastructural analysis (transmission and electron scanning microscopy) of the eggs of the mayfly Siphlonurus lacustris (Eaton) showed that they are wrapped in a thick coat composed of a network of tightly entwined filaments. Groups of twisted filaments form slightly uplifted buttons that are scattered on the coat surface. After experimentally induced egg deposition, egg–water interaction promotes marked cohesion of the eggs and their firm adhesion to the substrate. Egg masses include numerous gametes; the covering of those located close to the substrate greatly extends to anchor the whole mass. Eggs removed from the coat reveal a slightly punctuated smooth chorion and tagenoform micropyles (three to five). The coat increases egg size by about 20%. The lack of female reproductive accessory glands in Ephemeroptera transfers the synthesis of the adhesive coats to the follicle cells, which are typically competent for insect egg shell deposition (vitelline envelope and chorionic layers). This covering results from electron‐dense granules that give rise to filaments progressively organized to form superimposed layers variously orientated around the egg. In addition to egg adhesion to the substrate, a trophic function and protection from shear stress are postulated for this covering.",

In all investigated species, the dorsal vessel features a bidirectional flow. In the 10th abdominal segment, there is an intracardiac valve preventing flow in the anterior direction. The posterior portion of the dorsal vessel differs significantly from the anterior portion in design and wall structure. Pumping actions and frequencies do not correspond with each other in the two portions. Vessels supply haemolymph to the long terminal appendages. The terminal filament vessel is connected to the dorsal vessel, the two cercal vessels originate from a transverse septum at the base of the terminal filament. All taxa show the same flow pattern through the caudal appendages. Ephemeroptera have a unique spherical body at the posterior end of the dorsal vessel functioning as a backflow valve. The results indicate that the plesiomorphic state of the circulatory organs in the abdomen of primitive insects differ distinctly from that of higher insects which serve as bases for generalized schemes common to entomological textbooks.",

Corrections of the original descriptions of neopilinid anatomy concern the structure of the mantle margin, the presence and interpretation of cephalic appendages, and details of the nervous system. The excretory organs are clearly separated from each other and there is no connection with the pericardium. The neopilinid ctenidia are considered as ventilatory rather than respiratory organs. These corrections and clarifications of the neopilinid anatomy provide an improved database for discussion on monoplacophoran affinities. In contrast to popular statements about “living fossils”, the extant Tryblidiida (Neopilinoidea) are regarded as a considerably modified and specialized early conchiferan branch.",

It is difficult to uphold a clearcut distinction between denticles and setae and several types of setae also intergrade with each other. The trophi of Pollicipes polymerus and P. cornucopia have the most ‘generalized’ morphology. The palps of Pollicipes and L. anatifera are simpler than those in balanomorphs and carry a single type of seta. In L. anatifera the mandibles and maxillules are adapted to a semi‐predatory feeding habit by carrying large, pointed teeth, but this species lacks the foliate‐serrate setae which populate the palps in the other species studied. Compared with Pollicipes and Lepas , the three balanomorphs have palps with a complex setation. The trophi in S. balanoides differ from the two species of Balanus in numerous features of setation and denticulation, notably in having the palps populated by plumodenticulate setae homologous to purely denticulated types in Balanus. It is suggested that SEM studies of barnacle trophi will provide characters of use in estimating phylogeny.",

Similarly, myofilaments are absent from the mesothelia lining all parts of the sclerocoels and the lateral parts of the myocoels (the medial side of the myocoel is a myomesothelium comprising the striated muscles of the body wall). Lancelet coeloms differ from those of other deuterostomes in containing several kinds of formed extracellular materials. All three kinds of coeloms contain distinctive spherules with ramifying processes; dense strands are limited to the myocoels and sclerocoels; and a finely granular secretion is found only at the coelomic surface of the mesothelium lining the sclerocoels. These extracellular materials, which appear to originate from exocytosis of secretory granules from the mesothelial cells, may function biomechanically and for energy storage.

These ostracodes have two lateral compound eyes, with relatively few ommatidia (13 and 20 respectively). They exhibit apposition type compound eyes as seen in many other arthropods. Each ommatidium includes: a flat, ectodermal cuticular covering, corneagen cells, two long cone cells that give rise to a large conspicuous crystalline cone, retinular cells, pigment cells, a microvillar rhabdom and proximal axonal neurons. The axons merge to form an optic nerve that extends into the brain through a short, muscular stalk that is surrounded externally by a cuticle. The number of retinular cells is typically six per ommatidium in V. graminicola and eight per ommatidium in V. tsujii . Screening pigment cells surround each ommatidium forming a layer that is about 5–15 pigment granules thick. In addition to pigment cells, the cytoplasm of the retinular cells includes numerous screening pigment granules. In light/dark adaptation, there are no obvious morphological differences in the orientation of the rhabdom or in the organization of the screening pigments. Both Vargula species studied are nocturnally active and bioluminescent suggesting that these eyes are capable receptors of the bright conspecific luminescence.",

The nervous system consists of four major internal components: (1) a median‐anterior nerve nodule; (2) an equatorial, subcoronal nerve ring; (3) paired aboral nerve cords; (4) paired antero‐lateral nerve tracts. The nervous system is associated with the ciliated larval surface at the apical disc, the pyriform organ, the corona and the intercoronal cells. The paired aboral nerve cords extend from the apical disc to the nerve nodule, which gives rise to the paired antero‐lateral nerve tracts to the pyriform organ and to paired lateral tracts that form the equatorial nerve ring. Ultrastructural evidence is provided for the designation of primary sensory cells in the neural plate of the apical disc and in the juxtapapillary regions of the pyriform organ. Efferent synapses are described between the equatorial nerve ring and the overlying coronal cells, which constitute the primary locomotory organ of the larva. The repertoire of potential functions of the apical disc and pyriform organ are discussed. It is concluded that the apical disc and pyriform organ constitute larval sensory organs involved in orientation and substrate selection, respectively. Their association with the major effector organs of the larva (the corona and the musculature) via the nervous system supports this interpretation.",

The gill surface area per unit body weight is about 4 cm 2 /g wet weight. The blood vascular system anatomy differs from the tip to the base of the gill. In the distal branches of the gill the superficial afferent and efferent vessels are joined by connecting vessels. All vessels arise as spacings between the basal laminae of the thin epidermis and of the coelomic myoepithelium. The contractile part of this epithelium mainly borders the afferent and efferent vessels, whereas pedicel‐like cytoplasmic processes extend from the cell bodies and mainly line the connecting vessels. In the proximal branches of the gill the afferent and efferent vessels located in the coelomic cavity are surrounded by the coelomic myoepithelium, and a peripheral blood plexus is present below the epidermis. The gill epidermis is everywhere thin and does not exhibit the characters of a transporting epithelium. The gill coelomic myoepithelium has several functions: (i) periodic contractions of the gill, propelling blood and coelomic fluid toward the central vascular and coelomic compartments; (ii) blood ultrafilration toward the coelomic cavity; (iii) probably transport, suggested by the specialized structures of the lateral membranes of the cells.",

Five randomly chosen pairs of asterici and sagittae and two lapilli otoliths were shown by X‐ray diffraction to be composed of vaterite. In addition to their mineral composition, the sagitta and astericus of the opah present an unusual combination of anatomical features found in both what are generally regarded as primitive and as advanced fish. Vaterite otoliths also occur in the sunfish Mola mola and M. ramsayi , but with a different crystalline habit to that found in the opah, and in a distinctively different anatomical arrangement of the endolymphatic sac. It is argued that, based on their otolith mineralogy and morphology, the opah and the sunfish are each side of one of the biochemical and anatomical boundaries involved in the separation of the teleosts from other actinopterygian fish (sturgeons, paddle fish, gars and bowfins).",

    "abstract": "Abstract To determine whether vision returns to its original state following eye removal in Achatina fulica , light and electron microscope examinations, electrophysiological recordings and behavioural tests were carried out on the regenerating snails. Reparative morphogenesis can result in the restoration of the peripheral sense organ even in the absence of complete regrowth of the tentacle, but it can also lead to the formation of aberrant regenerates. We found that anatomically and ultrastructurally the eyes of the ‘most normal’ regenerates were basically the same as the original eyes. Under normal conditions each eye is composed of a principal and an accessory eye, both sharing a common cornea. The only difference between regenerated and native eyes is the smaller size of the former, as a result of a reduced number of retinal cells. Electroretinographic responses revealed that the molecular mechanism of phototransduction is restored, in principle, but that flicker fusion frequency in the regenerated eye is significantly lower than in the normal eye. The directional movement to a visual stimulus (a black stripe of 45° width) had not completely recovered even 6 months after amputation. This suggests that the central projections of the optic nerve had not become fully re‐established at the time of testing.",

In the area immediately around the phaosome very few pigment-granules are found. The body of the phaosome is dominated by the visual vacuole, which is totally occluded by numerous intertwining microvilli. The length of the microvilli is at least 5 μm. The cytoplasm around the visual vacuole is restricted to a narrow bordering zone. A presumed chemoreceptor is found in close association with the phaosome.",

The lateral lobes of the auricle are small and do not reach the ventral side of the heart. The hard nucleus in the auriculo‐ventricular plug consists mainly of dense elastic tissue, not of cartilage as in the other lungfishes. The general morphology of the heart, including the entrance of the pulmonary vein, the auriculo‐ventricular plug and the spiral valve of the bulbus cordis, is similar to that of the other lungfishes, so arterial and venous blood can probably be separated in the same way in Neoceratodus up to the level of the bulbus cordis. However, Neoceratodus lacks the horizontal septum in the distal part of the bulbus and all branchial arteries are emitted from an undivided space in the short truncus arteriosus. Thus the mechanism of separation in the distal bulbus of Neoceratodus must be very different from that of the other lungfishes.",

At around day 20 the biphasic larval discharge (which is similar to that of P. adspersus larvae) is followed by the emerging triphasic adult discharge with a delay of about 0.7 ms. Both discharge types coexist for about 3 weeks. As the development advances, the amplitude of the adult discharge increases rapidly while that of the larval discharge diminishes. Whereas the adult EOD waveform of P. marianne remains triphasic later in life, in P. castelnaui an ‘initial flourish’, in the form of additional small phases, is added and develops at an age of about 40 days, when larval and adult EOD are present. Possible evolutionary scenarios are discussed.",

The species has a rare type of spermatogenesis, called semicystic, in which the cyst ruptures in a stage prior to the spermatozoon stage. The most peculiar feature of the spermatozoon is its elongated shape, not typical of an oviparous species. Taking into account our results, the type of ovary and the spawning method, this species shows specialized characteristics which are fairly uncommon among oviparous species. The analysis of other biological aspects of the species, such as the capacity of the males to produce sounds, the low population density, the habit of individual members of burying themselves and the crepuscular habits, combined with our observations concerning their reproductive strategies, lead us to suggest a unique mating behaviour.",

(Department of Anatomy, University College, Cardiff, Wales, U.K.) — Acta zool. (Stockh.) 61(1): 1–7. The time-sequence of response of the prolactin, ACTH and growth hormone cells in the pituitary gland of the leiurus form of the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus L., to a transfer from freshwater to seawater, was studied by light microscopy. The appearance of the pituitary was compared with that of animals caught in brackish or sea water. The prolactin cells respond only slowly to seawater by cytological changes interpreted as signs of decreased secretory activity. It is thus suggested that prolactin is unlikely to be important for osmoregulation in this stickleback. The growth hormone cells are more active in all seawater-adapted animals, while the ACTH cells are less active—although only in laboratory experiments. The differing responses of the pituitaries of the leiurus and trachurus forms of G. aculeatus and Pungitius pungitius to high salinities are compared. Even in species whose pituitaries are virtually identical, the response to high salinites may differ widely.",

There are only a few inclusion bodies with membranous contents. The importance of the pigment epithelium in the retinal metabolic exchange is discussed in view of the fine structure of the cells.

The neurosecretory tracts are directed to the brain floor where they form a storage‐and‐release complex or neurosecretory neuropile , containing secretion‐laden fibre terminals which are diverse in character and can be distinguished on the basis of staining properties. Bundles of axons ( transcapsular fibres ) pass through the neurallamella and come into close association with the epithelioid cells of the infracerebral gland , a possible endocrine structure. The “gland” cells resemble monopolar neuron cell bodies in morphology and are of two types: a cells are devoid of secretory material, whereas b cells contain accumulations of PAF‐positive inclusions.

Peroxisomes are mainly found in middle and basal regions, usually close to mitochondria. Mucous cells are filled with large secretory vesicles containing thin electron‐dense filaments surrounded by electron‐lucent material in which acidic mucopolysaccharides were detected. The basal region includes the nucleus, several Golgi stacks and many dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternae containing tubular structures. The granular cells are characterized by very high amounts of flat rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternae and electron‐dense spherical secretory granules containing glycoproteins. Enteroendocrine cells containing small electron‐dense granules are occasionally present in the basal region of the epithelium. Intraepithelial nerve fibres are abundant and seem to establish contacts with secretory and enteroendocrine cells.",

However, one of these antibodies recognized isoforms in brine shrimp and oysters, two organisms in which the heat‐shock response has been well characterized. Extracts of those organisms and coho salmon tissues were run on the same gels and evaluated on the same Western blots, at the same time. We believe that our results provide a reliable account of Hsc70 in these fish under these conditions. Limited experiments showed that induced thermotolerance was achieved in these coho salmon, lasting for about 1 week after the sublethal heat shock.

The flagellum contained the conventional nine peripheral doublets and one central pair of microtubules (9 + 2 pattern) and lacked lateral fins. The uniflagellate spermatozoa of R. meidingerii were made up of a head, also without an acrosome. For both species the sperm tail was covered by a plasma membrane. The midpiece of C. nasus contained five or six mitochondria on average, vesicles and glycogen granules, whereas the midpiece of R. meidingerii had seven mitochondria of a spherical or ovoid shape. The centriolar complex was located caudolaterally with respect to the nucleus. In C. nasus , the centrioles were orientated at an angle of 125° to each other, whereas the centrioles of R. meidingerii were at an angle of 110°. The fine structure of C. nasus and R. meidingerii spermatozoa showed species‐specific differences in the position of the proximal centriole relative to the distal centriole, the position and number of mitochondria, size of the head and the length of the flagellum.

Central and peripheral neuronal pathways revealed by backfilling with neurobiotin in the optic, tentacular and small labial nerves of Lymnaea stagnalis. —Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 28–47. The TOLm complex in Lymnaea stagnalis contains nerves n. tentacularis, n. opticus and n. labialis minor . Ligatures close to where the complex enters the central nervous system (CNS) did not prevent penetration of retrograde‐transported neurobiotin into fibres of an adjacent nerve. Axonal bifurcation within the common nerve trunk or tight junctions may be involved, providing a basis for peripheral axon reflexes. Peripheral terminations of n. tentacularis , n. labialis minor and n. opticus revealed numerous cell bodies in the tentacular epithelium, some in the tentacle and lip region, and some in the retina. These cell bodies’ central projections were mapped by neurobiotin and verified by dissections of the cerebro‐cerebral commissure and cerebro‐pleural connective. Afferent fibres of the nerves form dense sensory neuropils in the ipsilateral cerebral ganglia. Direct connections between n. tentacularis and some visceral as well as parietal nerves were demonstrated by backfillings through n. pallialis dexter internus et externus , n. pallialis sinister and n. intestinalis . Labelling of n. tentacularis revealed neuronal bodies in every ganglion and stained fibres in most of the peripheral nerves. Fewer neurons were identified through n. labialis minor and n. opticus .

On new evidence of the dermal neck‐joint and shape of the median dorsal plate this family is reassigned from the Phlyctaeniina to the Brachythoraci. The strongly ornamented post‐branchial lamina of the trunk armour relates to a recent hypothesis that special post‐branchial denticles in placoderms are homologous to pharyngeal denticles of crown‐gnathostomes rather than modified external tubercles. Variable development of the post‐branchial lamina and its ornament in different placoderm subgroups, with specific resemblance to the external ornament characteristic of that subgroup, indicates that modification of normal external dermal ornament is the most parsimonious interpretation. A comparison of fish diversity in modern and ancient tropical reef environments is consistent with an equilibrium model for species diversification through time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Our research on the evolution of head development focuses on understanding the developmental origins of morphological innovations and involves asking questions like: How flexible (or conserved) are cell fates, patterns of cell migration or the timing of developmental events (heterochrony)? How do timing changes, or changes in life history affect head development and growth? Our ‘model system’ is a comparison between lungfishes and representatives from all three extant groups of amphibians. Within anuran amphibians, major changes in life history such as the repeated evolution of larval specializations (e.g. carnivory), or indeed the loss of a free‐swimming larva, allows us to test for developmental constraints. Cell migration and cell fate are conserved in cranial neural crest cells in all vertebrates studied so far. Patterning and developmental anatomy of cranial neural crest and head mesoderm cells are conserved within amphibians and even between birds, mammals and amphibians. However, the specific formation of hypobranchial muscles from ventral somitic processes shows variation within tetrapods. The evolution of carnivorous larvae in terminal taxa is correlated with changes in both pattern and timing of head skeletal and muscle development. Sequence‐heterochronic changes are correlated with feeding mode in terminal taxa and with phylogenetic relatedness in basal branches of the phylogeny. Eye muscles seem to form a developmental module that can evolve relatively independently from other head muscles, at least in terms of timing of muscle differentiation.",

Comparative morphology and cytology of the eye, with particular reference to the retina, in lizardfishes (Synodontidae, Teleostei). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 68–79. The retinas of nine species of lizardfishes (Synodontidae) are composed of double cones, single cones, and rods. The cones are 16–28 μm long, and their number in the fundus of adult Synodus variegatus reaches ca. 32,900 mm 2 (varying from ca. 300,000 to ca. 390,000 in a 10 mm 2 of the retina), while in Saurida spp., they number ca. 12,000–14,000/mm 2 . The cone ellipsoids are with up to 600 mitochondria, 0.5–1.6 μm in diameter. The rods are 30–50 μm long; their outer segments 0.6–1.2 μm thick and 15–18 μm long; their inner segments elongated. Their number varies from 15 to 128 million/retina. In fish of similar dimensions but of different species, the number of visual cells in the retina differs. In all species, the eyes increase from 2.0 mm in diameter in the smallest fish studied to 12 mm in the largest one. With eye growth, the retina in the various species increases from ca. 3.8 mm 2 in the smallest fish to ca.160.0 mm 2 in the large Saurida macrolepis .

For zoologists interested in the evolution of shape and form, however, there is a problem. The link between genome sequence and morphology is not direct and is obfuscated by complex and evolving genetic pathways, even when conserved regulatory genes are considered. Nonetheless, a large‐scale comparison of genome sequences between extant chordates reveals an intriguing parallel between genotypic and phenotypic evolution. Tunicates have highly altered genomes, with loss of ancestral genes and shuffled genetic arrangements, while vertebrate genomes are also derived through gene loss and genome duplication. The recently sequenced amphioxus genome, in contrast, reveals much greater stasis on the cephalochordate lineage, in parallel to a less derived body plan. The opportunities and challenges for relating genome evolution to morphological evolution are discussed.",

Long‐term fitness consequences for offspring of female oviposition decisions in the rose bitterling ( Rhodeus ocellatus ). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 367–372. Abstract Female oviposition decisions can have immediate consequences for offspring fitness as well as longer‐term effects, either through irreversible disruption to normal development, inducing alternative adult phenotypes, or through ‘coping’ whereby challenges to development are compensated in the short term, but carry a fitness cost in the adult. We investigated the long‐term impacts of oviposition decisions on offspring fitness parameters in the rose bitterling fish ( Rhodeus ocellatus ). Bitterling lay their eggs in the gills of living freshwater mussels, which complete development inside the mussel gill chamber. Bitterling embryo mortality in mussels is density dependent, and consequently, there are immediate costs associated with using mussels containing high numbers of eggs and embryos. We raised embryos at high and low densities for the first 4 weeks of development and then at a common low density until sexual maturity. Our results showed no effect of density on offspring survival or growth. However, there was an impact of density on age and size at maturity, with embryos raised at high densities becoming sexually mature earlier and at a smaller size. This effect may arise through embryos coping with low oxygen conditions during development. The results are discussed in the context of development and mating system evolution.",

This work describes the heretofore unknown origin and fate of these organelles in the Florida amphioxus ( B ranchiostoma floridae ). In late embryos, epidermal cells at the posterior end of the body increase in height, thus producing a tail fin. One ciliary rootlet in each cell elongates and also rotates through about 90°, soon becoming oriented parallel to the long axis of the cell and running continuously from the apical to the basal plasma membrane. During the subsequent growth of the larval tail, the rootlets and epidermal cells housing them reach lengths up to 120 μm. At metamorphosis, the rootlets become vacuolated and rapidly decrease in length along with the height of the tail epidermis. Contemporaneously, abundant extracellular dermal matrix accumulates in the sagittal plane of the body to produce a predominantly dermal tail fin. Throughout postmetamorphic life, the posterior epidermal cells, now without ciliary rootlets, thinly cover a largely dermal tail flange. Thus, the specialized morphology of the amphioxus tail fin is generated by two different cellular mechanisms, involving different cell populations (ectodermal and mesodermal), at different life‐history stages.",

The first organ to appear is the notochord, followed by the nervous, digestive and cardiovascular systems, and then by muscles and eyes. Embryonic nutritional provisioning was lecithotrophic, with yolk persisting until the last developmental stages and rich in proteins and polysaccharides.

Young individuals of the D onacidae species D onax hanleyanus are often identified as samples of D onax gemmula . Hence, the spermatozoa ultrastructure of both species was described in the present work, aiming to identify characters that could be useful for further taxonomic and phylogenetic analyses. D . hanleyanus and D . gemmula spermatozoa were different especially in relation to acrosomal characteristics and chromatin condensation. The spermatozoon produced by D . hanleyanus had a nucleus (exhibiting granular chromatin with a rope‐like appearance) capped by a long and conical acrosomal vesicle, which extended itself outward beyond the anterior nuclear fossa. Otherwise, the nucleus of the sperm cell of D . gemmula showed well‐compacted chromatin, and its acrosome, which was partially inserted into the anterior nuclear fossa, had a bubble‐like tip. In conclusion, the conspicuous ultra‐structural differences found between the spermatozoan morphologies were helpful for the discrimination of the species. In conclusion, our results suggest that analyses of sperm ultrastructure of the bivalves in the family D onacidae can be valuable to investigate their taxonomic relatedness. The present results also contribute to assess the monophyletic status of the family.",

Twelve tongues were examined by light, stereo‐ and scanning electron microscopy. The elongated tongue possessed an intermolar prominence and terminated in a rounded apex with a median sulcus. The dorsal surface of the tongue bore three types of papillae: filiform, fungiform and vallate, the first two of which were also observed on the ventral lingual surface. The filiform papillae varied in form and arrangement depending on the tongue region, although the majority of them were multifurcate, fork‐like papillae. The fungiform papillae were randomly scattered among the filiform papillae, with the highest density and number of taste pores (up to 12) at the ventral lingual apex. On the posterior tongue, two oval vallate papillae with numerous taste buds on their lateral epithelium were surrounded by a circumferential trench into which the serous von Ebner's glands’ ducts opened. The mucosal surface of the lingual radix was uneven without papillae, but contained mucous openings of Weber's glands. The tongue and lingual papillae of the lesser bamboo rat are similar to those of the large bamboo rat and show structural adaptations to the diet and food manipulation.",

Particularly, higher values of the molar ratio implies more omnivous diet than lower ones. With the same technique is possible to infer variations in the diet of extinct species. For the two Plio‐Pleistocene fossil species Nyctereutes sinensis and Nyctereutes megamastoides , the authors estimate a more carnivorous diet for the latter in comparison to the former that has much higher values. This fact contrast with the morphological features of these two highly comparable species, often considered as morphotypes of the same species. Thanks to the revision of a large sample of N. sinensis from Chinese localities of the Yushe Basin (Shanxi Province), new scores for this species have been calculated. The results presented here confirms a strong adaptation to an omnivorous diet, as emerged from morphofunctional evidence in recent literature.",

Advances have been made in understanding the systematic relationships among sturgeons based on both morphological and molecular data. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA data suggested that Pseudoscaphirhynchus should be regarded as nested within “ Acipenser, ” specifically as sister group to the Stellate Sturgeon, A. stellatus . Recent morphological analyses also recovered this relationship, supported by a number of osteological synapomorphies, although these results were based on few and relatively small individuals. Here we describe the anatomy of the skull of A. stellatus based on newly prepared specimens of adult individuals, as well as examination of a large number of preserved individuals representing a broad range of ontogenetic stages. We present new anatomical data from all regions of the skull (dermatocranium, neurocranium, viscerocranium) and offer interpretations of these and other characters. In particular, we describe the allometry in the snout of A. stellatus , which undergoes substantial elongation relative to other sturgeons. Aspects of the skull of A. stellatus are compared to other members of the family, specifically the course of the occipital sensory canal and the morphology and distribution of cranial spines.",

Tail regeneration in lizards likely occurs in immune‐evasive conditions. In order to strengthen this hypothesis, the presence of the tumour suppressor and macrophage marker Dab2 and the lymphocyte regulatory marker, Foxp3, are evaluated by immunofluorescence in lizard regenerating blastema. The observations reveal sparse Dab2 and Foxp3 cells among blastema cells, identified, respectively, as healing M2‐macrophages and Tregs‐lymphocytes. Dab2 is also detected in basal/suprabasal layers of the apical wound epidermis, suggesting that this protein may participate in controlling cell proliferation of the growing tail by regulating Epidermal Mesenchymal Transition. Tregs marker, Foxp3, is localized in sparse cells among blastema mesenchymal cells and in the regenerating apical ependyma, suggesting the presence of immune cells that stimulate healing and sustain blastema growth. However, due to a similar 14 amino acid‐long epitope between Foxp3 and Foxj1, the employed antibody might also recognize the latter protein, known to be involved in ciliogenesis of ependymal cells in fish and amphibians. It is, therefore, possible that Foxj1 may also be produced in the regenerating ependyma of lizards during ciliogenesis. The study further supports the hypothesis that lizard tail regeneration occurs in immune‐tolerant conditions and that organ regeneration in vertebrates can only occur in an immune‐suppressed or immune‐evasive environment.",

In this review, we look at the osteohistology in selected specimens from the four major avian groups: the long‐tailed Avialae ( Archaeopteryx and Jeholornithiformes), basal Pygostylia, Enantiornithes and Euornithes. Developmental and evolutionary changes in the three major bone layers are observed throughout the bone cortex of the limbs, may it be interspecific or intraspecific. Most noteworthy is the adaptive change from the overall lamellar/parallel‐fibered bone tissue to a fibrolamellar complex in the mid‐cortex as of the basal Pygostylia, potentially even as of the Jeholornithiformes. This change is generally associated with an increase in the density and complexity of the neurovascular network. Another evolutionary‐developmental feature is the progressive loss of post‐natal growth marks as of the non‐ornithurine Euornithes, indicative of uninterrupted bone growth as observed in extant Neornithes. Our comparisons of the osteohistological patterns allow us to better determine how and when specific features typical observed in the avian crown group developed, associated with external and internal factors, and how they lead to what is commonly observed in extant Neornithes.",

In this paper, we studied the toads Rhinella icterica from the Atlantic rainforest, and Rhinella jimi from the Brazilian Semiarid Caatinga, analysing aspects of natural history and comparing their skin morphology, the presence of macroglands, their resistance to water loss and rates of water uptake. In periods of extreme drought, R. jimi uses rock cracks as refuges, exposing only the head and regions of accumulation of poison glands. The skin of R. jimi showed higher number of poison glands with hydrophilic content than R. icterica . R. jimi also had a thicker skin, which can be related to its superior resistance to water loss. It also showed high rates of rehydration in association with a peculiar behaviour using the limbs to spread water onto highly glandular skin areas, suggesting that poison glands may also act in water balance in addition to chemical defence.",

The male reproductive system is formed by a pair of tubular testes dorsolaterally arranged in opisthosoma. They were divided into three regions: proximal region (next to vas deferens), median region and distal region (nearest to the blind ending of testis). Proximal regions are connected to the seminal vesicles by the deferent ducts and to accessory glands, similar to what was observed for other Ixodidae. Feeding plays a fundamental role in the development of the reproductive system, as in unfed individuals, the testes, the seminal vesicles and the accessory glands were smaller comparing with the fed individuals. In addition, the prospermia, precursors of the spermatozoa, were only observed in fed individuals. The germ cells were organized in spermatocysts, enveloped by a connective tissue. The cells in more advanced stages of spermatogenesis were localized in the distal region, in accord with studies in other ticks, but opposite to what was observed for other arthropods.",

The gland is formed by a cluster of class 3 cells underneath the anterior margin of the fifth metasomal sternite, and a reservoir formed by the intersegmental membrane between the fourth and fifth metasomal sternites where the secretion can be stored. The secretory cells contain a branched end apparatus that carries the secretory products towards the duct cell. Externally, the cuticle of the sternite, where the duct cells penetrate, is characterized by modifications as scales with very numerous pores. The presence of Richards' gland according to the model proposed by Samacá et al . 2013 in Protonectarina corroborates the single origin of this gland in Epiponini.

Skin samples were taken from three regions of the trunk (alar, dorsal and pelvic) in 14 specimens which ages ranged from 7 days to adulthood. Serial sections were obtained and subjected to different staining procedures (haematoxylin and eosin, orcein, Masson's trichrome and Gomori), and a morphometric analysis was carried out on stained slides. In general, both epidermis and dermis showed increased thickness of its layers with age. Some differences between regions can be detected both in epidermis and in dermis; for example in adults and 7‐day‐old birds, the stratum corneum of the alar region was thicker than of the dorsal region. In general, the skin of greater rhea was similar to that described in ratites and other birds (a thin epidermis compared to dermis, dermis with scarce elastic fibres, a slender and vascularized stratum superficiale, collagen fibres arranged in three directions). The scarcity of elastic fibres and the general cross‐weaved arrangement of the collagen fibres in the dermis of the adult greater rhea provide strength and flexibility to the dermis, two important features in leather industry.",

On the other hand, it is known that food habits may lead to morphological changes in the DS the same way that different food habits may be imposed by morphological limitations of this system. Among the species of greater commercial importance in Brazil, Micropogonias furnieri is highly representative of fish in south‐eastern Brazil. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyse the morphology of the DS of M. furnieri . Results on the morphology of the DS observed in this study were similar to the patterns determined for the morphology of teleostean fish. In this study, it was observed that the DS of the Whitemouth croaker is directly related with the shape of the peritoneal cavity; these fish showed oesophagus, stomach, pyloric caeca and intestines. The pyloric caeca showed morphological adaptations in relation to sexual maturation, with well‐developed caeca found in sexually mature animals.",

When searching for food, the myzostome uses its protrusible introvert to fulfil two major functions: sensory perception and the capture of food particles. The digestive system is composed of four parts, viz. a pharynx, that is contained within the introvert, a stomach, a series of paired caeca and an intestine that lie in the myzostome's trunk. The pharynx is supplied with a thick muscle which, thanks to peristaltic movements, carries food particles from the mouth to the stomach. Both stomach and caecal cells are able to absorb dissolved nutriments and to store lipids, whereas intestinal cells are only capable of absorption. Due to the beating of their cilia, stomach cells also carry food particles into the caecal lumen, where they are subjected to endocytosis and intracellular digestion by caecal cells. Undigested food fragments eventually gather in a very large, apical vacuole, and the cell apices containing vacuoles are eliminated into the caecal lumen by an apocrinal process. Detached cell apices reach the stomach, where they are embedded in a matrix, together forming a spindle‐shaped faecal mass that is expelled through the postero‐ventral anus. The observed digestive process—entailing the regular elimination of the apical part of the caecal digestive cells—appears to be unique among the Spiralia.",

Further, in both groups a fragmentation of the cartilago paraseptalis occurs in a comparable location and form. Heloderma has no double lacrimal duct, in contrast to previous accounts, but the two canaliculi at the origin of the duct fuse noteworthy far ahead (in other squamates they fuse in front of the bulbus oculi). In the varanids the two branches of the lacrimal duct remain separate and open separately. Some unique features of Heloderma are presented as well, above all the presence of a second concha.",

The pedal muscle of the land snail Megalobulimus oblongus (Gastropoda, Pulmonata): an ultrastructure approach. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 80: 325–337 The ultrastructure of the pedal muscle of the Megalobulimus oblongus is described. This muscle consists of transverse, longitudinal and oblique bundles ensheathed in collagenous tissue. Each muscle cell is also ensheathed by collagen. The smooth muscle cells contain thin and thick filaments; the thin filaments are attached to dense bodies. These cells contain a simple system of sarcoplasmic reticulum, subsarcolemmal caveolae and mitochondria with dense granules in the matrix, and glycogen. Three types of muscle cells were identified. Type A cells exhibited densely packed myofilaments, abundant glycogen rosettes, numerous mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum profiles. Type B cells exhibited scanty glycogen and mitochondria, few cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum and large intermyofibrillar spaces. Type C cells exhibited intermediate characteristics between type A and type B cells. Neither nexus nor desmosomes were observed between the muscle cell membranes. The muscle contains well developed connective tissue and blood vessels. These structures and the distribution of muscle cells are probably involved in the muscular‐hydrostat system. The muscle is richly innervated, having neuromuscular junctions with clear and electron‐dense synaptic vesicles. The clear vesicles probably contain acetylcholine because the axons to which they are connected arise from acetylcholinesterase positive neurones of the pedal ganglion. The other vesicles may secrete monoamines such as serotonin and/or neuropeptides such as substance P.",

The testes are formed on the greatly ramified nephridial blood vessel and are enveloped by a thin layer of peritoneal cells. The spermatogonia vary in shape, are about 10 μm in diameter and are not linked by intercellular bridges. Pairs or tetrads of spermatocytes connected by intercellular bridges float freely in the coelomic cavity. A complex acrosome is produced by a Golgi complex. The acrosome consists of four to five different structures, forms cisternae and, in the mature spermatozoon, lies deep in an invagination of the nucleus. Two centrioles are also situated in a deep centriolar fossa, the proximal centriole being perpendicular to the distal one. The mature spermatozoon is an ect‐aquasperm measuring about 5 μm in length and 2.5 μm in width. The midpiece consists of five spherical mitochondria arranged around the axoneme behind the nucleus. The axoneme is connected to the plasma membrane by a satellite complex. The microtubules of the flagellum are arranged in a typical 9 × 2 + 2 configuration. The spermatogenesis and the sperm morphology of M. viridis were compared with those of other members of the family Spionidae. Copyright © 1996 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

The sensory epithelium on the lamellae is almost continuous and contains receptor cells of both the ciliated and the microvillous type. Ciliated non–sensory cells are scattered throughout the sensory epithelium. Accessory ventilation sacs are lacking. The shape, position and size of the nostrils indicate that forward motion of the fish creates the water current through the olfactory organ (kolymbosmates). The scattered non–sensory cilia may aid in ventilation. The olfactory organ of A. felis differs from that of the other marine catfish, Plotosus lineatus , and from those of freshwater catfishes. The morphological differences are discussed with respect to species–specific behavioural activities.",

Both interior walls (vertical, interzooidal walls, and brood chamber roofs and floors) and exterior walls (basal walls) are initially secreted as tiny wedge‐shaped crystallites without a strong preferred orientation. These are seeded directly onto pre‐existing crystallites in the case of interior walls, but onto the organic cuticle in exterior walls, the bases of the crystallites forming a tightly packed mosaic against the cuticle. With growth the wedges become longer, broader and relatively flatter, developing into platey crystallites. These crystallites grow predominantly distally (i.e. parallel to wall growth direction) and are closely imbricated in a foliated fabric. Local disruptions to this pattern occur, especially in association with crystallite division along “divergent zones”. The pattern also breaks down in old walls where crystallite growing edges become less evident and imbrication is poorly developed. Although conforming to this general model, some differences exist between species of lichenoporids, and in the patterns found in different parts of the skeleton (e.g. apertural spines). Lichenoporid ultrastructure differs from that of both cinctiporid and hornerid cyclostomes: notably, lichenoporids lack the layer of transverse fibres found in cinctiporids, and their predominant distal growth direction of crystallites contrasts with the proximal direction found in hornerids.",

Many primary freshwater teleosts (Osteoglossiformes, Cypriniformes, Characiformes, Siluriformes, Gymnotiformes, and Synbranchiformes) possess none or a reduced SV. Some secondary freshwater teleosts also possess a reduced SV, but other secondary freshwater teleosts have a well‐developed SV. Some marine teleosts swimming in the surface water, for example, the Clupeiformes and Scombridae, possess a somewhat reduced SV. Bathypelagic teleosts also possess a rather reduced SV. On the other hand, most marine teleosts, benthic or nektonic in the subsurface water, have a well‐developed SV. The examples are the Anguilliformes, Scorpaeniformes, Perciformes, Pleuronectiformes, and Tetraodontiformes. Since all non‐teleostean actinopterygians possess a well‐deveoped SV, it is assumed that the earliest teleosts also possessed a SV. In the course of adaptive radiation, some teleost groups certainly have reduced or lost the SV while others developed it to various degrees. Reduction or development of the SV might be influenced more easily by environments in certain groups and might be constrained more strongly by phylogenetic lineages in other groups.",

Two species of Heteropora have interior zooecial walls comprising a granular precursory layer followed by a thick layer of transverse fibres and a subordinate foliated fabric with, in mature proximal walls, a semi‐nacreous layer. The remaining seven species have interior walls with no transverse fibres and instead predominantly comprise a distally‐imbricated, regularly foliated fabric overlying a granular precursory layer. Older, proximal surfaces often have abundant screw dislocations, but true semi‐nacre is absent. Basal walls comprise an outer finely granular precursory fabric and planar spherulitic layer, succeeded by the same ultrastructural succession seen in the interior zooecial walls of the respective groups. Exterior walled diaphragms, peristomes and gonozooids similarly comprise an external fabric of planar spherulitic calcite, lined internally by the predominant fabric seen in the interior walls. Ultrastructurally, therefore, cerioporines may be split into two groups with different fabric suites, the first resembling cinctiporids and many tubuliporines in having interior walls with fabrics of transverse fibres, foliated crystallites and semi‐nacre; and the second resembling the rectangulates Lichenopora and Disporella in having interior walls comprising only the foliated fabric. These findings support the close phylogenetic relationship between cerioporines and other cyclostomes but suggest that the cerioporines may constitute either a diphyletic or a paraphyletic group.",

The transition from the otoconial mass found in the endolymphatic sac of sharks and rays to the rigid polycrystalline otolith of teleosts probably occurred by progressive fusion of otoconia from a loose aggregate to a semi‐rigid mass. Traces of the primitive fused otoconia type of otolith still occur in the otherwise polycrystalline otoliths of some teleosts, and a few species of fish retain otoliths that are probably similar to the primitive fused otoconia type of otolith. The morphology of the fusion of otoconia varies according to the polymorph of calcium carbonate that is involved, as well as the particular crystal habit of the polymorph. Analyses of the size distributions of the polymorph‐specific morphologies and crystal structure of otoconia suggest that three physical chemical processes, Ostwald ripening, Keith‐Padden spherulitic growth and carbonate cementation are significant in the chemistry of fusion of otoconia in the evolution of the aragonite teleost otolith. Predictions of otoconia growth rate from the theory of Ostwald ripening can be compared with predictions from the Keith‐Padden theory of spherulitic growth.",

Representatives as diverse as ostracods, cirripeds, orstenocarids and skaracarids appear in the Cambrian, so we are dealing with a radiation that in the most part took place over 500 million years ago. A progenetic origin of the maxillopodans, from an ur‐malacostracan stock, has been proposed (Newman, W. A. 1983. Crustacean phylogeny—Crustacean Issues , Vol. 1, pp. 105–119). However, new information, including the recently discovered Cambrian forms Skaracarida and Orstenocarida, the structure of spermatozoa, and preliminary results from the sequencing of ribosomal RNA, suggests that the Maxillopoda are more deeply rooted in the crustaceans than previously supposed, likely closer to the ur‐crustacean than to the ur‐malacostracan.",

Epidermal complexes, which occur on podial surfaces directly contacting the sediment, each comprise four cells: a non‐ciliated secretory cell containing granules rich in mucopolysaccharides (NCS cell), a ciliated secretory cell containing granules of unknown composition (CS cell), and two ciliated non‐secretory cells (CNS cells). The cilium of the CS cell is subcuticular whereas that of each CNS cell traverses the cuticle. We propose that these four cells constitute a sensory‐secretory complex wherein the ciliated cells are sensory cells and the secretory cells function for adhesion and de‐adhesion. More exactly, an NCS cell adhesive and a CS cell de‐adhesive would be sequential and would be initiated by two successive stimulations transduced by cilia when the podium touches the sediment. Cilia that first contact the sediment are those protruding through the cuticle from the CNS cells. Their stimulation would result in the secretion of an adhesive material by the NCS cells. Subsequently, the subcuticular cilia of CS cells would be stimulated when the podial digitations closely squeeze the substrate, and this would induce the secretion of a de‐adhesive. These two antagonistic secretions would allow the podium to pick up and discharge sediment repetitively during burrowing and feeding.",

The fibrous basal lamina of the tegument forms a large extracellular compartment communicating through narrow interstices in the subtegument with extracellular lacunae in the parenchyma. Intercellular junctions of the gap junction‐type frequently occur between the tegument cell bodies, as well as between tegument and parenchymal cells. According to the function of these cells in nutrient uptake and storage, metabolic coupling seemed the most likely mission for these junctions.

Over most of the retina the cone population consists of single cones arranged in a very regular hexagonal mosaic.

The perpendicular arrangement of the centrioles is also shared with the Bufonoidea and is considered a synapomorphic condition. An expanded undulating membrane and the absence of a juxtaxonemal fibre appear to be apomorphic characteristics of dendrobatid species, as also observed (homoplastically) for species of Litoria and Cyclorana . However, the notable expansion of the undulating membrane appears to be an autapomorphy of Dendrobatidae frogs.

The numerous different erect colony types, certainly independently derived from this stage, show a higher degree of integration. Eventually forms arise with a strict pattern only little influenced by the environment. The Flustra foliacea colony holds an intermediate position in this respect. It forms an initial crust on a foreign substratum such as rock. The crust forms marginal lobes. The lobes collide two and two. The two components of each collision then rise back to back, owing to lack of space, into bilaminar fronds. The two zooid layers composing these erect branches and mutually encrusting the \"auto-substratum\" of their respective basal walls, grow much more rapidly than the initial crust on the \"heterosubstratum\" of the rock to finally comprise more than 95 % of the colony volume. The different rate of growth on \"auto-\" and \"heterosubstratum\" respectively is interpreted as indicating a preference for the \"autosubstratum\" and as the main force in the formation of erect branches. The Fl. foliacea case indicates one of the pathways from encrusting to erect colonies in the bryozoans. It is probably valid for at least some of the erect bilaminar colonies appearing in different parts of the bryozoan system.",

However, the evolutionary significance of this pharyngeal structure has been a mystery because of the lack of an obvious corollary in vertebrates or other close relatives. To address the homology of the csg by molecular means, we report the cloning and expression patterns of two amphioxus genes expressed during its development, crabp and maf . Amphioxus maf is a bzip transcription factor expressed early in csg formation in the forming of the ventral duct of the gland. crabp encodes a cellular retinoic acid binding protein and is expressed widely in the csg later in its development. We compare these genes to the expression of AmphiKrox , a zinc‐finger transcription factor previously reported to be expressed during csg development. Together these genes mark different spatial and temporal aspects of csg formation. However, we find little evidence to suggest homology of the csg with other organs in amphioxus or other chordates. We therefore propose that the csg can be viewed as an evolutionary novelty that probably arose within the amphioxus lineage.",

Features shared with palaeognaths and the Galloanserae are the conical acrosome, shorter than the nucleus; the presence of a proximal as well as distal centriole; the elongate midpiece with mitochondria grouped around an elongate distal centriole; and the presence of a fibrous or amorphous sheath around the principal piece of the axoneme. The perforatorium and endonuclear canal are lost in A. apus as in some other non‐passerines. All non‐passerines differ from palaeognaths in that the latter have a transversely ribbed fibrous sheath whereas in non‐passerines it is amorphous, as in Apus , or absent. The absence of an annulus is an apomorphic but homoplastic feature of swift, psittaciform, gruiform and passerine spermatozoa. The long distal centriole, penetrating the entire midpiece, is a remarkably plesiomorphic feature of the swift spermatozoa, known elsewhere only in palaeognaths. The long centriole of Apus , if not a reversal, would be inconsistent with the former placement of the Apodiformes above the Psittaciformes from DNA–DNA hybridization. In contrast to passerines, in A. apus the microtubules in the spermatid are restricted to a transient single row encircling the cell. The form of the spermatozoon fully justifies the exclusion of swifts from the passerine family Hirundinidae.",

The scoloplacid spermiogenesis is similar to those found in Diplomystidae, the most primitive siluriform family. The scoloplacid spermatozoa have all the main characteristics of introsperm. They exhibit a conic head, a symmetric midpiece, a medial flagellum, and no acrosome. The conic forward‐elongated nuclei contain homogeneous chromatin. The thin extremity of the nuclei is strongly curved and along its internal face there is a well‐developed membranous compartment. The centrioles are completely inside the medial nuclear fossa, perpendicular to each other and with an electron‐dense material between them. In a cross view of the midpiece, the mitochondria form a ring surrounding internally the cytoplasmic channel, and in a longitudinal view they are organized in a row along it. Several elongated vesicles are distributed peripherally, mainly concentrated in the mid‐piece basal region. The flagellum contains the classical axoneme (9 + 2) and has two lateral projections or fins. The spermatozoa of scoloplacids share several characteristics with those of Auchenipteridae. Since these two families are not phylogenetically related this similarity seems to be due to convergence once both families are, until now, the only known siluriform families with introsperm.",

The rete tibiotarsale is the main arterio-venous heat exchange system in the hind limb of the Mallard. A large arterial shunt and a venous shunt allow the blood to by-pass the rete. These shunt vessels must be able to constrict so as to direct the blood to the rete when heat conservation is needed. Using ordinary histological methods and the technique of Falck and Hillarp for demonstration of biogenic monoamines, it was shown that the arterial shunt is more muscular and receives a more dense adrenergic innervation than adjacent segments of the same vessel. Perfusion with noradrenaline before fixation revealed that the arterial shunt was able to reduce its lumen to near closure. No structure, in the ordinary sense of a sphincter, was found in the shunt vein but adrenergic nerves were scattered throughout the tunica media at the base of venous valves, suggesting that a sphincteric action at these sites is possible.",

Of especial interest was whether young individuals increased their reproductive effort, and thereby their reproductive cost, as much as older birds when brood size was enlarged. To address these questions, a brood‐size manipulation experiment with reciprocal cross‐fostering of nestlings of young and middle‐aged female Collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis , was performed on the Swedish island of Gotland. Nestlings’ body mass, tarsus length and survival were recorded to estimate the parental ability and parental effort of the experimental female birds. Female survival and clutch size were recorded in the following years to estimate reproductive costs. We found that middle‐aged female flycatchers coped better with enlarged broods than younger females or invested more in reproduction. In the following year, young female birds that had raised enlarged broods laid smaller clutches than the females from all the other experimental groups. This result shows that the young female birds pay higher reproductive costs than the middle‐aged females. Both young and middle‐aged female flycatchers seemed to increase their reproductive effort when brood size was increased. However, such an increase resulted in higher reproductive costs for the young females. The difference in reproductive costs between birds of different ages is most likely a result of insufficient breeding skills of the young individuals.",

It consists of two ossifications, the epipterygoid and the quadrate, which were joined by cartilage in life. The margins of the cartilage are clearly indicated by ridges and grooves on the dorsal surface of the pterygoid. The epipterygoid ossification consists of two structures: the anteroposteriorly expanded basal portion and, dorsally from it, an extending, slender, ascending process. From the anterior margin of the basal portion of the epipterygoid, a plate‐like structure, herein called the lamina epipterygoidea anteromedialis, extends anteromedially to form the anterolateral wall of the cavum epiptericum. Comparisons with the similarly constructed embryonal and adult epipterygoid components of Sphenodon punctatus show that the anteromedial lamina of the epipterygoid of P. fergusi is an additional component of the epipterygoid of this species and that this lamina is absent in the former species. However, a structure in a topologically similar position to the anteromedial lamina of the epipterygoid of P. fergusi is present in the palatoquadrate of Alligator mississippiensis . In the latter species, the structure is called the lamina palatoquadrati anterior; it ossifies in membrane and forms the dorsolateral cover of the huge trigeminal ganglion. It is hypothesized here that the anteromedial lamina of the epipterygoid of P. fergusi and the anterior lamina of the palatoquadrate of A. mississippiensis are most probably homologous structures and are present in both the basal and one of the crown taxa of the archosauromorph clade, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The development of the tongue and the histogenesis of its filiform papillae and mucous glands have been studied in twelve premetamorphic, ten metamorphic and one adult stage of Rana catesbeiana . The differentiation of the tongue anlage is described macroscopically and histologically. Its dorsal epithelium increases progressively in thickness. A maximum thickness of from then to twelve cell layers is reached just before the onset of metamorphosis. The general epithelium then undergoes degeneration between the developing papillae and mucous glands. Four premetamorphic papillae are known to develop during the larval period. They form a transverse row across the approximate anterior‐posterior center of the tongue anlage. The growth and subsequent regression of these structures is described. A gustatory function is tentatively assigned to these structures. Filiform papillae and mucous glands arise from either conical or rectangular cell groups in the dorsal epithelium of the tongue. The anlagen of these structures are first seen during larval involution at a stage usually just prior to the emergence of the forelimbs. The distal portion of two adjacent halves of an anlage migrate or grow towards each other and fuse to constitute a single papillary rudiment. The papillary core develops between these half anlagen. The epithelium of the papillae consists of but one layer of unciliated cells. Mucous glands differentiate from the basal portion of each cell group. A general similarity in the development and histology of filiform papillae and mucous glands is noted when comparing R. catesbeiana with R. sylvatica . Certain developmental and histological differences do exist, however, between these two species.",

The eggs of Ephemerellidae may be considered among the most studied in mayfly families, especially with regard to the number of species for which they have been described (approximately 32 species corresponding to 12 genera). However, this study provides new details of the egg morphology of three species of this family, Serratella ignita (Poda 1761) , S. spinosa (Ikonomov 1961) and Torleya major (Klapalek 1905). The main finding was that the morphology and organization of the lateral attachment structures do not resemble the type normally associated with ‘knob terminated coiled thread ’ (KCT). The particular characteristics of this structure, never before described for Ephemeroptera, led us to propose a new type of attachment structure, the ‘ multithread‐folded with terminal fibre cluster ’ (MFT). We also provide a detailed description of the chorion morphology of the eggs of the three species, identifying a tear‐shaped variation in the oval sperm guide and confirming the type III polar caps in the two species of Serratella Walsh, 1862.",

A detailed morphological description is provided of the neurocranium of Squatina guggenheim and compared with S. argentina and S. occulta . Despite being generally conservative, the neurocranium of Squatina presents significant differences among these species which aid in their identification, which is otherwise problematical. The main distinctions were found in rostral projections, anterior fontanellae, supraorbital crests, upper and lower postorbital processes, otic capsules, suborbital crests, and pterotic processes. Squatina guggenheim and S . occulta share more neurocranial characters when compared to S. argentina .

Significant changes appeared during the morphogenesis of the papillae. At E12, two rows of rudiments of fungiform papillae were extended bilaterally on the anterior half of the tongue. At E16, the rudiments of fungiform papillae were regularly arranged in a lattice‐like pattern. A rudiment of circumvallate papillae could be recognized. No rudiment of filiform papillae was visible. No evidence of keratinization was recognizable. At P0, rudiments of filiform papillae were visible but had a more rounded appearance, with keratinization. The fungiform and circumvallate papillae were large and their outlines were somewhat irregular as that found in the adult rat. At P7, the filiform papillae were large and slender. The fungiform papillae became large and the shape of circumvallate papillae was almost similar to that observed in the adult. At P14 and P21, the shape and structure of the three types of papillae were irregular as those found in the adult. In conclusion, the rudiments of the fungiform and circumvallate papillae were visible earlier than those of the filiform papillae. The morphogenesis of filiform papillae advanced in a parallel manner with the keratinization of the lingual epithelium, in the period from just before birth to a few weeks after birth.",

Although considered from its discovery as a species on its own, its biological status is debated. During the early seventies T. blanchardi was reduced to a mere form of T. tubifex , as a particular case of polymorphism in chaetal pattern. Using classical histological techniques, microdissections of portions of the male genital apparatus and phalloidin staining of dissected copulatory organs we investigated 163 mixed individuals of T. blanchardi and T. tubifex belonging to sympatric populations from the Lambro River (Milan, Northern Italy). The internal morphology of T. blanchardi is described for the first time. Our results show that T. tubifex and T. blanchardi differ in several characters concerning both their external and internal morphology, and in the fine organization of their copulatory organs. Several independent character sets support the separation of T. blanchardi from T. tubifex, suggesting that it is an independent species. This study also supports the idea that T. blanchardi and T. berg i (Hrabě, 1935), another species closely related to T. tubifex , are not conspecific. The observed morphological differences between allopatric populations of T. tubifex are discussed.",

Structural and ultrastructural studies of male reproductive tract and spermatozoa in Xylocopa frontalis (Hymenoptera, Apidae). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 176–183. In Xylocopa frontalis the reproductive tract is composed of testes, deferent ducts, seminal vesicles, accessory glands and an ejaculatory duct. Each testis comprises four testicular tubules in which multiple cysts are present containing approximately 64 spermatozoa per cyst. The seminal vesicle consists of an epithelium, a thick basement lamina and a muscular external sheet. In the luminal region some vesicles can be observed; however, the epithelial cells of the seminal vesicle do not display morphological features associated with secretory functions. The spermatozoa, measuring approximately 260 µm long, are similar to the hymenopteran pattern. The head region consists of an acrosome with an inner perforatorium that penetrates an asymmetrical nuclear tip. The nucleus is linear, electron‐dense and its posterior tip projects into the beginning of the axoneme. The centriolar adjunct is asymmetric with many electron‐lucent lacunae interspersed throughout. The axoneme has the 9 + 9 + 2 pattern of microtubules and in the posterior region the central microtubules finish first, followed by the doublets and finally the accessory microtubules. The mitochondrial derivatives are asymmetric in both length and diameter with paracrystalline material present only in the larger one. These features may be useful characters for taxonomy and phylogenetic studies.",

These conditions are similar to those found in the Eurasian R. temporaria . Rana clamitans and R. catesbeiana are distinguished by a considerably narrower palatoquadrate in the region posterior to the anterior quadratocranial commissure, a more anterior position of attachment of the larval otic process to the palatoquadrate, and the presence of a lateral trabecular process in some specimens. These characters may represent larval synapomorphies for the traditional R. catesbeiana group (= Aquarana ).",

The five species and the two subgenera ( Microtus and Terricola ) were morphometrically clearly distinguished and discriminating variables were revealed. However, morphometrics did not provide robust criteria to infer phylogenetic relations among species. Furthermore, three species, M. (M.) guentheri , M. (M.) rossiaemeridionalis and M.

Comparisons with data in the literature, mainly concerning populations of these species from adjacent areas, indicate that the Greek M. (M.) guentheri , M. (M.) rossiaemeridionalis and M.

Here we argue why it makes sense to define the homology‐concept in a way, so it is applicable for phylogenetic purposes. If used to define the relation among structures of organisms assigned to the same character state of a phylogenetic character, homology has to represent an equivalence relation, with the properties of transitivity and symmetry. This is exactly the reason why correspondence, not similarity should be used to define homology, since the latter is not transitive. Homology then also cannot be used to define the relation among character states of the same phylogenetic character, since this relation necessarily is asymmetric.",

The ultrastructure of mature spermatozoa and paraspermatozoa of Odontocymbiola magellanica is investigated. Euspermatozoa consist of: (1) a tall, conical acrosomal vesicle (with a short basal invagination, constricted anteriorly); (2) a rod-shaped, solid and highly electron-dense nucleus; (3) an elongate midpiece consisting of the axoneme sheathed by helical mitochondrial elements each exhibiting a dense U-shaped outer layer; (4) an elongate glycogen piece; (5) a dense annulus at the junction of the midpiece and glycogen piece; and (6) a short free-tail region. Paraspermatozoa of O. magellanica are vermiform and dimorphic. First type contain approximately 14–17 axonemes (arranged peripherally and interspersed with microtubules) and numerous oblong dense vesicles, numerous less dense (round) vesicles, and scattered mitochondria; the second type contains 38–45 axonemes peripherally arranged and closer to the core region of the cell and occasional mitochondria. Most of the euspermatozoal features of O. magellanica are also observed in many neotaenioglossans and neogastropods. However, the U-shaped outer layer of each mitochondrial element has only been previously reported in the Volutidae subfamily Zidoniinae.

The female cloaca of an oviparous caecilian amphibian (Gymnophiona): functional and seasonal aspects. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00 :1–14. Reproductive morphology is receiving increased attention in animals that have variable reproductive modes combined with internal fertilization. Exceptionally among amphibians all caecilian species practice internal fertilization via an intromittent organ: an everted part of the male cloaca (phallodeum or phallus). Because research has mostly concentrated on males, knowledge of the female cloacal morphology is scarce. Here, we present the first single‐species study of the functional morphology of the female cloaca of an oviparous, phylogenetically basal caecilian ( Ichthyophis cf. kohtaoensis ). We have analyzed female cloacal shape during the reproductive cycle combining conventional histology with 3D‐reconstruction. All females are similar in their overall cloacal structure with some differences in size and histology associated with the reproductive cycle. The female cloaca is divided into two distinct chambers similar to the male condition. The cranial chamber contains urogenital pockets into which oviducts and Wolffian ducts open and which may have function during oviposition. The caudal cloacal chamber bears a novel feature – dorsolateral blind sacs, which are homologous to the male condition, but are considerably smaller. The study of female cloacal morphology is essential to understanding the evolution of the caecilian reproductive system and contributes to the understanding of tetrapod genital morphology in general.",

Abstract Anatomical and physiological studies of cardiovascular control in garfish are scarce. The combination of muscle labelling and neurochemical identification of extrinsic and intrinsic nerves in the heart of Lepisosteus osseus reveals a well‐developed system of adrenergic, cholinergic, substance P (SP)‐ and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)‐containing nerve terminals in the walls of the conus arteriosus, the sinus venosus and the atrium. Double labelling showed that nNOS‐immunoreactive terminals do not co‐label for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and choline acetyl transferase (ChAt). Coronary blood vessels running in the epicardium of the conus arteriosus and ventricle receive a rich supply of nNOS‐positive nerve fibres. The main intracardial localization of nervous tissue is in a sinoatrial plexus corresponding to the pacemaker region of the heart. This plexus is a network of SP‐, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)‐ and pituitary adenylate cyclase‐activating polypeptide (PACAP)‐positive nerve fibres and nerve cell bodies, but its function in fish cardiac regulation remains to be elucidated. This study provides morphological data on distinct nitrergic, peptidergic, ChAT and TH nerve terminals thus pertaining to the neurochemical content of the vagal motor and adrenergic, and intrinsic innervation revealing a complexity of the neuronal control of the garfish heart.

The claw closer muscle of two estuarine crab species, Cyrtograpsus angulatus and Neohelice granulata (Grapsoidea, Varunidae): histochemical fibre type composition. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00 : 1–7. This study permitted the characterization of four types of muscle fibres in the claw closer muscles of Cyrtograpsus angulatus and Neohelice granulata . Succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) for mitochondria, periodic acid Schiff (PAS) for glycogen, Sudan Black B for lipids and myosin‐adenosine triphosphatase (m‐ATPase) preincubated at alkaline and acid pHs were used for that purpose. The mean fibre diameters, the relative areas and frequencies of each muscle fibre type were calculated. Types I and IV would be considered ‘extreme’ groups with type I fibres large, weak and acid/alkaline‐labile m‐ATPase, weak SDH, PAS and Sudan, and type IV fibres small, very strong and acid/alkaline‐resistant m‐ATPase, strong SDH and PAS, and moderate Sudan. Types II and III would belong to a predominant ‘intermediate’ group. Type IV fibres were scarce in C. angulatus but represented 25% of the total fibre population in N. granulata . In C. angulatus , the relative area occupied by type I fibres was bigger than its relative proportion, whereas in N. granulata, types I and II had similar patterns. Concluding, variations in fibre type composition in the claw closer muscles of C. angulatus and N. granulata would be linked to different habitats and feeding behaviours.",

To evaluate the phylogenetic signals, 18 unordered characters were utilized in implied weighting analysis through the program TNT 1.1. Four variations of spermiogenesis were found. In the earliest spermatids, the nucleus can be positioned lateral, eccentric, strongly eccentric or nearly medial in relation to the distal centriole. The nuclear rotation can be present or absent. These spermiogenesis processes are related or intermediate to T ype I and T ype III . Taking into account the degrees of nuclear rotation during the spermiogenesis and other characteristics, distinct forms of spermatozoa are observed among the species analyzed. The phylogenetic analysis yielded a single most parsimonious tree with fit value 2.70000 and the topology obtained founds M oenkhausia as non‐monophyletic. However, some hypothesis of relationships previously proposed viz the clade 20, which contains the type species M oenkhausia xinguensis , is recovered herein. This clade is supported by five synapomorphies, and it allows the supposition that these species constitute a monophyletic group. The whole topology is presented and discussed.",

The orbitotemporal region is dramatically different from those observed for other species of turtles in that the: (1) planum supraseptale is greatly reduced and present only as tiny projections on the posterodorsal margin of the interorbital septum, (2) pila metoptica is free from all neighbouring structures and bifurcates distally, (3) pila antotica is greatly reduced, (4) foramina for optic nerve, ophthalmic artery and oculomotor nerves are open dorsally by virtue of this species lacking the taenia marginalis and taenia medialis, and (5) tectum synoticum is present and invested dorsally by the supraoccipital, despite the fact that this bone forms by replacement of the supraoccipital. The unique morphology of the pila metoptica is explained either as de novo formation of processes on the terminus of this cartilage or by retention of portions of the taenia medialis (anteriorly) and pila antotica or pila accessoria (posteriorly). Variation in the orbitotemporal region presented here is discussed for two other pleurodiran turtles ( P hrynops hilarii and E mydura subglobosa ) and briefly compared with the anatomy observed in C ryptodira.",

Structurally, atrium and ventricle muscle fibers exhibit typical features of cardiac fibers revealing myofibrils bundles, mitochondria, plate‐shaped junctions, anastomosis between myofibrils bundles, and electron‐dense granule natriuretic around the nucleus and mitochondria of atrium muscle cells. The Southern‐fur‐seal heart was structurally similar to other mammals; however, it presented morphological changes that assist in their adaptation to their environment.",

Comparative morphology and cytology of the alimentary tract in lizardfishes (Teleostei, Aulopiformes, Synodontidae). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 308–318. This study compares the morphology and cytology of the alimentary tract in several species of lizardfishes (Synodontidae, Teleostei) of the genera Saurida, Synodus, and Trachinocephalus , in relation to their diets and bathymetric distribution. All the studied species feature a large, pouch‐like stomach, with the intestine beginning at the stomach’s anterior apex, adjacent to the esophageal opening. In the more ‘microphagous’ Synodus spp. and Trachinocephalus, the intestine bends twice before reaching the anus, whereas in the more ‘macrophagous’ Saurida spp., the intestine extends straight to the anus. The species differ also in the number and form of their pyloric ceca, the length of the intestine and in the percentile relationship between stomach length and standard body length. Along the alimentary tract folds and villi protrude into the lumen, their numbers differing on various sites of the tract. Three cell types make up the gastric gland system: (1) pyramidal cells forming the tubular gastric glands in the lamina propria ; among them are large, pale secretary cells; (2) groups of neck cells that surround the pits of the tubules; and (3) groups of large and granule‐rich cells at the end portion of the stomach. All species are carnivorous and uniform in morphology, the differences in the alimentary tract found between the more shallow‐water species of Synodus and Trachinocephalus , and the deeper‐dwelling Saurida , seem to be only partly correlated with the differences in diet.",

The coeloms in a late brachiolaria larva of the asterinid sea star Parvulastra exigua: deriving an asteroid coelomic model. —Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 92: 266–275. The coeloms and their interconnexions in a late pre-metamorphic brachiolaria larva of a sea star are described from the series of images in the frontal, transverse and sagittal planes obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy. A larval, brachial coelom connects with the coeloms of the adult rudiment that lie posteriorly. The connexion is through the anterior coelom, which lies over the head of the archenteron, to the right anterior coelom and then to the left posterior coelom through the ventral horn of the left posterior coelom. The right posterior coelom is a separate coelom. The hydrocoele is on the larval left side separated from other coeloms except for a connexion to the anterior coelom. On the larval right side, the anterior coelom and right anterior coelom connect with the pore canal that opens to the exterior at the hydropore. From these coeloms, we derived an asteroid coelomic model comprising the larval left and right coeloms linked over the head of the archenteron by a common anterior coelom. The asymmetry of the hydrocoele and the left posterior coelom on the left side linked through the common anterior coelom to the right side, with the external opening, translates into the oral and aboral coeloms of the adult stage. The coelomic model has application in the search for morphological homology between the echinoderm classes and the deuterostome phyla.",

In this study, spot numbers, spot circularity, spot size and spot asymmetry were studied during larval to adult growth in N. microspilotus during July 2012 to June 2015. The mean numbers of spots increased during the late larval stage till postmetamorphic period from 13.33 ± 3.77 to 22.53 ± 4.09 and reached 42.62 ± 4.06 in adults. At the same time, the extent of spots gradually decreased in size from 5.80 ± 1.00 to 3.57 ± 0.97 mm 2 and reached 3.55 ± 1.42 mm 2 in adults, but the spot circularity increased from 0.48 ± 0.23 to 0.78 ± 0.49 and reached 0.80 ± 0.15 in adults. In adults, the numbers, circularity, size and asymmetry of spots remain stable with little but non‐significant changes during the study period. Histological study shows that formation of a melanophore‐free region correlates with the development of the lateral line receptors. This study demonstrates that the effects of lateral line on chromatophores persist through middle larval stages but diminish as metamorphosis completes.",

Development of their reproductive system begins after completion of the pubertal moult. The growth of the gonopodium showed negative allometry for both juveniles and adults. The reproductive system is divided into portions with different functions. There is a germinal zone in the testes containing spermatogonia, a zone of maturation containing spermatocytes, spermatids or spermatozoa, as well as a collecting duct, which carries spermatozoa to the vas deferens. There are two matrices in the anterior vas deferens that initiate the separation of spermatozoa groups, one composed of polysaccharide acids (matrix I) and another consisting of neutral polysaccharides (matrix II). In the median vas deferens, the matrix II forms an acellular capsule, which forms the spermatophores. In the posterior vas deferens, the matrices are accumulated, initially with a granular texture and are homogenous for the final portion. The ejaculatory duct and penis have muscle lining to expel the spermatophores at copulation. Even after copulation, males retain a stock of spermatophores, allowing copulation with other females.",

The species considered include the ice‐obligate—Weddell ( Leptonychotes weddellii ) and leopard ( Hydrurga leptonyx ) seal—and the ice‐tolerant, and southern elephant seal ( Mirounga leonina ). In addition, we attempted to link the histological features to their different lifestyles. All three species showed features related to their amphibious lifestyle (i.e., parakeratotic epidermis with abundant melanin granules, dermis with numerous arteriovenous anastomoses and a great amount of elastic fibres). In aquatic mammals, parakeratosis would decrease cellular replacement, the great amount of melanin is related to the high exposure to solar radiation, the presence of arteriovenous anastomoses is related to thermoregulatory mechanisms, and the presence of elastic fibres is due to variations of thickness in the adipose tissue that requires high elasticity of the dermis.",

Here, 32 geographic populations were sampled from China, and morphometrics and multiple statistical analyses were applied to detect the population clustering and relationship between the morphology and bioclimatic factors. The results suggested that T. japonica with females are significantly bigger than males in the eight morphological traits. The 32 populations do not obviously cluster according to the natural geographic area. The body sizes of females are mainly related to the lowest temperature and precipitation; by contrast, males only have a significant relationship with the lowest temperature. The forewing size is significantly related to the maximum precipitation. Furthermore, the Mantel test showed that the morphological size variation of females has a weak positive correlation to geographic distance, but is insignificant in males. It was concluded that Chinese geographic populations of T. japonica mixed and that the size of the morphological structure is limited by bioclimatic factors.",

After the late gastrula stage, the archenteron separates from the ectoderm to form an archenteral sac, which develops into a dumbbell shape consisting of anterior and posterior lobes, and a middle part connecting both lobes. The anterior and posterior lobes, and the middle part, become separated into an axo‐hydrocoel, the left and right somatocoels and an enteric sac, respectively. The hydrocoel forms from the left lower edge of the axo‐hydrocoel and becomes separated from the axocoel by the late dipleurula stage, when chambered organs and coelom X bud off from the anterior tip of the right and left somatocoels, respectively. Coelom X does not occur in comatulid crinoids (feather stars), and its fate is unclear. The pore canal extends from the axocoel. The hydrocoel differentiates into a crescent shape at the overtime semidoliolaria stage, a few days after the semidoliolaria becomes competent to settle. Coelomogenesis in M. rotundus is much simpler than in the comatulids and probably represents the ancestral mode of the crinoids. As each portion of the dumbbell sac differentiates almost in situ into each coelom, presumptive fates in the sac are easily followed in M. rotundus .",

Often such structures are difficult to examine due to their small sizes which makes a more complete understanding of their functional morphology difficult. Here we present a new report and a first time high‐resolution, non‐SEM documentation of a parasitic epicaridean isopod, a female of the dajiid Arthrophryxus sp. from the Sea of Okhotsk. It was found during the SokhoBio 2015 on its host, a mysid shrimp ( Holmsiella sp.). Arthrophryxus has only one formally described species, Arthrophryxus beringanus Richardson, 1908. With high‐resolution documentation methods, we reveal new details of the morphological structures of mouthparts and thoracopods of this dajiid. Furthermore, we discuss the functional morphology of attachment to the host and feeding according to our new findings. We suggest that the thoracopods are involved in the attachment process even more than formerly assumed for different dajiids. The piercing‐sucking mouthparts and the additional attachment mechanisms strongly indicate a permanent parasitism of the dajiid isopod. Permanent parasites affect the fitness of their hosts; therefore, deep‐sea forms of dajiid isopods have direct impact on the deep‐sea crustacean communities.",

Cranial damages correlate with the newest films about modern African spotted hyenas which cut and decompose the head first of their antagonistic female same clan leader or other clans. The skulls and jaws have repeatedly similar bite damages, whereas, at birth/natal dens, their cranial remain abundance is highest. At communal dens, Pleistocene spotted hyena carcasses were similarly decomposed—first head off antagonistic clan leading females, and further similar strategy decomposing of the legs. Large postcranial C. c. spelaea bones have three identical bone destruction stages. These damage stages are similar to those found at hyena guilt including competing carnivores such as cave bears, steppe lions, but also herbivores like horses, and even a few smaller‐sized Neanderthal long bones.",

With 8 adult males, 8 females, and 7 pregnant males collected during the breeding season from the Baltic sea as our samples, our research was conducted using light and electron (TEM, SEM) microscopes and immunohistochemistry methods to distinguish the olfactory sensory neurons. The interior of the olfactory chamber lacked an olfactory rosette. Instead, olfactory receptor epithelium covered the inner walls of the olfactory chamber and, to varying degrees, the inside of the anterior and posterior nostrils. All types of olfactory sensory neurons (ciliated, microvillus, and crypt) were present within the olfactory sensory epithelium, although the crypt sensory neurons were limited to the pregnant and non‐pregnant males). The olfactory sensory neurons were present in the areas where the density of the non‐sensory epithelium cells was reduced. No significant differences in morphology of the olfactory organ between sexes were found. Nevertheless, only in males crypt sensory neurons were presented in olfactory epithelium, which indicates that sense of smell could play a little role during mating.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Clupeiformes (generally known as herrings, shads and sardines) with a synapomorphy of recessus lateralis are globally distributed marine, freshwater and diadromous species classified in seven families including the family Clupeidae. In this study, a comparative analysis of the vertebral column and caudal skeleton of twelve clupeid species was conducted on the basis of X‐ray imaging and usual staining method of bones and cartilages. Several osteological features including number of principal branched caudal rays bearing with hypurals on both lobes of the caudal‐fin; number, length, arrangement and shape of epural bones; shape and length of haemal and neural spines of the penultimate vertebrae 2, 3 and 4; length and shape of parhypural; length and shape of neural arch of the urostyle; distribution of the dorsal and procurrent rays, and fusion of parhypural with preural centrum 1 (PU1) were investigated and a detailed account of these structures were provided. The results reveal that the neural spine of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th penultimate vertebrae (NSPU2, NSPU3 and NSPU4) was generally narrow and broad in lower and pointed at upper part with some variation in the size and position related to the dorsal edge of the body in different taxa. The neural arch of the urostyle (Na) has been observed as spindle, lance‐like or knife‐like. It is usually long (≥1/2 length of the NSPU2) with some modification in the studied species. Two or three curved, straight, cone‐shape or pin‐shaped epurals were found in all species with the same number in congeneric species. Opisthural cartilage (O) lays between HYP6 and PLS anteriorly, located at the tip of PLS or traversed horizontally. The presence of this cartilage made a gap between first (longest) and second unbranched caudal rays in upper part of caudal‐fin. It showed six varied shapes (e.g. fusiform, golf club‐like, horn shape, trapezoid shape, crescent and triangle) with different size in comparison with HYP6. This comparative study revealed that some osteological characters such as shape and position of opisthural cartilage, shape of neural arch of the urostyle, and number of epurals could be used as suitable features for the identification of the studied clupeids at the species and genus levels. The improved knowledge of the skeletal structures provided here, can also facilitate the correct identification of clupeid fossils.",

Wide interspecific variation in eye size between the taxa is recorded with those of G. bimaculata being the largest, G. nummaria the smallest and G. pilosa and G. glycymeris of intermediate and similar dimensions. Such differences result primarily from interspecific variations in the numbers and sizes of the ommatidium‐like rhabdomes. The consequences of this will be the differences in abilities to create a summed image and thereby reduce visual acuity. Other bivalves, such as the Pectinoidea, have shown eye size differences in relation to depth. Glycymeris bimaculata , with the largest eyes, occupies the shallowest depths; G. nummaria bears the smallest eyes and occupies the deepest depths. The genetically sister clusters of G. pilosa and G. glycymeris occupy intermediate depths. Accurate depth records for the four taxa blur this hypothesised trend, but comparative eye dimensions suggest it to be valid.",

Due to lack of information on the morphology of M ysticetes, this study aimed to provide a morphological description of the adnexal structures of the humpback whale eye. Three newborn female specimens, stranded on the coast of S ergipe, B razil, were used. Samples were fixed in a 10% formalin solution, dissected and photographed, and all the structures were collected and analysed using different light microscopy techniques. Eyelids were characterized by a palpebral fissure, a palpebral opening, two grooves (dorsal and ventral) and the presence of mechanoreceptors in the dermis. Some fibres of the four recti muscles had palpebral, scleral and glandular insertions. The H arderian gland filled the area between the orbit wall and the eyeball. Two vascular networks separated the extraocular retractor muscle of the eye and surround the optic nerve. The morphology of the accessory structures of the humpback whale eye was similar to that of other cetaceans, which suggests an adaptation to diving during migration, contributing to the perception of temperature difference in different regions.",

Like all penguins it is flightless, instead using its specialized wings for underwater locomotion termed ‘aquatic flight’. While musculature and locomotion of the large Antarctic penguins have been well studied, smaller penguins show different biochemical and behavioural adaptations to their habitats. We used histochemical and immunohistochemical methods to characterize fibre type composition of the African penguin primary flight muscles, the pectoralis and supracoracoideus. We hypothesized the pectoralis would contain predominantly fast oxidative–glycolytic (FOG) fibres, with mainly aerobic subtypes. As the supracoracoideus and pectoralis both power thrust, we further hypothesized these muscles would have a similar fibre type complement. Our results supported these hypotheses, also showing an unexpected slow fibre population in the deep parts of pectoralis and supracoracoideus. The latissimus dorsi was also examined as it may contribute to thrust generation during aquatic flight, and in other avian species typically contains definitive fibre types. Unique among birds studied to date, the African penguin anterior latissimus dorsi was found to consist mainly of fast fibres. This study shows the African penguin has specialized flight musculature distinct from other birds, including large Antarctic penguins.",

The genus Ommatotriton is represented by two allopatric, genetically well‐defined species: Ommatotriton ophryticus and O. vittatus . Within each species, two subspecies have been recognised. The samples used in this study cover the geographical and genetic variation within each species. We found statistically significant variation in skull size between species and among populations within species. When corrected for size, there was no significant variation in shape between species. Our results indicate that the variation in skull shape within the genus Ommatotriton is almost entirely due to size‐dependent, allometric shape changes. The exception is the shape of the ventral skull in males. Males of O. ophryticus and O. vittatus significantly diverge in the shape of the ventral cranium. The ventral skull, more precisely the upper jaw and palate, is directly functionally related to feeding. In general, our results indicate that allometry is a significant factor in the morphological variation of banded newts. However, the divergence in the ventral skull shape of males indicates that sexual selection and niche partitioning may have influenced the evolution of skull shape in these newts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Morphology and ultrastructure of skin photogenic organs in the deep‐sea squid Histioteuthis bonnellii from the Strait of Messina (Mediterranean Sea) was investigated. The photophore is formed by a glandular complex, made up of photogenic cells involved in the light production process, and a set of annexes (filter, reflector, pigmented layer and gelatinous body), with suggested dioptric function. The photocytes have an elongated shape, often arranged in an approximately radial series within the chamber, and show eccentric rounded euchromatic nucleus. The filter shows a membranous tissue made up of rows of cells, rich in smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The analysis on reflector's cells highlighted the presence of several iridosomal platelets in the cytoplasm, having irregular and sinuous shape. The pigmented layer and the gelatinous body provide protection to the organ and may have dioptric functions too. The photogenic organs were found to be innervated by nerves, and it was possible to confirm the strictly glandular nature of the photophores of this species. The detailed anatomical descriptions of the photophores of H. bonnellii extend our current knowledge and provide a scientific basis for future studies aimed to relate the evolution of photogenic system to the ecology of this squid.",

In the Cirripedia Thoracica, nauplii of the Lepadomorpha and Scalpellomorpha/Sessilia are shown to differ in their patterns of antennular setal addition and division into articles, and one or two possible apomorphies for each group are identified. Several variations of the scalpellomorphan/sessilian pattern are outlined. These data on the Ascothoracida, Facetotecta, and Cirripedia provide the basis for modifying an earlier proposal of structural homologies among the naupliar antennules of thecostracan maxillopodans. ‘Virtual’ articles (ones that are never completely free) are invoked to account for setae that ‘jump’ across article boundaries at molts and for supposedly homologous setae found on adjacent articles in different taxa. The identities of the preaxial setae in the Cirripedia are ambiguous and force consideration of two models for that group and for the thecostracan antennular Bauplan ; the latter may have included up to 11 or 12 articles, more than the previously supposed 8 or 9. The scoring of characters used in an earlier cladistic study of thecostracan and other maxillopodan taxa is not seriously affected. A comparison with the Cambrian maxillopodan Bredocaris suggests that division of the antennule into discrete articles in extant thecostracans is an apomorphic state and that yet one more apical article once existed in the maxillopodan antennule.",

The brachial articulation is provided with a long tendon at the aboral side; the entire articulation surface, including the areas where ligaments attach is built up by labyrinthic stereom. The calycinal ossicle lacks any internal vestiges of a pentameric composition; vertical planes with changing stereom direction lie irrespectively of radial or interradial planes. Gut, ovary and testis are histologically inconspicuous, and the location of the gonads inside the calyx is quite unusual. Both sexes develop outer gonoducts which probably are functionally adapted madreporic canals. The coelomic system differs from that of other crinoids in that a chambered organ is completely lacking. Simultaneously, the aboral nervous subsystem has no aboral nerve centre and simply terminates aborally in the ring‐shaped commissure. A glandular axial organ is absent, as are typical sacculi. The data are in accordance with two proposals made previously for Holopus rangii , viz., that the animals can feed raptorially, and that cyrtocrinids probably have evolved by loss of aboral calycinal ossicles of ancestors. In part, our observations differ from those in Cyathidium foresti , so we have chosen to use the species name meteorensis which has been considered a synonym of foresti .",

Scanning electron microscopy shows that each female cypridinid genital limb has a medial depression and associated pore (= spermatophore pore); over all of which a male cements a spermatophore. The limb terminates laterally in a superficially smooth rounded knob bearing an additional small opening (= lateral pore). Dorsolateral to this genital limb there are grouped setae, previously called “brush organs”, that are really paired, slit–like posterolateral openings, which are probably subdermally united to the female genital limbs. The “brush organs” of all myodocopid females also are likely to be the setose openings. The setose openings are probably homologous to the setose central lobe of male cypridinid copulatory limbs, but not homologous to the limb–like “brush organ” described for some podocopid males. We speculate that the eggs are fertilized via the spermatophore pore associated with the attached spermatophore, and that they are released from the slightly larger and more lateral setose openings into the brood chamber of the posterodorsal area of the bivalved carapace.",

Periostracal units of up to 900 nm length are merged into the outer fibrous layer and binding of gold‐labelled lectin‐WGA indicates the presence of chitin because it is labile to chitinase treatment. The periostracum is formed by the epithelia of the groove and the belt at the mantle edge. The distal and basal epithelium of the groove consists mainly of type A cells with an extended Golgi apparatus and apical vesicles. The presence of peroxidase and phenol oxidase indicates a function in tanning of the periostracum. In the proximal epithelium of the groove, type B cells with protruding apices add more material for periostracum formation. Type C cells secrete single periostracal units which are formed within single vesicles or larger vacuoles. Type D cells secrete electron‐dense vesicles which also contain WGA‐positive material. The distal cells of the belt are characterized by predominating strands of the rER while subapical vacuoles, to some of which WGA binds, dominate in the cells of the central part. In the belt, phenol oxidase and peroxidase can be localized in cisternae of the rER and the Golgi apparatus. Numerous control incubations indicate that, indeed, two different enzymes are localized.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The New Zealand ascidian Pyura pachydermatina has a 7–10 cm long body at the end of a stalk up to 1 m long and 1–2 cm in diameter. Two different spicule types are present: dumbbell‐shaped spicules of calcite in the fibrous tunic that covers the body and stalk, and antler‐shaped spicules of amorphous calcium carbonate in the soft body tissues. Both types form extracellularly within a closed compartment surrounded by an epithelium of sclerocytes. In adults the tunic spicules form in 2–3 weeks in the lumen of the tunic blood vessels, as determined by calcein uptake studies. They add mineral only while surrounded by the sclerocyte epithelium, which is anchored to the vessel wall. Ultimately the sclerocytes rupture at one or more leading points on the spicule. The blood vessel epithelium also becomes very thin at these points and either ruptures or the cells separate. allowing the spicules to migrate out into the tunic. The sclerocytes degenerate and the blood vessel closes behind the migrating spicule, thus maintaining the vessel's integrity. Tunic spicules accumulate in the subcuticular region of the stalk, but the outermost layer of tunic covering the body is periodically sloughed off along with some spicules. This gives the “neck” between body and stalk a flexibility that allows it to orient to currents, and prevents an accumulation of epizoic organisms on the body. The antler spicules form within blood sinuses of the body tissues. The mineral and organic material are arranged in concentric layers. In the branchial sac, oral tentacles, gut and endostyle, where antler spicules occur most densely, the branches interlock, providing support to the soft tissues. They are of many sizes and apparently remain where they form, increasing in number and size throughout the animal's lifespan.",

The coelomic spaces in the tentacles are lined by cross‐striated myoepithelial cells, allowing rapid movements of the tentacles. One, possibly two, blood vessels accompany the coelomic canal. On their outer sides the arms are covered by a simple ciliated epithelium with intra‐epithelial nerve fibres; the inner side is covered by vacuolar cells. On both sides different types of exocrine cells occur. The collar canals of the mesocoel are of complicated structure. Ventrally their epithelium is pseudostratified and ciliated; dorsally it is lower and forms a fold with specialized cross‐striated myoepithelial cells of the coelomic lining. Arms, tentacles, associated coelomic spaces and the collar canal of the mesocoel are considered to be functionally interrelated. It is assumed that rapid regulation of the pore width is possible and even necessary when the tentacular apparatus is retracted, which presumably leads to an increase of hydrostatic pressure in the coelom.",

Avian egg turning allegedly facilitates embryonic development by stimulating growth of the area vasculosa and minimizing the effects of unstirred yolk and albumen layers. From day 10 to day 45 of incubation, alligator eggs were experimentally turned, gently, through ± 60° in an hourly cycle. This turning regime killed only 6 out of 25 embryos. Compared with unturned controls, no significant effects were observed on the growth, production of extraembryonic fluids or utilization of albumen and yolk for those embryos that survived turning. The protein concentration of amniotic fluid at various stages of alligator development was examined in eggs incubated at 30 and 33°C. The fluid contained very little protein (max &lt;8 mg) at any time: the protein concentration did not change consistently as development progressed. Differences in response to egg turning in birds and reptiles may be associated with the length of the incubation period, the protein content of the albumen and the mechanism of albumen utilization.",

These rounded fibrous cords, placed one behind the other, are called ligamentum intracraniale transversum and ligamentum intracraniale obliquum. The former spans the orbitotemporal division of the cranial cavity and passes through the velum transversum. The latter, which is paired, extends from the roof to the sidewall of the endocranium and runs in the rhombomesencephalic sulcus in company with the trochlear nerve. It is argued that these intracranial ligments, like the spinal denticulate ligaments, are derivatives of a pair of fibrous bands which in early craniate phylogeny extended throughout the length of the neuraxial meninx and enhanced its tensile strength. It is also argued that at least the transverse intracranial ligament was already in existence some 350 million years ago.",

The bipinnaria has paired concentrations of Multipolar with Apical Processes (MAP) cells in this region that correspond in position with previously identified clusters of serotonergic and peptidergic neurones. MAP cells located in the centre of the band have well‐developed apical processes, but no cilium. Those at the sides of the band have fewer processes, but some have recumbent cilia that extend under the glycocalyx, suggesting a sensory function. Comparable cell types are not found elsewhere in the band, a clear indication that the apical parts of the ciliary band system are organized in a distinctive fashion. Two neuronal cell types were identified in the apical region of the auricularia larva, a conventional bipolar neurone that corresponds with previously described serotonergic apical cells, and more numerous MAP cells for which there is no previous record and hence, no known transmitter. Previous immunocytochemical studies are summarized and re‐examined in the light of these results. Relevant evolutionary issues are also discussed, but the data fail to provide strong evidence either for or against Garstang’s hypothesis that the chordate brain and spinal cord derive from larval ciliary bands resembling those of modern echinoderms.",

These cellular compartments are separated from each other by abundant ECM, which consists primarily of an electron‐lucent amorphous ground substance. Filaments are scarce in all ECM except the tegumental basement lamella. This is the first report of parenchyma and ECM fine structure in the Proteocephalidea.

Some characters, particularly number, thickness and arrangement of notopodial spines, were extremely variable among specimens. Three morphological forms were distinguished based on the general appearance of the bundles of spines; one form possesses at least one bundle of stout spines, whereas bundles of medium spines or thinner acicular spines characterise the other forms. Differences in prostomial shape, as well as in the extension and form of the caruncle, were artefacts (preservation or angle of observation). The present study supports D. rogeri as a junior synonym of D. armata. D. armata was regularly found on shells inhabited by hermit crabs ( Calcinus tubularis , Clibanarius erythropus ) and on damaged, empty shells.

    "abstract": "Abstract Ultrastructural analysis has revealed that metanephridia in Dero digitata arise from three nephroblast cells in the frontal epithelium of a septum suggesting its mesodermal origin. Each cell has a fixed developmental destination, one nephroblast cell produces the entire canal part and two cells give rise to the nephrostome. The nephroblast cell nearest to the body wall enlarges and proliferates a first set of canal cells, then one of the two proximally adjacent nephroblast cells differentiates into the envelope of the nephrostome generating the marginal cilia of the opening (mantle cell) and the second one transforms into the anteriormost cell of the funnel, producing a flame of cilia that beats into the canal lumen (flame cell). Thereafter, new canal cells appear, mainly by mitosis of the first cell, enlarging the body of the nephridium whose further differentiation was not analysed. Comparison with other clitellate species suggests a mantle cell (or some marginal cells) and a flame cell (or a central cell) to be special characters of the metanephridium in the stem species of the Clitellata and that, compared to many polychaete species, its early development assumes a special course by a precocious determination and arrangement of nephroblast cells, which, in both groups, probably originate from an identical mesodermal stem cell. Results further indicate that the nonclitellate Aeolosomatidae, by virtue of corresponding nephrostomata, are possibly closer related to the Clitellata.",

Most of our present knowledge of the efferent duct system of the female is based on palaeacanthocephalan and archiacanthocephalan representatives. In order to provide a basis for further elucidating the phylogenetic relationships within the Acanthocephala, we herein describe ultrastructure and overall organization of the ligament sac and efferent duct system in females of Paratenuisentis ambiguus (Eoacanthocephala, Neoechinorhynchida). Only one ligament sac was found. The uterine bell consists of two contractile binucleate syncytia (bell wall syncytium, lateral pocket syncytium), two pairs of contractile cells (lappet cells, uterine bell retractors) and three pairs of noncontractile cells (median cells). The contractile uterus bears four nuclei. The vagina is composed of a syncytial epithelium (four nuclei) and two binucleate sphincters. A comparison of the present findings with literature data leads to the following conclusions: except for the uterine bell retractors, the uterine bell components found in P. ambiguus can be assumed to be autapomorphies for the Acanthocephala. The sheathing syncytium and median dorsal cell belong to the basal pattern ( sensu ground pattern) of a palaeacanthocephalan subclade termed the Echinorhynchus ‐group in the present study. The median oviduct syncytium and paired uterine bell retractors can be assumed to be basal pattern characteristics of the Archiacanthocephala and Neoechinorhynchida, respectively. The study includes a tabular survey of terminological synonyms used in the literature.",

Although potential behavioural correlates of VNO function have been shown in two of the three elephant species, its morphology in Loxodonta africana has not been studied. The development of the VNO and its associated structures in the African elephant are described in detail using serially sectioned material from fetal stages. The results show that many components of the VNO complex (e.g. neuroepithelium, receptor‐free epithelium, vomeronasal nerve, paravomeronasal ganglia, blood vessels, vomeronasal cartilage) are well developed even in a 154‐day‐old fetus, in which the VNO opens directly into the oral cavity with only a minute duct present. However, the vomeronasal glands and their ducts associated with the VNO were developed only in the 210‐day‐old fetus. Notably, in this fetus, the vomeronasal–nasopalatine duct system had acquired a pathway similar to that described in the adult Asian elephant; the VNOs open into the oral cavity via the large palatal parts of the nasopalatine ducts, which are lined by a stratified squamous epithelium. The paired palatal ducts initially coursed anteriorly at an angle of 45° from the oral recess and/or the oral cavity mucosa, and merged into the vomeronasal duct. This study confirms the unique characteristics of the elephant VNO, such as its large size, the folded epithelium of the VNO tube, and the dorsomedial position of the neuroepithelium. The palatal position and exclusive communication of the VNO with the oral cavity, as well as the partial reduction of the nasopalatine duct, might be related to the unique elephantid craniofacial morphogenesis, especially the enormous growth of the tusk region, and can be seen as autapomorphies.",

It is suggested that this region of fat is just one of many sites of lipid storage that have been developed to provide energy reserves for the lengthy non-trophic periods found during the life cycle of lampreys. The incorporation of this fat within an extension of the nerve cord sheath suggests that it could act as a protective dorsal cushion for the nerve cord, which would otherwise be more exposed due to the absence of complete vertebral arches. The development of the fat column as the principal blood cell forming structure in the adult can apparently be related to certain changes that take place during metamorphosis, particularly in the circulatory system.",

(Zoology Department, University College, Swansea, U.K.) — Acta zool. (Stockh.) 61(3): 147–155. The ovariole sheath of the viviparous parthenogenetic aphid Brevicoryne brassicae has been the subject of an ultrastructural examination, particularly with regard to its relationship with embryos at various stages of ontogeny. The sheath is a unilaminar, squamous epithelial layer enclosing germarium and embryos, but does not have an intrinsic trophic role until the connection between the embryo and germarial trophocytes, in the form of the trophic cord, is lost. At this time there is a degree of thickening and an increase in the number of cell organelles with ultrastructural indications of metabolic activity, a situation paralleled in the embryonic serosa. There is also evidence that haemolymph components may have direct access to the embryos through intercellular spaces in the sheath. Intercellular junctions, microtubules and cell overlap in regions of the sheath adjacent to embryos at a more advanced state of development are all implicated in a mechanism which resists deformation, maintains sheath integrity and allows embryo passage. A tunica propria and microfilament bundles are absent in the ovariole sheath of this species.",

Later this disperses and no chromatin condensation takes place. There is a steady reduction in the nucleus size. This is correlated with increase in the number of small vesicles and microtubules in the cytoplasm. Eventually the nucleus becomes very small, and is surrounded by a complex system of microtubules. Following spermiogenesis process the mitochondria lose their cristae and contain adielectronic material. The mature sperm is spindle-shaped, tapering at both ends. In both ends there are only microtubules present terminating freely in the cytoplasm. In its middle there are a number of rod-shaped mitochondria containing an electron dense material. The microtubules in the middle part of the sperm are arranged in a hexagonal pattern and in others in rows interspersed with single ones. The structure of Pycnogonum littorale sperm is highly modified, which may explain the special mode of fertilisation.",

A differentiation of new tubules also occurs. This effect is less intense after hypophysectomy and greater in FW. A dose of 10 μg/g body weight/day for 10 days in SW produces some harmful renal effects, barely detected at 6 μg/g/day. The kidney plays a minor role in osmotic adjustment in SW when PRL secretion is reduced (intact eels) or suppressed (hypophysectomized); PRL treatment reverses effects of SW adaptation. An inhibition of gill sodium extrusion may explain the high blood sodium level; however, kidney histological changes suggest a renal participation, perhaps through reduced water permeability as in Platichthys.",

Every worker is a potential gamergate, thus we expect pronounced conflicts over sexual reproduction within their colonies. In the queenless ant genus Diacamma , gamergates inhibit nest mates from mating by aggressively removing (‘mutilating’) a pair of small appendages on the thorax, termed gemmae, shortly after eclosion. Dissection and serial sectioning of the reproductive tracts of both mutilated and unmutilated individuals of Diacamma sp. from Japan at different ages revealed that mutilation inhibits the development of the bursa copulatrix and the spermatheca, two structures fundamental for sexual reproduction. The precursor of the bursa copulatrix develops into a fully functional structure in unmutilated individuals, whereas it degenerates irreversibly in mutilated callows. Experimental manipulations showed that the removal of the gemmae is not the sole factor regulating this development. The spermathecal epithelium and accessory spermathecal gland of unmutilated individuals are thicker than that of mutilated individuals, indicating a higher degree of activity in the former. Mutilated females are therefore left incapable of copulating and less competent for long‐time sperm storage.",

The cells produce three types of secretory material. One not bound to vesicles in form of a finely granulated substance, a second one in spherical, uniformely electron-dense elementary vesicles with a diameter of 100–140 nm, and a third one in vesicles of the monoamine type. In the most caudal part of the spinal cord glial secretion is present. Groups of glial cells produce a fine, granulated material and release it into the adjacent intercellular space. From there the material extends into other intercellular spaces of the spinal cord.

The spermatozoon of the Old Endemic Australo‐Papuan and Philippine rodents – its morphological diversity and evolution.— Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 279–294 The spermatozoon of most murine rodents contains a head in which there is a characteristic apical hook, whereas most old endemic Australian murines, which are part of a broader group of species that also occur in New Guinea and the Philippines, have a far more complex sperm form with two additional ventral processes. Here we ask the question: what is the sperm morphology of the New Guinea and Philippines species and what are the trends in evolutionary changes of sperm form within this group? The results show that, within New Guinea, most species have a highly complex sperm morphology like the Australian rodents, but within the Pogonomys Division some species have a simpler sperm morphology with no ventral processes. Amongst the Philippines species, many have a sperm head with a single apical hook, but in three Apomys species the sperm head contains two additional small ventral processes, with two others having cockle‐shaped sperm heads. When these findings are plotted on a molecular phylogeny, the results suggest that independent and convergent evolution of highly complex sperm heads containing two ventral processes has evolved in several separate lineages. These accessory structures may support the sperm head apical hook during egg coat penetration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract When testicular growth is induced in photosensitive white‐crowned sparrows ( Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii ) by photoperiodic stimulation, there is an accompanying appearance of acetylcholinesterase‐containing cells in the pars distalis. Such cells do not appear in photorefractory birds subjected to long daily photoperiods; gonadal growth does not occur in these. To study further the function of these AChE‐containing cells, the activities of the thyroid gland, the adrenal cortex, and the gonads were inhibited or eliminated in photorefractory birds. No AChE cells appeared with the induction of increased TSH secretion with treatment of propylthiouracil and thiourea. Similarly adrenalectomy, treatment with metyrapone (2‐methyl‐1, 2‐di‐3‐pyridyl‐1‐propanone) as well as castration of photorefractory birds failed to cause the appearance of these cells. On the other hand, castration of photosensitive males and treatment with long days caused the development of AChE cells which, in comparison with the control, non‐castrated photostimulated males, were hyperplastic and hypertrophied. This supports our earlier suggestion that the AChE cells are gonadotropin producing cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The fine structure of the exoskeleton of Timanaspis kossovoii Obruchev 1962 was investigated based on new well‐preserved material. The remains come from the lower part of the Eptarma Formation (Upper Silurian). Timanaspis kossovoii was referred by Obruchev to the family Tremataspididae and most authors agree with the placement of Timanaspis among tremataspidid osteostracans. Histological study of the shield of T. kossovoii has revealed the presence of unusual features in the exoskeletal structure. The smooth and shiny surface of the ventral side of the shield of T. kossovoii is similar to that of species of Tremataspis , but thin sections show differences in histological composition. The exoskeleton of T. kossovoii consists mainly of dense bony tissue in the middle layer and a laminated basal layer. No osteocyte cavities of typical form and size were found in the middle layer. The upper parts of the elongated tubercles of the dorsal side of the shield are formed by a well‐developed dentine‐like tissue; the arrangement of numerous tubules within this tissue is far more regular than in the mesodentine of Tremataspis . No traces of perforated septa, pore fields or a polygonal model were detected in the structure of the exoskeleton of Timanaspis . We conclude that Timanaspis can be differentiated from conventional tremataspidids by histological features and refer it to the new family Timanaspididae. Moreover, the Timanaspis exoskeleton provides evidence that an acellular condition of bony tissue does not appear to be characteristic of only Late Devonian osteostracans.",

Adult male crabs in intermoult stage were collected from Mar Chiquita Lagoon (Buenos Aires, Argentina). Muscle fibers show evident striations and oval-elongated nuclei with loose chromatin. The loose connective tissue among muscle fibers consists of cells and fibers embedded in an amorphous substance. Muscle histochemistry reveals two slow fiber types: ‘A’ and ‘B’. Prevailing A fibers are larger, and they usually show, with respect to B type, a weaker reaction to whole techniques. Fibers with short (SS), intermediate (IS), and long sarcomeres (LS) appear in the claw closer muscle, being the LS fibers predominant. Concluding, the histochemical and morphometrical characteristics of the claw closer muscle fibers of N. granulata are indicative of slow fibers. The slow A type (low resistant to fatigue) prevails.",

The successive stages of oogenesis in Phoronopsis harmeri were examined by electron microscopy methods. During the oogenesis, each oocyte is encircled by vasoperitoneal (coelomic) cells forming a follicle. The previtellogenic oocytes are small cells which accumulate ribosomes for future synthesis; their cytoplasm contains characteristic clusters of mitochondria and osmiophilic particles resembling a germ plasm of other metazoans. The cytoplasm of the vitellogenic oocytes includes numerous mitochondria, cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies and annulate lamellae. The synthesis of three types of inclusions was observed: strongly osmiophilic granules (lipid droplets) as a prevalent component, distinctly larger granules surrounded by membrane (proteinaceous yolk) and numerous large vesicles with pale flocculent content. No inclusions which could be unequivocally interpreted as the cortical granules were detected. The surface of the vitellogenic oocytes is covered by microvilli which increase in number and length during development. The oogenesis in Phoronida may be interpreted as follicular because of close association of oocytes with the vasoperitoneal tissue. However, well-developed synthetic apparatus together with a strongly developed microvillous surface and absence of endocytosis indicate a clear case of autosynthetic vitellogenesis. Thus, in phoronids, there is a combination of simply developed follicle and autosynthesis that, apparently, is plesiomorphic character.",

Abstract The esophagus of Rinella icterica was analyzed by employing histochemical methods and lectin histochemistry at light microscopy as well as by transmission electron microscopy. The mucosa was composed of a ciliated columnar pseudostratified epithelium with goblet cells, overlying a lamina propria. The goblet cells contained neutral and acid glycoconjugates and were positive for galactose residues. Moreover, two types of goblet cells were identified; one type was positive for mannose, and the other was negative. Serotonin‐immunoreactive cells (5HT‐IR) occurred randomly scattered at the base of the epithelium; they were also localized between the mucous cells of the gland. Both submucosa and adventitia were composed of loose connective tissue, and the muscularis was formed by smooth muscle. Although the basic morphology of the esophagus of R. icterica is similar to that of mammals, the esophagus showed some morphological differences that are likely to be related to the specific physiology of the tissue.",

The testes are paired, compact, non-follicular and lie dorsally and dorso-laterally to the paired ovaries, partially enfolding them. All stages of spermatogenesis, including spermiogenesis, are described at the ultrastructural level and their spatial organization within the testes is discussed. The cells at the early stages of spermatogenesis (spermatogonia and spermatocytes) are located on the dorsal and dorso-lateral sides of the testes, while the late stages (spermatids and filiform spermatozoa with 9+2 axonemes) lie at the ventral and inner periphery of the testes, adjacent to ovaries. All the cell types can be found both at the anterior and the posterior end of the testes. The value of the structure of the testes as a phylogenetic marker is addressed.",

Dramatically different from this are the sperm of the Greater Bandicoot Rat, Bandicota indica . Here, we ask the question has the structure of the sperm head co‐evolved with that of the egg coat, the zona pellucida? For this, we first summarise the morphological features of the spermatozoon of B. indica that may relate to zona pellucida penetration at the time of fertilisation, and we confirm that the sperm head is generally round, not bilaterally flattened, in profile and has a huge acrosome. We then show that the zona pellucida around oocytes in tertiary follicles also differs from that of the other murine rodents in being only about 4 μm thick and, as demonstrated by lectin staining, has an unusual abundance of alpha‐L‐fucose. These findings indicate that both the male and female gametes of this South‐East Asian murine rodent are highly divergent in their structural organisation. One of the functional implications of this probably relates to sperm–zona interactions and the release of acrosomal enzymes that probably facilitate penetration by digestion of the zona matrix at the time of fertilisation.",

Using W estern blot, light and ultrastructural immunolocalization, we have analyzed the distribution of two specific beta‐proteins (formerly beta‐keratins) in the epidermis of snakes. The study indicates that the antibody HgG5, recognizing glycine‐rich beta‐proteins of 12–15 kD a, is poorly or not reactive with the beta‐layer of snake epidermis. This suggests that glycine‐rich proteins similar to those present in lizards are altered during maturation of the beta‐layer. Conversely, a glycine–cysteine‐medium‐rich beta‐protein (HgGC10) of 10–12 kD a is present in beta‐ and alpha‐layers, but it is reduced or disappears in precorneous and suprabasal cells destined to give rise to beta‐ and alpha‐cells. Together with the previous studies on reptilian epidermis, the present results suggest that beta‐proteins rich in glycine mainly accumulate on a scaffold of alpha‐keratin producing a resistant and hydrophobic beta‐layer. Conversely, beta‐proteins lower in glycine but higher in cysteine accumulate on alpha‐keratin filaments present in beta‐ and alpha‐layers producing resistant but more pliable layers.",

Ultrastructural and immunocytochemical features of the epidermis of the lizard Heloderma suspectum indicate richness in lipids and lack of a specialized shedding complex. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00 : 1–9. Abstract The epidermis of the venomous lizard Heloderma suspectum has been studied for detecting generalized and desert adaptations. A thick and non‐completely syncytial beta‐keratin layer is followed by 60–90 layers of mesos‐cells. Non‐lamellated or sparse lamellated lipid material is seen among mesos‐cells where lipids form the main barrier against water loss. The alpha‐layer is made of interlocking cells with irregular perimeter that are connected through desmosomal remnants. Immunocytochemistry shows that beta‐keratin is present in beta‐cells, disappears in mesos‐cells but is diffuse in alpha‐cells. Alpha‐keratin is seen in mesos‐cells but lowers in alpha‐cells where alpha‐keratin probably mixes with beta‐keratin. Although the sequence of layers formed during the renewal stage of the epidermis was not available, a specialized shedding layer with an outer oberhautchen faced to an inner clear layer appears absent in this species. This condition suggests that shedding occurs at the boundary between the outer (old) alpha‐layer and the inner (new) beta‐layer formed underneath the alpha‐layer. The thick mesos layer is likely an efficient adaptation to limit water loss in desert conditions while the poorly specialized shedding complex may suggest a primitive stage in the evolution of the shedding layer in this lizard or a special adaptation to water shortage.",

In this work, we describe the morphometric characteristics, as well as the mRNA and protein expression levels of two myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs)– myod /MyoD and myogenin /Myogenin–in the white and red muscle types of tambaqui. A high proportion of white and red muscle fibers with large diameters suggest a hypertrophic growth process in the skeletal muscle during juvenile stages. Comparisons between muscle types showed that, in red muscle, myogenin transcript levels were significantly higher than those of myod . In contrast, MyoD protein levels were significantly higher than those of Myogenin in red muscle. These results suggest that in red and white muscles of juvenile tambaqui, independent post‐transcriptional mechanisms for regulating MyoD and Myogenin expression may exist, which could be differentially activated during muscle growth. Furthermore, these data also suggest that specific control mechanisms may regulate distinct muscle phenotypes.",

The paraglossalia lie within the tongue parenchyma and consist of paired, flat, caudo‐laterally directed cartilages joined rostrally. The basiurohyale forms a single dorso‐ventrally flattened unit composed of an octagonal‐shaped body from which extend rostral (the rostral process) and caudal (the urohyale) projections. The laryngeal skeleton consists of cricoid, procricoid and paired arytenoid cartilages. The large ring‐shaped cricoid cartilage displays a body and paired wings which articulate with each other and with the procricoid. The blunt, ossified, rostral projection of the cricoid and the scalloped nature of the arytenoid cartilages are unique to the ostrich. The procricoid is a single structure which links the paired arytenoids and wings of the cricoid. The hyobranchial apparatus is firmly attached to the tongue parenchyma and to the larynx and proximal trachea. In contrast to previous reports in this species, the horns of the hyobranchial apparatus are not related to the skull. Ossification of the body of the basihyale, the ceratobranchials and the rostral process and body of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx lends stability to these structures.",

The epipodial tentacles are large extendable conically elongated structures whose surface is differentiated in two regions: the dorsal region with long corrugated folds, and a ventral region composed of three parts, a basal part with the same structure as the dorsal, a middle part with shorter corrugated folds and an apical part with large micropapillae. Although the thin sections and ultrastructure examination show that the epithelium of both organs is morphologically similar and composed of supporting cells, sensory cells and different types of secretory cells, there is a certain specialization in their secretory product. Although the epithelium of both structures was positive for acidic glycoconjugates, the tentacle epithelium was also positive for neutral sugars. Further specific differences were revealed by lectin histochemistry. Because papillae and tentacles can be extended or retracted depending on environmental conditions, they probably have tactile and olfactory functions.",

In this study, we used scanning electron microscopy to examine the ovipositors of nine species representing the families M anaosbiidae (five species) and N omoclastidae (four species). Similar to the ovipositor morphology of many gonyleptoidean families, the distal tips of the ovipositors of these harvestmen have four external lobes, with the margins most commonly adorned with 10 large peripheral setae. In manaosbiid and nomoclastid species, these peripheral setae have undivided bases, striated shafts and undivided distal tips. There are typically three setae on each anterior lobe and two setae on each posterior lobe. The medial setae on both anterior and posterior lobes insert into sockets that are slightly more dorsal. We observed small, surface denticles, usually associated with a pore, on the external surface of the lobes. There was interspecific and intraspecific variation in the number and shape of these surface denticles. The association of pores with denticles on the ovipositor appears to be a feature common to not only both families but is also a trait that has not been observed on ovipositors in other families of laniatorean harvestmen.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Scale and otolith morphology and morphometry of Indian oil sardine Sardinella longiceps (Clupeidae) were investigated and described using light and scanning electron microscopy from eight different body regions for scales and the right and left otoliths. Scales of the Indian oil sardine show general characteristics of the other studied clupeids sand that are easily distinguishable from other fish groups, by having striae in the posterior field. The studied cycloid scales of S . longiceps were classified into three types based on the overall shape including circular (e.g. true circular and cordate), pentagonal and quadrilateral in the different body regions. The circular shape was the most common shape (87.5%), while the quadrilateral and pentagonal forms constituted 6.25% each. The results also showed that the relative scale size (J‐index) plays a desirable contribution in separating the examined populations. The results showed that the mean (or relative) scale size for all the eight regions in the Oman Sea population is larger than the Arabian Sea population. Also, another scale variable, the scale shape index (Si index), demonstrated variation (a mean of 0.86 to 1.1) in different regions of both populations from the Oman and Arabian Seas. Interestingly, here, we found that scale characters of S . longiceps not only differ from its other congeneric species, but also differ in the populations from both sides of the Oman Sea (Iran and Oman) and the Arabian Sea. It shows a positive signal for the presence of different taxonomic and management unit in the Oman and Arabian Seas. The idea should be approved by using integrated molecular and morphological traits. The otolith morphology of S . longiceps from the Oman and Arabian Seas was more conservative than the scales, which can be due to its function actin primarily as a balance organ and also enhancing hearing. The overall shape of S . longiceps otolith was lanceolate, with an elongated morphology and a well‐developed rostrum, an ostial sulcus acusticus that opens to the anterior/ dorsal margin. These morphological characters are also found in the Iranian population of S . longiceps . However, otolith displayed variation in biometric parameters among two populations and left and right otoliths and the RRL parameter were important characters to discriminate the Oman and Arabian Sea populations. Thus, the structural/biometrical variability of the otoliths may be used for population distinctness, especially in water bodies with various environmental factors, and the otolith has turned out to be a useful tool to track the life history of teleostean fishes in environments with physicochemical gradients.",

We carried out a morphometric analysis to detect specific patterns and the potential occurrence of morphotypes in M. olfersii from different populations. Our data set included 52 females and 109 males collected in the Neotropical region, between the north and south limits of Brazilian territory, in coastal rivers from the states of Rio Grande do Norte, Bahia, Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná and Santa Catarina. Body measurements were size standardized by allometric methods and explored by the principal component analysis (PCA) and non‐hierarchical analysis of K‐means clustering and canonical variate analysis (CVA). Our results suggested three distinct morphological groups (morphotypes) only for males in M. olfersii . Furthermore, the confirmation of monophyly of the different populations of M. olfersii was accomplished by sequences of 16S rDNA. Additional studies about relative growth in other populations and the analysis of the entire ontogenetic development of males in the laboratory will be important to complement the knowledge about morphotypes in this species.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Extrinsic thoracic limb muscles are a muscular group that supports the thoracic limb in mammals without the clavicle and serve to move the scapula and shoulder joint. However, there are few evolutionary studies of these muscles in Felis catus , which should take into account the topology and innervation of the muscles to hypothesize the muscle derivation from a common ancestor. The main objective of this study was to check the extrinsic thoracic limb muscles in ten cadavers. Intra‐ and interspecific anatomical variants were found with that formerly described and other felids. Based on the topology and innervation found in this study, the evolutionary derivation was hypothesized. Therefore, the omotransversarius and rhomboideus muscles are derived from the serratus ventralis cervicis muscle. The cleidobrachialis muscle is derived mainly from the m. deltoideus and accessorily from the supracoracoid muscular group. The pectoantebrachialis and pectoralis abdominalis muscles are derived from the pectoralis descendens and cutaneus trunci muscles, respectively. In conclusion, most extrinsic thoracic limb muscles of F. catus may have evolutionary derivations from the last common ancestor of mammals, while some of them are from the last common ancestor of carnivorans or within the family Felidae.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present review formulates an evolutionary hypothesis on the distribution of regeneration in invertebrates and vertebrates. Regeneration is a basal ancestral property of animals living in aqueous environment where life was generated. The specific life cycles that evolved in each phylum indicate that only adult aquatic animals with asexual reproduction, larval stages and metamorphosis, possess broad regenerative abilities, protostomes or deuterostomes. Regeneration derives from the re‐utilization in different forms of numerous developmental gene pathways active during development and the transitional phases of larval metamorphosis. An injured adult animal, composed of differentiated tissues, cannot repeat the same sequence of gene activation of embryogenesis, resulting in a variable regeneration (most aquatic invertebrates and anamiotes). In contrast, species with a genome that is not programmed for producing larvae and intense metamorphosis, mainly terrestrial (numerous nematodes, arthropods and amniotes), cannot regenerate their organs after injury. It is hypothesized that during the evolution of terrestrial animals, they lost genes involved in regeneration so that they repair by wound healing associated with grow (regengrow) or by scarring. Future molecular knowledge on developmental pathways that evolved in regenerating competent animals will tell us whether or not organ regeneration in regenerative incompetent animals will be feasible.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The current biodiversity crisis warrants accurate measuring of biodiversity, often achieved by counting species or higher taxonomic units, with morphological or molecular methods. Alternatively, trait‐centred approaches categorise organisms into distinct ecological roles and then count the number of occupied roles to measure biodiversity. Even combinations of trait‐based and taxonomic approaches are utilised. However, when investigating the theoretical aspects, all these approaches have significant shortcomings, which complicate a reliable biodiversity measurement, that is, the ignorance of polymorphic species, the sensitivity to the initial classification or the knowledge gap concerning the ecology of the organisms. We outline a non‐discrete ecospace approach for which neither pronounced taxonomic expertise nor in‐depth knowledge about the ecology of the organisms is required. A morphospace based on quantitative morphological properties is used as a proxy for an ecospace, thus resulting in a continuous morpho‐ecospace. With this, decision‐making concerning taxonomy or ecology is reduced, as morphology is directly used instead of being first interpreted. Differences usually not considered due to polymorphism or ontogeny can be included in this approach, as well as fossils without species determination. This morpho‐ecospace approach is easily applicable and can be combined with already existing approaches, making it broadly applicable.",

There have been a number of hypotheses on the source of their pink coloration, including that the colour is from blood and a relative lack of dermal pigmentation. We obtained full thickness skin biopsies of three species and compared tissue from darkly pigmented areas and lightly pigmented surfaces. “Pink” areas of pink iguanas are devoid of pigment cells (e.g. melanophores) and the dermal tissue is rich with aggregates of confluent capillaries. This was in sharp contrast to the minimally vascular (only capillaries were observed) dermal areas of the marine and yellow iguanas. The dermal stratum laxum of every biopsy site contained melanophores except for the pink skin of pink iguanas. Interestingly, marine iguanas have a much thicker epidermal stratum germinativum/granulosum, between 2 and 10 cells thick depending on location, compared to the thinner epidermal stratum germinativum/granulosum of land iguanas (one to three cells thick with most areas possessing just one or two cell layers). These microscopic differences might reflect differences in habitat and ecology of the three species.",

A possible way to test the homology of these cortical microtubules in the different groups is to analyze the presence/absence of post‐translational modifications of tubulin. An indirect immunofluorescence study showed that the doublet microtubules of the sperm axonemes are labelled by an anti acetylated‐alpha‐tubulin antibody in all groups, irrespective of the axoneme pattern (9 + 0, 9 + 2 and non‐trepaxonematan 9 + “1” in various acoels, and trepaxonematan 9 + “1” of the temnocephalid Troglocaridicola sp., the digenean Echinostoma caproni and the monopisthocotylean monogenean Pseudodactylogyrus sp.). Significant differences are found in the sperm cortical microtubules: they are acetylated in the acoel Actinoposthia beklemischevi , but not in the digenean E. caproni and the temnocephalid Troglocaridicola sp. These results suggest that the sperm cortical microtubules of the acoels are not homologous with the morphologically similar elements found in the higher Platyhelminthes.",

The nerve cords exhibit only ectoneural components at the level of the statocysts. A sinus‐like epineural canal lies superjacent to each cord. This canal is lined by a robust monociliated neuroepithelium which lacks any special support cells. Beneath the neuroepithelium, the somata of the ectoneural neurons form a perikaryal layer whereas the axons are located within the proximal parts of the cords. Glial cells have not been found. Each statocyst is a hollow sense organ. Its central cavity is lined by a monolayer of monociliated parietal cells. Axons of these parietal cells extend towards the statocyst nerve which connects each statocyst with the ectoneural pathways of the cord. A single lithocyte floats within each central statocyst cavity. This unciliated cell contains a voluminous vacuole with the statolith and several smaller vacuoles. It is concluded that statocysts do not belong to the basic organization of the Holothuroidea but have been evolved within this group. The statement, that the statocysts of apodous sea cucumbers and that of the enigmatic Xenoturbella bocki are homologous organs, is rejected.",

Morphology of the bourgueticrinid and isocrinid aboral nervous system and its possible phylogenetic implications (Echinodermata, Crinoidea). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 80: 241‐249. On the basis of semithin serial sections the aboral nervous system within the calyx of five bourgueticrinid and one isocrinid species was reconstructed using the computer programm NIH Image. The aboral nervous system of all bourgueticrinids belongs to a common type which is proposed to be called ‘ Bathycrinus ‐type’ (B‐type), that differs from the ‘ Isocrinus ‐type’ (I‐type). The morphology of the B‐type and the I‐type are described and differences are discussed. Together with the B‐type there are now six aboral nervous system types well established and the consequences regarding phylogeny are discussed. Conclusions: 1) The morphology of the aboral nervous system may be a useful tool for the clarification of relationships between crinoid groups; 2) All known aboral nervous system types can be derived from the I‐type, which seems to be the most primitive one; 3) The B‐type aboral nervous system is probably a synapomorphic feature charac‐terizing a monophyletic group within the Bourgueticrinida.",

Mature and developing granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells occur in a reticular and/or fibroblastic supporting stroma inside the cartilaginous skeleton. Heterophils, which are the most abundant granulocytes in the cranial tissue, contain two distinct cytoplasmic granular populations, whereas eosinophils show one uniformly electron dense granule type. Heterophils and eosinophils may differentiate from a common precursor producing granules of each cell type in relation to the activity of rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. The presence of macrophages, lymphocytes and developing and mature plasma cells suggests an important role of the cranial lymphohaemopoietic tissue in eliciting the immune responses. A phylogenetical relationship between this tissue and the higher vertebrate bone marrow is proposed on the basis of histological similarities between the cell microenvironments governing haemopoietic differentiation in these organs.",

The present data are the first ultrastructural findings of the neuromuscular apparatus which supports rhythmic cirral contraction. A single large striated flexor muscle extending the length of the cirus contains mostly one type of myofibril (Type A) but is accompanied by a small band of more compact myofibrils (Type B). A well developed T‐tubular system with extensive sarcoplasmic cisternae and dyads is found, in addition to subsarcolemmal membranous whorls. A central neural complex innervates this muscle and electron‐lucent axons containing large membranous elements and small vesicles and surrounded by supporting cells with extensive rough endoplasmic reticula are present. Intimate association of nerve processes with the flexor muscle consists of neuromuscular junctions with synaptic‐type vesicles, and a well developed mode of sarcolemmal vesicular transport. These focally compacted vesicles communicate directly with the muscle tubular system. Rhythmic movement of cirri is probably controlled by alternating contraction of the flexor muscle followed by relaxation with pulsatile filling of the afferent hemocoel with blood.",

Moreover, oliogosaccharides with “identical” biochemically defined sugar compositions can be distinguished. The method allowed further characterization of complex glycoconjugates of dermal glands.

This study demonstrates the presence and describes the structure of attachment organs in three species of gymnotiforms: the apteronotids Apteronotus albifrons and A. leptorhynchus , and the rhamphichthyid Rhamphichthys sp. Attachment organs are present only during the first few days after hatching. Organs were studied with light microscopy, SEM, and TEM. In all three species attachment organs are restricted to the head region. They consist of numerous individual attachment cells and modified epithelial cells distributed on the frontal, lateral, and dorsal head area. Only the apical parts of the attachment cells reach the body surface between the epithelium of the epidermis. Attachment cells contain considerable amounts of rough ER and Golgi vesicles filled a the glutinous substance. Epithelial cells in the area in which attachment cells are developed differ in structure from those on the rest of the body and form a functional complex with the attachment cells. In the two Apteronotus species they possess 4–10 μm long projections that are located in the cell centre in A. albifrons , but are slightly shifted to one side of the cells in A. leptorhynchus . Epithelial cells in the organ area of Rhamphichthys sp. lack any projections and resemble cells of the trunk region. However, their pattern of microridges on the outer cell surface is more pronounced and conspicuous. Projections along with modified microridges may aid in distributing and focusing adhesive substances released by attachment cells, and thus may enhance adhesive properties.",

Structure and function of pilosebaceous units on the heads of small mammals (Insectivora, Chiroptera, Rodentia). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 81 : 195–203 The cranial integument of 32 species was examined for increased sebum production and structures serving sebum storage and expulsion by means of light and scanning electron microscopy. The head is rich in sebaceous glands in all species. Some have no further specializations other than regions with enlarged sebum production. These regions either need extra protection per se or they are situated where they can be used for fur grooming directly or be easily reached by the forepaws. The water shrew stores sebum that it can possibly apply as a water‐repellent lipid coating for the fur if required. All vespertilionid bats not only have huge glandular complexes with storage chambers, but also structures for the retaining and application of sebum. Stabilizing elements reflect the extent of external pressure on the specialized pilary canal during sebum discharge. Originally simple hair follicles evolved highly adapted pilosebaceous complexes that possibly produce scent themselves or at least a carrier substance for scent secreted by the many apocrine glands on the snout.",

The length and morphology of this organ vary even among zooids in the same colony. After curving between the paired posterior nerve trunks, the strand turns left and terminates in a dead end. The dorsal strand of this species is one of the simplest types among ascidians, since there is no branching, no extensive nerve plexus, and no neuronal or non‐neuronal endocrine cells surrounding it. The strand mainly consists of a simple cuboidal epithelium, but has several variations, such as multilayered regions, and protrusions of a cellular chain. The strand cells usually have mitochondria, free ribosomes and a Golgi complex of dictyosomal type. There are many mitotic cells in the strand epithelium. The presence, between the cerebral ganglion and dorsal strand epithelium, of cells with morphology intermediate between the strand and neuronal cells suggests that the dorsal strand might supply cellular components, such as neurones, to the cerebral ganglion in adult zooids. At the caudal end, the strand cells show ultrastructural features suggesting active protein synthesis and secretion. These cells appear to be liberated from the epithelium to release the content of their granules.",

Subsequently (S6), the keratin cusps of the supraoral and infraoral laminae became exposed at the surface, and distinct retractor and protractor muscles formed around the lingual cartilage. In the latter part of the terminal stage in metamorphosis (S7), just prior to the time when the animal migrates downstream, the primary tooth cones and the keratin cusp of the longitudinal lingual laminae began breaking through the epithelial surface of the disc.",

The glomerular layer of the kidney is tightest in Bombina, and has its maximal extension in Rana. It covers up to 2/3 of the thickness of the kidney while in the other species studied the glomeruli are restricted to the ventral third of the kidney. Glomeruli with double afferent or efferent arterioles were rarely found in Xenopus.

Naturally occurring, large pituitary cysts, that almost excluded prolactin cells from the pituitary of Pungitius pungitius L., offered a unique opportunity to study a target organ for prolactin (the integument) in fish that were “partially hypophysectomised” without any accompanying surgical trauma. In fish with large pituitary cysts, the epidermis from the lateral body wall was thinner and its mucocytes less abundant, than in fish with normal pituitaries and thus many prolactin cells. In support of the hypothesis that prolactin produced the observed integumentary changes, was the similarity of other pituitary cells in animals with and without cysts. Evidently, prolactin can influence the integument of Pungitius, even though it does not seem essential for freshwater survival.",

In addition to this function, it is also secondarily an organ of calcium storage. This stored calcium is distinct from other forms of stored calcium already reported in that it is exceedingly susceptible to osmotic disturbances and very labile. It is possible that this serves as an almost instantaneously mobilizable reserve in times of calcium demand.",

As a consequence, the general cytological mechanism of differentiation has been identified in T. nodulosus . The cytodifferentiation processes are characterized by autophagy of the initial specialized cell population and its replacement by a second population with other morphological and functional potentials. The change in specialized cell populations during morphogenesis is caused by a change in the functional requirements of organs. The primitive nature of the differentiation processes in T. nodulosus at the initial stages of tissue formation is confirmed. It is supposed that destruction of the primary cell populations is the result of apoptosis or genetically programmed suicide.",

These protozoans belong to three genera of ciliates: Vorticella , Dendrosoma and Tokophrya , and were located on the antennae, carapace, appendages and abdomen of the basibiont. The ciliates of the genus Vorticella had a bell‐shaped body, with concave‐type striations and a very long contractile stalk. The stalk joined the body via a truncated and overlapping zone. The macronucleus was J‐shaped, and the contractile vacuole was anterolateral. Only one ciliate species of Vorticella has been found on mysids, although on species other than M. relicta , and this is therefore the first record of Vorticella on M. relicta , and the second on the order Mysidacea. The ciliates of the genus Dendrosoma had an irregular body directly attached to the substrate. Finger‐like actinophores arose from the body, with a bundle of tentacles at their ends. The macronucleus ramified into branches that followed the actinophores. These ciliates were included in the species D. astaci . The presence of this ciliate represents the first record of this genus on Mysis relicta . The ciliates of the genus Tokophrya had a pyramidal body, the apical surface of which showed two conspicuous actinophores, with a short, longitudinally striated stalk joining to the body via a narrow unstriated band. The macronucleus was spherical or ovoid, centrally located, and there was an apical contractile vacuole. Only one previous study has referred to the presence of this genus on Mysis relicta , and the data contained in it were compared with those of the present study.

Usually, these studies reported slower body warming in pale‐coloured morphs than in dark‐coloured morphs. Under this circumstance, one way in which pale‐coloured individuals can manage their slower body warming is to perform better at lower temperatures than dark‐coloured individuals. If this is the case, the former need not necessarily raise their body temperature to the same level as the latter. Based on this scenario, intermorph differences in thermal sensitivity of performance were examined using the melanistic/striped colour‐dimorphic snake Elaphe quadrivirgata as a model species. As an indication of performance capability, the crawling speed was measured at several temperatures. Although striped individuals exhibited slower body warming than melanistic individuals under experimental conditions, the former did not exhibit faster crawling speed than the latter at lower temperatures. Shape and position of the performance curve were almost identical between melanistic and striped individuals, indicating a highly static nature in thermal sensitivity of crawling. Coupled with the results of field studies, it is suggested that striped individuals manage their slower body warming by efforts of behavioural thermoregulation. The possible significance of ecological performance in the wild was discussed.",

More morphological and molecular studies are needed because their phylogenetic relationships with other pulmonates remain unresolved. The present study examines the most conspicuous reproductive gland, the glandular complex in two marine limpets, Siphonaria capensis and S. serrata (Pulmonata: Basommatophora) at both gross and fine structural levels. These two sympatric species with different developmental modes were selected to compare the structure and function of this enormous glandular structure. In both S. capensis and S. serrata , the glandular complex shows an undifferentiated state composed of an acidophilic albumen gland and a basophilic mucous gland. The glands contain secretory cells and supporting cells (= ciliated cells) that are highly ciliated. When the histochemical properties of the glandular complex were compared with those of siphonariid egg masses (of each species) it could be established that the albumen gland was responsible for the production of perivitelline fluid whereas the mucous gland secreted substances that help in the assembly of mucous layers surrounding the egg capsules. We suggest that the presence of a single glandular complex comprised of two glands is the most primitive organization of reproductive glands in pulmonates. Furthermore, the histology, fine structure and histochemistry of these glands are very similar to those of the reproductive glands of opisthobranchs.",

The comparative analyses of the data show that trichomycterid species share six of seven analyzed spermiogenesis characters, reinforcing the monophyly of the group. Analyses of trichomycterid sperm ultrastructure showed that the species studied share the same character states for nine of seventeen characters analyzed. Copionodon orthiocarinatus and Ituglanis amazonicus each share more ultrastructural characters with species of Trichomycterus than with one another. Regarding the families of Loricarioidea, the species of Trichomycteridae share more characters of spermatogenesis, spermiogenesis, and sperm with representatives of the families Callichthyidae, Loricariidae, and Scoloplacidae than with Nematogenyidae, its hypothesized sister group. With the exception of the family Nematogenyidae, the character similarities observed reinforce the monophyly of the superfamily Loricarioidea.",

Biodiversity and distribution of epibiontic communities on Caridina ensifera (Crustacea, Decapoda, Atyidae) from Lake Poso: comparison with another ancient lake system of Sulawesi (Indonesia). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 163–175 The epibiont communities of the shrimp Caridina ensifera , endemic to Lake Poso (Sulawesi, Indonesia), were analysed. Most of the epibiont species were ciliated protozoa belonging to three suctorian genera ( Acineta , Podophrya and Spelaeophrya ), three peritrich genera ( Zoothamnium , Vorticella and Cothurnia ), and a haptorid genus ( Amphileptus ). There was also a rotifer epibiont of the genus Embata . Epibionts were identified to species level. There were 14 to 1114 epibionts per shrimp. The distribution of the epibiont species on the surface of the basibiont was recorded, calculating the number on the different colonized individuals of C. ensifera . The most abundant species, Zoothamnium intermedium and Acineta sulawesiensis , were also the most widely distributed. There was a significant difference between the spatial distributions of the different epibiont species. The analysis of the number of the epibiont species throughout the anteroposterior axis of the shrimp showed a gradient from the anterior to the posterior end of the body. Data from Lake Poso were compared with those of the Malili lake system (Sulawesi), obtained from its endemic shrimp, Caridina lanceolata . Lake Poso had the highest mean diversity, while Lake Mahalona showed the highest maximum diversity. All lakes were correlated with respect to the mean number of epibionts on the anatomical units of the shrimp, which showed a similar general distribution. The distributions of the different epibiont species were compared between the lakes. The possible adaptations of the epibionts as well as the colonization patterns were discussed. From the statistical results and the analysis of the distributions, we propose that in these communities epibiont species have a pattern of colonization in which they follow a behaviour as a whole; each species has a differential distribution, with the species occupying the available substratum with the particular requirements of each functional group, but there is a trend towards maintaining an equilibrium among species and groups, compensating for diversity and number of individuals. In all lakes there was an epibiont distribution model comprising the maintenance of an anteroposterior axis gradient, which was supported by the fluctuation in diversity and number of individuals of the different functional groups of epibiont species. The functional role of the different groups of species seems to tend towards sustainability with little global variation among the lakes.",

From the middle portion of the adult, which has four nidamental glands, a spermoviduct leads to a common genital aperture. From here two separate structures, the vas deferens and a groove on the body surface, lead anteriorly. The latter is termed the egg groove because it carries the egg ribbon anteriorly, a function that is recognized here for the first time in the Ellobiidae. The evolution of this structure is discussed. In development, the organ system arises from four separate anlagen: (1) the ovotestis anlage, (2) the pallial anlage giving rise to the hermaphrodite duct, fertilization pouch–spermatheca complex, nidamental glandular complex and spermoviduct, (3) the bursa copulatrix anlage and (4) the anlage of the copulatory organ, vas deferens and egg groove. This development mode strongly resembles that of the siphonariid Williamia radiata , supporting its interpretation as a plesiomorphy in Pulmonata. Similarities in development of primitive pulmonates and evolution in gastropods lead to the assumption that ontogenesis of this organ system reflects evolution to some degree.",

The NLT is recognised into three divisions: pars rostralis, pars medialis and pars ventrolateralis. The neurons of both the NLT and NPO are aldehyde-fuchsin (AF) positive. The axons from NPO run into four or five bundles ventrolaterally and caudally for some distance before all of them from either side join ventromedially into a single thick cord of neurosecretory fibers which finally enters the pars intermedia to form the neurointermediate lobe. The fibers from NLT, which are separate from the neurosecretory fibers of the NPO, anastomose in the region of the pars distalis. The neurosecretory material (NSM) of NPO is transported by axonal route whereas that of NLT is by axonal as well as ependymovascular pathways. Hypophysectomy results in the increase of AF-positive material in the neurons of NPO shortly after the operation, but later on, the material begins to deplete in them. The AF-positive material at the cut end of neurosecretory fibers, however, accumulates. The AF-positive material in the cell bodies of NLT is also depleted, but the nuclei increase in size, after hypophysectomy.",

The three species have a geographic distribution restricted to south‐eastern and southern South America, and have quite distinct body masses, adaptations and life histories. Our observations include the following: (i) submucosal glands are present throughout the oesophagus of D. albiventris , only in its first third in M. dimidiata , and are lacking in L. halli ; (ii) in the stomach and duodenum, the serus coat coat in D. albiventris is cuboidal (simple, squamous mesothelial layer in the other two species); (iii) the duodenum in L. halli has large folds, short crypts and Brunner's glands (the other species lack folds and Brunner's glands); (iv) the colon's mucous membrane has short, scarce villi in D. albiventris (villi absent in the remaining species). Some of the observed differences can be due to ecological adaptations, especially in the relatively large‐sized, extremely omnivorous D. albiventris (e.g., colon villi).",

The larva is covered by multiciliated cells, which are latitudinally strongly elongated and show phalloidin‐stained cell junctions. We hypothesize that these cells contract at metamorphosis and squeeze the apical invagination and the adhesive sac out. Ectodermal, longitudinal muscle cells extend from the cells of the inner, conical cuticularized part of the apical invagination to the lower part of the corona, around the adhesive sac pore. These muscles are retained in the ancestrula. Scattered monociliated nerve cells are interspersed between the coronal ciliary cells. An equatorial nerve in the larva disappears at metamorphosis. The central, conical part of the cuticle becomes the terminal membrane of the ancestrula, and the underlying ectodermal and mesodermal cell layers differentiate into the polypide bud, forming a deep narrow invagination, differentiating into vestibule–atrium, mouth ring and pharynx–stomach–rectum. Tentacles develop from the ring of cells around the mouth, and a small ganglion with four nerves innervating each of the tentacles develops at the anal side of the mouth. These new findings yield further support for previous homology statements of bryozoan larvae and development.",

The influence of environmental parameters on the reproduction of C. gigas was evaluated from January 2008 to October 2009 with oysters grown on a raft in the Ría de Arousa (Galicia, NW Spain). Temperature and chlorophyll a are directly correlated to sexual maturation. Oysters can mature at temperatures below 14°C. The temperature necessary for spawning differs between the sexes, requiring a temperature above 15°C for males and 18°C for females. Females had a single massive spawn between June and September, while males had partial spawning from May to December with two peaks, one in May–September and another in October–December, with the second peak more pronounced. The first spawning peak is related to high temperatures and concentrations of chlorophyll a , and the second spawning peak is mainly related to the food availability in the water. The spawning asynchrony may be impeding establishment of wild C. gigas populations in Spain.",

In the majority of female snakes examined, sperm storage occurs in receptacles of the infundibular regions of the oviducts. In pitvipers (Viperida, Crotalinae), the storage of sperm was described in the caudal regions of the oviducts (utero‐vaginal junction) through a mechanism termed uterine muscular twisting (UMT). Uterine muscular twisting was described as a twisting of the oviducts after copulation because of uterine contractions. The twisting remains until ovulation at which time the oviducts straighten and sperm migrate cranially to fertilize ovulated ova. Here, we demonstrate that the UMT is not formed by twisting (rotation around axis) of the oviducts of Crotalus durissus but rather coils formed by the inner layers of the oviducts at the utero‐vaginal junction. Contrary to previous findings, coiling of the oviducts is present in females throughout the year, not only in the postcopulatory period; however, the degree of coiling is variable and may be linked to the seasonal reproductive cycle of C. durissus . We categorize the degree of coiling as pronounced coil , discreet coil or absent coil .",

Using micro‐CT to non‐invasively visualize the external and internal morphology of this specimen, we find that the half valves are symmetrical and independent from each other and from any of the other valves. The presence of girdle‐like tissue between the split valves suggests that this shell abnormality arose in early development and was not the product of damage to the adult animal. While the present specimen of A. granulata is clearly abnormal for its species, its split valve may provide some insights into the developmental pathways that would underlie macroevolutionary transitions to multi‐plated chiton forms known from the fossil record.",

The Asian narrow‐mouth toad genus Kaloula is an interesting group that is known for many species having a fossorial life. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive osteological account of Kaloula . Herein, we present the osteology of K. borealis with the help of micro‐CT scanning and double‐staining technologies, which is the first detailed osteological description of the genus. Osteological comparisons with other members of Microhylinae indicate that K. borealis is characterized by the following traits: skull obviously wider than long; suture between frontoparietals narrow; parasphenoid posterior to vomer; premaxilla, maxilla and vomer edentate; clavicles absent; procoracoids small; omosternum and sternum cartilaginous; crista femoris present and large; femur longer than tibiofibula; prehallux including one element. Remarkably, the species possesses a series of osteological specializations that probably are adaptations for the hindlimbs‐first burrowing and a fossorial life, including stout hindlimb, robust crista femoris, tibiofibula shorter than femur, enlarged prehallux, long anterior ramus of the pterygoid and branched bronchial processes of the cricoid. These findings will contribute to the systematics of microhylids and evolutionary interpretations of the osteological adaptation to fossorial life.",

Acta Zoologica, Stockolm. Immunolabelling for RhoV and α‐smooth muscle actin, genes that are highly expressed in the regenerating tail of lizards, shows that a main protein band immunolabelled for RhoV is seen at 65–70 kDa and only a weak band at 22–24 kDa. This suggests that alteration occurred during extraction or is due to biochemical processing of the protein. RhoV immunolabelled cells are present in apical and proximal regenerating epidermis during scale neogenesis. The apical ependyma is labelled but labelling fades and disappears in medial‐proximal regions, near the original spinal cord. Differentiating muscles and cartilage show low labelling. Ultrastructural immunolocalization of RhoV in wound keratinocytes shows labelling in regions containing actin filaments that associate with tonofilaments and desmosomes while a low labelling is present in mesenchymal cells. Filamentous regions of the nucleus, nuclear membrane and the nucleolus are immune‐labelled for RhoV. Similar localization is seen for actin that is present along the perimeters of keratinocytes associated with tonofilaments, in elongations of mesenchymal cells, in muscle satellite cells, endothelial and pericytes of blood vessels. It is suggested that RhoV and actin are associated in the dynamic cytoskeleton needed for the movements of epidermal and mesenchymal cells and in endothelial cells forming new blood vessels.",

During metamorphosis, specimens remodel the palate, rearrange the vomerine dentition, expand the maxilla, broaden the cheek, foreshorten the posterior skull table and develop specific serrated suture patterns in the dermal bones. Instead, large larvae grow a robust pterygoid sutured with a fully ossified trapezoidal vomer and a short maxilla. Small larvae are readily distinguished by tooth count, morphology and arrangement from more advanced larvae. Age‐related features, irrespective of metamorphosis, include pedicellate teeth, morphological differentiation of parasphenoid, enlargement of the orbitosphenoid, distal expansion of columella, and loss of coronoid teeth.",

The number of total vertebrae in the genus Aphanius is ranged from 26 to 29, in Aphaniops, it is ranged from 24 to 28, and in Paraphanius mento, it is ranged from 26 to 27. The vertebral column in Aphanius was often slightly curved, and it is varied from almost straight (most common) to slightly or strongly curved and straight in two others. The caudal skeleton of the family Aphaniidae is characterized by a single and completely fused hypural plate, and a total number of 9–12 branched segmented soft rays, a single and elongate epural bone. All examined species of the genus Aphanius and Paraphanius mento displayed a straight epural bone in their caudal skeleton, while it was often sinuous‐like and thick in all species of the genus Aphaniops . This study supports the assumption that a sinuous epural is likely the first detected morphological synapomorphy for the “inner” clade of Aphaniops . The family Aphaniidae is closer to Cyprinodontidae, Valenciidae and Fundulidae than other cyprinodontiforms in the caudal skeleton, which is in agreement with the multigene phylogeny of cyprinodontiforms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The anatomy of the African lion heart is not well documented, and assumptions are made that the anatomy is comparable to that of the domestic cat. The increasing demand for veterinary intervention in the African lion warrants sound anatomical knowledge of the heart. The heart is situated caudal to the thoracic limbs between ribs 4 and 6. It is covered by the left cranial lung lobe, and cranial and middle lobe of the right lung, respectively, with a prominent cardiac incisure present on the right. Two pericardial ligaments are present, the A . coronaria dextra is dominant, and the Atrium dextrum and Auricula dextra possess a vast network of Mm . pectinati . The massive thoracic limbs, adapted to bring down prey, appear to restrict the cranial thoracic cavity, and as a trade‐off, the thoracic viscera are situated more caudally. During intense activity, the heart and lungs compete against each other for space, thus limiting physical activity to short, intense periods. Capacity for sudden increase of cardiac output is facilitated by the extensive Mm . pectinati of the Atrium dextrum . Intracardiac injection is recommended on the right, ventrally in intercostal space 5. The two pericardial ligaments may help to stabilize the heart during intense activity.",

Although the morphology of abalone gills has been studied by some authors, up to date no data are available about the gills of Haliotis tuberculata . This study was carried out, by light and electron microscopy, on 10 wild adult H. tuberculata . Gills lamellae produce an undulated surface increasing the area in contact with water. At the level of skeletal rods, we observed a joint‐like structure that allows a checked movement. The left ctenidium is always decidedly larger than the right, probably because of the enormous size of the shell muscle. The cilia permit oxygenated water that leaves the afferent border and is thrust away at the tips of the lamellae by the extremely long cilia. Ciliary movement may take part in sweeping mucous secretions to capture extraneous particles and remove them from the gills. Three types of mucous cells are distributed along the epithelium of the afferent and efferent zones of the gill filament. They seem to play a role in the cleansing of gills in coordination with the muscle contraction and ciliary movement. The presence of microvilli on particular cells reflects their role associated with the absorption of substances from the environment. A haemolymphatic vessel is located in the central zone of the gill filament. The backbone of the haemolymphatic vessel is a chitino‐like structure, which gives support to the gills.",

In the posterior region, spikes form within the translucent layer of the periostracum but separated from the calcareous part of the shell. By contrast those spikes in the anterior and ventral region, despite also forming within the translucent periostracal layer, become incorporated into the outer shell layer. Spikes in the posterior area of S pengleria mytiloides form only on the outer surface of the periostracum and are therefore, not encased in periostracal material. Despite differences in construction between these gastrochaenid spikes and those of other heterodont and palaeoheterodont bivalves, all involve calcification of the inner translucent periostracal layer which may indicate a deeper homology.",

When relative length ratios of the bones are compared with a sample of 29 extant and extinct birds with short metatarsi, the specimen variably clusters with some alcedinids, coraciids and trochilids. Log‐clusters give less ambiguous results and indicate significant proximity of the B ystré specimen to the extinct messelirrisorids ( U pupiformes) and the recent acledinids ( C oraciiformes). With regard to morphological details, such as those of the first metatarsal, II ‐ IV metatarsal trochleae, intertrochlear incisurae and phalanges, the S lovak specimen shows a combination of features, which are distributed among recent upupiforms and coraciiforms as well as extinct upupiforms ( M esselirrisor ) and apodiforms ( E ocypselus, P arargornis ).

    "abstract": "Abstract The bivalve Limopsis cristata pursues a semi‐endobenthic life in abyssal soft sediments. It attaches to particles by up to three byssal threads and filter feeds by inhaling water from posterior and anterior directions. Because of partial burial, however, only the latter is functionally significant. Complex ciliary currents in the mantle cavity concerned with the rejection of unwanted particles keep most material out of the simplified intestine. It is generally considered that the ligament is the constraining force in arcoid evolution. This may be true in part, but the lack of pallial fusions and the retention of anterior and posterior inhalant flows are more powerful limits to radiation in the Arcoida. In the deep sea, the Limopsidae has radiated into many micro‐niches through micro‐morphological adaptations. Loss of the arcoid ‘heel’ has resulted in the union of the separate rejectory currents of the visceral mass and foot, creating a single discharge point in more advanced bivalves. This greatly simplifies the rejectory roles of the visceral mass and foot and is thus of functional and selective advantage.",

With the accumulation of these studies and revisions of the terminology based on structural similarities and differences, it is imperative to review the work on tuataras to determine whether the structural organization fits the revised terminology of vertebrates. We investigated the morphology of the male reproductive system in the T uatara, S phenodon punctatus ( R hynchocephalia), the sister taxon to the Squamata. Previous studies on the Tuatara used a nomenclature for the testicular ducts different from the current terminology for amniotes. The reproductive system in the Tuatara is consistent with reports in the S quamata. Two rete testis tubules exit the testis within a connective tissue sheath similar to that shown in other squamate species and the protherian E chidna. Each rete testis divides into multiple ductuli efferentes that fuse with the epididymis. The epididymis transitions into the ductus deferens where the sperm become more concentrated into spherical bundles. The ductus deferens enters the cloacal urodeum separately from the ureter. An ampulla ureter or ampulla urogenital papilla was not observed, which differs from previous studies of lepidosaurians. Furthermore, a sexual segment of the kidney ( SSK ) was not observed, consistent with previous studies on the T uatara.",

This article presents an overview of the role of chironomid midges in embryology research since their introduction as model organisms in the 19th century. We present the vestiges of bibliography since the days of Weismann (1834–1914), who raised preliminary queries to unravel many unique features of insect embryogenesis using midges as a crucible. Unfortunately, over the years, chironomid midges got lost into obscurity as a model for developmental biology, which is evident from the paucity of developmental biology–related literature on midges in the past decades. Through this essay, the authors intend to share reminiscences of the heydays of chironomid research with the wider community of zoologists with an aim of reviving chironomid embryology. Midges not only possess the basic qualities essential for an ideal model system, but being one of the ancestral dipteran stocks, they can also prove an excellent test system for evo‐devo, transgenetic, and embryogenomic investigations that utilize methodologies at the interface of developmental biology and high‐throughput molecular genetic and genomics approach. An introspection of re‐introducing chironomid midgesas model system will be rewarding for the contemporary developmental biologists.",

The quills of H. brachyura are categorized into four types – broad, slender, hollow tail quill and quills of the anogenital region. The ESEM images of surface characteristic of different types of quills of both the species except the hollow tail quill showed usual scaly features without having any differences. The cross‐sectional images of quills of H. indica and H. brachyura show a narrow cortex and a broad medullary region with a network of anastomosing channels. The cortical layer is comparatively thicker in mane hairs of H. indica and in slender quills of H. brachyura . With extensive exploration of the anatomical structures of the quills by ESEM from both the species of Hystrix, we could not find ‘osmetrichia’ in any forms of quill. In contrast, we hypothesized that the channels and network of medulla are serving the purpose for transportation of pheromonal signalling molecules in old world porcupine.",

Most ctenophores have a tentacular apparatus, which plays some role in their feeding. Tentacle structure has been described in adults of only three ctenophore species, but the larval tentacles have remained completely unstudied. We made a light and electron microscopic study of the tentacular apparatus in the larvae of Bolinopsis infundibulum from the White Sea. The tentacular apparatus of B. infundibulum larvae consists of the tentacle proper and the tentacle root. The former contains terminally differentiated cells, while the latter contains stem cells and cells undergoing differentiation. The core of the tentacle is formed by myocytes, and its epidermis contains colloblasts (hunting cells), wall cells, degenerating cask cells, refractive vesicles, and ciliated sensory cells. Stem cells, colloblasts, and cask cells at various stages of differentiation and putative myocytes progenitors were revealed in the tentacle root. Two different populations of the stem cells in the tentacle root give rise to epidermal (colloblasts and cask cells) and mesogleal (myocytes) cell lines. Nervous elements, glandular cells, and basal lamina were not found. Step‐by‐step differentiation of colloblasts and cask cells is described.",

The antennae of female E upristina sp. are geniculated, and in total, there were seven types of sensilla found on the antennae: two types of multiporous placoid sensilla (type 1 is sausage‐like and type 2 is rounded), sensilla trichodea ( ST ), basiconic sensilla ( BS ), chaetica sensilla ( C h S ), coeloconic sensilla ( C o S ), and one specialized sensillum classified as sensillum obscurum ( SO ).

Here, we used an ecological and a phylogenetic approach to explore the relationship between habitat, HP , BS , and heart size ( HS ) in five species of the neotropical whipsnakes genus C hironius that occupy terrestrial, semiarboreal, and arboreal habits. Our ecological comparison indicated that the arboreal species have the most posterior‐positioned heart, the most slender body, and the smallest HS , whereas the terrestrial representative of the group exhibited the most anterior heart, the less flattened body, and the largest HS . After removing the phylogenetic effect, we found no difference in HP and BS between terrestrial and arboreal species. Habitat only differed when contrasting with HS . Body slenderness and HS were correlated with HP . Our results suggest that different restrictions, such as anatomical constraints, behavior, and phylogenetic inertia, may be important for the studied species.",

Whereas several methods have been proposed to address issues raised by the inclusion of incomplete terminal taxa, until recently no tool existed to easily quantify the amount of anatomical overlap within a particular clade. The Overlap Indices provide such values and might prove useful for comparative cladistics. We herein describe these new indices and their applications in detail and provide an example file for their calculation. A case study of diplodocid sauropod dinosaurs shows how the Overlap Indices will help to explore and quantify, which one of a number of conflicting tree topologies is supported by more anatomical traits, which skeletal regions are underrepresented in a particular phylogenetic matrix, and which taxon would improve character state score completeness.",

Mucus cell pores were shown to be narrow slits or triangular‐shaped openings which are invariably situated at cell‐cell junctions. Small granules were often located at or just below the openings with larger granules positioned deeper into the cell. The large granules were observed to undergo a bubbling‐like activity, where a granule suddenly appears, enlarges and then abruptly disappears. Situated below the large granules is a dense matrix of quiescent small, tightly packed mucin granules. The findings suggest that mature epidermal mucus cells are structurally ordered with respect to secretory activity, where small numbers of initially basally located, densely packed granules rapidly expand in a location proximal to the pore and presumably prior to mucus release through the pore.",

Unique character states of the first instar larva of this species are the spine-like shape of antennal complex, laterally compressed apical part of mouthhooks and an extreme elongation of the sensilla of the maxillary palpus. Phrosinella (Asiometopa) ujgura (Rohdendorf) possesses a pair of retractable, robust processes on the ventral margin of the first thoracic segment and a very strong, elongated labrum. Both character states are present in other known first instar larvae of genus Phrosinella. A reduction of cuticular ridges on dorsal and lateral surfaces of abdominal segments supports a monophylum consisting of the subgenera Asiometopa Rohdendorf and Caspiomyia Rohdendorf within genus Phrosinella.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The results of a detailed morphological and pathological study on reindeer bones ( Rangifer tarandus ) from four medieval hunting stations on Hardangervidda are presented. As intensive marrow collecting left almost no bones intact, traditional sexing methods could only sparsely be applied. Alternative methods had to be explored to successfully assign the fragments to a sex. Employing linear discriminant analysis ( LDA ) on early‐ and non‐fusing skeletal elements, I have shown that (incomplete) calcanei, metapodia and phalanges I and II can be used successfully to assign a specimen to a sex and should no longer be excluded from osteometric analyses. Differences in the demographic compositions of the taphocoenoses lead to the assumption that hunters in the 11th century AD targeted large reindeer bucks, while at the 13th‐century sites, the complete biocoenose is represented, albeit in a different ratio. There seems to have been a shift in hunting technique: from selective hunting to mass hunting. Size wise, the reindeer from Hardangervidda were smaller than reindeer from contemporary assemblages from the Dovre area (central Norway), a population that is genetically different. Few pathologically affected bones were encountered in the material, but some cases of infections, bone lesions and a progressed osteosarcoma are described.",

The cellular events of wrinkled blastula formation in P. exigua were documented using light, confocal and electron microscopy. Wrinkled blastulae have a highly infolded epithelium. Prior to wrinkling, the blastomeres are cuboidal with lipid droplets and yolk granules distributed throughout their cytoplasm. During wrinkling, the cells become columnar and the lipid and yolk reserves become redistributed to the basal and apical ends of the cells, respectively. Gastrulae have a tall columnar epithelium, with a basal accumulation of lipid. Interdigitation of numerous cell projections, including short lateral processes, basal lamellipodia and apical filopodia, assists in maintaining epithelial integrity during wrinkling. Apical filopodia have not been observed in other echinoderm embryos. Although 1 M urea caused elevation of the fertilization envelope, the embryos did not expand into the newly‐created space. This is suggested to be due to the adhesive properties of the hyaline layer. Embryos removed from their envelope were enlarged with shallower and fewer wrinkles compared with controls. It appears that the integrity of the hyaline layer and fertilization envelope both influence the compact wrinkled profile of P. exigua blastulae.",

P. amphophthalma does not show any epitokous modifications at maturity such as those that usually occur in syllids. The reproductive structures are unique: the male genital organs consist of a seminal vesicle in chaetigers 6–10, subdivided into a dorsal part tightly filled with spermatozoa and a ventral part with contents in different stages of spermatogenesis, one pair of sperm ducts and conspicuous gland cells situated in chaetigers 10 and 11. Their glandular secretions are discharged into the sperm duct together with those of other types of gland cells that form the duct. The oocytes develop freely within the body cavity of the females. Each of the fertile segments possesses a paired oviduct ending in a large ciliated funnel. Sperm ducts and oviducts are probably modifications of excretory organs; nephridia are absent in segments where gonoducts occur. A direct sperm transfer by lytic opening of the integument of the female and internal fertilization are inferred.

    "abstract": "Abstract The Thylacocephala is a recently recognized extinct group of uncertain, but probably crustacean, affinity, comprising fossils formerly assigned to many different crustacean groups. Key characters are three anterior pairs of subchelate limbs; at least 8 pairs of radiating gills, situated between the trunk and carapace, the most posterior gill lying subhorizontally; and the large posteriorly tapering battery of 8(–?20) elongated limb protopods with tenuous distal filaments. Thylacocephala bear huge anterior structures, variously identified as compound eyes or as a ‘cephalic sac’. Microsclerites borne on this structure may be external, perhaps setae, but need not imply affinity with cirripedes as has been argued. Internal microsclerites have been compared with crystalline cones of a compound eye. More detailed study of well‐preserved material is required to resolve the nature of these microsclerites, to elucidate details of appendages, to locate antennae, and to ascertain limb homologies. Until that work is done, affinities of the Thylacocephala must remain uncertain as must the group's relevance to evolution of Crustacea. Such recent recognition of a distinctive functional model system (Dahl, E. 1976. Zoologica Scripta 5: 163–166) which persisted for at least 340 million years, shows the fossil record still has much to contribute to understanding the pattern of arthropod evolution.",

The sperm head of B. bengalensis is invariably falciform, has a uniform electron‐dense nucleus capped by an acrosome with a posteriolateral equatorial segment, a subacrosomal cytoskeleton with a large rostral perforatorium, and a sperm tail, attached to the lower concave surface of the sperm head, with typical coarse fibres and fibrous sheath. By contrast, the sperm head shapes of B. indica are generally conical or bulbous, the nucleus contains a few large vacuoles, the acrosome lacks an equatorial segment, no recognisable perforatorium occurs, and the sperm tail, which is attached basally, is very short with only modest development of coarse fibres and fibrous sheath. These results indicate that, within the genus Bandicota , huge interspecific differences in morphology of the spermatozoon have evolved. The spermatozoa of B. bengalensis are similar to those of Rattus and many other murids and thus presumably represent the ancestral condition, whereas those of B. indica (and B. savilei ) are unlike spermatozoa from any other eutherian mammal so far described. © 1998 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

The present account describes the sperm of six of these species, in two subfamilies: Pisinae— Sphenocarcinus orbiculatus and Sphenocarcinus stuckiae and Inachinae— Cyrtomaia furici, Grypacheus hyalinus, Platymaia rebierei and Macropodia longirostris. M. longirostris has the only eubrachyuran sperm in which the acrosome is known to depart radically from a subspheroidal form. The acrosome is semilunar in shape and is bordered by a very thin layer of cytoplasm and an unusually uniform, narrow band of chromatin. The apical surface of the acrosome is almost flat, though slightly concave, whereas the posterior surface forms a hemisphere, and is almost completely occupied by the thin, centrally perforate, electron dense operculum. The bulk of the acrosome consists of a homogeneous, moderately electron dense outer acrosome zone. This surrounds a small inner acrosome zone internal to which is an ellipsoidal, pale perforatorium capped by a central acrosome zone. Majid sperm are distinguished by a flattened and/or centrally depressed operculum; a further characteristic is that the pointed perforatorium is relatively short and frequently does not reach the operculum. They vary inter alia with regard to presence or absence of a posterior median process and, apparently, of centrioles and of microtubules in the nuclear arms, and in the number of these arms. Perforation of the operculum, seen in the Pisinae, is not constant in the Inachinae. Spermatozoal ultrastructure offers no certain support for a close relationship of majids with parthenopids or hymenosomatids.",

Cell surface glycoconjugates in the olfactory system of lungfish Protopterus annectens Owen. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 81 : 131–137 Lectin binding was performed on the olfactory system of lungfish Protopterus annectens to identify specific glycoconjugates on the cell surface of olfactory receptor cells. The lectin histochemical patterns and the Western blot analysis indicate that the receptor cells of the olfactory mucosa are characterized by high density of α‐N‐acetyl‐ d ‐galactosamine residues on the saccharidic chains of the surface glycoproteins. Other lectins display a regional pattern between the regions of the olfactory bulbs. This different histochemical lectin pattern might be due to a different regional segregation of the olfactory projections. On the other hand it could allow the identification of an area corresponding to the accessory olfactory bulb of terrestrial vertebrates in the ventrolateral region of Protopterus olfactory bulb. The presence in the dipnoan olfactory system of a vomeronasal organ homologous to the organ in amphibians is discussed. Moreover, the selective lectin binding on the surface of primary olfactory neurones suggests that specific cell surface glycoproteins may have a role in the axonal growth due to the continuous cycle of proliferation and the death of olfactory receptor cells.",

The apical organ consists of at least four cell types: (1, 2) two types of ciliated cells, (3) vacuolated cells and (4) myoepithelial cells. The apical organ and frontal ganglion are tightly juxtaposed in the upper tier of the episphere. The stalked vesicles each consisting of two cells are unique evaginations of the epidermis.

The prototroch is comprised of a row of contiguous prototroch cells each containing about eighteen long cilia.

Three morphologically distinguishable regions of the spleen were identified: the white pulp, the red pulp and the ellipsoids. In all three, the splenic parenchyma was a meshwork supported by reticulum cells and fibres. Reticulum cells in both the white and the red pulp are irregular elements, the processes of which are joined by cell junctions and embrace developing reticular fibres. The ellipsoids of the dogfish spleen are terminal branches of the splenic arteries of the white pulp, with a sheath consisting of reticulum cells, reticular fibres, ground substance, macrophages and occasional lymphocytes. Isolated melanomacrophages also occur in the ellipsoid walls as well as in the red pulp. In both the white and the red pulp phagocytic reticulum cells, and macrophages appear frequently forming cell associations with surrounding blood cells, mainly lymphocytes. The functional significance of the ellipsoids and the cell‐cell clusters of the white and the red pulp is discussed in relation to the immune capacities demonstrated in elasmobranchs.",

Free odontoblasts cluster on the adaxial side and have patchy chromatin and little cytoplasm. The free odontoblasts migrate to the abaxial side, where their structure changes to that of syncytial odontoblasts. Calcareous deposits are formed intracellularly by syncytial odontoblasts within two membranes: an outer plasma membrane and an inner vacuolar membrane. The vacuolar membrane has organic particles on the surface of the membrane. There is no trace of organic matter within the calcareous deposit. Fibroblasts are located on the adaxial side. Collagen fibers are located primarily on the adaxial side adjacent to the calcareous depositing membranes and between free odontoblasts, but they are not located in the deposits. Collagen fibers may play a role in cell migration and thus in calcification. The morphological changes of the plumulae are closely related to calcification.",

The marked trabeculation of the ventricle and bulbus arteriosus and the arrangement of central veins are used as a basis for the hypothesis that Channa may selectively channel the well oxygenated blood draining the air breathing organs via the anterior cardinal vein to the posterior ventral aorta, which forms the systemic arterial circulation. An angiocardiographic technique was used to test this hypothesis, as well as to delineate the functional role of the heart chambers in the cardiac cycle. No reflux of contrast to the sinus venosus during atrial filling and no ventricular filling before atrial contraction were apparent, which makes the atrium the main determinant of the ventricular end‐diastolic volume. Ventricular contraction left a small or no residual volume. The ventricular ejectate was initially nearly completely absorbed by the very elastic bulbus arteriosus, acting as a pressure chamber (Windkessel) stabilizing and prolonging ventral aortic blood flow. Contrast medium was not selectively passed from the anterior cardinal vein to the posterior ventral aorta. However, the diameter of this vessel and its density of contrast were greater than in the anterior aorta, suggesting a preference for a greater blood flow from the air breathing organ through the heart to the posterior aorta.",

Structure and chemistry of the Dufour gland in Pristomyrmex ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 81 : 159–166 All individuals of the three species of Pristomyrmex studied have a Dufour gland with a conspicuous hammer‐shaped distal part, that is connected to a thin‐walled proximal reservoir through a very narrow stalk. The secretory distal part is formed by high columnar cells that are characterized by a highly folded apical wall. The lateral cell junctions apically correspond with the crenel tops, which gives individual cells a peculiar shape with a deep apical depression. The cytoplasm of the secretory cells contains a very well developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, numerous mitochondria and lysosomes. Histochemical analysis indicates a positive reaction for the presence of a lipid secretion in the hammer‐like part. Gas chromatographic analysis of glands of P. pungens workers reveals the secretion to be formed of a mixture of simple volatile monoterpene hydrocarbons; α–pinene, β–pinene, limonene and camphene. Similar, but species characteristic mixtures of four monoterpenes were found in Pristomyrmex brevispinosus and Pristomyrmex sp.1. Behavioural experiments did not allow a conclusive determination of the function of the gland.",

The dolphins were collected by local fishermen and 29 external characteristics were measured by members of the Marine Mammals Laboratory, University of Mexico. The length of each characteristic with respect to total length was analysed through adjustment of the data to a power equation. A stepwise discriminant analysis was applied to the absolute values and to those expressed as proportions to analyse the differences between the sexes. Results indicate that growth in these dolphins is generally negatively allometric, and most of the characteristics measured were, in both absolute and proportional terms, greater in male dolphins than in female dolphins. As found in many species of odontocetes, the discriminant analysis showed that the main differences between the sexes for this coastal subspecies include the relative positions of the umbilicus, the genital aperture and the anus. The morphometric data provided by this study, corresponding to 29 specimens of S. a. graffmani collected in a restricted locality of the Mexican Pacific coast, are particularly interesting to studies documenting latitudinal morphological differences in the coastal spotted dolphin.",

The seasonal variation of sperm storage in this species has previously been studied by light and transmission electron microscopy. In this paper, sperm aggregations, interaction of sperm with the spermathecal epithelium, and spermathecal secretions are studied using scanning electron microscopy. Within spermathecal tubules, relatively small groups of sperm are aligned along their entire lengths in parallel arrays. This pattern is similar to other plethdontids with complex spermathecae. Lumina of spermathecal tubules are filled with secretory material in April prior to the arrival of sperm, and after sperm appear, a coating of secretory material persists on the apices of the spermathecal epithelium. Sperm peripheral to the central luminal mass can become embedded in the secretory matrix or pushed deeper into the spermathecal epithelium. The spermathecal secretions may serve to attract and prolong the viability of sperm, but sperm that become enmeshed in the secretions or epithelium are phagocytized. Sperm and spermathecal secretions are largely absent after ovulation and in summer months, and new secretory vacuoles are formed in fall, although mating does not occur until spring.",

The contacts between the glial cells consisted of desmosomes and puncta adherentia , while those between the glial cells and the basal lamina consisted of hemidesmosomes. Both glial cell types were located in the cortex and medullary regions, however, the protoplasmic glial cells prevailed in the cortical region, while the fibrous glial cells prevailed in the medullar region. As the nervous tissue is avascular, the passage of nutrients and waste products may be facilitated by the glial labyrinthic system which is located in the cortical region. Glial processes adjacent to large and giant neurones formed a trophospongium, which seemed to be involved in a metabolic exchange between these cells. Thus, this evidence suggests that glial cells of M. abbreviatus are involved in structural support, isolation of different ganglionic areas, the formation of a microcirculatory system and an intimate metabolic relationship with neurones.",

A phylogenetic hypothesis should be based on multiple character systems and all available data must be considered. Kazantsev based his conclusions on a single isolated character complex. His hypothesis is in deep conflict with a phylogeny based on the molecular data, which clearly show that Lycidae are nested within Elateroidea. The molecular and morphological evidence also implies that females are aberrant neotenic forms and by no means ‘primitive’. Kazantsev's hypothesis is problematic because the presented data are insufficient and the character evaluation is not based on a numerical analysis.",

The body wall of three species of Grania, including the cuticle, epidermis and the musculature, are studied using TEM. The cuticle is similar to previously studied enchytraeids, with an orthogonal grid pattern of collagen fibers. This pattern is also seen in Crassiclitellata, which has been suggested as the sister taxon of Enchytraeidae. Variation of epicuticular and fiber zone patterns seen in Naididae (formerly Tubificidae and Naididae) seem to be lacking in Enchytraeidae. The fiber thickness, however, varies between Grania species and may be a phylogenetically informative character. The epidermis consists of supporting cells, secretory cells and sensory cells. Basal cells, typical for Crassiclitellata, were not observed. The clitellum of Grania seems to consist of two types of gland cells, which develop from regular epidermal tissue. It is possible that more cell types exist in different regions of the clitellum, however. The body wall musculature is arranged somewhat differently from that of closely related taxa; this refers to the reduction of circular and outer, triangular longitudinal muscle fibers, while the inner, ribbon-shaped longitudinal muscle fibers are well-developed. A search was conducted for the cause of the peculiar green coloration of Grania galbina De Wit and Erséus 2007, and it was concluded that neither cyanobacteria nor epidermal pigment granules were present in the fixed material.",

An investigation of the cranial evolution of Asian pitvipers (Serpentes: Crotalinae), with comments on the phylogenetic position of Peltopelor macrolepis — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 402–407. We investigated the evolution of 12 cranial characters of 31 species of Asian pitvipers by examining the character state changes on a consensus tree modified from broadly consistent molecular results. We found that these characters appear stable with only one intraspecific polymorphism. Nine of the 12 characters form useful synapomorphies, whereas three are ambiguous and evolutionarily plastic. Clades that are supported with numerous apomorphies are the Trimeresurus group [consisting of the recently defined genera Trimeresurus sensu Malhotra and Thorpe (2004) , Parias , Popeia , Viridovipera , Himalayophis , and Cryptelytrops ] and the genera Protobothrops , Parias , and Viridovipera . Two species previously considered as congeners but now known to be distantly related, Ovophis monticola and ‘ Ovophis ’ okinavensis , have nearly identical character states, demonstrating substantial convergence in cranial characters. Finally, we attempt to infer the phylogenetic position of Peltopelor macrolepis by comparing its cranial features with that of other pitvipers.",

Each testis contains seminiferous tubules and interstitial tissues. The former house spermatogenic cells (spermatogonia A &amp; B, preleptotene, primary and secondary spermatocytes, spermatids (steps 1–8) and spermatozoa) and Sertoli cells, while the latter comprise peritubular and intersitial tissues. The rete testis is an anastomosing duct, having intratesticular and extratesticular portions. The proximal region of ductuli efferentes has wider outer ductal and luminal diameters than those of the distal region. The convoluted ductus epididymis is subdivided into four regions (initial segment, caput, corpus and cauda), based on the ductal diameter, epithelium characteristics and cell components. The ductus deferens has the greatest diameter and is divided into the ductal and ampulla ductus deferens. The ductal portion is subdivided into the proximal and distal regions, based on the epithelium types and ductal diameters. The ampulla ductus deferens is a fibromuscular tube, having numerous mucosal folds projecting into the lumen. Spermiophagy is detectable in the ductus epididymis and ductus deferens. The present results contribute to improved fundamental knowledge on the microanatomy of the reptilian reproductive system.",

Cranial sutures closure and fusion sequences of N. leporinus agree with that of hystricomorph rodents, artiodactyls, primates, sirenians and carnivores, beginning with the cranial vault followed by the basicranium, supporting a conserved pattern for mammalia. Detailed comparisons exhibit a complete cranial sutures fusion reached earlier at Desmodus rotundus regarding N. leporinus and Pteropus sp., and an early fusion for the sutura coronalis plus late fusion for the sutura sagittalis at N. leporinus regarding Desmodus rotundus . The drastic shape changes of cranial elements, as well as sutures closure and fusion in N. leporinus at subadults and adults, seem to be closely related to the acquisition of morphological specializations during stages of development when the fisher bat begins to feed independently.",

The main feature of the LLS of flatfishes is bilateral asymmetry in the course of the cranial lateral line canals, but also in the reduction of canals or portions of canals, which occurs independently on the eyed and blind sides. The number of reductions is used to define two patterns for comparative analysis. A complete pattern is defined by the presence of all main canals, connected with each other, and the canaliculi that end in pores are usually highly branched. The reduced pattern is defined by the presence of more than two reductions. Each family is characterized by the occurrence of a complete pattern, a reduced pattern or both patterns. The combination of reductions varies considerably and characterizes taxa at the generic level. A reduced pattern appears independently several times and has a complex evolutionary history with reversals to a complete pattern. This study has shown that LLS characters are very informative for phylogeny and taxonomy and should be an important component of the description and revision of pleuronectiform taxa and their relationships.",

This is the first morphological and histochemical description of the uropygial gland for this species in a comparative context. The uropygial gland of these birds had parallel arranged lobes with a kidney‐like shape, a conical papilla and a feather tuft in a sub‐terminal position. The lobes were composed of tubular adenomers with a straight course that lead to secondary chambers. The capsule and connective tissue around the adenomers had elastic fibres. It showed a positive reaction to AlcianBlue/Periodic Acid Schiff and several lectins indicating the presence of glycoconjugates. The uropygial gland of the Hooded Grebe shares morphological characteristics with other aquatic species (e.g. secondary chambers) and the presence of glycoconjugates might suggest protective functions against microbes as previously proposed. The sub‐terminal position of the feather tuft is a unique characteristic of this species indicating that this position leaves the tuft in a dorsal location and could be involved in parent‐chick recognition mediated by odour transmission. Further studies are needed to increase our knowledge on some behavioural aspects of this species related to the biochemical composition of the uropygial secretion.",

A total of 96 individuals were analysed. The reproductive cycles of males and females were described through morphoanatomical analysis of testis and ovary. Age at onset of sexual maturity and estimated longevity were determined by skeletochronology. Individuals of O. americanus presented a potentially continuous reproductive cycle with a peak of reproductive activity in the warmer months. Females presented a higher reproductive investment than males. Sexual maturity was reached at around one year of age for both sexes while longevity differed between the sexes, with females living up to six years and males up to ten years. No evidence of sexual size dimorphism was found. This study is among the few that have assessed age at sexual maturity and longevity in a Neotropical anuran. Basic aspects of life history are of paramount importance because they allow comparisons and test of hypotheses to be made, which can help to build generalizations about the evolutionary meaning of ecological strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the present article, the median dorsal bones, bones of the upper jaw, circumorbital series and occipital ring of the skull of the adult Egyptian cobra, Naja haje have been described in detail, and compared with those of the other snakes studied by the previous authors. The median dorsal bones of the cranium are the nasals, frontals, parietals, but not the premaxillae. The paired nasals are exceptionally elongated anteriorly to the extent that the premaxillae and their processus nasalis are completely hidden in a dorsal view. The paired frontals send lateral downgrowths through their whole length which unite together in the mid‐ventral line just dorsal to the parasphenoid. The fused parietals also send lateral downgrowths which articulate ventrally with the posterior part of the parasphenoid and the anterior part of the basisphenoid. The upper jaw is composed only of the premaxilla, maxilla and quadrate on either side. The fused premaxillae possess a processus nasalis, and ventrally they send backwards a palatal process. The maxilla carries two poisonous fangs and two solid small teeth. It is quite separate from the premaxilla, but connected with the palatine (through its palatal process), prefrontal and ectopterygoid. The length of the maxilla is reduced in comparison with that of the boids and colubrids. The incomplete bony orbital ring is formed only of the prefrontal, frontal and postfrontal. Thus the jugal, lacrymal and postorbital are completely lacking, and the parietal is excluded from the circumorbital series by the presence of the postfrontal. The prefrontal extends from the cranial roof to the upper jaw. It is firmly fixed dorsally with the antero‐lateral border of the frontal. Its ventral edge is firmly fixed to the dorsal surface of the maxilla and its palatal process. The antero‐dorsal edge of the postfrontal is connected with the postero‐lateral edge of the frontal, while its medial edge is in sutural contact with the parietal and its lateral downgrowth. The occipital ring consists of the four occipital bones; the basioccipital ventrally, the two exoccipitals laterally and dorsally, and the supra‐occipital dorsally. The sutures separating these bones from one another are distinct. The two exoccipitals articulate with each other dorsally above the foramen magnum, thus excluding the supraoccipital from this foramen. The occipital condyle is tripartite formed out of the basioccipital and the two exoccipitals. The exoccipital is completely fused, without any line of demarcation, with the opisthotic to form a compound bone which is called the otoccipital.",

The otic capsule is composed of the prootic, laterosphenoid and opisthotic. The fenestra ovalis interrupts the suture separating the prootic and the opisthotic part of the otoccipital. The laterosphenoid is a rather minute bone lying lateral to the center of the prootic, with which it is completely fused both above and below without any trace of sutures. The palate is composed of the premaxillae, maxillae, prevomers, septomaxillae, palatines, pterygoids, ectopterygoids, basisphenoid and parasphenoid. There is no actual contact between the two prevomers. Each prevomer is composed of a median vertical part and a lateral horizontal one. It is quite separate from the premaxillae, maxilla and palatine. The septomaxilla is wedged between the nasal dorsally, the premaxilla anteroventrally, and the prevomer postero‐ventrally. The palatine is connected posteriorly with the pterygoid and laterally (by means of an outer process) with the palatal process of the maxilla. It carries about seven teeth. The pterygoid is a very long bone, it is connected with the quadrate only by a ligament. The pterygoid is free from the brain‐case, and carries about fourteen teeth. The ectopterygoid connects the maxilla with the pterygoid. The epipterygoid is completely absent. The basisphenoid is completely fused anteriorly with the parasphenoid without any trace of a suture. The parasphenoid is firmly fixed above to the lateral downgrowths of the frontals, and suturally articulates postero‐laterally with the lateral downgrowths of the parietals. There is only one temporal bone on either side which is regarded as the supratemporal. Thus the squamosal and tabular are completely absent. This supratemporal holds the quadrate to the cranium. Each mandibular ramus is composed of four distinct bones which are the dentary, splenial, angular and a composite bone. This composite bone is the result of the complete fusion of the articular, prearticular and supra‐angular. The coronoid bone is completely lacking. The cartilaginous hyoid apparatus is composed of two very long ceratohyals which are fused anteriorly to a small hyoid corpus.",

Molecular investigations have indicated that the Fabriciinae, major taxon of Sabellidae, belongs to Serpulidae, thereby making Sabellidae paraphyletic; however, morphological characters are absent to support this result. We investigate the development, anatomy and ultrastructure of the branchial crown of Fabricia stellaris (Müller, 1774), describing morphological characteristics useful not only for constructing morphological phylogenies but also for understanding the evolution of the branchial crown. The morphology of the radioles and pinnules does not differ from each other. The supporting tissue of the branchial crown consists of myoepithelial cells and a solid extracellular matrix (ECM). Both ciliated and non‐ciliated cells form the epidermal layer; ciliated cells shape the food groove. Most important is the result that radioles and pinnules within Sabellida may not be homologous, because the morphology and the branching of radioles and pinnules are completely different between Sabellinae, Fabriciinae and Serpulidae. The terms ‘primary branch’ for radioles and ‘secondary branch’ for pinnules are proposed for Fabriciinae. The phylogeny of the Sabellida is discussed.",

I found significant variation in the gland structure. The gland opening is associated with a variety of cuticular modifications, several of which provide enlarged evaporative surfaces for enhanced dispersal of gland products. The gland reservoir was surrounded by musculature in all families except Agathiphagidae and Nepticulidae, providing means of rapid expulsion of gland products. The fenestra in female Eriocraniidae, Neopseustidae and Nepticulidae are perforated. Furthermore, the fenestra in female Neopseustidae and Nepticulidae are associated with what appears to be functional sternum V glands consisting of a reservoir and secretory tissue albeit without a gland duct. I discuss the evolutionary history and functional considerations of the sternum V gland in Lepidoptera.",

Fertilised eggs, obtained from one female and two males, were held in a flow‐through system. On the first day, embryos were sampled every 20 min during the first 12 h, and every 40 min in the following 12 h. Embryos were sampled hourly on the second day. On the third and fourth days, embryos were sampled every 2 h, and every 3 h on the fifth and sixth days. The first cleavage furrow appeared at 1 h 40 min postfertilisation. Blastulation concluded at 12 HPF (hours postfertilisation), when the dorsal blastopore lip formed. The completion of gastrulation was at 18 HPF , closing of the neural tube at 23 HPF and formation of the s‐shape heart at 31 HPF . The mass hatch occurred at 120 HPF . A. naccarii is a relatively common sturgeon species in aquaculture and possesses similar developmental patterns to those of other sturgeons; hence, we can use this species as a model for further studies about sturgeon species which are more difficult to breed artificially. Information about the embryonic development of the Adriatic sturgeon could assist restocking programmes.",

This indicates that the skin contains proteins that allow extension of interscale regions. The immunocytochemical analysis of the epidermis indicates that H g G 5, a glycine‐rich hydrophobic beta‐protein poor in cysteine is localized only in the stiff beta‐layer of the outer scale surface, but is completely absent in mesos and alpha‐layers and in hinge regions. H g GC 10, a cysteine‐medium‐rich beta‐protein is present in beta‐layers but especially in alpha‐layers of interscale epidermis that presents folds and lacks a beta‐layer. H g GC 3 is weakly localized in the alpha‐layer, but is mainly found in hinge regions. H g GC 8 and H g G 13 are low to absent in the alpha‐ and beta‐layer. The immunolocalization of cysteine‐rich beta‐proteins such as H g GC 10/3 in alpha‐layers and interscale epidermis suggests that these small proteins are involved in the formation of a corneous material compatible with dewlap extension. The basement membrane underneath scales is joined to bundles of collagen fibrils in the dermis through anchoring fibrils that likely determine flattening of the epidermis during the extension of the throat fan.",

Direct developing frog species, such as Eleutherodactylus coqui , undergo a cryptic metamorphosis before hatching, and many larval‐specific features are vestigial or have been lost entirely from their ontogeny. Taste buds are present in larval stages of biphasically developing anurans and are replaced by taste discs during metamorphosis. One goal of this study was to characterize the ontogeny of taste buds and/or discs in E. coqui . The other goal was to examine correlations between body size and taste organ density and size in different regions of oral epithelium. The research reveals the presence of only one type of taste organ, characteristic of metamorphs of biphasic amphibians, namely taste disc. In addition, taste disc density and the area of the taste disc sensory zone change dramatically during growth.",

To study the effects of allometry on the shape, we performed regression analysis and, to study shape modulation at different collection points and sub‐basins, the canonical variation analyses. We found differences in shape between collection points and sub‐basins associated with relative body height and sub‐orbital plate recoil, in addition to a significant influence of size on specimen shape (allometry) associated with the ventral skull, orbits and sub‐orbital plate. We do not envision differences in body shape between males and females. Several works with fish relate body height with water velocity, while the sub‐orbital plate recoil shows a taxonomic or ecological potential, marking the main difference between the populations of the Upper and Middle São Francisco River.",

The morphological characters of the species were compared with descriptions of other Alpheus species with a known first zoeal stage. The first zoeal stage of this species can be separated from the first zoeal stage described for the other 26 species using the following combination of characteristics: basial endite of maxillule with 2 stout spines (distal one with two rows of spinules) and 2 small plumose setae; basial endite of maxilla bilobed, with 3 and 4 simple setae on proximal and distal lobe, respectively, and five (3 strong and 2 slender) simple setae arranged (2 + 2 + 1) on the basis of first maxilliped. The substantial progress in larval knowledge is fundamental to areas such as ecology and will allow us to better understand the distribution of different early life stages of Alpheus species in the meroplankton community.",

We studied thermoregulatory efficiency and locomotor performance for Liolaemus fitzgeraldi in the Central Andes of Argentina. We determined body temperature, micro‐environmental temperatures and operative temperatures in the field. In the laboratory, we measured preferred temperatures and calculated the index of thermoregulatory efficiency. We estimated the thermal sensitivity of locomotion by measuring sprint speed (initial velocity and long sprint) and endurance at five different body temperatures. Body temperature was not associated with either micro‐environmental temperature, nor did it show differences with preferred temperatures. Thermoregulatory efficiency was moderate (0.61). Initial velocity and long sprint trials showed differences at different temperatures; however, endurance did not. Moreover, the optimal temperatures for the performance trials showed no significant differences among themselves. We conclude that Liolaemus fitzgeraldi has thermal sensitivity in locomotor performance with respect to body temperature and that it is an eurythermic lizard that experiences a large variation in body temperature and that has thermal flexibility in the cold.",

Molecular studies on lizard tail regeneration indicate that the blastema stage is a tumour‐like outgrowth capable of self‐regulate to produce a new tail. Various oncogenes and tumour suppressors are expressed, and their proteins are localized in specific regions of the growing blastema. SnoRNAs are exclusively overexpressed in the tail blastema suggesting changes in ribosome translation efficiency in blastema cells, like in cancer. Blastema cells secrete high levels of hyaluronate and adopt an anaerobic metabolism (Warburg effect). These studies indicate that the lizard blastema represents a unique case among terrestrial vertebrates of physiological tumour remission. Mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts forming the blastema are turned within 1–2 months into a functional organ, the tail. In vitro studies on isolated mesenchymal cells from the regenerative blastema shows that these cells do not undergo contact inhibition but continue proliferation after confluence, and contain nestin, vimentin and K17. After 2–3 weeks they stratify into 5–7 layers forming a pellicle of loose connective tissue. Future molecular studies on genes and proteins that allow the control of growth in the lizard blastema may help to determine how lizards turn a tumour into a new organ with numerous differentiated and functional tissues, providing clues on cancer growth regulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study gives a comprehensive description of eyelids movement in little owl and discusses the impact of some surrounding conditions in their kinetic performance. The present study used the video's recording technique to record the kinetic activity of eyelids, besides the anatomical and histological studies of the eyelid's structure. The fundamental eyelid movements can be uniquely and reliably characterized by their anatomical relationship that was confirmed via video recording for their kinetic activity. The levator palpebrae muscle is considered a main generating motor for the upper eyelid; in the little owl, this muscle splits into multiple directions and is distinguished from the levator palpebrae superioris (Lps) and the levator anguli oculi (Lao) muscle. That anatomical pattern of insertion increases the movement of the upper lid. On the other side, the contraction of depressor palpebrae inferioris (Dpi) muscle and the active upward forces of levator palpebrae muscle help in increasing the opening of the eye's fissure. However, the closure process is produced from the passive downward forces and relaxation of the levator palpebrae superioris (Lps), levator anguli oculi (Lao), and depressor palpebrae inferioris muscle, as well as the contraction of retractor anguli oculi lateralis (Raol) and medialis (Raom) muscle. The present results also recorded that nictitating membrane's (Nm) movement is reversely proportionate to the level of kinetic of other eyelids. The mobility of Nm in little owl occurs under the effect of artificial external stress. These anatomical data and sequence video recordings have confirmed that the upper eyelid moves more compared to other eyelids. The authors also suggest that the mobility of eyelids may get stimulated through external pressure force of some surrounding structure like the periorbital sheet. Also, the histological study exhibited that the structure of two eyelids is very similar in the little owl and the variability is showing in the number of cell layers that forms their epithelium of skin and palpebral surfaces, the distribution of pigment granules, and degree of keratinization on their surface. That variability in the histological characters of eyelids may counteract the abrasive forces occurring during the opening and closing processes.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the microscopic characteristics of scales in several body parts and anal‐fin rays of nine species of the old world cyprinodontiform fishes belonging to the genera Anatolichthys and Paraphanius to find out possible secondary sexual dimorphic traits and their importance in aphaniid taxonomy. Both light and scanning microscopy revealed that scales show general characteristics of aphaniid species and present large cycloid scales of several subtype forms including cycloid‐true circular, cycloid‐chordate, oval‐reversed ovoid, polygonal‐pentagonal, quadrilateral‐square, oval‐ovoid and oval‐oblong in different body parts of fishes. Both genera had sexual dimorphism: (i) male individuals of all nine investigated species presented contact organs in the forms of ctenus‐like structure in the posterior margin of the scales and spicule‐like structure in the anal‐fin rays; (ii) caudal‐fin rays of both sexes lacked contact organs; (iii) the number, position, size and form of contact organs provided a taxonomic signal to identify the two genera; (iv) contact organs can be thought of as functional structures that keep male and female individuals in physical contact during courtship and display behaviour throughout the active phase of reproduction; (v) it can provide evolutionary signals because sexual dimorphism would come from various sexual selection pressures acting on both sexes.",

Central East Pacific fisheries are mainly supported by four species: Penaeus brevirostris , P. californiensis , P. stylirostris and P. vannamei . However, the same shrimp fishery practices, management strategies and closures are applied to these four species despite their differences in life history and reproductive periods. Most molecular studies have focused on the cultured species P. vannamei , while knowledge for the rest of the species is scarce. Therefore, this study sought to examine the transcriptomes of these four shrimp species from the Mexican Pacific at different maturity stages. A total of 165 unigenes were found to be reproduction‐related in the four shrimp species. The genes with the highest overall expression levels were associated with ribosomes, transcription and methyltransferase pathways. Moreover, the reproduction‐related genes with the highest expression values were polehole protein and ovarian peritrophin . The major expression similarities were primarily among pre‐vitellogenic and vitellogenic females within each species, and secondly among the species P. brevirostris and P. californiensis and the species P. vannamei and P. stylirostris . Although these four species might share a geographical location or niche, the expression of reproduction related‐genes at different gonadal maturity stages exhibited species‐specific variations.",

The beak utilized in tadpoles of R. dalmatina for crushing vegetables is formed of cornified cell layers.

The labial and oral surfaces of the beaks also accumulate corneous material during proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes from the epidermis to form a sheath around the central corneous cells. Corneocytes are shed during the growth of tadpoles. Electron microscopy reveals that keratin and mucus granules are main components of these keratinocytes. Electron‐dense organelles of unknown composition and with inside lamellae are also present. Using immunohistochemistry after post‐injection of 5BrdU, a marker of cell proliferation, the main timing of formation of the beak has been determined. After 2–5 h from injection, labelled nuclei of keratinocytes are seen in the basal layer, and sparse suprabasal labelled nuclei are detected after 5 h. Labelled keratinocytes are seen in suprabasal layers at 2 days post‐injection.

    "abstract": "Abstract The palaeofauna of the Quaternary is mostly known from the mammals' record, while the herpetofauna is less represented. In the same way, in northeastern Argentina reptile fossils records are scarce, usually represented by preliminary communications. This paper focuses on the study of herpetofauna remains from the Isla El Disparito archaeological site. The faunal materials collected at the site revealed an increase in taxonomic diversity related to the Quaternary herpetofauna in the IED site, with over 50% of the bone remains represented by anurans and at least six recognized squamates taxa. The purpose of this study is to properly identify these new records of herpetofauna remains from northeastern Argentina during the Holocene as well as to provide a dichotomous key of postcranial remains for identifying extant squamates taxa in other Quaternary sites from Argentina. The identified squamate assemblage includes the lizard Ophiodes sp., the snake families Typhlopidae, Dipsadidae, Viperidae and undetermined colubroids, along with anuran bone remains (Anura indet. and ?Hylidae). Additionally, the findings contribute to a better understanding of the herpetological assemblage in Argentina, providing insights into the composition of South American squamates during the Quaternary.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study reports the formation of claws in lizards and their cornification. From a flat epidermis with lose mesenchyme, the skin forms undulations that become symmetric domes and later asymmetric for the elongation of their proximal part that gives rise to the outer scale surface. At the tip of digits claws develop in association with a mesenchyme that surrounds the cartilage of the last phalange. Beta‐cells of claws appear 2–3 embryonic stages before those of scales formed in other body regions, including digital scales. The epidermis of the developing claw initially forms 3–4 embryonic layers under which elongated beta‐cells accumulate long bundles of corneous material, immunopositive for CBPs. Claw beta‐keratinocytes incorporate tritiated proline and accumulate numerous, oriented corneous bundles that rapidly occupy the entire cell. The bundles are electron‐dense under transmission electron microscopy, suggesting that, in association to CBPs, other proteins are synthesized and increase the mechanical resistance of claws. Immunolabelling for cysteine‐rich IFKs, HA and HB, shows that these keratins co‐localize with CBPs only in claws but are low to absent in digital scales and adhesive setae. This indicates that the hardness of claws mainly depends from the association between these different proteins rich in glycine and cysteine.",

The chief drive of the current investigation is to describe the deformities in the otoliths of the European eel Anguilla anguilla . Out of 76 Anguilla anguilla individuals collected from Bafa Lake in Western Anatolia, Türkiye, four female specimens exhibited abnormal otoliths. Scanning electron microscope was used to determine the deformed otoliths examined. The outcomes of the abnormality analyses in A. anguilla otoliths, deformities were noticed such as numerous prominence structures and bumps of different sizes on the surface of the otolith produced by buildup of the different crystal structures in some parts of the otolith. These deformities were found in the left and/or right otoliths of the female individuals of different total lengths. The percentage of individuals with abnormal otoliths of A. anguilla is calculated as 5.3%. The current study presents for the first‐time abnormal otolith information on left and right otoliths in female A. anguilla. Deformities in the otoliths of European eels are believed to result from a combination of genetic predisposition and stress caused by various environmental factors, such as water pollution, changes in salinity, temperature fluctuations and nutritional imbalances.",

Aphaniops stoliczkanus (Day, 1872) is an endemic species of Middle East occurring over a vast geographic range in different basins. This species has been observed in freshwater, brackish water and hot sulphur springs; therefore, its populations are known to exhibit considerable morphological variation. In the present study, we have investigated the poorly studied populations of A. stoliczkanus of the Hormuz and Makran basins of Iran in terms of otolith morphology and morphometrics. According to the results, these populations can be divided into two distinct groups including east and west of the Strait of Hormuz. Our results also provide evidence that there is a relationship between otolith morphology and the environment, serving as environmental factors that may influence the formation of specific regions in the otolith shape. Despite the remarkable morphological similarities among otoliths in geographically close populations of Charak and Chiruyeh, our data purposed that geographically these populations have different dorsal tip shapes in their otolith. In comparison to the data from other studies, the otoliths of Qeshm Island appear to resemble the overall shape of otolith found in Oman very closely. However, it is believed that Qeshm Island population was separated from the Hormuz basin populations during the Holocene Sea level rise. Also, the outcomes of this study provide insights into the potential role of environmental factors in shaping intraspecific diversity and the migration patterns of this species within the Persian Gulf.",

External fertilization of transparent, spherical, sticky and macrolecithal eggs bearing adhesive filaments with an average diameter of 0.83–1 mm is the first step in the ontogenesis of E. shirini . Embryogenesis continued with a process of meroblastic cleavage (approximately 2 and half h post‐fertilization, hpf), formation of blastula (blastulation), gastrula (gastrulation), neurulation, somatogenesis, organ formation (organogenesis) and pre‐hatching. The development continued with hatching (a stage between the embryonic and larval periods) at approximately 131 haf (at 24 ± 1°C). The new larvae were about 3.9–5.8 mm in length with distinct fin rays and pigmentation on the head, body and fins. Basic data from this study can be used in forthcoming investigations on the reproduction processes, breeding, behaviour and conservation of E. shirini . Fish development comprises an integrated, ordered and well‐mapped sequence of early life‐history events controlled by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Knowledge of fish developmental stages during embryogenesis/ontogeny is essential for a better understanding of their biology, breeding criteria, phylogenetic relationships, dietary requirements, conservation plans, environmental requirements and ecological preferences.",

In the case of Rhopalura ophiocomae , which lives in the brittle star Amphipholis squamata , the plasmodia occupying the perivisceral coelom are closely associated with the walls of the genital bursae or the gut, and they are covered by peritoneum. They have been reported to contain scattered small nuclei distinct from those within germinal cells, embryos, and adults, but the results of the present study indicate that such nuclei probably do not exist. Furthermore, electron micrographs show that some plasmodia are in continuity with the cytoplasm of contractile cells that lie beneath the peritoneum of a genital bursa or the gut of the host. The matrix of a plasmodium of R. ophiocomae appears, therefore, to consist of cytoplasm of a contractile cell. It is proposed that after a contractile cell has been entered by an infective cell of the parasite, it hypertrophies, bulging progressively farther into the perivisceral coelom and lifting up the peritoneum, which remains in intimate contact with it.",

An accessory line is present above and below the peduncular canal. The presence of both canals and accessory lines on the peduncle suggests that the peduncle in this species has important sensory functions. No canals are found in the three‐spined stickleback. Instead, replacement lines corresponding to the canals can be identified on the head. Accordingly, the lateral‐line system of the three‐spined and the nine‐spined stickleback has a different structure.

Four morphologically different cone types were observed: unequal double cones, short single cones, long single cones and triple cones. The cones are arranged in a square pattern (four double cones around a central short single cone) in the ventral and ventrotemporal and in a row pattern in the nasal and dorsal areas of the retina. Moreover, intermediate patterns can be observed in several regions indicating that double cone twisting occurs, i.e. double cones twist about their longitudinal axis. The highest cone densities are found in the ventrotemporal area. Conversely, the rod photoreceptor density is the highest in the dorsal retina. While the basic morphology of the retina is the same in both subspecies, the distribution of long single and triple cones differs between the studied animals. While these cone types are very rare in the pollan, they are common in the gangfish, though not exhibiting a regular pattern. The findings are discussed with regard to the photic habitat conditions, the systematic position of coregonids and variation of retinal morphology in the two subspecies.",

Also the fine structure varies considerably from one animal to the next. The cell surface sometimes indicates a strong pinocytotic activity with many coated pits and vesicles. In other cases there are many small vesicles which are interpreted as exocytotic. They are found both in the cytoplasm close to the plasma membrane and in the haemocoelic fluid. Subchordal cells with no pronounced surface activity have a large amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum, which suggests that they synthesize proteins. The presence of subchordal cells in the tail is correlated with the presence of the ontogenetically related bioluminescent oral gland cells in the pharynx; either both types exist simultaneously or both are lacking. It is speculated that the two cell types are also functionally co‐ordinated.

The diameters of the microfibrils (10–13 nm) of the oxytalan, elaunin and elastic fibres of lampreys and hagfish are the same as those of higher vertebrates. The connective tissue immediately dorsal and ventral to the notochord of lampreys contains mainly oxytalan fibres in very young ammocoetes, a combination of oxytalan, elaunin and elastic fibres in older ammocoetes, and predominantly elastic fibres in adult lampreys. While the region of the endomeninx at the base of the spinal cord contains almost exclusively oxytalan fibres in young ammocoetes, it also possesses numerous elastic fibres in adult lampreys.

Only Brachycera are able to attain this posture. The forward turn of the coxa at this position is hindered by the junction of the coxa with the pleuron. Recovery of mobility is gained in two ways. (1) By reduction of the contact zone between coxa and pleurite, as in Asiloidea, Bombyloidea, and Empidoidea. Within these flies, the streamlined posture was recorded in Bombyliidae and in a robber‐fly, Laphria flava . Others fly with their middle legs straddled laterally or trailing backwards. (2) Longitudinal splitting of the coxa into three coxites provides intracoxal mobility in most Tabanoidea and Cyclorrhapha. The hind and medial coxites rotate about the front coxite and change the coxo‐trochanteral axis, thus compensating for restricted protraction. Separation of the hind coxite appears in primitive Tabanoidea, and a separate middle coxite was found in several families among the Nematocera. The streamlined posture was recorded in horse‐flies, stratiomyids, and in many Cyclorrhapha except Micropezidae and Hippoboscidae. There is morphological evidence for a possible secondary fusion of coxites at least in Dolichopodidae and Opetidae as well as for the origin of Cyclorrhapha from a miniature ancestor.",

The greatest concentration of inclusions in adipocytes was found in the nephric fold of G. australis . While some iron is present in the cytoplasmic matrix as ferritin, the majority is seen in large ammocoetes in membrane‐bound dense aggregations of haemosiderin. The wide variety of inclusion types seen in smaller larvae may reflect on the method of formation of these inclusions within the cell. Because of the high level of iron loading in the larval lamprey nephric fold, this readily accessible tissue may provide a valuable model for studies of iron metabolism in vertebrates.",

In the gymnolaemate bryozoans generally, whether uniserial or multiserial, the longitudinal zooid walls are exterior, the transverse (proximal and distal) zooid walls interior ones. The radiating zooid rows grow apically to form \"tubes\" each surrounded by exterior walls but subdivided by interior (transverse) walls. The stenolaemate bryozoans show a contrasting mode of growth in which the colony swells in the distal direction to form one confluent cavity surrounded by an exterior wall but internally subdivided into zooids by interior walls. In the otherwise typical gymnolaemate Parasmittina trispinosa the growing edge is composed of a series of \"giant buds\" each surrounded by exterior walls on its lateral, frontal, basal and distal sides and forming an undifferentiated chamber usually 2–3 times as broad and 3 or more times as long as the final zooid. Its lumen is subdivided by interior walls into zooids 2–3, occasionally 4, in breadth. This type of zooid formation is therefore similar to the \"common bud\" or, better-named, \"multizooidal budding\" characteristic of the stenoleamates but has certainly evolved independently as a special modification of the usual gymnolaemate budding.",

During differentiation of the spermatids, the Golgi complex is associated with formation of the acrosomal vesicle near the posterior pole of the cell. A remarkable feature is the dual origin of the subacrosomal material: one component originates at the posterior end of the spermatid, and the other at the anterior end. Subsequently, the two components merge into one after the acrosomal vesicle has migrated to its definitive anterior position in the mature spermatozoon.",

Sertoli cells within the lobules appear not to be involved in SH‐secretion; they phagocytize spermatozoa which have not been discharged. In the residual stage SH‐secreting cells, as well as Sertoli cells, are degenerated. The tissue is composed of undifferentiated fibrocytic cells, probably derived from smooth muscle cells and/or SH‐secreting cells, of solid cell cords representing the formerly open ductuli efferentes and of primordial germ cells ensheathed by follicle cells.

The setae are composed of a number of cylindrical channels (mean= 877). The number of channels is less than one third of the number of spines on the distal swollen part of the setae. In the proximal shaft, channels are hollow and cylindrical. Towards the expanded distal part of the setae, the lumen gradually disappears, and the shape of the wall of the channels changes from circular to hexagonal. With no lumen, the term microrod is suggested as more descriptive than ‘channel’ for the units in this part of the seta. The solid microrods change from a strictly hexagonal shape to a more irregular indented shape, and gradually taper off towards the tip region. The cortical layer of the expanded part contains numerous irregular cavities. Morphometric data on the organization of the internal components are presented. When tested for flexibility, the setae broke when bent to a mean of 93.6° (±9°). Calculations based on morphometry show that the bending stiffness is up to 19 times greater in the swollen part than in the shaft, and it is reduced to about 1/50 in the distal whip.",

We tested this new proposal experimentally by destroying the coelomic canals along the proximal halves of all ten arms of a feather star and then inducing it to swim. The wave form of the swimming arms was recorded on cine film for frame analysis. While the animal was swimming even the arm regions without coelomic canals were able to extend vigorously. Therefore, hydraulic pressure in the coeloms is not required for arm extension in feather stars. Our results are consistent with the classical idea that elastic ligaments extend the arms of crinoids.",

In common with other invertebrates two broad classes of granule were present. The first appears to be proteinaceous, with a high sulphur content. This type contained copper and iron and was found in the stomach, kidney, pore cells, and rectum. The second type was inorganic and mineralized, containing phosphorus. They contained calcium, zinc and manganese, and were observed in the kidney and digestive gland.

The lateral site of communication shows a complex set of connections between the seminal receptacle and the oviducts (via the egg‐laying ducts).

Arterial and venous morphology was found to be as reported in previous works, but the presence in the eel of a venous system that does not confom to the generalised teleost plan necessitated the use of a non-standard nomenclature. The gills are the site of the connection of the arterial system with a second vascular system and it is suggested that this system should be termed the veno-lymphatic system. The veno-lymphatic system connects dorsally to the systemic lymphatic system and so to the internal jugular vein. Ventrally the veno-lymphatic vessels from the first three gill arches are collected into a connective tissue sheath around the ventral aorta. The sheath is connected to a veno-lymphatic sinus posterior to it which also collects the veno-lymphatic of the fourth gill arch. This sinus then drains into the external jugular vein which at this point is the fusion of the left and right branches. These later separate and each branch contains a valve preventing flow towards the ventral aortic sheath. It is proposed that because of the form of this ventral route for veno-lymphatic drainage, and the ease and completeness of filling of this route compared with the dorsal route, that the ventral veno-lymphatic system is probably the primary route of drainage of veno-lymphatic outflow from the gills.",

A fine structural analysis was made of material fixed in either glutaraldehyde alone, or in glutaralde-hyde followed by post-fixation in osmic acid. Special attention was paid to the reproductive organs. Nuclear inclusion bodies characteristic of lead poisoning were found within the tubular epithelium of the kidney, within hepatocytes, the germinal epithelium of the male and follicle cells of the ovaries. The possibility that lead might bind to acidic nuclear proteins which influence specific gene regulation is suggested.",

The gonadotrops undergo a gradual degranulation and become devoid of stainable cytoplasm by 90 days. No signet ring cells have been noticed at any stage. The cyanophils in the ventral region of the PPD, identified as thyrotrops, also show degranulation, but to a comparatively limited degree. The ACTH cells undergo gradual hypertrophy and degranulation. A progressive increase is noticed in the nuclear diameter.

It is suggested that a fall in gonadal steroids may result in ACTH release which in turn activates the interrenal cells.",

The results have been compared with those of a number of other mammalian species including carnivores and herbivores. The fibres structure was found to be consistent with that expected for a keratin fibre. From the results of the bound lipid analysis it can be concluded that the Tasmanian devil is a typical mammal in which the 21‐carbon atom anteiso branched fatty acid is the predominant bound fatty acid. This is consistent with the Tasmanian devil's position in the mammalian phylogenetic tree. The amino acid analysis places the devil in line with other carnivores. The high cystine and proline content may correlate with the Tasmanian devil's diet which is rich in muscle and collagen proteins.",

In vitellogenic oocytes, the endoplasmic reticulum components, the nuclear envelope intermembranous space, some Golgi dictiossomes, lysosomes, yolk granules, regions of the egg envelope and sites of the follicle cells react to acid phosphatase detection (AcPase). The cortical alveoli, some heterogeneous cytoplasmic structures, regions of the egg envelope, and sites of the follicle cells are strongly contrasted by osmium tetroxide and zinc iodide impregnation (ZIO). The endoplasmic reticulum components, some vesicles, and sites of the follicle cells also react to osmium tetroxide and potassium iodide impregnation (KI). The biosynthetic pathway of lysosomal proteins, such as acid phosphatase, required for vitellogenesis, involves the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, vesicles with inactive hydrolytic enzymes, and, finally, lysosomes. In S. spilopleura oocytes at secondary growth, the endomembranous system takes part in the production of the enzymes needed for vitellogenesis, and in the metabolism of yolk exogenous components (AcPase detection). The endomembranous system compartments also show reduction capacity (KI reaction) and are involved in the metabolism of proteins rich in SH‐groups (ZIO reaction).",

The reproduction parameters fertility, fecundity, egg volume, larvae size, loss of embryos and number of females with viable eggs/larvae were evaluated. Females presenting carapace length of 12–15 mm and spent stage of gonadal development were divided into two groups, one undergoing unilateral eyestalk ablation and the other remaining intact. The specimens were kept in aquarium until ovarian maturation, then brought together with males for mating (proportion of two females for each male). Fecundity and fertility were greater in intact females (1,741 eggs and 1,045 larvae) than in ablated ones (1,373 eggs and 741 larvae). Ablation also reduced the percentage of females with viable eggs (68% intact versus 49% ablated) and larvae (82% intact versus 64% ablated), besides increasing the loss of embryos. Egg volume and shape (ellipsoid) and larvae size were similar, as was the duration of embryonic development. The results of this study suggest that, although ablated females exhibit a high rate of survival, their reproductive performance is reduced; therefore, the ablation technique is not recommended in M. acanthurus farming, so as to protect the animals from physiological stress.",

Female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair of lateral oviducts, a common oviduct, spermathecae and a genital chamber. The ovary has 18 meroistic telotrophic ovariole. Each ovariole is divided into four regions: terminal filament, germarium, vitellarium and pedicel. Terminal filament is a long tubular structure. Germarium contains trophocytes (nurse cells), young oocytes and prefollicular cells. Vitellarium consists differentiating oogenic stages including developmental periods of previtellogenesis, vitellogenesis and choriogenesis. The ovarioles open into lateral oviduct by pedicel. The single spermatheca is located near the base of the common oviduct. Spermathecae consist of spermathecae reservoir for sperm storage and a short spermathecae duct. C. herbacea eggs are yellow and elongated. The structure of female reproductive system, the egg chorion and larva of C. herbacea are important to understand the outbreak of this insect pest and to biological control this harmful species.",

The particular nanoscale substructure of these chitinous bristles resembles photonic crystals and manipulates the incident light in a way that results in spectacular structural coloration. Even though Aphrodita's chaetae have garnered great attention from the field of biomimetics, the few previous ultrastructural studies primarily focused on acicular chaetae that are much less iridescent than the thin capillary notochaetae. In this paper, we present new ultrastructural data on the chaetae of two species of Aphrodita and illustrate their formation process. Our results allow us to specify the prerequisite for iridescent chaetae. Aphrodita species are dorsally covered with a matted felt of intertwined chaetae, and we further discuss the evolution of feltage chaetae in Aphroditiformia. In addition to iridescent feltage chaetae, we also provide new insights into the chaeotogenesis of pilose chaetae. For the first time, our study shows that the hairy tips and ornamentation of the chaetae is formed by follicle cells alone and thus attribute a further role to this type of cells.",

Crenulations are a succession of micron-sized elongated ridges and troughs with a general dorsoventral pseudo-labyrinthine pattern that are present on the hinge plate of most pectinoideans. The crenulations of opposing valves are complementary and interpenetrate in a hinge-like fashion. They are also imprinted in the dorsal mantle, although there is evidence that the mantle adheres only at the ridges, but not at the troughs. Those mantle areas that secrete the ridges contain cells that are richer in structures, indicating an active metabolism than those facing the troughs. Crenulations are formed because the dorsal mantle expands allometrically along the anteroposterior direction. The excess length is accommodated by creasing. Crenulations initiate at the anterior and posterior ends of the hinge plate as shallow spheruliths, which increase in height with time until the mantle on both sides detaches from the shell areas forming the neighbouring troughs. A contact differentiation of the mantle into actively and passively secreting bands follows. This genetic model explains the general pattern as well as the changes in the morphology of crenulations that occur during growth. Crenulations are secondary postlarval structures unrelated to the provinculum. Their presence in the earliest pectinoideans makes crenulations a plesiomorphic character of the group.",

Differences between the three species relate to shape and size, the morphology of the filter region and the number of microvilli and cilia inside the terminal organ. A comparison across Rotifera indicates that the terminal organs in D . forcipatus display a number of plesiomorphic characters, but are modified in E . mucronatum and Er . clastopis . This is in accordance with the results of phylogenetic analyses suggesting a basal position of D . forcipatus compared with the more derived species E . mucronatum and Er . clastopis . Moreover, we survey available data on the terminal organ in Rotifera and discuss its evolutionary transformations. The protonephridial terminal organ in the common ancestor of Rotifera consisted of a cytoplasmic cylinder with cilia united into a vibratile flame and a single circle of circumciliary microvilli. Depending on the topology on which characters are optimized, the site of ultrafiltration was formed by longitudinal cytoplasmic columns spanned by a fine filter diaphragm or by pores in the wall of the terminal organ. In several taxa of Rotifera, the terminal organ – probably independently – lost its circumciliary microvilli.",

Elga chose placoderms and psammosteid heterostracans as main research objects. Valentina also began with whole fish, antiarch placoderms, but then chose fish microfossils with W. Gross as mentor and discovered the oldest chondrichthyans. Both work as palaeobiologists understanding the implications of their fossils for functional interpretation and palaeogeography; their main contribution is in biostratigraphy (over 50% of their publications). In 1976 Elga organized the 1st Middle Palaeozoic Fossil Fish Symposium in Tallinn.

A prime inference on genetic diversity (RAPDs) in the marine fish Atherinella brasiliensis (Teleostei, Atherinopsidae) from Southern Brazil. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 242–248 As a result of the importance of Atherinella brasiliensis in estuarine environments, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to verify the genetic diversity in A. brasiliensis from two different places in Paranaguá Bay (Paraná State) and one from the Conceição Lagoon (Santa Catarina State). Cytogenetic data have shown a high karyotypic diversity in some populations, although in others this peculiarity demonstrates rearrangements such as heterochromatinization. In the present study, a low level of genetic structuring between the samples from Conceição Lagoon compared with the others was observed through principal coordinate analysis (PCO), analysis of molecular variance and Mantel test according to 79 RAPD markers. As this specie does not perform horizontal migration and the individuals of Conceição Lagoon are isolated, three hypotheses are proposed to explain the results: (i) similar environments may show homogeneous populations not depending on the geographical distance, (ii) because vicariant events that formed the bays occurred in a recent period, the fragmentation effects over the structuring of the genetic diversity may still be low and not totally detectable by the RAPD technique and (iii) the isolation time or the number of generations may not be enough to promote a possible differentiation and genetic structuring between the specimens of these three places. The specimens of these places present a low level of differentiation and genetic structuring so we can consider them as a unique homogeneous population.",

The phallus of O. canicollis is intromittent, with a blind tubular cavity and two distinct regions when erect: the base of the phallus, which shows the mucosa smooth and lined by a pseudostratified columnar epithelium, and the tubular portion, which shows the mucosa lined by a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium with little knobs. The phallus includes two vascular bodies at the cranial portion in the urodeum. A fibrocartilaginous body anchors the tubular portion therefrom up to the eversible portion. A branched elastic ligament inserts on different regions of the tubular portion. The phallus is plesiomorphic in birds and it has disappeared in Megapodius , Leipoa and Neoaves. The asymmetric phallus evolved early and it was retained in the basal branches of birds. The intromittent phallus is plesiomorphic in birds (found in Archosauria's ancestor), but Crypturellus , Numididae, Odontophoridae and Phasianidae have developed a non‐intromittent phallus a posteriori. The blind tubular cavity and the fibrocartilaginous body evolved as an adaptive convergence many times in birds. Therefore, this study shed some light on morphological aspects of the phallus and contributed to understand its evolution in birds.",

The AEP is a micro‐region of the regenerating epidermis located at the tail tip of the blastema, likely corresponding to the AEC of the amphibian blastema. No immunolabelling is present in the wound epidermis and scarring blastema of the limb at 18–21 days of regeneration, except for sparse repairing muscles. The presence of a proximal–distal gradient of Msx1‐2 protein, generated from the apical ependyma, is suggested by the intensity of immunolabelling. The AEP and the ependyma are believed to induce and maintain tail regeneration, and this study suggests that Msx1‐2 proteins are components of the signalling system that maintains active growth of the tail blastema. The lack of activation and production of Msx1‐2 protein in the limb are likely due to the intense inflammatory reaction following amputation. This study confirms that, like during regeneration in fishes and amphibians, also the blastema of lizards utilizes common signalling pathways for maintaining regeneration.",

An autapomorphy of all phasmids is the paired prothoracic exocrine defence glands. In this study, the anatomy and innervation of the defence glands in Timema petita and Timema chumash are described and compared with the data on Euphasmatodea. In all phasmids, the glands consist of a cuticular epithelium, a secretory epithelium and muscular fibres that compress the lumen. In Timematodea, the muscular part of the gland is less developed than in Euphasmatodea and the ejection of the defence secretion depends on the dorsal longitudinal neck muscles. On the neuroanatomical level, Timema petita and Timema chumash lack neurons that are involved in the independent contraction of the gland in euphasmids. In both studied species of Timema , neck muscles play an active role in the gland function which is not observed in any other phasmid. Considering the basal position of this genus, this supports the hypothesis that in euphasmids, the muscular part of the gland evolved from the dorsal longitudinal neck muscles. Additionally, the same nerves that innervate the dorsal longitudinal neck muscles in all Polyneoptera also innervate the defence glands in phasmids.",

Allometry of metapodial and digit lengths in the manus and pes of the primitively padless gekkotan ( Eublepharis macularius ) is explored using maximum‐likelihood repeated‐measures ANCOVA s with body length as the covariate. Estimated variance–covariance matrices differed significantly within and between autopodia, and integration was stronger among the metapodials than the digits. The first metapodial and the first digit of each autopodium exhibit the strongest covariances with each of the remaining components in each variance–covariance matrix, suggesting that the lengths of the first rays are important for allometric integration of both manus and pes. Metapodials scale isometrically and digits negatively allometrically; both display allometric heterogeneity among themselves in both autopodia. Both autopodia exhibit changes in proportion over the ontogenetic size range, attributable to variation in scaling among the components of the rays. Allometric coefficients do not vary among pedal digits, despite differences in phalanx number, although phalanx number is associated with differences in slope in the manual digits. This is suggestive of heterogeneity in allometry among the manual phalanges, which thus may be associated with variation in phalanx length within gekkotan digits.",

One of the most studied genera of squamates, Sceloporus , is widely distributed along a latitudinal and elevational gradient in temperate, tropical, low‐elevation and high‐elevation habitats. Due to this wide distribution and varying habitats, Sceloporus exhibit differences in their spermatogenic activity (including both cyclical and acyclical patterns) and may be one of the most useful genera for understanding the abiotic correlations with spermatogenesis. The spermatogenic activity in Sceloporus variabilis was studied histologically (in a population that inhabits a tropical region at Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico) and found to exhibit a unique cyclical pattern with an extended period of maximum activity (from November to July) and the absence of regression and quiescence. Furthermore, these data corroborate previous works on the spermatogenic cycles of S . variabilis despite different populations utilised. These data suggest that although abiotic factors may play a role in the timing of spermatogenesis, phylogenetic signal may be equally as important. More data concerning spermatogenic cycles in phylogenetically related taxa from differing habitats will elucidate the patterns of spermatogenic diversity.",

The pseudobranchial neurosecretory system associated with carotid labyrinth (CL) is one such example. CL – a chemosensory organ is well known in amphibians. The homologous structure also exists in fish. Clusters of neurosecretory cells, close to the CL and the first two efferent branchial arteries occur in catfish and a few other groups of teleosts. These cells belong to the pseudobranchial neurosecretory system ( PNS ). To reveal the ultrastructure of CL and the pseudobranchial neurosecretory cells ( PNSC s), environmental scanning electron microscope ( ESEM ) and transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) investigations were made in an Asian air‐breathing catfish Clarias batrachus . Under ESEM, the PNS appeared as a mass of cells innervated by nerves and supplied by blood capillaries. The CL appeared to have a network of blood capillaries. The transmission electron microscopic investigations showed pear shaped PNSC s having different sizes of dense cored vesicles ( DCV s), numerous mitochondria, nerve varicosities, indicating a secretory function of the cells. The CL shows a close association with PNSC s and smooth muscles. Although the exact function of the CL and associated PNSC s in the biology of fish is far from clear, their morphology suggests they are involved in a stress response such as to hypoxia.",

Surprisingly, little is known about intraspecific variation in sperm morphology. We analysed within‐ and between‐male variation in mature sperm traits in two brackish water populations of the pipefish Syngnathus abaster. Four morphometric parameters, such as the width and length of the head (including nucleus, and midpiece), length of flagellum and total sperm length were taken into account. The differences in all morphometric parameters analysed between populations were not statistically significant. Moreover, the multidimensional scaling analysis shows that (i) the two populations seem to be indistinguishable based on their spermatozoa and (ii) there is not polymorphism, being sperm not distinguishable into discrete classes both within a single male and between males of each populations. The latter datum does not seem to support the presence of polymorphic sperm in syngnathids. Both populations, however, exhibit a high variation in all sperm traits, both among individual sperm within an ejaculate and among males within each population. The relationship between sperm traits variability and the low selection pressure determined by the absence of postcopulatory sexual selection (i.e. absence of sperm competition) is discussed.",

Small (0.1 μm diameter), primary proacrosomal vesicles produced in spermatocytes give rise to much larger (0.4 μm diameter) secondary proacrosomal vesicles in early spermatids, which in turn form the dished‐shaped, definitive acrosomal vesicle (diameter 1.0 μm) of later spermatids. The acrosomal vesicle acquires a deposit of subacrosomal material and comes to lie close to or in contact with the plasma membrane. The acrosomal complex (acrosomal vesicle + subacrosomal material) initially positions itself at the apex of the condensing, fibrous nucleus (the so‐called temporary acrosome position), but subsequently begins to move posteriorly. The condensing nucleus becomes markedly folded so that its apex is posteriorly orientated towards the migrating acrosomal complex and the midpiece (mitochondria and centrioles). The close spatial relationship of nuclear apex to acrosomal complex during this folding strongly suggests that acrosomal migration in M . anomioides is assisted, at least in part, by movement of the late spermatid nucleus. Similar nuclear folding has previously been demonstrated in an early stage of fertilization in another anomalodesmatan ( L aternula limicola ) raising the possibility that one event might be a reversal of the other.",

The corneous layer of soft‐shelled turtles derives from the accumulation of higher ratio of alpha‐keratins versus beta‐proteins as indicated by gene expression, microscopic, immunocytochemical and Western blotting analysis. Type I and II beta‐proteins of 14–16 kDa, indicated as Tu2 and Tu17, accumulate in the thick and hard corneous layer of the hard‐shelled turtle, but only type II is present in the thinner corneous layer of the soft‐shelled turtle. The presence of proline–proline and proline–cysteine–hinge dipeptides in the beta‐sheet region of all type II beta‐proteins so far isolated from the epidermis of soft‐shelled turtles might impede the formation of beta‐filaments and of the hard corneous material. Western blot analysis suggests that beta‐proteins are low to absent in the corneous layer. The ultrastructural immunolocalization of Tu2 and Tu17 beta‐proteins shows indeed that a diffuse labelling is seen among the numerous alpha‐keratin filaments present in the precorneous and corneous layers of the soft epidermis and that no dense corneous material is formed. Double‐labelling experiments confirm that alpha‐keratin prevails on beta‐proteins. The present observations support the hypothesis that the soft material detected in soft‐shelled turtles derives from the prevalent activation of genes producing type II beta‐proteins and high levels of alpha‐keratins.",

Microvilli are greatly reduced at mid‐pregnancy, and the uterus differentiates into two structurally distinct regions: the chorioallantoic and the omphaloplacenta. At late stages of pregnancy, the uterine epithelium of chorioallantoic placenta in both species is further ridged, forming a knobbly uterine surface. The ultrastructural evidence between N . metallicus and N . ocellatus cannot strictly account for the distinct differences in their placentotrophy; as yet unexplored molecular nutrient transport mechanisms that are not reflected in uterine ultrastructure must play significant roles in nutrient transportation. Characteristics consistent with a plasma membrane transformation were confirmed in both species.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the structure of the male reproductive system in Ichthyophis supachaii . The testis comprises a series of mulberry‐like lobes, each of which contains testis lobules occupied by germ cysts. A single cyst consists of synchronously developing germ cells. Six spermatogenic cell types, viz. primary spermatogonia, secondary spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa, have been identified and described. Notably, the testis of I. supachaii encompasses specific organization patterns of spermatids and spermatozoa during spermiogenesis. Spermiating cysts rupture and release spermatozoa to the collecting ducts, which are subsequently transported to the sperm duct, Wolffian duct and cloaca. We report for the first time ciliated cells in the epithelium of the caecilian Wolffian duct. The cloaca is divided into the urodeum and phallodeum. The urodeum has ciliated and glandular epithelia at its dorsolateral and ventral regions, respectively, as the lining of its internal surface. The muscular phallodeum is lined by ciliated epithelium. Paired Mullerian ducts lie parallel to the intestine and join the cloaca. The posterior portion of the duct is modified as the Mullerian gland. The most posterior region is non‐glandular and lined by ciliated epithelium. Our findings contribute further to information on the reproductive biology of caecilians in Thailand.",

Cytogenetic and morphometric studies were performed in populations of Astyanax aff. fasciatus originating from Paranaíba river and São João river, both from the hydrographic basin of Paranaíba river. Fish originating from a third place at the Mogi‐Guaçu river (Tietê river's basin) and with 2 n = 46 chromosomes also went through morphometric analysis. The morphologic data evidenced the populational structuring, following the geographical distribution of the subjects. Cytogenetic data disclosed the same diploid number and karyotype formula for both populations. The other cytogenetic markers comply with the literature. These data show that the two populations of A. aff. fasciatus do not differ among themselves concerning the chromosomal structure, but they structure themselves regarding morphometry. Aspects of evolution of the group are discussed facing this study.",

A database search indicates that the enzyme shares common sequences in numerous mammalian species so that an antibody against the human sulfhydryl oxidase 2 has been utilized on other species. The immunofluorescent study on the epidermis of the platypus (monotreme), red kangaroo (marsupials), hamster and human (placentals) reveals a prevalent labelling in the granular, transitional and lowermost part of the stratum corneous layer. The detailed ultrastructural immunogold study of the human epidermis reveals a diffuse and uneven labelling in the paler component of the composite keratohyalin granules or among keratin filaments of the transitional layer while the labelling disappears in the corneous layer. The study supports the hypothesis of the participation of the enzyme in the oxidative process that determines the formation of stable disulphide groups among keratins and other corneous proteins of the stratum corneum. This process gives rise to the resistant cell corneous envelope of keratinocytes in addition to the isopeptide bonds that derive from the catalytic action of epidermal transglutaminase on several corneous proteins.",

Proliferating cells are present in developing cartilaginous femur and tibia, especially in the epiphyses where a higher cell multiplication likely determines their typical enlarged shape in comparison with the diaphyses where chondroblast proliferation is low to absent. Sparse 5BrdU‐labelled cells remain in the articular and growth plate cartilages of the epiphyses in older stages of development and are still detected in developing epiphyses 13 days after injection of 5BrdU. This indicates they are slow‐cycling cells, a typical characteristic for progenitor or stem cells. Long retaining 5BrdU‐labelled cells remain in the articular surface also during adult life where they likely sustain the growth of long bones. Adult epiphyses show secondary ossification centres where the articular cartilage is partially or largely replaced by bone trabeculae. The damage in the epiphysis of lizards stimulates the proliferation of progenitor cells for the regeneration of new cartilaginous epiphyses. The localization of cells capable of proliferation in the epiphyses of adult femur and tibia pre‐adapts these lizards to cartilage regeneration in case of injury.",

The spotted hyenas took over the niche of European hyenas with their appearance in warm and cold periods. Those used more and more cave entrances as dens between Spain and Siberia.

We counted parietal and squamosal horns and used phylogenetic analysis to reconstruct the plesiomorphic horn numbers for these bones. Based upon this, we propose and test hypotheses of evolutionary homology for these asperities and conclude the following: (1) a plesiomorphic horn array is retained among the species of Phrynosoma ; the horns are paramorphs, each identifiable as an evolutionary homologue; (2) an autapomorphic additional pair of parietal horns in P. solare has been recruited from a pair of tubercles associated with the plesiomorphic parietal horns; (3) an additional anterior squamosal horn in P. solare and the Brevicauda species is derived from a tubercle recruited homoplasiously in these taxa; (4) the anteriormost squamosal horn of the plesiomorphic series in the species of the coronatum species group is highly reduced and is subsumed within the posteriormost jugal asperity and (5) an apparent additional squamosal horn exhibited by P. ditmarsi and P. modestum is instead an enlarged submarginal tubercle, a homoplasy for these species.",

Accessory glands open into the lumen of the external common sperm duct (= external vas deferens). The gland cells contain abundant endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies and secretory bodies, and have elongate necks that pierce the apical cytoplasm of the duct. Cell contact with the apical cytoplasm of the sperm duct is mediated by septate desmosomes. Accessory glands secrete spherical particles, with a diameter of approximately 70 nm, that adhere to spermatozoa. The roles of these accessory glands may relate to activity of the sperm or development of the female system after insemination. Paired sperm ducts arise from testes, and unite to form a common sperm duct. Each duct consists of a tubular anucleate cytoplasmic region which is supported by nucleated cytons that lie sunken in the parenchyma. The apical cytoplasm of the paired sperm ducts (= vasa efferentia) possesses apical microvilli and abundant mitochondria, but few other cytoplasmic features. The apical cytoplasm of the common sperm duct possesses sparse apical microvilli and numerous electronlucent vesicles. The male gonoducts form an elongate syncytium which is markedly polarized along the length of the ducts. The ducts also display apical–basal polarity in that sunken nucleated cytons support the apical cytoplasm which in turn has distinct basal and apical domains.",

One view holds it to be either of two interorbital bones that together surround the foramen neuroepiphysium (and the so‐called pineal plates); another, that it is each of the two mesial bones which comes next in order, behind the orbital cavities. Both of these views are untenable because neither of the proposed bones has proved to be amenable to conversion to the parietal bone of man. In seeking a solution to this issue thoughts turn to the tentorium cerebelli, whose topographic relationships and comparative morphology place it in the key position as a plausible derivative of the posterior half of the cranium of the tetrapod forerunners. Following this line of reasoning, it can be suggested that the tentorial exoskeleton, here called the pluteal bones, originally was situated in the dermis superjacent to the synotic tectum. In early therian phylogeny, these skull bones were covered by the backwardly expanding cerebral hemispheres which, concomitantly, became overgrown and thus protected by epiotic exoskeleton. It follows that the likely homologues of the human parietal bones are those parts of the skull roof of the piscine progenitors of the tetrapods that lie dorsolateral to the otic capsules.",

We have suggested earlier that a localized epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (= transdifferentialion) of the epicardial mesothelium might explain the origin of the subepicardial mesenchymal cells (SEMC) in a primitive vertebrate, the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula . We have tested our hypothesis through the immunolocalization, in the embryonic dogfish heart, of three proteins involved in the epithelial—mesenchymal transitions. Fibronectin immunoreactivity (FN‐IR) was present between epicardium and myocardium from the earliest stages of the epicardial development. However, in embryos ranging between 20 and 35 mm TL, FN‐IR disappeared from the basal surface of the epicardial cells at the atrioventricular and conoventricular grooves and increased in association with the SEMC. Proliferating‐cell nuclear antigen immunoreactivity was intense in most epicardial cells and SEMC in these areas and developmental stages, but it declined in later embryos. The JB3 antigen, a fibrillin‐related protein, was delected in the cytoplasm and basal surface of the epicardial cells, as well as on the SEMC surface. These immunohistochemical patterns were remarkably similar at the subepicardium and at the endocardial cushions, which are populated by mesenchymal cells derived from the transdifferentiation of the endocardium. © 1998 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

    "abstract": "Abstract The ultrastructure of the calcareous skeleton is described in twenty–one species of recent tubuliporine cyclostome bryozoans, using field emission SEM. The succession of skeletal fabrics in interior walls may be classified into four different fabric suites. The first–formed part of the calcitic skeleton in all species for which it has been observed is a precursory fabric of tiny, wedge–shaped crystallites. This is succeeded in about half of the species studied by a fabric of transverse fibres, followed by foliated fabric and often semi–nacre (fabric suite 1). Most of the remaining species lack transverse fibres and have interior walls largely comprising semi–nacre (fabric suite 2). A few species have skeletons consisting of predominantly distally–oriented, irregularly or regularly foliated fabric (fabric suite 3). A single species has a skeleton of proximally–oriented foliated fabric (fabric suite 4). Basal exterior walls in all species have a precursory fabric of tiny wedge–shaped crystallites without a strong preferred orientation, deposited directly upon the organic cuticle, followed by a layer of planar spherulitic structure, which in turn is succeeded by a similar fabric to that developed in the interior wall of the species concerned. Outermost layers of frontal exterior walls exhibit one of the following combinations of three fabrics: an outer layer of (1) finely granular or wedge–shaped crystallites; a thin dense granular layer followed by (2) distally accreting planar spherulitic fabric., or (3) obliquely accreting planar spherulitic fabric growing partly towards the midline of the frontal wall. Terminal diaphragms usually have outer layers dominated by planar spherulitic ultrastructure with centripetal growth directions. The fabric suites present in tubuliporines encompass most known fabrics found in the other cyclostome suborders and support the notion that this species–rich suborder occupies a central position in cyclostome evolution.",

The pineal of the epigean form is relatively small but ultrastructurally well differentiated and characterized as a metabolically active, photoneuroendocrine organ. The outer segments of the sensory cells are composed of 32–55 very regularly arranged sacculi which are obviously functioning in photoreception. Furthermore, the presence of electron‐dense vesicles, free ribosomes, conspicuously well‐developed Golgi bodies, and large amounts of rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm provide evidence for a secretory activity of the sensory cells. The only regressive traits in the pineal of the cave form regard the outer segments: there are few disintegrated, whorl‐like outer segments and the number of sacculi exhibits an increased variability. Compared with other morphological structures dependent on light, for example the eyes, the degree of regression is very low. It is suggested that this is due to a remaining secretory role of the sensory cells, which prevents the functionless, photoreceptive outer segments from rapid degeneration by developmental constraints.",

It was also shown that spermatogenesis continued during re‐feeding, since prospermia (elongated spermatids) were deposited in the seminal vesicle. A potent male seeks a receptive female on the host for copulation. The movement of males to different attachment sites occurred between the third and fourth day of re‐feeding, and completely re‐fed males (for 4 days) were able to copulate successfully. Spermatogenic cells, ranging from spermatogonia at the anterior end to prospermia at the posterior end, were found in fed males. Degeneration of spermatocytes at the great growth phase and developing spermatids prior to final development of prospermia were seen in virgin males without re‐feeding after the first meal. Fully elongated spermatids (prospermia) appeared morphologically normal up to 10 days after the first feeding. Degeneration of spermatocytes and developing spermatids occurred from the second day and was almost complete by the fourth day. The degenerating cells shrank, became electron‐dense, and finally died. A reduction in secretions of the four lobes of the accessory glands occurred during the 10 days after feeding.",

Both adults and nymphs utilise a stridulation produced within the head capsule. Observation and simple experiment reveal that this sound is produced in conjunction with the passage of air into the buccal cavity. There are large trachea beneath the frons which may be associated as amplifiers of these noises. The hind wings of the adults have small downward projecting spines set in open membranous areas of the wings. When the insect is excited, these spines engage a highly specialised area of the cuticle on the dorsal terga. The production of the noise requires only slight movement of the abdomen. Its role in defense is discussed.",

From neural sensilla protrude S hairs (cilia from uniciliate cells) which are thought to detect water currents. Two categories of multiciliate cell, of unknown function, are also present within neural sensilla; (i) grouped cilia extending beyond the cuticle (G hairs), and (ii) cilia which radiate out beneath the cuticle. Studies of the entire external surface of leech body wall with a scanning electron microscope revealed the presence of large numbers of sensilla on every annulus including the neural annuli. These sensilla lack S hairs. Our results show: (i) annular sensilla have a significantly smaller surface area than neural sensilla ( p &lt; 0.001 Mann‐Whitney test, 2 tailed), (ii) The position and number of the small sensilla varies from annulus to annulus, segment to segment and individual to individual, (iii) Significantly higher numbers of small sensilla were found where non‐neural annuli remain single and have not undergone a further division during development as happens in the quinquannulate segments. The data suggest that small sensilla continue to be added during the adult life of the leech.",

The opposed columns and alternating bars of the two cells are arranged in such a way that they form an obviously rigid, cylindrical structure which both supports and gives rise to the thin‐walled weir. The fenestration of the weir consists of a single, enormously extended and sinuous cleft which represents part of the boundary between the two terminal cells. The ciliary flame comprises 92–118 cilia that originate basally in the two cells and is surrounded by a palisade of long, straight microvilli, positioned immediately within the weir's wall. The structure is very similar to that of the terminal organ of the land nemertean Pantinonemertes , except that the cytoskeleton which supports columns and bars consists of a fibro‐granular substance, not, as in Pantinonemertes , of an abundance of oriented microtubules.",

In females, femur calcium and fat levels increased by 80 and 30%, respectively, during the spring migration, much of the increase taking place while the birds staged in southwestern Manitoba and North Dakota prior to their departure for the breeding area. In males. femur calcium levels showed no seasonal change but femur fat increased in a manner similar to that found in the females, although the increase was not as great (17%). In the females, femur fat content fell by 40% during egg‐laying whereas in males a decrease in femur lipid was not evident until incubation was well underway. Femur calcium levels in females declined during egg production and early incubation, showing a 56% decrease over spring migratory levels, indicating that dietary calcium intake was limited during the nesting period. However, the low femur calcium levels in birds collected during the spring were not significantly different from those of wintering birds, suggesting that no calcium deficiencies were apparent. Plasma calcium levels in males remained relatively constant throughout the year, although there was some elevation in May. Plasma calcium levels in the females increased almost threefold during egg laying and returned to pre‐laying levels during incubation. Medullary bone was evident only in reproducing females and appeared during spring migration, concomitant with increased femur weight, fat and calcium content. Medullary bone degradation commenced during the first week of incubation and no medullary bone was in evidence by molt. Calcium reserves of medullary bone accounted for only 17.2% of the calcium required for eggshell production, suggesting that. at least during the laying period, the female must depend on some exogenous source, perhaps from grit or brackish water.",

Each crown cell has a bundle of about 20 cilia, surrounded by a labyrinthic weir of cell processes that are presumably involved in filtration. The ciliary bundles enter the nephridial duct through perforations of the adjacent tubule cells. This finding of a protonephridium in a minute, coelomate animal that lacks a circulatory system corroborates a recently formulated functional theory on the distribution of nephridial types.",

Close to the pyloric region, the posterior midgut cells are devoid of microvilli and intranuclear crystals. There is no special pyloric chamber as in Protura or pyloric cuticular ring as in Collembola but a morphological transformation from midgut to hindgut cells. Eight globular Malpighian papillae, consisting of distal microvillated cells and flat proximal cells, open into the gut lumen via ducts formed by hindgut cells. The structure of the hindgut is complicated and can be divided into three segments. The anterior hindgut cells have an irregular shape and compact cytoplasm. A striking interdigitation between the large bottle‐shaped epithelial cells and longitudinal muscle cells occurs in the middle segment of the hindgut. The thick cuticle gives rise to long spikes projecting into the gut lumen. The posterior hindgut cells possess the morphological features for water reabsorption. Some hypotheses are advanced about the function of the different regions of the gut.",

The anterior subdivision is built up of a relatively uniform, innervated, pseudostratified, ciliated epithelium with mucus cells which are concentrated in the initial parts of the mouth cavity. Cilia and mucus presumably constitute a mechanism transporting food particles into the stomach. In the area of the gill slits specific vacuolated cells occur which may lend rigidity to the walls of the slits. The gastric epithelium consists of prismatic cells characterized by, among others, large inclusion bodies, which may represent digestive vacuoles, small dense rod‐shaped granules and an elaborate system of microridges, at the base of which abundant endocytotic vesicles occur. The dorsal gastric pouch contains cells rich in rough ER and secretory granules, probably containing digestive enzymes. Thus morphological evidence points both to intra‐ and extracellular digestion. The intestinal epithelium resembles that of the stomach, however, it is lower, its organelles are fewer and it bears, beside cilia, mainly microridges, which towards its distal end become sparse. Both in the gastric and intestinal epithelium small granulated cells have been found, which presumably represent endocrine cells.",

At hatching, a pair of free neuromasts and three pairs of neuromast primordia were present on the head, and three pairs of neuromast primordia were present on the trunk. The hair cell polarity of the otic neuromast until just prior to hatching was radial, but not bi‐directional.

The high actin: myosin filament ratio in this fast muscle is likely related to extensive actin‐myosin filament interaction which must occur when tension is increased and maintained by repeated nervous stimulation as demonstrated by Kammer (1967) during the long downstroke of the wingbeat cycle. Glycogen particles are present in the granular fraction of the interfibrillar sacroplasm and among the myofilaments of the flight muscle of young butterflies. The distribution of the granules appears to be related to spatial forces within the muscle fibril for in resting butterflies the intermyofilament particles are generally located in rows parallel to the myofilaments, while they are in transverse bands in the H and I zones of animals fixed immediately after flight. Since the glycogen particles were not depleted during flight, this redistribution does not appear to be related to glycogen metabolism. Glycogen in the flight muscle was depleted during eight days of adulthood in butterflies fed on honey solutions, but lipid reserves increased in the same period.",

B) were investigated in order to describe the microanatomy of the mouth parts and especially jaws of these enigmatic polychaetes. The animals of both studied species have 14–18 mouth tentacles that are about 30 µm in diameter each. In both species, the ventral pharyngeal organ is well developed and situated on the ventral side of the buccal cavity. It is composed of a ventral muscle bulb and investing muscles. The bulb consists of posterior and anterior parts separated by a deep median transversal groove. In both species, the triangular teeth or denticles are arranged in a single transversal row on the surface of the posterior part of the ventral bulb just in front of its posterior edge. There are 36 denticles in Adercodon pleijeli and 50 in Ampharete sp. B. The height of the denticles (6–12 µm) is similar in both species. Each tooth is composed of two main layers. The outer one (dental) is the electron‐dense sclerotized layer that covers the tooth. The inner one consists of long microvilli with a collagen matrix between them. The thickness of the dental layer ranges from 0.95 to 0.6 µm. The jaws of the studied worms may play a certain role in scraping off microfouling. The fine structure of the jaws in Ampharetidae is very similar to that of the mandibles of Dorvilleidae, the mandibles and the maxillae of Lumbrineridae, Eunicidae and Onuphidae, and the jaws of other Aciculata. This type of jaw is characterized by unlimited growth and the absence of replacement. The occurrence of jaws in a few smaller Ampharetidae is considered as an apomorphic state.",

The dorsal sac consists of a single layer of cuboidal ependymal cells which have cilia and very irregularly shaped microvilli. The presence of vesicles in longitudinal rows indicate that these microvilli are very active. Bulbous outpocketenings from the apical surface contain glycogen. These bulgings may be pinched off into the lumen of the third ventricle forming rounded drops which contain richly glycogen. To increase the surface there are protrusions covered with microvilli. In the cytoplasm between the basis of those microvilli there are several coated vesicles which possibly sign micropinocytotic activity. Coated vesicles are also to be found in the lateral and basal parts of the cell, where they often have taken contact with the cell membrane. The ependymal cells rest upon a broad glycocalyx. In the subependymal connective tissue are wide capillaries with thinwalled fenestrated endothelial cells. The functional significance of these structures is discussed. A PAS‐reaction has been done. The ependymal cells and rounded drops in the ventricular lumen showed a positive reaction. Zusammenfassung Der Saccus dorsalis ist bei den Leuciscus rutilus ein stark gefaltetes Gebiet. Er umschliesst mit seinen Falten die Epiphyse, so dass diese im Dorsalsack versenkt liegt. Die Zellen bestehen aus einem einschichtigen kubischen Ependym. Diese sind mit Zilien und unregelmässigen Mikrovilli versehen, welche dadurch, dass sie Bläschen in langen Reihen enthalten, grosse Aktivität zeigen. Ausbuchtungen der apikalen Zellenoberfläche sind mit Glykogenkörnchen gefüllt. Diese Ausbuchtungen werden wahrscheinlich abgeschnürt und bilden dann runde, mit Glykogen gefüllte Tropfen im Ventrikellumen. Zellauswüchse, mit Mikrovilli bekleidet, vergrössern die Oberfläche. Akanthosome (coated vesicles), welche möglicherweise mikropinocytotisch aktiv sind, kommen reichlich zwischen den Basen der Mikrovillis vor, aber auch in den lateralen und basalen Teilen der Zelle, wo sie sich in Kontakt mit der Zellwand befinden.

At the ultrastructural level, pairing chromosomes and cellular junctions between germ and pregranulosa cells, such as desmosomes, were observed. At this time, the zona pellucida could not be detected in the formed follicles. From 15 to 28 days postpartum, growing follicles were located at the medulla and inner cortex of the ovary, but most were atretic. The first preovulatory follicles were seen at 40 days. Likewise, corpora lutea were observed at this stage of development, which shows that the volcano mouse is a spontaneous ovulator. The follicular development of the volcano mouse shows strong similarities with that of the golden hamster, particularly during the first week. The morphological changes observed during postnatal follicular development of the volcano mouse follow the same general histological pattern as reported for other mammals, although the timing of these events is species‐specific.",

In A. semen the glandular epithelium is detached piecemeal and, probably by means of the foot, is moved to and grafted upon the gills of the same individual. The transferred epithelia appear as disk‐shaped actively secretory ‘gill bodies’ which, attached to the abfrontal side of the inner demibranch, replace the ordinary unciliated gill epithelium. The secretion is liberated into the suprabranchial chamber, which serves as a marsupium, but its function is uncertain. Arthritica semen is a protandric hermaphrodite and produces very large ova that undergo a direct development that results in a non‐planktonic lecithotrophic crawling juvenile stage. The sperm cells have filiform nuclei that are straight in the euspermatozoa and more or less helicoidal in what is considered to represent paraspermatozoa. By a process of aggregation, spermatozeugmata are formed which consist exclusively either of euspermatozoa or paraspermatozoa. Spermatozoa are stored in the oviduct in A. semen but in paired seminal receptacles in A. bifurca .",

Follicle volume increased with increasing BS, BC and rainfall but decreased with increasing temperature. Egg volume averaged 8.8% of body volume, increased allometrically with BS, but was not affected by BC, rainfall or temperature and did not differ between first and second clutches. Most females produced at least one single‐egg clutch per year, even when BC was low. Many females produced two, possibly more, clutches but some forfeited reproduction in some years. Females often retained large follicles from one season to the next with 18%–71% carrying pre‐ovulatory sized follicles in different times of the year. Increasing temperatures likely influenced timing of first ovulations in August while decreasing water and food availability, linked with high temperatures, possibly terminated ovulations by November. The gravid season was short compared to other winter‐rainfall tortoises in South Africa. We propose that the females' small bodies may constrain investments in eggs, resulting in low fecundity, which is countered by producing large hatchlings with high survivorship in an arid habitat.",

Despite the great morphological diversity in Chiroptera, the hindlimbs morphology and its postnatal development have been poorly studied. Postnatal development of hindlimbs in Noctilio leporinus is described, further comparing the morphology of adults with that of Noctilio albiventris and previously reported species ( Desmodus rotundus , Artibeus lituratus , Molossus molossus ). The ossification ending sequence at autopodium elements of N. leporinus does not follow the distal to proximal directional sequence described for D. rotundus , exhibiting a heterochronic delayed ossification ending for the digits of N. leporinus regarding other hindlimb elements, associated with the bigger relative autopodium size of this fisher bat regarding other bat species. Noctilionid bats share the same adult hindlimb bone morphology, except for differences at hindlimb proportions and calcar ossification degree. There are differences in the number and position of bony processes, slots and sesamoids of adult noctilionid fisher bats regarding previously reported species; most differences are concentrated at the autopodium and are related to an increased surface for muscular insertion and the structural support of claws. These facts seem to be closely associated with functional demands of the feeding strategy of noctilionid fisher bats.",

The present immunological study has detected Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs), previously indicated from a transcriptome study, in the lizard Podarcis muralis . Immunoblots show a main labelled band for MMPs around 68 kDa, possibly a MMP16‐like. Immunofluorescence shows that MMPs are mainly present in the central apical region of the mesenchymal blastema, in the ependyma of regenerating spinal cord, and in the basal layer and basement membrane‐region of the apical wound epidermis. The immune‐labelling decreases or disappears in differentiating tissues present in proximal regions of the regenerating tail such as the epidermis and dermis, muscles, inner connective tissues and in the axial cartilaginous tube. The prevalent localization of MMPs in the central mesenchyme of the blastema indicates a continuous remodelling of the extracellular matrix that actively contributes to the progressive distal growth of the apical blastema into a new tail. The study stresses that in regenerating organs of amniotes, a massive growth can only occur where connective tissues are maintained loose by the continuous action of extracellular matrix proteases in concert with the high production of hyaluronate and consequent tissue hydration.",

Mandible morphology reflects dietary preferences and niche partitioning and has therefore been well documented. However, mandibular cuticular microstructure has been under‐documented. Here we use scanning electron microscopy to explore mandible microstructure in four disparate Australian Formicidae taxa (ants) with different life modes and diets: Camponotus nigriceps , Iridomyrmex purpureus , Odontomachus simillimus and Rhytidoponera aciculata . We test the hypothesis that mandible construction is highly conserved across these species, as would be expected for arthropod cuticle. We show broadly similar mandible microstructure but report that pore canals and cuticular indentations are not ubiquitous among all studied taxa. Our preliminary results demonstrate that ant taxa have morphologically plastic mandibles with a highly conserved construction, potentially reflecting an interesting record of evolutionary stasis.",

Significant male‐biased sexual size dimorphism was recorded in snout–vent length (SVL), head length, head width, forearm length and tibia length. Both sexes showed asynchronous reproductive cycles, and males reached sexual maturity at a smaller SVL (33 mm) than females (37 mm). Testes volumes were small from January to February, testicular recrudescence began from March to June, and decreased in July, but increased again in August and September, followed by a second decrease from October to December. In females, vitellogenesis began from May until ovulation in December. Embryonic development extended from November to March, and a small number of females carried embryos through July. Mean litter size was 4.0 and was positively correlated with female SVL. The length of the reproductive period in S. palaciosi recorded in this study is longer than that recorded for other populations in other parts of this species range. Further studies are needed to clarify reproductive cycles in the other isolated populations of S. palaciosi , and then extended to other species and chromosome races in the Sceloporus grammicus complex.",

The sample consisted of nine males (seven belonging to Megaloceros giganteus cf. ruffii and two belonging to subspecies M. giganteus cf. giganteus ) and two females (both classified as M. giganteus cf. ruffii ), photographed in ventral and lateral views. The statistical analyses did find significant shape differences between possible subspecies and sexes for the lateral cranium view but not for the ventral. Possible subspecies differed in the overall skull robustness. Sexual shape dimorphism consisted of transition from higher and elongated skulls in females, to more robust and dorsoventrally flattened skulls in males. The allometry was not proven to be statistically significant, but the shape changes related to size variation could be visually described. Some of the shape differences related to sexual dimorphism can be interpreted as an adaptation for bearing large antlers in males. Even with small sample size, we got statistically supported differences between possible subspecies and sexual shape dimorphism in the lateral view of the giant deer skull. In analyses that showed no statistical support, methods of geometric morphometrics still provided good visualization of shape variation.",

The presence of two M. levator mandibulae longus profundus portions and the post‐orbital origination of the M. suspensorioangularis is unusual in anuran tadpoles.",

In reptiles, especially lizards and snakes, females have specialized structures to store sperm in their oviduct, which occur in the posterior infundibulum and the nonglandular uterus. Many viperids exhibit uterine muscular coiling (UMC) in the nonglandular uterus, and this modification has been proposed as an ancestral trait in this taxon to store sperm. However, UMC and oviductal sperm storage have not been reported in Lachesis . Here, we studied the reproductive tract of L. muta females using histological techniques and describe, for the first time, the occurrence of oviductal sperm storage and UMC in nonglandular uterus of this species. We also describe an increase in secretory activity in the oviduct throughout the reproductive cycle. Our results support the hypothesis that UMC is an ancestral character in Viperidae and suggest that female L. muta must store sperm in the oviduct to fertilize the oocytes. We also propose new hypotheses for reproductive strategies of L. muta in nature.",

Paraneuronal pseudobranchial neurosecretory cells in scorpion catfish Heteropneustes fossilis : an environment scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope study. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 00 : 1–8. Pseudobranchial neurosecretory system (PNS), found in the gill region of certain groups of teleosts, falls under the category of the ‘diffuse neuroendocrine system’ (DNES). The cells belonging to the system share morpho‐functional features with the paraneuronal cells observed in respiratory tract and airway surfaces of higher vertebrates. On the basis of the experimental observations, a role in condition of hypoxia has been recorded for this system. In an attempt to elucidate the ultrastructure of pseudobranchial neurosecretory cells, present investigation was undertaken using environment scanning electron microscope (ESEM) and TEM in an air‐breathing catfish, Heteropneustes fossilis . The external morphology of PNS under ESEM appeared as a mass of cells supplied with nerves and blood capillaries. Each cell mass is made up of numerous pear‐shaped neurosecretory cells, confirmed by neurosecretion‐specific acid violet stain. The TEM investigation of the cells revealed the presence of different sizes of dense‐cored vesicles in the cytoplasm, which was observed as granular cytoplasm under light microscope. Presence of large number of mitochondria in the cytoplasm confirmed active involvement of these cells in the physiology of fishes. Although lacuna prevails regarding the exact function of this system of fish, its probable role in hypoxic condition and surfacing behavior are speculated.",

Ovarian folliculogenesis in the southern sea lion Otaria flavescens . — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 444–452. In Otaria flavescens , folliculogenesis occurs within ovary cortex. This process attains successively higher level of organization through cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we identified eight major follicular stages from I to VIII, plus corpus luteum and corpus albicans . Otaria folliculogenesis is divided into (1) primordial follicle recruitment; (2) pre‐antral follicle development; (3) growth of antral follicle; and (4) follicle atresia. The primordial follicle is surrounded by thin and flat granulosa cells. As recruitment occurs, granulosa cells organize into cuboidal monolayer marking the transition into pre‐antral phase. Pre‐antral phase (from stage I to stage V) is characterized by follicular growth and theca layer formation. The typical feature of the antral phase (from stage V to pre‐ovulatory Graafian follicle or stage VIII) is the formation of a fluid‐filled cavity ( antrum ) within the follicle. In the Graafian preovulatory follicle, theca cells organize two distinguishable layers surrounding the follicle. In gravid females, the corpus luteum persists. In nongravid females, the corpus luteum transforms into corpus albicans. The corpus albicans is formed by granulosa, thecal cells, and invading blood tissue. Our results provide a detailed histological description of follicular development in O. flavescens and add new knowledge to the reproductive biology of this species.",

Similarly, samples from fish captured during two opposite seasons showed differences in their nuclei, which were smaller in summer than winter.

The lizard S celoporus torquatus has sexual differences associated with microhabitat use, which can be reflected in the physiology and anatomy of the muscle, and thus, in our study, we analysed the morphological and contractile characteristics of the iliofibularis muscle ( IF ) of S . torquatus males and females. We found a larger prevalence of FOG compared with FG and SO fibres in the muscle of both sexes. We also found that males show larger areas of the three types of fibres, develop greater strength but also faster fatigue than females, suggesting that strength is a key functional feature that enables males to perform faster movements (but for shorter periods), associated with the demands of territoriality.",

Comparisons are made with Metridium senile (Linnaeus, 1761), whose cnidom, with a few exceptions, is closely similar to that of S. viduatus . The two anemones possess b‐ and p‐mastigophores, p‐amastigophores, isorhizas and spirocysts. Although the majority of cnidae in S. viduatus is smaller than corresponding ones in M. senile , they are grouped into the same size classes as those of M. senile , namely small, medium and large.

All TBs are of similar structure, following an orthodox plan: the basal cells (1–2) are the basis of the bud, and vertically elongated gustatory cells and supporting cells span from the basal membrane to the apex where they form a sensory zone (known as the gustatory pore). The basal cells have finger‐like processes pointing towards the nerve plexus. They do not show any hemidesmosomal connections with the basal membrane. Typical afferent synaptic contacts were found only at the basal cells and gustatory cells while no such contacts were found at the supporting cells. The highest concentration of TBs (up to 170 TBs mm 2 ) occurs in the epithelial lining of the distal part of the pharynx, the least (12 TBs mm 2 ) in the epidermis of the distal part of the head. The tops of most TBs protrude above the epithelium but their gustatory pores are slightly sunken, thereby protecting the apical processes of the gustatory cells from mechanical stimulation.",

Spindles in metaphase spermatogonia are surrounded by fenestrated two‐layered cisternae and do not contain intraspindle membranes. In metaphase spermatocytes, a spindle envelope is missing, but intraspindle membranes are abundant. Mitochondria form long threads lateral to the nucleus in prophase I of meiosis. The elongated mitochondria also align parallel to the spindle apparatus in prometaphase I. As a consequence, the spindles reside in a cage formed of mitochondria. This arrangement may guarantee proper bisection of the chondriome during division. Cells are tightly packed during spermatogonial divisions and in prophase I, but large intercellular spaces develop when the first meiotic spindle assembles. Then, cytoplasmic bridges which persist between the cells as a result of incomplete cytokinesis appear as slender tubes. Anti‐tubulin immunofluorescence using an antibody against acetylated α‐tubulin revealed intense acetylation throughout spermatogonial mitosis but a low degree of α‐tubulin acetylation in meiotic spindles prior to telophase. This may indicate a high microtubule turnover in meiosis.",

As time went on more and more craniates were designated vomerate. To date, however, the issue as to whether brachiopterygian fish are or are not vomerate has remained unresolved. Those who consider these fish to be vomerate have suggested at least three different palatal bones as the homologue of the human vomer. Examination of embryological material of Polypterus senegalus shows that this brachiopterygian actually develops a vomer which eventually becomes united indistinguishably with the anterior part of the parasphenoid. The vomer is suggested to have arisen through the fusion of dental plates belonging to a supplementary set of buccopharyngeal denticulate bones. The other subethmoidal bones of the brachiopterygian palate seem likely to be derivatives of the tooth plates which originally were applied to the first two pairs of infrapharyngeals. When these endoskeletal elements were put to use for encapsulation of the organs of smell early in craniate phylogeny, some of the tooth plates that covered their inner surfaces fused to provide anterior palatal bones. Identified at one time or another as vomers, these bones are here termed glochinals and dacnils.",

The tip of the cord‐like structure connects to the surface of the endospermatophore, and together form a loop after extrusion. Ultrastructural observations confirmed that the ectospermatophore wall is composed of four layers, and the contents consist of male germ cells and three types of secretions from the male accessory genital glands. As in other ticks the male germ cells are elongated spermatids in spermatophores just after formation and extrusion.

    "abstract": "Abstract The ultrastructure of the epididymal sperm of Tarsius bancanus is described. The sperm possess the typical eutherian pattern of a dorsoventrally flattened, ovate sperm head, comprising a nucleus capped by a symmetrical acrosome, and a distinct midpiece and principal piece containing a 9 + 9 + 2 arrangement of outer coarse fibres and microtubules. However, unique features are also present. The overall head length (9 μm) equals the greatest for any primate yet examined, and the subacrosomal space (“perforatorium” or “pseudoperforatorium”) tilted at 30° to the sagittal axis of the sperm, is described for the first time for mammals. The acrosome extends only a short distance beyond the length of the nucleus of the mature sperm, and a significant reduction in the acrosome to nuclei ratio appears to occur during the final stages of sperm maturation. In contrast to earlier predictions based on the spermatid of Tarsius syrhicta , the mature spermatozoa of Tarsius shows greatest morphological similarity with the sperm of the Anthropoidea, which have a short symmetrical acrosome, than with the Strepsirhini, which have a relatively long acrosome that can be either symmetrical (Lemuriformes) or asymetrical (Lorisiformes). Four proposed phylogenies of the Primates are assessed using comparative sperm ultrastructure. Placing the Tarsiidae as a sister group to the Lorisidae appears the least likely. The sperm data are consistent with the Tarsiidae being a sister group to the Anthropoidea, to the Strepsirhini, or even to the extant primate groups as a whole. Use of sperm morphology to provide characters in phylogenetic systematics of the primates is discussed, and the principle of “total evidence” is preferred to the common practice of “hanging” sperm on phylogenetic hypotheses based on other evidence. © 1997 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Ultrastructural investigations of the female genital system of Epiperipatus biolleyi (Bouvier 1902) (Onychophora, Peripatidae). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 80: 339–349. The female genital system of the neotropical peripatid Epiperipatus biolleyi was examined using transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Special attention is given to the two accessory organs of the paired oviducts: the receptacula seminis and the ovarian funnels (Ovarialtrichter). The latter occur only in the Peripatidae, whereas receptacula seminis may also be present in the Peripatopsidae, the only other family in the Onychophora. The ovarian funnels of E. biolleyi are thin‐walled and closed from the haemocoel. This trait has also been reported from Epiperipatus trinidadensis, Macroperipatus torquatus, and Eoperipatus weldoni, whereas other peripatids have ovarian funnels which have been reported to open into the haemocoel. The occurrence of artificially opened ovarian funnels, caused by tissue rupture during specimen preparation, is discussed. The presence of spermatozoa both in the receptaculum seminis and in parts of the uterus of the female examined in this study supports the hypothesis that in E. biolleyi insemination of juvenile females occurs directly via the genital opening. The female contained one unstalked cleavage embryo in each uterus horn. Two features of the uterus were found to be unique to E. biolleyi: (1) a second cell layer overlying the uterine epithelium with a pronounced secretory activity (2) embryos are enclosed in a noncellular coat interspersed with numerous transport vesicles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The larval morphology and settlement of the vesicularioid ctenostome bryozoan Bowerbankia gracilis has been investigated by light and electron microscopy in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of attachment to the substratum at the onset of metamorphosis. The oral epithelium in the free‐swimming larva is infolded to form a glandular internal sac at the oral pole. The internal sac is not specialized into distinct regions, but consists of a uniform, simple columnar epithelium filled with secretory granules. The hemispherical internal sac is underlain by a cup‐shaped layer of undifferentiated cells that constitutes the polypide rudiment. The cupiform layer of undifferentiated cells is in turn embraced by a network of muscle fibers called the rete muscularis. At the onset of metamorphosis, the larva constricts oro‐laterally and the internal sac is everted against the substratum. As the sac everts, the glandular cells secrete an adhesive that is wafted up over the metamorphosing larva by the reversed beating of the coronal cilia. At the same time, the cupiform layer of undifferentiated cells flattens in the plane of the oro‐lateral constriction and doubles in thickness. The cells of the cupiform layer undergo a corresponding transformation from short columnar cells to flask‐shaped cells that bulge into the glandular cells of the internal sac. The narrow ends of the flask‐shaped cells abut the strongly contracted muscle fibers of the rete muscularis. It is hypothesized that the contraction of the muscle fibers of the rete muscularis is responsible for the change in shape of the undifferentiated cells and, consequently, for the eversion of the internal sac. On the basis of this study and a review of the literature, it is concluded that attachment to the substratum at the onset of metamorphosis typically is effected by the eversion of an internal sac in larvae of the ctenostome superfamily Vesicularioidea.",

These features correlate with the synthesis and secretion of androgens. At the end of spring and after mating, the amount of smooth endoplasmic reticulum decreased and the mitochondria showed laminar cristae. Both features are typical of a latent period, during which time secretion of androgens remains inactive until the end of summer. The possible role of other cell organelles, such as Golgi complex and lysosome-like electron dense bodies, during both secreting and resting periods, is also discussed. Finally, we consider the relationship between seasons, secretory activity of Leydig cells and the spermatogenic cycle.",

Random destruction of erythrocytes was initially higher in isolated bats. In cold and isolated animals the white pulp of the spleen was most reduced in quantity and in proliferative activity. Red pulp became highly engorged with erythrocytes and showed a hypertrophy of reticuloendothelial elements. Higher rates of random destruction are closely correlated with increased splenic erythrophagocytosis.

These cells regularly extend from the basal lamina to the gut lumen, ending in an apical process with microvilli and a filamentous surface coat. Fasting results in an accumulation of secretion granules in all cytoplasmic portions, except for the terminal web area. A similarity is recorded between the distribution of secretion granules and the finely granular fluorescamine-induced fluorescence, suggesting that the fluorescence is associated to some component(s) of the secretory granules. Granule release may take place at the base after an adequate stimulus (presence of food?) at the luminal portion of the cells. The formaldehyde condensation technique shows that insulin-containing hagfish islet parenchymal cells, but not intestinal endocrine cells, store dopamine after intestinal supply of the amine precursor. Acidification of formaldehyde vapour-fixed intestinal epithelium induces fluorescence in the granules of zymogen cells but not of endocrine cells, indicating a low concentration of tryptophyl-peptide(s) in the secretory granules of hagfish intestinal endocrine cells.",

It was evident from the data that significant variations were found in AA concentrations of different tissues of the pigeon. The brain possessed the highest content of AA/cell. The liver, ovary, pancreatic acini, kidney, adrenal and testis followed in order, whereas, the pancreatic islet region was the poorest in AA. On the basis of the synchronization of the high AA content of these tissues with their well known high level of metabolic activity, it is suggested that AA participates in the metabolic turnover by serving as an electron donor via the formation of its free radical. Considering the fact that these organs are very rich in ascorbic acid, there is also a possibility for the biosynthesis of AA in tissues like the liver and kidney of the pigeon as in other bird species. The need for further work in this direction is stressed.",

The present study examines the expression of A and B HBGA in the stomach of free‐living vertebrates belonging to: Chondrichthyes, Actinopterygii, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia. HBGA were detected immunohistochemically on stomach paraffin sections from 11 species. In all classes from Actinopterygii to Mammalia HBGA expression was confined to stomach mucosa only. Antigenic heterogeneity in the pattern of expression and localization was observed. Smooth muscle tissue, endothelial and red blood cells were immunonegative, except for the reptile Emys orbicularis . Our results present the first comparative evidence for the expression of HBGA in the stomach of 11 free‐living vertebrate species from six classes, some of which have never been studied so far. It could be assumed that A and B antigens are constant and conservative structures with almost similar tissue localization. Their immunobiological role in the animal gastrointestinal tract might be possibly related to cell differentiation and homeostasis maintenance which would contribute to sustain the evolutionary stable ABH antigen cellular expression.",

Following a detailed histological examination, histochemical, ultrastructural and experimental techniques have been used to study some aspects in more detail. A modification of the standard glutaraldehyde fixative for electron microscopy has been developed for Myxine tissues. The development of the horn cap (HC) and the pokal cell cone (PCC) have been traced. The HC is seen to increase in thickness with increasing length of the animal but there are irregularities in the development of the PCC which suggest that this cone may act as a replacement tooth for the HC. Experiments, in which the HCs were removed and the changes in the PCC observed, were performed to test this hypothesis. As a result of these and other observations it is suggested that it is possible for tooth replacement to occur. The structure and formation of the keratin in the HC and PCC cells has been followed using electron microscopy and histochemistry. The accumulation of keratin fibres in the early stages of PCC development has been traced, and keratinisation, which is probably associated with an increase in height of the cusps has been followed across a keratogenous zone at the bases of well developed HCs and PCCs. It has been established that the HC pigment granules are lipofuscin and that they can originate from lipid droplets. A detailed investigation has been made of the pokal cells. It is suggested that the beaded fibres, observed in electron micrographs of the apical band of these cells, are synthesised from lipid droplets in basal portions of the pokal cells, in a synthetic cycle, during which the nucleus descends through the length of the cell.",

An ultrastructural study of alimentary tract development in the cercariae of Prosorhynchoides borealis (Digenea, Bucephalidae). —Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 92: 170–178. The development of digestive system in Prosorhynchoides borealis cercariae was studied using transmission electron microscopy. The foregut and caecum primordia arise in early cercarial embryos as two adjoining cellular cords. The primordial pharynx appears as a cluster of myoblasts in the mid-part of the foregut primordium whose proximal end abuts onto the ventral embryonic tegument. Later, a lumen develops within the gut primordia and their component cells form the embryonic cellular epithelium with an essentially similar structure in the foregut and caecal regions. Subsequently, the foregut epithelial cells merge to form a syncytium. This process proceeds asynchronously and the most proximal foregut area remains cellular for the longest time. The syncytial lining of the foregut establishes syncytial connections with secretory cytons differentiating in the surrounding parenchyma. These cytons produce secretory granules, which are transported through cytoplasmic connections to the foregut syncytium. Before cercariae reach maturity, their foregut epithelium becomes anucleate and continuous with the external tegument. By the end of cercarial development, numerous short lamellae appear on the luminal surface of the caecal epithelium. The caecal cells become involved in secretory activity as indicated by the presence of Golgi-derived secretory bodies in their cytoplasm.",

A comparative analysis using phylogenetic independent contrasts showed that in families that contain both flighted (volant) and flightless species, the volant species have shorter wings and total‐arm (humerus + ulna + manus) lengths relative to their body masses than the species within their wholly volant sister families. A shortening of the manus may typify the early stages of the evolution of flightlessness, with the humerus and ulna attenuating later, perhaps because of their role in maintaining the position of the aerodynamically important alula. A shorter wing relative to body mass was not the result of the inverse (i.e. heavier body mass relative to wing length) because mean body masses of volant members of flightless families were similar to or lower than those of their wholly volant sister families. Despite finding a common trend in the wing morphologies of volant members of flightless families, it seems unlikely that a general model of selection pressures driving the evolution of flightlessness exists. At the very least, a dichotomy between those birds that have lost the ability to fly in order to gain the ability to swim and terrestrial forms, may persist.",

However, EGC s also share some features with mammalian basophils as neutral red dye was selectively incorporated into EGC granules. EGC s within scale epidermis were actively motile, displaying average speeds of 16 μm/min and maximum speeds of greater than 40 μm/min and showing morphological plasticity during migration. The predominant motile phenotype was elongate with a well‐developed leading lamella, while a broader body motile morphology was observed to a lesser extent. A trailing, relatively unchanged uropod was associated with every motile EGC and invariably contained one or a few granules. A rounded EGC shape without a leading‐edge or trailing uropod was also observed and was generally associated with static cells. Individual cells readily switched between the three major shapes during motility; static cells could abruptly develop a polarized morphology, and actively motile cells switched between elongate and broad‐bodied shapes or the static, rounded shape.",

Although the retina is typical of other vertebrates, having three nuclear and two synaptic layers, it presents some features associated with the animal's deep‐sea habitat. A stratum argenteum containing iridescent crystals is located in the choroid. The pigment cell layer shows bulky cells filled with melanin granules but without the typical apical processes. The visual cells, consisting of a big population of rods, are arranged in several banks. No cones were observed. The outer segments are very long and cylindrical, and the inner segments are constituted by a small ellipsoid at the proximal end. The outer nuclear layer contains several rows of oval nuclei, and the spherules in the outer plexiform layer have less regular outlines than nuclei. The inner retina is characterized by very large horizontal cells, and presumable bipolar and amacrine cells separated by large spaces that are occupied by neuronal processes. Finally, the low density of ganglion cells produces a thin nerve fibre layer. The results of this study suggest that the retina of Nezumia sclerorhyncus exhibits high visual sensitivity and that vision is a sense that plays an important role in its behaviour.",

The taxonomy of Sperata spp., sampled from Hakaluki Haor in Bangladesh, was re‐evaluated based on morphological variation and DNA barcoding. The collective variation in morphometric characters and mitochondrial DNA revealed an undescribed old and well‐separated lineage under the genus Sperata along with two previously known Sperata aor and Sperata seenghala in Bangladesh. Analyses of morphological traits suggested significant differentiation among Sperata species. The variation in mitochondrial DNA supported the distinct lineage and taxonomical discrimination. Sperata aor diverged earlier from the new lineage and Sperata seenghala with a divergence of 5.39 ( CI : 3.91–7.19) Mya ( PP &gt; 90). Sperata seenghala and the new lineage shared a most recent common ancestry, which diverged from each other around 3.41 ( CI : 2.24–4.62) Mya ( PP &gt; 90). Thus, the newly identified lineage could be a subspecies of S. seenghala or even a species under the genus Sperata .

The specimens were captured bimonthly in two distinct ecosystems along the south‐eastern Brazilian coast. The mature ovotestes were removed, preserved in formalin and examined using histological techniques. The results revealed indeterminate fecundity with asynchronous ovarian organization. All spermatogenesis occurs within cysts, and the spermatogonial distribution indicated an unrestricted testicular type. The testicular and ovarian tissues were separated from each other by different ducts, indicating no possibility of internal self‐fertilization. The hydrated oocytes were stored in the accessory reproductive structure for at least 24 hr. The presence of atretic hydrated oocytes within this structure and the positive periodic acid–Schiff reaction of the villi‐like projections revealed the function of the ovary sinus as absorbing unspawned oocytes. The relative batch fecundity ranged from 62 to 209 oocytes/g (126 ± 42) for specimens from the coast and from 52 to 203 oocytes/g (113 ± 57) for those sampled in the estuary.

The female reproductive system of C. tenebrionis has a pair of ovaries, lateral oviducts, a common oviduct, spermatheca, and bursa copulatrix . Each ovary in C. tenebrionis consists of approximately 24 telotrophic meroistic type ovarioles. The ovarioles of C. tenebrionis have four regions (terminal filament, tropharium, vitellarium, and pedicel). Tropharium have trophocytes, young oocytes, and prefollicular cells. Vitellarium consists of previtellogenic, vitellogenic, and choriogenic oocytes. Previtellogenic oocyte is surrounded by cylindrical epithelial cells. Its ooplasm is homogeneous and basophilic. In vitellogenic oocyte, there are intercellular spaces between monolayered follicle cells. Its ooplasm has yolk granules and lipid droplets. Choriogenic oocyte are surrounded by chorion and single‐layered cylindrical cells. There are yolk granules and lipid droplets in its ooplasm which is asidophilic. In C. tenebrionis female, spermatheca and bursa copulatrix wall is surrounded by thin cuticular intima, monolayer epithelial, glandular cells, and muscle layer. Spermatheca lumen contains a large number of spermatozoa. Bursa copulatrix lumen is filled with secretory material. This study may be useful in terms of the morphology of mature female reproductive organs of Buprestidae and other coleopteran species.",

We observed two mass moulting events; one occurred in May, whereas the other occurred in September. Most males within this population moulted from Form I (i.e. reproductive form) to Form II (i.e. non‐reproductive form) in May and then later returned to Form I after a September moulting event. We collected females with active glair glands from May to June, with oviposition occurring from July to August. Fecundity was high and weakly correlated with body size. Egg counts of attached eggs/young in ovigerous females ranged from 41 to 281, with an average of 168. Additionally, from June to October, we dissected a subset of females to determine the monthly gonadal development in females with and without active glair glands. Lastly, in the laboratory, we observed 4th instar neonate crayfishes repeatedly “drifting” between females. We speculate on the relevance of this drifting behaviour and propose future studies to investigate this phenomenon. Our study provides the first comprehensive understanding of the life history of C. chasmodactylus .",

Herein, we highlight the ontogeny of a different skeletal complex, the dorsal and anal fins. We studied the development of the skeletal elements of both fins in the gonorynchiform Kneria stappersii . We gained new insights into the developmental and formation patterns of K. stappersii . We discuss these patterns as well as the development of certain elements like the fin stay in comparison to other gonorynchiforms and available otomorph data. In general, the fin development in K. stappersii is very similar to that of other gonorynchiforms and even otomorphs. Specific differences, however, reveal that much remains unknown about the evolution of median fin elements such as the fin stay.",

Two main patterns of the coronary trunks are defined in the conus arteriosus. A dorsal and a ventral coronary trunk are present in lamnoid and carcharhinoid representatives (except in scyliorhinids), while two lateral coronary trunks are always observed in the holocephalian, hexanchoid, squaloid, squatinoid, scyliorhinid and batoid representatives. Posterior coronary arteries arising from subclavian branches are recorded only in rajoid and myliobatoid specimens. We propose that both the dorsoventral coronary trunk pattern and the presence of posterior coronary arteries are apomorphic. Thus, the phylogenetic analysis of these character–states supports the view that lamnoids are the sister–group of advanced carcharhinoids (carcharhinids and sphyrnids), sharing the dorsoventral coronary trunk pattern as a synapomorphy.",

The presence of ducts opening on the surface of the esca shows that the AEG, like the escal light gland, is derived from the epidermis. The function of the AEG is unknown. Its location suggests that it may in some way supplement the escal light gland, for example, by secreting substances yielding a scent that may attract prey animals.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether these structural proteins show the same sex‐specific expression patterns reported for mammalian embryos, and to assess their usefulness as early markers of gonadal differentiation in species with temperature‐dependent sex determination. Laminin delineated enlarged seminiferous cords in differentiating testes from developmental stage 23 to hatching. Laminin distribution was more diffuse and revealed smaller cords of cells in differentiating ovaries. Cytokeratin was also detected in developing gonads of both sexes. Cytokeratin became concentrated in the basal cytoplasm of differentiating Sertoli cells in developing testes. In developing ovaries, prefollicular cells of the ovarian cortex and cell cords in the medulla stained strongly for cytokeratin. Cytokeratin did not show the same basal distribution in female medullary cord cells as seen in the Sertoli cells of testes, however. These sex‐specific patterns of laminin and cytokeratin distribution in embryonic alligator gonads may serve as early markers of sexual differentiation.",

In the head the digestive apparatus muscle is relatively thick; individual muscles are difficult to distinguish at the anatomical level; in the anterior part of the oesophagus discontinuous bundles and layers of cross‐striated fibers are found. As a group however, the oesophageal musculature completely covers the oesophageal epithelium. The prominent muscle layers around the oesophagus probably help to force food into the intestine against the turgor pressure of the trunk cavity which tends to collapse the intestine. Around the intestine the musculature is largely circular and smooth. The intestinal epithelium is ciliated despite its muscular covering. Muscle fibers are not individually innervated. They form myoepithelial structures with various intercellular junction types. In the intestinal muscle the fibers show myoendothelial‐like junctions. Sphincters composed of myoepidermal cells surround the anus and the female gonopores. The somatic side of the general cavity is lined with a polymorphic squamous epithelium. Sometimes myoepithelial cells are found, with the occasional presence of extracellular matrix basal to the layer of the squamous epithelium. The ontogenetic relations between the polymorphic epithelium and the composite ‘mesenteries’ remain to be established. We have now some idea about the architecture of the body of Chaetognaths in relation to contractile structures.",

Each oocyte subsequently grows within a compartment of the epithelium known as a primary follicle. The wall of the primary follicle is composed of outer follicular epithelial cells. While growing from about 15–70 μm in diameter, each oocyte gradually recruits a set of about 950 non‐epithelial inner follicular cells. These cells co‐differentiate in sets with each oocyte, but test cells never appear. The first filamentous components of the vitelline coat appear on the surface of an oocyte in places where it is in contact with undifferentiated (stage 2) inner follicular cells. Each fully differentiated inner follicular cell stores adhesive precursors in a large compartment of the endoplasmic reticulum and probably secretes components of the vitelline coat. There is no evidence that the outer follicular epithelial cells transform into inner follicular cells by dedifferentiation as has often been assumed. Inner follicular cells, in stage 1, are nearly identical to hemoblasts. Hemoblasts may form the inner follicular cells, but to do this they would have to cross the outer follicular epithelium and this phenomenon has not yet been seen.",

A well‐developed blood sinus (gut sinus) lies between the gut and the visceral peritoneum. The ultrastructural features of the gut epithelium and its close association with the blood sinus point to an absorptive function. The coelomic cavity is reduced to a narrow space limited by two peritoneal sheets (visceral and parietal) of myoepithelial nature. Amoebocyte‐like cells (coelomocytes) occur free in the coelomic fluid, and muscular, unicellular bridges are attached to both peritoneal walls across the coelomic space. The dorsal epidermis follows the gut foldings and is formed by flat, overlapping cells. The present observations are compared with previous histological, histochemical and ultrastructural data.",

The deeper component (paradental axis) is represented by a supporting rod and shows a peculiar histological structure, which consists of glycogen containing vesiculate cells mixed to slim muscle fibres and held together by a thin fibrillar stroma. The paradental axes are very problematic structures in terms of comparative anatomy and phylogenetic aspects.

Slow fibres have a pattern of multiple innervation, whereas fast fibres are associated with individual endplates. The organization of the myofibrils and the sarcoplasmic reticulum in slow muscle fibres from the chameleon biceps brachii was compared with that in fast fibres. Slow fibres lacked an M‐line and the Z‐lines were uneven. They had fibrils that were not clearly separated from each other and the sarcoplasmic reticulum was poorly developed.

A comparative assessment of the new growth (regenerate) showed that the initiation of regeneration, the daily growth, the total length of tail replaced at the end of regeneration and the total percentage replacement of the lost (autotomized) tails were all enhanced by continuous light and depressed by continuous darkness. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between any of the parameters in NL and BL Hemidactylus ; however, PX lizards generally showed retardation in the regeneration process. Seasonal differences in tail regeneration were noted—the best regenerative performance was obtained during the summer months and the worst during the winter months, with the regenerative performance during the monsoon season in between. Thermal and photoperiodic influences on tail regeneration in lizards are discussed.",

They are composed of a cuticular pore apparatus, an inner and an outer canal cell, and of four large and one to three small compartment cells. Plasma of the latter seven cells is almost completely filled with large membrane‐enclosed compartments that contain either numerous small vesicles (one of the large cells) or homogeneous material of varying electron density (three large and all the small cells). Microvilli are found in the apical region of the compartment cells. The nucleus is situated basally where Golgi‐cisternae, coated vesicles and free ribosomes are frequently found. Apical microvilli and vesicles are also formed by the inner canal cell indicating that it might directly be involved in transport. Anatomically the ‘slit organs’ are similar to class III glands described for many arthropods. In addition, discharge of secretion via large intracellular compartments is also a feature found in arthropod glands. Although pycnogonids appear to take up substances across the cuticle, a genuine secretion rather than a more generalized transport function is suggested for the ‘slit organs’.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The gall‐midge family Cecidomyiidae is one of the largest within the animal kingdom. Its characteristics include, among others, a chromosome elimination during spermiogenesis and a bewildering diversity in sperm ultrastructure. The sperm tail, in particular, is unusual in that it deviates from the conventional 9+2 pattern of microtubules. We describe here the spermatozoa of five gall‐midge species, all belonging to the same supertribe Cecidomyiidi. In Bremia more than 100 microtubular doublets form a tight spiral around a central mitochondrion. In an undetermined binomen many doublets form a spiral around the mitochondria in the distal end of the sperm tail, but a single row along a peripheral cistern in the main part of the tail. In Coquillettomyia caricis a peripheral row of doublets resides in the proximal part and tightly packed doublets distally. In Arthrocnodax sp. the many doublets also form a peripheral single or double row around a central mitochondrion. In Massalongia bachmaieri there are more than 500 doublets which form several rows around the nucleus and tightly packed doublets distally. The nuclear membrane forms bundles of extensive outpocketings. There is no acrosome. The nucleus consists of both condensed and dispersed material. Only outer dynein arms are present in all this species and the spermatozoa are motile. Cecidomyiidi species that have been examined for sperm structure fall into two groups: those where the mitochondria are confined to the centre of the tail and those in which the mitochondria lie in the head region and have a peripheral location. Most species belong to the first group, while Massalongia belongs to the second one.",

Oral primary spines of both species are clearly but differently adapted for movement over soft substrata. The aboral spines of both species bear fleshy extensions which are composed of gelatinous material in both species and are not poison sacs. Field experiments showed that the fleshy parts of the aboral spines of P. placenta are palatable to shallow‐water fish. However, the aboral spines are shown to have stored within the hollow ossicle of the spine secretory material likely to be irritant in function. The structure of the tip of the spine ossicle of both species suggests that they may act like hypodermic needles. We conclude that the aboral spines of both species are probably defensive in function but remain equivocal over the exact role of the massive fleshy extensions found in P. placenta . Other possible non‐defensive functions are briefly discussed.",

Their low response or the absence of changes in goldfish kept in 1/3 Ca‐free seawater (SW) and in Ca‐free SW‐adapted eels, respectively, suggest that sodium and/or magnesium are interfering. To test this hypothesis, young goldfish were adapted to DW supplemented or not with sodium (50 and 140 mM) for 8 and 16 days or with magnesium (16.5 and 50 mM) for 16 and 30 days. Cytological and morphometric studies of the pituitary showed that prolactin (PRL) cell activity was reduced by sodium. Thyrotropic (TSH) cells were stimulated. The activity of melanocyte‐stimulating (MSH) cells increased in DW + Na+. Stimulation of the pars intermedia PAS+ cells in DW was partly inhibited by adding sodium; the cellular and nuclear areas increased only moderately, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was not conspicuous and mitotic activity disappeared. In DW + Mg 2+ the activity of PRL, TSH and MSH cells tended to be lower after a long‐term adaptation. The response of the PAS+ cells was as high as that noted in DW; complete degranulation, enlargement of the ER and important mitotic activity. Differential responses to Na+ and Mg 2+ are not due to pH differences in the solutions. External sodium is able then to reduce the response of the PAS+ cells in a Ca‐free environment, while magnesium is not inhibitory. Other cell types are also affected by high levels of Na+ and Mg 2+ .",

The nuclei of the photoreceptor cells are located inside the medial region of the brain. Thin cytoplasmic photoreceptor projections provided with neurosecretory‐like granules are interposed between the inner surface of the eye cup and the distal extremity of the microvilli. The breakdown and renewal of microvillar membranes was analysed. Membrane turnover is a continuous process. At dusk and during the night abscission of photoreceptive membranes occurs. At dawn the membrane fragments are degraded to granular material, which is then endocytosed into the submicrovillar cytoplasm as coated vesicles. These vesicles form multivesicular bodies. The degradation of multivesicular body content occurs during the following light hours. The dark period is correlated with membrane synthesis for elongation of reticular membranes, which are converted into ellipsoid bodies. The formation of new microvillar membranes occurs at the base of the microvillar border, and involves the fusion with the old microvillar membranes of small vesicles detached from the tubular endoplasmic membranes and from the flattened concentric cisternae of ellipsoid bodies. The correlations with daily cycles of other invertebrates are discussed.",

As revealed by the present study of Polypterus senegalus , it consists of an incurrent and an excurrent tube, a body and six lobes. Luminally these divisions are extensively covered with cilia, the actions of which cause water to flow through the organ. The proximal extremities of the two tubes communicate directly with one another, allowing water to bypass the body and the lobes. The body is subdivided by means of seven infolds into a central part and two peripheral parts. Of these, the central part directs water to the lobes; the peripheral parts drain the lobes and lead water to the excurrent tube. Each lobe has an axial portion and two rows of alternating lobuli. Interlobularly infolds of the axial portion subdivide the lobar lumen in such a way that movement of water is possible. Olfactory neurosensory cells occur in the rear of the incurrent tube, as well as in the lobes. Probably the degree of stimulation of the tubal receptors determines whether the water taken in is to bypass the lobes.",

Unlike the other epidermal syncytia, the posttentacular ones may be deeply stained with silver nitrate. The basal zone of the posttentacular syncytia is occupied by abundant deep invaginations of the basal cell membrane with densely packed mitochondria between them. In one species, A. sathonota , the nuclei containing portions of the posttentacular syncytia are insunk into the parenchyma. Ultrastructurally, the posttentacular syncytia are similar to the excretory bladder (the distal portion of the protonephridial canal) of the same animals and to osmoregulatory epithelial chloride cells known from many animals. These data suggest that ion transport in this syncytium serves for osmoregulation and maintenance of ion balance. Despite extensive studies of the epidermis, no hints of such cells have ever been reported in other platyhelminths. The accessory osmoregulatory organ is probably an adaptation to life in the gill chamber of the crustacean hosts which are characterized by high ability to maintain osmotic and ionic balance in stressful conditions.",

Ultrastructural study of the bacillary, granular and mucoid proboscidial gland cells of Riseriellus occultus (Nemertini, Heteronemertini). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 81 : 235–242. The ultrastructure of six types (G 5 ‐G 10 ) of proboscidial gland cells whose cell necks emerge independently on the epithelium surface is analysed and compared with data from other nemerteans. These types differ in cytological features, as well as in the morphology of their respective secretory granules. Secretory granules of the types G 5 and G 6 have a bacillary shape, and differ from each other based on their contents and dimensions. Secretory granules of the types G 7 and G 8 are spherical to ovoid; type G 8 gland cells are monociliated, and their secretory granules contain a paracrystalline material. Types G 9 and G 10 gland cells are typically goblet‐shaped; secretory granules in the type G 9 have a spherical shape, contain a homogeneous electron dense material and maintain their individuality, whereas those of the G 10 type are elongate and have fibrillar contents, showing a tendency to fuse before they are extruded. The mucus sheet of the proboscis is responsible for lubrication of its epithelial surface. Secretion products of type G 10 gland cells form the background substance of this mucus, and those of the G 5 type confer stickiness to it. Type G 9 gland cells could provide the toxic component to the mucus, and type G 7 and G 8 gland cells could be concerned with the production of enzymatic secretions.",

The dorsal eye also uses refracting superposition optics, although the optical array is unusual as many of the peripheral ommatidia lack crystalline cones. The centre of curvature of the cornea is in front of the flattened rhabdom layer whereas the axes of the crystalline cones are centred on a point about twice as deep as the rhabdom layer. This results in a well‐focused eye, free of spherical aberration. There is a remarkable similarity in eye structure between this species and some mesopelagic double‐eyed euphausiid crustaceans.",

The method highlights the duality of possible secretory inclusions in nerve terminals. Many typical synaptic/synaptoid vesicles have ZIO-positive contents, but intermingle with unreactive vesicles. Both positively and negatively reacting vesicles contribute to the unusual dense clusters associated with sites of release of neurochemical mediators, characteristic of polychaete nervous systems. Fewer dense-cored synaptic/synaptoid vesicles have reactive cores. The larger ‘storage granules’ typically have unreactive contents, but dense deposits form within a small minority. A possible cytophysical, in contradistinction from a cytochemical, basis of affinity for ZIO is discussed.

The primary plexus enters the pars distalis paramedially, apparently without the formation of distinct portal vessels. The neuro‐intermediate lobe receives its blood supply exclusively from the primary plexus. The plexus intermedius gives off capillaries to the parenchyma of the intermediate lobe (an intermediate lobe sinus system). The saccus vasculosus receives (1) a “direct” supply, i.e. branches originating directly from the cerebral arteries and (2) an “indirect” supply, i.e. capillaries from the primary plexus. The pars distalis is drained into an unpaired ventral hypophysial vein, while a dorsal hypophysial vein, also unpaired, drains the plexus intermedius.

Ossification begins in the median part of the metatarsals; however, it appears in the distal part of the digits’ phalanges, beginning with the third phalanx. The first metatarsal appears just distal to the entocuneiform and develops as a small, separate bone located either in close contact with the distal end of the entocuneiform in A . tetradactyla or completely fused with it, forming a compound bone, in both of J . j . jaculus and J . orientalis . The second, third and fourth metatarsals differentiate distal to the mesocuneiform, ectocuneiform and cuboid, respectively, and fuse with one another into a single long cannon bone in all species. Nevertheless, the fifth metatarsal differentiates ventro‐lateral to the head of the fourth metatarsal and ossifies ventral to the head process of the developing cannon bone. The fifth metatarsal either extends to articulate with the phalanges of the fourth digit in A . tetradactyla or persists as a separate, small bone in both of J . j . jaculus and J . orientalis .

Unlike the other members of the Macropodidae so far examined, the acrosome of this species appears to be fully compacted at spermiation and extends evenly over 90% of the dorsal aspect of the nucleus. During spermiogenesis, the nucleus of the rufous hare wallaby spermatid showed evidence of uneven condensation of chromatin; this may also be related to the appearance of unusual nucleoplasm evaginations from the surface of the fully condensed spermatid. This study was unable to find evidence of the presence of Sertoli cell spurs or nuclear rotation during spermiogenesis in the rufous hare wallaby. The majority of spermatozoa immediately before spermiation had a nucleus that was essentially perpendicular to the long axis of the sperm tail. Nuclei of spermatozoa found in the process of being released or isolated in the lumen of the seminiferous tubule were rotated almost parallel to the long axis of the flagellum; complete parallel alignment occurred during epididymal maturation. At spermiation spermatozoa have characteristically small cytoplasmic remnants compared to those of other macropods. Unlike the majority of macropodid spermatozoa so far described, the spermatozoa of the rufous hare wallaby showed little evidence of morphological change during epididymal transit. There was no formation of a fibre network around the midpiece or of plasma membrane specializations in this region; the only notable change was a distinctive flattening of midpiece mitochondria and scalloping of the anterior mitochondrial sheath to accommodate the sperm head. Preliminary evidence from spermiogenesis and epididymal sperm maturation supports the classification of the rufous hare wallaby as a separate genus but also indicates that its higher taxonomic position may need to be re‐evaluated.",

Spines are denser on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the anterior and middle parts of the body and less dense towards the posterior end. The tegumental fold surrounding the ventral sucker of A. absconditum has spines while the fold of A. spiniceps lacks them. The most important morphological features differentiating both species are the number of circumoral spines, body shape, ratio of body length to width, sucker sizes, and the presence or absence of spines on the ventral sucker.",

The results support the Hansen and Rohwer theory of coverable badges, are consistent with the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis and with the good genes model suggesting that, on a population level, the expression of secondary sexual traits should be an honest signal positively associated with traits that are beneficial for survival.

The caudal musculature consists of the superficial ilio‐caudalis and ischio‐caudalis and the deeper ventral caudo‐femoralis brevis and caudo‐femoralis longus . There is an accessory tendon extending between the outer border of the tendon of the caudo‐femoralis longus and the tendinous origin of the gastrocnemius . In the male the copulatory organ is provided with a retractor muscle. Attached to the ventral surface of the penis sheath is another muscle which helps in everting the penis. This latter muscle is present in the female also as a vestigeal one attached to the postero‐lateral corners of the cloacal chamber. The modifications in the caudal musculature are attributable to the gliding habits of this lizard. Draco dussumieri , the South Indian Flying Lizard is unique in having a patagium for gliding from tree to tree. Associated with the development of the patagium, the musculature has undergone a number of adaptive modifications. The modifications of the trunk musculature have been published elsewhere (John 1970). The present communication is a study of the caudal musculature of this lizard.",

The results reveal that this organ is covered by a layer of simple epithelium and that there are some differences between the epithelium facing the mantle shelf and that facing the mantle cavity. The former consists of columnar cells, which may have a secretory function, whereas the latter is a cuboidal epithelium. Underneath the epithelium and along the whole gland there are fibres of smooth muscle and collagen, organized in groups of parallel bundles. There are vesicles of different diameters, apparently with similar morphology. Some are filled with ink, whereas others are either granular or clear. The ink is released through a duct formed by invaginations of the cuboidal epithelium. Tests with bromophenol blue and periodic acid Schiff indicated that the ink and granulated vesicles contain proteins and carbohydrates or maybe glycoproteins. Between the fibre bundles and the vesicles there are dispersed cells. A diagram is presented emphasizing the covering epithelium, the distribution of muscle and collagen fibres, the dispersed cells, vesicles and ducts. This organization is similar to that of the other Aplysia species studied to date, A . californica .",

Lack of investment in parental care results in high annual fecundities of female parasitic birds. Brood parasites lay eggs in series or clutches, separated by gaps or non‐laying intervals of a few days, but they may continuously lay for prolonged periods. In tropical latitudes, the fecundity of female shiny cowbirds ( Molothrus bonariensis ) has been estimated to be 120 eggs per year in a six‐month breeding season, a fecundity that is paralleled only by domestic fowl. However, no detailed morphological descriptions of the reproductive tracts of brood parasites are available. We studied the reproductive tract of female shiny cowbirds in northeastern Colombia, searching for morphological features that might be related to this high fecundity. The reproductive tracts of female shiny cowbird showed no departures from the standard morphology or follicular dynamics known for birds with different postural patterns and fecundities, suggesting that high fecundity in cowbirds does not require a specialized reproductive tract. Instead, explanations must be sought at physiological levels.",

Adult females ( n = 23) had body masses of 13.0–19.0 g, with forelimbs 3.83–4.33 cm in length. All adult females were pregnant, with pregnancies observed during every month except May, September and November when no adult females were captured. Female M. minimus in Brunei have a reproductive cycle that is consistent with a pattern of seasonal bimodal polyoestry. Most births appear to occur from November to May, during which time females experience two births: the first centred around November and December, and the second centred around April and May. These two birth seasons appear correlated to the two seasons of greater rainfall in Brunei: October to December, and April to July. Oestrous and mating apparently occur soon after each birth; however, there appears to be a 2‐ to 3‐month period of delayed embryonic development following the births centred around April and May. The data are consistent with embryonic development commencing around July and August (after a delay) for the births centred around November and December, and around December and January for the births centred around April and May. The data suggest that all adult females participate in each breeding season. Adult males ( n = 20) had body masses of 12.5–18.0 g, with forelimbs 3.91–4.26 cm in length.",

The goals of this study are to provide a description of the skeleton of R. jordani as a baseline contribution for future systematic comparisons among all bathymasterid taxa and zoarcoids. We used our osteological study to discuss ontogenetically variable characters that appear to carry phylogenetic signal within Zoarcoidei. Finally, we discuss the systematic relationships of Bathymasteridae, including its monophyly and their systematic relationships. The vertebrae of Bathymasteridae develop in two distinct patterns. In Ronquilus and Bathymaster , the vertebrae initially form in the mid‐caudal region and development proceeds both anteriorly and posteriorly until the entire vertebral column is complete. In contrast, in Rathbunella the vertebrae initially form immediately posterior to the skull and development proceeds posteriorly; this is interpreted to be plesiomorphic. Other characters that were clarified (e.g., presence of well‐developed teeth on the gill rakers of Ronquilus ) or described (e.g., variation in fusion caudal skeleton elements across Zoarcoidei) now must be evaluated in a taxonomically comprehensive systematic analysis of Zoarcoidei.",

Data on the external morphology, presence of gonopores, carapace length (CL) and cheliped lengths (Lch) were obtained. In addition, the gonads were processed for histological analysis. The animals were divided into three categories: A, individuals with male characteristics; B, those presenting exclusively female characteristics; C, animals with characteristics of intersex, which presented supernumerary gonopores. Positive allometries were found for Lch versus CL only for category A, characterizing the group's marked heterochely. Histologically, it was possible to observe the presence of oocytes in category A and one case of male tissue in an intersex individual (category C). However, no genital ducts of both sexes were found in that individual.

The spermatogenic cycle of Sceloporus variabilis was recently assessed using the aforementioned methodology, and only two spermatogenic phases (recrudescence and maximum activity) were observed. The authors hypothesized that quiescence and regression must occur in a short period (less than a month), which was not visualized by their monthly sampling methods. Thus, the entire spermatogenic cycle displayed by this species may have not been adequately represented. The present study assessed the spermatogenic cycle of S. variabilis in those months where the spermatogenic activity passes from maximum activity (July) to recrudescence (August) using weekly sampling to test the hypothesis that quiescence and regression do indeed occur. The results showed a regression period for 2 weeks, whereas quiescence was not observed. These results lead us to two hypotheses: (a) quiescence occurs in a very short period (days/hours) or (b) does not occur in this species. The data generated in this study suggest that species exhibiting rapid changes in spermatogenic activity need to be assessed at more frequent intervals to accurately depict the spermatogenic stages.",

Morphometric and genetic analyses were conducted on the 43 specimens recovered.

While clear morphological distinctions were observed between male and female fish, limited morphometric analyses could not differentiate between members of the three genetic groups.

A total of 1,122 adult S. dimorphus and 549 adult P. bouvieri derived from demersal research trawl surveys were examined to investigate parameters of population structure, carcinoecia association and morphology. S. dimorphus had a female‐biased sex ratio of 1:1.5, and P. bouvieri an equal sex ratio of 1:1. The proportion of males of both species increased with cephalothoracic shield length (CL). The lengths of the major right chelipeds of both S. dimorphus males and females, and P. bouvieri males were positively allometric, and negatively allometric in P. bouvieri females. All P. bouvieri inhabited carcinoecia, while 3.39% ( n = 38) of S. dimorphus specimens occupied gastropod shells. There was a positive relationship between S. dimorphus CL and rate of gastropod shell occupation ( r 2 = 0.96). In S. dimorphus, number of zoanthid polyps forming the carcinoecia pseudoshell increased with both total shell volume ( R 2 = 0.73) and colony height ( R 2 = 0.61), but no such relationships were found for P. bouvieri . Euspira napus was the most common original shell around which carcinoecia developed in both S. dimorphus (45.45%) and P. bouvieri (39.00%). We speculate that these hermit species exist along an evolutionary continuum of carcinoecia use. Sympagurus dimorphus retains the ability to occupy both gastropod shells and pseudoshells and, like most other hermit crabs, continue to use shells/carcinoecia as shelters to protect the entire body. In contrast, adult P. bouvieri appear to be totally reliant on carcinoecia, which they use more as a brood pouch covering only the abdomen, rather than as a shelter into which they can fully retract to escape predation.",

The part of the body that first contacts the substrate may vary among taxa. The limbs and pectoral girdle muscles as well as those of the caudopelvic region, involved with landing and take‐off behaviours, are investigated. The existence of a relationship exists between myology and different take‐off and landing behaviours is explored. The results suggest that most of the muscles involved in both take‐off and landing are conserved morphologically, with only few differing, depending on the locomotor behaviour. Two muscles tend to be longer; the m. coracobrachialis, which is involved with landing, and the m. coccygeosacralis, related to the take‐off.",

This study pointed to investigate the light and ultrastructural features of the renal tissue of this lizard. Microscopically, the lizard nephron deprived from loop of henle and no demarcation could be detected between the cortical and medullary tissues. The renal corpuscles were small, but complex structures. The proximal convoluted tubules were lined by acidophilic cuboidal cells with hemosiderin pigment in their apical cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of the distal convoluted tubular cells reacted strongly with alcian blue stain. The sexual segment of the lizard kidney was lined with high columnar cells with massive periodic acid–Schiff‐positive/alcian blue‐negative supra‐nuclear granules. Ultrastructurally, the basal infoldings of the proximal convoluted cells were evident. Supra‐nuclear electron‐dense vesicles were detected in the cytoplasm of the sexual segment cells. In summary, the kidney of the Egyptian Nile monitor lizard shares many histochemical features with other reptiles. However, they own several structural specializations in order to adapt to their harsh environments. Future studies focusing on the histochemical components of the sexual segment secretion would be required.",

Hyaluronate is detected using a biotinilated hyaluronate binding protein and anti‐biotin antibodies coupled to gold and silver intensification. Hyaluronate appears among migrating keratinocytes of the wound epidermis and mesenchymal cells of the blastema at 3–6 days post‐amputation. Immunofluorescence for 5BrdU indicates that most proliferation of the wound epidermis and blastema occurs among mesenchymal and bone cells of the amputated lepidotrichia. Few keratinocytes proliferate indicating they mainly derive by migration from the stump borders. Among blastema and epithelial cells, numerous apparently pycnotic cells are present at 3–6 days of regeneration, most identified as immune cells. Silver intensification clearly shows that blastema cells are surrounded by hyaluronate suggesting that this glycosaminoglycan limits the contact between immune and blastema cells, perhaps avoiding an immune reaction that would damage survival of the blastema. Hyaluronate labelling decreases between connective and bone cells in proximal regions at 14–16 days post‐amputation and is low to absent in normal stump tissues. The study suggests that a high level of hyaluronate located among cells is essential for the formation of a regenerating blastema in fish and in other vertebrates.",

This study aimed to describe macroscopic and microscopic stages of gonad development in females of Plagusia depressa (Fabricius, 1775). Thirty females of P. depressa were captured manually and underwent analgesia by decreasing temperature to collect the gonads, which underwent standard histological techniques. The macroscopic and microscopic appearance of the ovaries and the frequency of germ cells and their location in the organ were used to determine the stage of gonadal development. A total of four stages were defined. Stage 1: marks the end and beginning of gonadal maturation cycle. The germinal zone is tightly reduced with few oogonia and pre‐vitellogenic oocytes are rarely observed. Stage 2: yellow to orange colour and firm consistency. Oogonias and pre‐vitellogenic oocytes can be observed at this stage, as well as a few vitellogenic oocytes at organ limits. Stage 3: colour between red and dark brown. The gonad already presents many mature oocytes. Stage 4: characterized by the abundance of mature oocytes that occupy almost the entire organ. Macroscopic appearance of the female reproductive system, cell characteristics and changes during maturation of P. depressa corroborate with the normally found in Malacostraca.",

Morphogenesis and cell proliferation in claws of turtle and alligator have been analysed by immunolabelling and thymidine autoradiography. Proliferating cells are randomly distributed in the epidermis and mesenchyme at the tip of forming digits. Developing claws elongate with a dorsal curvature forming the unguis. Numerous proliferating keratinocytes are present in the unguis at 4 hr–1 day after injection of 5BrdU or by PCNA detection. Their size increases before being incorporated into the ungueal corneous layer. Immunolabelling at 3–6 days post‐injection of 5BrdU indicates that proliferating keratinocytes move towards the tip of the claw giving rise to the claw pad. The ventral side of the claw termed sub‐unguis shows a lower proliferation that expands the surface and produces thin corneocytes that are desquamated. Autoradiography and immunolabelling indicates that proliferating cells of growing turtle claws are present along most of the germinal epidermis 7 hr–1 day after injection of tritiated thymidine or 5BrdU. Low labelled corneocytes incorporated into the corneous layer are detected at 6–12 days post‐injection, generally localized towards the tip of the claw, indicating they have migrated distally. The study confirms that claws of reptiles have an extended proliferative zone instead of a localized proximal germinal matrix as in mammalian claws.",

Response to competition: Geometric Morphometric and Allometric Change Analysis. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 453–464. The chondrocranial development of Pelodytes punctatus is described, from tadpole to froglet, and compared with that of other taxa reported previously, such as species in the Pelobatidae, Pipidae, Ranidae, Hylidae, Bombinatoridae, Leptodactylidae, or Microhylidae families. The comparison leads us to suggest that the ontogeny of the anuran chondrocranium is very conservative, making it difficult to discern phylogenetic or ecologic patterns. Chondrocranial development is also analyzed to quantify shape changes and allometries during ontogeny, using linear and geometric morphometrics. The main shape change observed follows the general pattern of vertebrate postnatal development. The allometric analysis indicates the presence of different functional units in the chondrocranium that could be subjected to different pressures. Finally, tadpoles were raised in two conditions of competition to compare their chondrocranium development. The largest shape differences between the two conditions are located in the anterior region of the cranium and fit the general response to competition stress by increasing growth rate. Comparison of the scaling pattern between Pelodytes and Rana sylvatica and Bufo americanus shows differences, principally in the oral region, that do not fit with the general allometric pattern in larval anurans proposed in previous studies.",

Histomorphology showed that the bronchial wall consists (from luminal to abluminal) of squamous epithelium, subepithelial capillary bed, cartilage rings or cartilage plates, a layer of dense connective tissue, a layer of smooth muscle cells, and squamous epithelium (serosa). SEM of VCC s reveals that bilaterally a ventral, a dorsal (Ø 77.21 ± 7.61 μm), and a caudal bronchial artery supply the bronchial subepithelial capillary bed. The ventral bronchial artery has 3–4 branching orders (interbranching distances: 506.3 ± 392.12 μm; branching angles of first‐ and second‐order bifurcations: 24.60 ± 10.24° and 29.59 ± 14.3°).

The location of the dense subepithelial capillary meshwork just beneath the thin squamous bronchial epithelium and its drainage into the pulmonary veins make it likely that in X enopus, bronchi assist in aerial gas exchange.",

We investigated spatial variations in the morphometric characteristics (total length of body, lengths of cephalothorax, abdomen and antennules, and their relative proportions) of Pseudocalanus minutus , an abundant copepod species across the Barents Sea in August–September 2007. Females were found to have higher values for the measured parameters than males. The average absolute morphometric characters of both sexes increased from the south to the north. In most cases, parameters were similar in the southern, central, and eastern regions delineated by cluster analyses of oceanographic variables. The morphometric characteristics were strongly correlated with environmental variables in both males and females. Multiple regression analysis showed that temperature together with salinity explained 72–85% (in females) and 38–91% (in males) of the total variations in the log 10 ‐transformed morphometric parameters. According to principal component analysis and discriminant function analysis, two distinct groups could be separated in the Barents Sea. The first group included the copepods from the northern region; the other included populations from the southern, central, and eastern regions. The observed morphological variation can be interpreted as geographical variation connected with hydrological variability.",

The flagellum is composed of an axoneme, a mitochondrion and a dense rod adjacent to the mitochondrion. A centriolar adjunct is also observed surrounding the axoneme in the initial portion of the flagellum and extends along the flagellum for at least 2 μm, surrounding the axoneme in a half‐moon shape. The axoneme is the longest component of the flagellum, and it follows the 9+9+0 pattern, with no central pair of microtubules. At the posterior region of the flagellum, the mitochondrion has a dumb‐bell shape in cross sections that, together with the rectangular mitochondrial‐associated rod, is responsible for the flattened shape of the flagellum. An internal membrane is observed surrounding both mitochondrion and its associated structure.",

Results confirm published findings gained by microscopical dissections with respect to gross arterial supply. However, in adult frogs one rather than two thyroid veins are found. This study reveals for the first time that bilaterally located thyroid glands in premetamorphosis have immature capillary networks, lack a clear hierarchy of blood vessels, and show many signs of sprouting angiogenesis. During metamorphic climax, blood vessels gain a clear hierarchy and capillaries form closed networks around thyroid follicles. From climax onwards, non‐sprouting angiogenesis (intussusceptive microvascular growth) becomes the prevailing mode of angiogenesis intensifying follicle capillarization. Due to narrow interfollicular spaces, thyroidal arterioles remain superficial while draining venules are located interfollicularly. In contrast with the mammalian thyroid gland where most thyroid follicles have their own capillary beds, most thyroid follicles in Xenopus share their capillary beds with neighbouring follicles. Consequently, the concept of individual morphological and functional angiofollicular units applicable to adult mammalian and human thyroid glands is not applicable to larval and adult amphibian thyroid glands.",

In spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes of both species, the proteins were localized mainly in the intercellular bridges and, in lesser quantities, in the cytoplasm. Overall, actin was present along the plasma‐lemmal contact sites of the gonial cells. At the beginning of spermatid elongation, actin could be detected in two regions: in perinuclear cytoplasm and under the plasmalemma. Subplasmalemmal actin, visible as threads running along acrosome‐adhering protrusions of the nuclear envelope, is supposedly located within the electron‐dense material filling the subacrosomal gap. Tubulin was found on both sides of each actin thread; its location was consistent with two sets of microtubules adhering to the inner acrosomal membrane. Their involvement in acrosome shaping is suggested. As spermatid elongation terminated, the previous pattern of proteins disappeared. In Pergamasus , however, actin emerged briefly near the centrifugal ends of spermatids (granular bodies zone). In spermatocyte‐containing cysts, actin and tubulin fluorescence (more pronounced in Porrhostaspis ) was associated with intercellular junctions between the cyst cells. In both species, diffuse actin fluorescence was also detected in the cytoplasm of cyst cells assembling elongated spermatids; the reaction was intensified at the end of the elongation process, when the cytoplasm of cyst cells aggregated around the centripetal ends of spermatids.",

No trace of the anterior leg‐pair, nor of its sternum, could be found in these rings. At the moult to the next stadium (?IV), the normal, diplopodous condition is restored. The term haplopodous diplopods is suggested for the deviating juveniles of G. granulatus and T. tjampeanus.

Evolution of aquatic vertebrates led from heavy, benthic, microphagous animals to buoyant, agile, omnivorous ones. Key events of this evolution took place in fresh water, while most crustacean groups probably evolved in marine habitats. It is pointed out that until early Jurassic times the caridoid escape reaction obviously ensured the survival of eucarid species, while the later radiation suggests that selection favoured well‐calcified and short‐tailed species. It is suspected that the radiation of the marine Teleostei is a main cause of this evolution. This hypothesis is in accordance with the occurrence of the most archaic crustacean relict species in fish‐free habitats.",

Numerous brown‐green vesicles were discovered in both the epithelial cells and lumen of sacculations. Transmission electron microscopy revealed these bodies to be heterophagic vacuoles and residual bodies. Morphological evidence suggests that hepatic caeca are involved in intracellular digestion. Once endocytosed food particles are packaged as heterophagic vacuoles, and digestion has been completed, the residual bodies are packaged together and exuded from the cell in a spherule of cytoplasm.",

This single microtubule is found in the mature spermatozoon of both species and was also noted in capsalids. This requires a modified definition of ‘pattern 2’ of spermatozoa which becomes: ‘spermatozoa with two axonemes and no cortical microtubules, except one single element much shorter than the spermatozoon’. A very unusual structure was found in Myxinidocotyle , but not in Acanthocotyle : the centriolar derivative of one of the 9+‘1’ axonemes is made up of 18 diverging singlets of unequal length associated with electron‐dense cytoplasm. This seems to be the first case of a centriolar derivative without nine‐fold symmetry associated with an axoneme with nine‐fold symmetry.",

The wall of this pouch contains (I) an epidermis comprising typical lamprey epidermal cells, (II) a thick dermis consisting of layers of collagen fibres, with intervening oxytalan fibres, and a vascular network, and (III) a hypodermis. The hypodermis contains active fibroblasts embedded in an extracellular matrix, comprising collagen fibrils, some of which form dense bundles, together with oxytalan fibres and an amorphous material that contains glycosaminoglycans. The hypodermis also contains arteries, which are innervated and confluent with a large anastomosing system of sinuses. Since these sinuses open at intervals into the large central cavity of the pouch, it is proposed that, at maturity, they discharge blood into the central lumen of the pouch, thereby causing the pouch to become distended. The degree of such distension would be regulated by the limited elasticity of the dermal collagen fibres. The dermis is thickest in those regions where the pouch is most susceptible to abrasion. The Weibel–Palade bodies, which are abundant in the sinus endothelia, may facilitate tissue repair where neccessary. The gular pouch is thus a specialised structure, which may play a role in courtship or the spawning act.",

The most rostral of them, the organon vasculosum hypothalami, located dorsally at the mid and caudal hypothalamus level, showed under electron microscopy some monoaminergic cells and others with an abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The cerebrospinal fluid‐contacting processes of both cell types, in association with numerous fibres, terminal buttons and some capillaries, constitute a thick and complex intraventricular mat. The other two fluorescent regions, nucleus recessi lateralis and nucleus recessi posterioris, border the lateral and posterior recesses of the hypothalamus. The ultrastructural characteristics of the organon vasculosum hypothalami and its intraventricular mat suggest a function in the regulation of chemical changes in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Neuronal and non‐neuronal constituents of the myenteric plexus are divided into smaller units by endoneurial collagen which in places condenses to form a perineurial covering. The myenteric plexus is avascular but arterioles and fenestrated capillaries are present close to the plexus in the intermuscular space. Small groups of neurones constitute the ganglia of the plexus but as yet few ultrastructural indications of differing neurone types have been observed. Within the neuropil of the ganglia five types of axon profile, characterised by their vesicle content, have been identified. One of these types was only recognisable following the administration of 5‐hydroxydopamine. Axo‐somatic and axo‐dendritic synaptic contacts were only made by Type 1 axons but these were uncommon. The presence of an adrenergic component of the myenteric plexus was confirmed ultrastructually following 6‐hydroxydopamine‐induced degeneration and also by Falck‐Hillarp fluorescence histochemistry which revealed an extensive distribution of adrenergic nerves in the plexus. The structural organisation of the plexus, the comparatively few ultrastructurally recognisable axon and neurone types and the sparsity of synaptic contacts all indicate that the teleost myenteric plexus is less complex than its mammalian counterpart.",

Caudal epididymal biopsies were taken from two male H. moschatus and prepared for transmission and scanning electron microscopy in order to study mature spermatozoan ultrastructure. Within the diprotodont group, several features were found to be unique to H. moschatus . These were an unusual acrosome covering nearly 100% of the dorsal nuclear surface, a midpiece fibre network which is loose, indistinct and extends to the anterior‐most aspect of the midpiece, a nucleus that is very streamlined, while the principal piece is comparatively short, and a mitochondrial helix and annulus which are similar to those of dasyurids. Also reported is the presence of a fibrous network in the connecting piece, not previously reported for any marsupial.",

Each gland contained acidic cells, positive for both periodic acid Schiff and Alcian blue reactions. These cells can be distinguished as seromucous and mucous types based on the different electron density of their granules. α‐Amylase, until now detected only in mammalian salivary glands, was not found in any of the salivary glands examined. The ultrastructural study revealed that the salivary glandular cells of T. mauritanica lack intercellular canaliculi, which by contrast, are present between the seromucous cells in the salivary glands of C. viridiflavus and P. s. sicula . Comparable variation is also seen when the ultrastructural features of the secretory granules in salivary glands of the three Squamata species are compared. The salivary granules of T. mauritanica and C. viridiflavus are more or less dense but structureless, while the mucous granules of P. s. sicula have a distinctive and characteristic substructure. Therefore, this study, designed to obtain comparative data on the histology, histochemistry and ultrastructure of the salivary glands of three representative, but hitherto unstudied, species of Squamata, reveals great variation in the structure of these glands within the Squamata lineage, even when compared to previously documented species.",

The SEM showed changes in Sertoli cytoplasm volume during spermatogenic development. In immature spermatocysts in the germinal zone, spermatogonia were embedded in Sertoli cytoplasm. In spermatogonial spermatocysts, Sertoli cells were adluminally located in the spermatocyst, with spermatogonia enveloped in the basal portions of the cytoplasm. During the round spermatid stage, Sertoli cytoplasm was very scanty. Spermatid elongation was accompanied by a progressive increase in the volume of Sertoli cytoplasm, notably around the spermatid heads. In the mature spermatocyst, bundles of spermatozoa are totally enveloped by Sertoli cytoplasm. Spermatozoa occurred randomly in the epididymis. However, in the ampulla ductus deferentis, spermatozoa reaggregated and were embedded in a mucoid substance to form highly ordered spherical bundles. In the sperm bundle, the spermatozoa heads were arranged such that the helical turns of adjacent spermatozoa were precisely aligned, and all the heads in the bundle formed a distinct apex. This study demonstrates the utility of exploring the relationship between germ cells and Sertoli cells in an evolutionarily ancient vertebrate, such as the shark.",

The membrane of the column and the inner membrane of the posterior part of the cytoplasmic mantle (outer sheath) surrounding the vacuole bear numerous so‐called cellular processes. However, most of the outer sheath is reduced and represented solely by a very thin membrane‐like envelope. The posterior part of the cell bears extensive folds. The cell, or, more precisely, the column, shows a deep posterior invagination. This invagination contains extracellular material composed of thin filaments or strands. Peripheral folds emerging from the posterior rim of the cell form a thin‐walled tube that contains the same material as the invagination. The elongated nucleus is attached to a peculiar acrosomal complex consisting of a flat acrosomal cisterna that parallels most of the cell membrane, an attachment cone, and a short acrosomal filament which is embedded in a narrow canal within the nucleus. The spermatozoa of M. floridanus represent a peculiar version of the vacuolated type of sperm known to be plesiomorphic within the anactinotrichid Acari. Some details of spermiogenesis are described and consequences for phylogenetic and systematic considerations are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The distribution of succinic dehydrogenase activity was investigated in the pectoralis muscle of thirteen East African birds, representing five Orders. It was found that the pectoralis muscle of the most primitive birds studied (Galliformes) contained all “white” muscle fibres whereas the more advanced birds (Passeriformes) had all “red” muscle fibres. Intermediate Orders had mostly a mixture of red and white muscle fibres. There also appeared to be a direct relationship between body size and average muscle fibre size. However, it was concluded that the most important factor in relation to the muscle structure is the bird's mode of flight. The relationship with the degree of evolution and body size only held true in so far as the birds which had developed the facility for sustained flight, by increasing their red muscle fibre content, were also smaller in size and constituted the more “evolved” Orders of birds. In support of this it was noted that migratory birds (i.e. engaging in sustained flight) from more primitive Orders also had a high red muscle fibre content in their pectoralis muscles.",

This species mates and oviposits eggs in ponds from March to June. Included in the sample were 12 unmated females collected in terrestrial situations in March and mated in the laboratory. Some of these females oviposited viable eggs in the laboratory whereas others did not oviposit after mating. In addition, we examined five females with unknown mating histories that were collected from a breeding pond in June. We found that all of the specimens contained some stored sperm and were similar in spermathecal ultrastructure. The spermathecae exhibited characteristics of secretory epithelium at the end of a cycle, including irregular heterochromatic nuclei surrounded by scant cytoplasm, absence of organelles involved in synthetic activities, few secretory vacuoles, and wide intercellular canaliculi. Spermiophagy by the spermathecal epithelium was extensive. In contrast, spermathecae from females at the beginning of the breeding season as reported in our previous study were actively producing a PAS+ secretion and did not exhibit spermiophagy. Spermiophagy is a means of eliminating sperm prior to the next breeding season.",

It is described as composed of rostellum, pseudoproboscis, and two groups of glandular syncytia, one in the rostellum and the other inwards to the rostellum and the pseudoproboscis. The rostellum is a discoid cushion with muscular walls. There are numerous thin vertical muscular fibres and glandular syncytia inside it. Its tegument has slender microtriches. Peripherally, the rostellum is encircled by thin muscle fibres that protrude anteriorly between rostellar hooks and group posteriorly to form retractors. The rostellar hook guards are associated with a complicated network of muscles and nerves. The pseudoproboscis is a thick‐walled ring around the apical part of the scolex adjacent to the rostellum. Its tegument has microtriches with modified spines that are interpreted as accessory spines. The walls of the pseudoproboscis possess a loose structure of parallel muscular fibres and glandular processes. The glandular syncytia, interpreted as modified tegumental perikarya, have basophilic cytoplasm and stain positively for protein and carbohydrate. They form cellular processes, which protrude to reach to the tegument. These results provide structural details characterising one of the rostellar types recognized in the order Cyclophyllidea, i.e. the davaineid rostellar apparatus.",

Studies of the behaviour and population dynamics of mantle autotomy in F. ficus have previously been reported, but here, a detailed description of the structure of the autotomy tissue is presented for the first time. Whether or not this autotomy tissue has the secondary function of a storage compartment was also investigated through analysis of its biochemical composition. Figsnails were collected from the coast of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Histological observations indicated that the most obvious feature of the autotomy tissue is the extensive network of muscle fibres and connective tissues. In the swollen autotomy tissue, not only do the epithelia rupture, but the connective tissue expands threefold on the dorsal side and 15‐fold on the ventral side. Chemical analysis of body composition indicated that the average contents of protein, lipid, carbohydrate and ash in the foot, mantle and autotomy tissue are in the range of 55.6–76.5%, 0.6–14.1%, 2.0–27.9% and 6.5–13.5%, respectively, with the caloric value ranging from 4.7 to 5.5 kcal g −1 dry wt. The content of carbohydrate in the autotomy tissue is much less than that in the foot and mantle, i.e. 2.0–6.8% vs. 13.0–27.9%. There is no indication that the autotomy tissue serves as an energy reserve. Hence, it is suggested that the autotomy tissue functions only as a defensive weapon.",

The nerve fibers in the lamina propria and in the transitional regions between the lamina propria of each lamella and the dorsal nerves display two different appearances: 1. Small fibers (olfactory axons) range approximately between 85 and 165 nm in diameter; the cytoplasm is more electron dense than that of large fibers; one or a few microtubuli are frequently seen in the cytoplasm, whereas mitochondria are seldom observed; 2. Large fibers range approximately between 500 and 1200 nm in diameter; the cytoplasm is electron translucent and mitochondria occur frequently. Nerve fibers in the dorsal nerves have a diameter of 100 to 500 nm and within a nerve bundle they are grouped in fasciculi with an estimated fiber density of 16/μm 2 . Figers with diameter exceeding 500 nm are very seldom seen in the dorsal nerves. The small fibers are with great certainty olfactory receptor cell axons, since their size, fine structure and organization in fasciculi is entirely similar to that described in other species. The structure and distribution of large nerve fibers are discussed with regard to the possibility that they either are efferent fibers which constitute an extrinsic innervation of the olfactory epithelium or are the axons of olfactory receptor cells.",

Five categories of granular cells were distinguished both by their ultrastructural characteristics and qualitative changes throughout the year and following different treatments. The cell types are described and their functions discussed. From conventional electron microscopical studies it proved difficult to draw any satisfactory conclusions about the gonadotropic cells. Further investigation by means of immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay techniques is required to determine, whether the presumptive gonadotropic cell type produces both FSH and ICSH or only one of these hormones.

The coiled motor apparatus will then gradually uncoil, exhibit kinetic activity and finally take on a straight configuration analogous to that of spermatozoa in isotonic media. The coiling of the motor apparatus occurring in swelling spermatozoa and its uncoiling in swollen spermatozoa subjected to dehydration are processes evoked by the pressure exerted on the motor apparatus by the shape-altering cell membrane and are not dependent on the presence of any movements in the motor apparatus. Thus, these processes occur in fluoride-immobilized spermatozoa. The uncoiling process is, however, gradually inhibited and finally blocked by storing the spermatozoa previously in a hypotonic medium for a prolonged period. In this case, subsequent cellular dehydration will induce lysis of the cells and their motor apparatus will remain coiled inside the leaky membrane envelope. The background to this fact is discussed.",

An extract of three pituitaries when injected in a normal snake did not produce any change in the blood sugar level.

Microscopic and ultrastructural characters are in accordance with another limnic species of Paucitubulatina, Chaetonotus maximus , whose protonephridial system has been previously reconstructed. Shared protonephridial characters of both species include the presence of highly elongate terminal organ cilia, microvilli, and the canal cell lumen as well as the presence of a conspicuous anterior loop of the protonephridial lumen. These features are not present in representatives of earlier, marine, paucitubulatan lineages (i.e., Xenotrichulidae) and so are assessed as evolutionary novelties that were likely important for the successful colonization of the freshwater environment.",

The present ultrastructural and immunocytochemical study analyzes the cell junctions joining barb/barbule cells versus cell junctions connecting supportive cells in forming feathers. Differently from the epidermis or the sheath, desmosomes are not the prevalent junctions among feather cells. Numerous adherens junctions, some gap junctions and fewer tight junctions are present among differentiating barb/barbule cells during early stages of their differentiation. Adherens junctions are frequent also among differentiating supportive cells and show weak immunolabeling for both N-cadherin and neural-cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM). Differentiating barb and barbule cells do not show labeled junctions for N-cadherin and N-CAM. The labeling occurs at patches in the cytoplasm of supportive cells but is more frequently seen in the external cytoplasm and along the extra-cellular space (glycocalix) covering the plasma membrane of supportive cells. Labeling for N-cadherin is also found in medium-dense 0.1- to 0.3-μm granules present in supportive cells and sometimes is associated with coarse filaments or periderm granules. The study indicates that adherens junctions form most of the transitional connections among supportive cells before their degeneration. Keratinizing barb and barbule cells loose the labeling for adherens junctions (N-CAM and N-chaderin) while their adhesion is strengthened by the incorporation of cell junctions in the corneous mass forming the barbules.",

One such species, the echimyid T hrichomys apereoides , has a behavioural and social repertoire which suggests the use of its eversible anal gland in communication between individuals; however, no information on the morphology of this gland is available. In this study, the anal gland of nineteen adult individuals (11 males and 8 females) was analysed through histological and histochemical techniques. The gland was located in the submucosal of the anal region, cranial to the anus, and had an opening located dorsally in the rectum mucosa at approximately 1 mm from the anus.

The detailed stylet morphology and stylet formation during postembryonic development in the pulmonate mollusk Anisus vortex (Linnaeus, 1758) are described using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histological methods. The stylet begins to develop in the lumen of the copulatory apparatus and then assumes its final position inside the penial sac. The developing stylet lying between two epithelial layers is undergoing chitinization mediated by secretion of the secretory epithelium of the penial sac that completes on the 80–120th day after hatching of mollusks from the egg masses. The stability of the characters of stylet morphology and their significance for the systematics of Planorbidae are discussed.",

An extensive network of blood vessels, muscular fibrils and numerous collagenous fibrils in the connective tissue of the ovipositor may make a functional contribution to the ovipositor by making it firmer during egg laying. Mucous cells were detected in the medial and distal regions of the ovipositor, which may play a role in facilitating insertion of the ovipositor into the exhalant siphon of a mussel during oviposition. E uropean bitterling are batch spawners, and the female spawns eggs in clutches at intervals during the breeding season, which were visible as three distinct cohorts of oocytes in the ovary.",

The head of the captaculum, which bears the alveolar indentation, contains a large ganglion, at least three types of gland cells, circular and longitudinal muscles, and connective tissue. It is likely that gland 1 secretes mucus which is used in the transport of food particles and that gland 2 secretes material which promotes adhesion of the alveolus to the substratum. The function of gland 3 is unknown. Critical observation of the captaculum surface revealed that the cilia of the alveolar region have truncated tips unlike those found on other regions of the captaculum.

The posterior is made up of the hyoid artery which, after giving rise to the stapedial artery, enters the chondrocranium to originate the internal carotid and the cerebral arteries. The efferent pseudobranchial artery forms the anterior coiling, gives rise to the ophthalmic artery, enters the orbitary wall and joins the internal carotid artery. The histological sections of the arterial coilings showed the scarcity of smooth muscle cells in the tunica media as well as an important collagenic and elastic component in the arterial wall. Several venous vessels percolate through the coilings. A large amount of small (mean diameter = 73 μm), spheric corpuscles were observed in the connective tissue around the coilings. These corpuscles were also present in the palate and under the skin of the head of these sharks. They are comprised of spirally‐arranged cells around a bundle of collagen fibres. We hypothesize that their association with the coilings could suggest some kind of involvement in detecting pressure changes in the blood supply to the head.",

The visceral epithelium within these species shows considerable variation in the branching mode of the cellular processes, in the number of pedicels and in the form of cell bodies. The presence of various podocyte cell forms within anurans of one family (e.g. within Ranidae and Discoglossidae ) indicates that podocytic structure is not manifested phylogenetically. The complexity of processes and pedicel numbers are high in glomeruli of terrestrial and semiterrestrial frogs but low in aquatic and semiaquatic animals. Consequently, podocyte structure is (a) correlated with environmental conditions and (b) plays an important role in osmoregulation. Furthermore, since podocytes are suggested to serve as stabilizers of glomerular vessels, the cells of the visceral epithelium provide the structural basis for regulation of glomerular filtration rate, e.g. for glomerular intermittency.",

Fibres, which are morphologically similar to the elastic fibres of gnathostomatous (jawed) vertebrates, are shown to be present in the ventral aorta of the hagfish Paramyxine atami , and also, but to a lesser extent, the dorsal aorta of this species and the ventral aorta of another hagfish, Eptatretus stouti. The ‘elastic’ tissue formed irregular sheet‐like aggregates, comprising well‐defined amorphous material surrounded by tubular microfibrils, whose diameters ranged from 10 to 15 nm. While this tissue was most abundant in the same region of the aortae as that occupied by the elastica interna in the blood vessels of gnathostomes, it was also found deeper in the wall of these blood vessels. Although tubular microfibrils were found in the ventral aorta of the hagfish Myxine glutinosa and the lamprey Geotria australis , these were never associated with well–defined, amorphous material. This parallels the results of previous studies on Myxine glutinosa and another species of lamprey, Petromyzon marinus. Thus, the elastic fibre–like tissues found in the ventral aortae of P. atami and E. stouti provide the first examples of such structures in this region in agnathan vertebrates.",

All frogs ovulated during hibernation which was interrupted in mid‐May, but in seven out of 19 frogs ovulation was incomplete. The number of non‐ovulated oocytes varied from a minor fraction to about two thirds of the complement of vitellogenic oocytes, indicating that the follicle size reached at the time of induced hibernation was at the critical level for successful maturation. This critical size was about half the normal oocyte volume at the onset of natural hibernation. There was no vitellogenic growth during hibernation, which presumably constitutes the period of follicle maturation. In five of the frogs, oogenesis sensu stricto had occurred during the period of hibernation, some oogenic events being completely finished at autopsy in mid‐May and others still progressing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Male silver eels kept in fresh water were injected with 17α‐methyltestosterone (MT). They received 5, 10, 15 or 20 injections (8 μg/g every other day) or 6 or 9 injections (4 μg/g or 2.5 μg/g once a week). Compared to solvent‐injected controls, the treated eels showed changes in the pituitary: prolactin, corticotropic, thyrotropic and melanotropic cells were stimulated. Gonadotropic cells had enlarged nuclei, but synthesis and storage of granules and large globules were not evident, despite the progressive testicular maturation. High doses of MT induced a liver hypertrophy, a drop in plasma osmolarity and sodium level. An increase in plasma calcium level is possibly involved in the reduced activity of PAS‐positive Ca‐sensitive cells of the pars intermedia. These responses, previously observed in estradiol (E2) treated eels, may suggest that MT is aromatized in the brain and/or the pituitary. However, the considerable stimulation of GTH cells which always occurs in E2‐treated eels is absent in MT‐treated eels. With lower doses of MT, changes in the pituitary and the testis were similar to those produced by high doses, although the Ca‐sensitive cells were more active. The decrease in plasma osmolarity and sodium level was less marked, plasma calcium was slightly reduced and the liver was not modified. There is no clear evidence in favour of E2 production. These data suggest that MT may stimulate the gonad directly, in agreement with biochemical data by Dufour et al. (1983).",

    "abstract": "Abstract The patterns of production and growth of oocytes were studied in female toads brought into the laboratory after hibernation and kept at 20°C. The oogenic state of the ovaries was determined from the number and size frequency distribution of the oocytes, and change in oogenic state was followed by comparing ovarian biopsies with the ovaries at autopsy one month later. New oocytes grew within one month to sizes up to 0.16 mm or more in diameter, and were integrated in the existing pool of small oocytes. Production of new oocytes continued for more than one month, perhaps 2–3 months, to increase the pool of oocytes by about 50%. An episode of oogenesis sensu stricto is followed by a resting period, probably lasting for about 1–2 years. Oogenesis was not coordinated with ovulation or recruitment of oocytes to vitellogenic growth and it occurred also in the ovaries of sexually immature toads. Exogenous gonadotropin (hCG) and/or fasting for one month of toads in a good nutritional condition did not affect oogenesis, but no oogenic episodes were observed in the ovaries of starving toads that were depleted of energy reserves. It is concluded that oogenesis and growth of oocytes constitute a dynamic system that is only inadequately described by the widely accepted linear, sequential model of production of eggs in amphibians and teleosts.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to shed some light on the systems controlling the contractile activities in the sea urchin pluteus, their pharmacological properties, the regional organization of the structures involved, their interactions, and their physiological roles. Physostigmine may bring about tetanic celomic activity of long duration. In spite of this it is possible to recognize the two activity patterns elicited by carbachol. The effects of the two agents, together with some histochemical data, suggests the occurrence of two control systems. The main muscular control system may be linked to adjoining cholinergic and mono-aminergic structures close to the mouth and is presumably responsible for the “reciprocal antagonism” between swallowing and celomic movements when the larva is stimulated (activity pattern I). It may involve intricate interactions between the cholinergic and monoaminergic components in the generation of muscular impulses. Another control system is presumably linked to neurons extending from the main ciliated band and responsible for the intestinal cycling and the “non-antagonistic” muscular activity (activity pattern II). After strong stimulation both control systems may become “exhausted” in some respects, but may eventually recover. In comparison with the effects of carbachol, the physostigmine effects are not quickly reversible which indicates that, to a great extent, they are due to inhibition of cholinesterase in deeper parts of the two control systems.",

The corpora cardiaca (CC) and corpora allata (CA) of the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella, were studied at the ultrastructural level during induction maintenance, and termination of larval diapause. The CC is composed of 5–6 intrinsic secretory (IS) cells, glial cells, and axons that carry electron dense (ED) and electron lucent (EL) granules from the brain. The IS cells produce ED granules with an average diameter of 110 ± 26 nm. During diapause, the axons with ED granules showed large accumulations of neurosecretory granules, but the axons with the EL granules contained lesser amounts. The CA is made up of approximately 25 large cells and axons that pass through the CC from the brain. Most of the axons take up a peripheral position. A characteristic feature of CA cells during diapause was the presence of stacks of convoluted tubules of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) that may be associated with juvenile hormone synthesis. The IS cells of the CC appeared to be inactive during diapause.",

The organ of Bellonci, a complex of cephalic receptors, has previously been reported from two ostracode groups. On morphologic grounds, a cephalic receptor of a third ostracode group (Cladocopa) is believed to be an organ of Bellonci. The organ is situated on the forehead above the first pair of antennae and consists of two feathered hairs. Two nerves, each formed by one dendrite, run from the protocerebrum into the hairs where they terminate with ramose cilia. The dendrites, as well as the cilia and ciliary branches, are enveloped by glial cells. Distally, these cells form cavities around the ciliary branches. The ciliated neuronal connection and the glial cavities, together with other morphologic characteristics of the organ, support a homologization with the organ of Bellonci of other myodocopid ostracodes.",

They can be distinguished by the appearance of their secretory granules. The PAS+ cells stain with toluidine blue in semithin sections as opposed to the PbH+ cells. After 5 days' treatment with metopirone the PbH+ cells are highly activated whereas the PAS+ cells show no response. The PbH+ cells are assumed to produce MSH. In roaches adapted to diluted sea water (10%) the transfer to fresh water for 1—1 1/2 hours or reserpine injections for the same period had no notable effect on neither cell type. Three kinds of axons innervate the PI. Two of these, which have granules averaging 111 nm and 151 nm in diameter, originate in the nucleus preopticus (NPO). The third type of axons has granules of an average size of 74 nm and is probably aminergic. The glia cells in this part of the neurohypophysis (NH) are granular pituicytes, which are innervated by all three axon types. The border between the NH and the PI is composed of a double basement membrane from which a network extends into the NH. This network, the basement membrane and the capillaries are the main sites for the terminations of the axons although nerve fibers also invade the endocrine tissue. Only axon type 3 was observed to synapse frequently with the PbH+ cells.",

As a rule, the middle coxa contains a separate coxite, the mediocoxite, articulated to the sternal process. In most families, this coxite is movably articulated to the eucoxite and to the distocoxite area; the coxa is radially split twice. Some groups are characterized by a single split. The coxa in flies is restricted in its rotation owing to a partial junction either between the meron and the pleurite or between the eucoxite and the meropleurite. Hence the coxa is fastened to the thorax not only by two pivots (to the pleural ridge and the sternal process), but at the junction named above. Rotation is impossible without deformations; the role of hinges between coxites is to absorb deformations. This adaptive principle is confirmed by physical modelling. Middle coxae of limoniid tribes Eriopterini and Molophilini are compact, constructed by the template of hind coxae. On the contrary, hind coxae in all families of Mycetophiloidea and in Psychodidae s.l. are constructed like middle ones, with the separate mediocoxite, centrally suspended at the sternal process. These cases are considered as homeotic mutations, substituting one structure with a no less efficient one.",

The germinal epithelium varied from a proliferative continuous germinal epithelium during the regenerating and development phases to a sperm storing discontinuous germinal epithelium during the Spawning Capable and Regressing phases. The seminiferous lobules ranged from a simple unrestricted lobular organization to an anastomosing‐like testis that transformed the testis of A. grunniens into a sperm storage organ.

This study reassesses and provides new descriptions of the paired fins of Squalus acanthias , including comparisons with other representatives of Squalidae, aimed to expand the anatomical information of these species. All examined species of Squalus have two sites in the scapulocoracoid for the articulation of the pectoral basals: one facet articulating with the propterygium and a condyle for the mesopterygium (or both meso‐ and metapterygium). Additionally, the scapulocoracoid does not have a scapular process. Squalus acanthias is unique for having a series of barrel‐shaped elements in the anterior region of the scapula. These elements are lacking in all other examined species of Squalus and Cirrhigaleus (and sharks in general) and are likely an autapomorphy of S . acanthias .",

Acta Zoologica (Stockolm). Lizard epidermis is formed by alternating layers of hard corneous beta‐layers and softer and pliable alpha‐layers. After tail amputation in the lizard Podarcis muralis, the tail regenerates within a month forming neogenic scales. The differentiation of beta‐ and alpha‐layers in the epidermis has been studied by immunofluorescence detection of cell adhesion molecules. Initially, the thick wound epidermis shows high content in L‐CAM and N‐CAM in comparison with normal epidermis, including pre‐corneous layers where labelling is intense in the cytoplasm and along the keratinocyte perimeter. L‐ and N‐CAMs are also observed in the regenerating ependyma and N‐CAM in mesenchymal cells of blastema. The apical regenerating (wound) epidermis often shows nuclear localization in basal layers, especially for E‐cadherin, perhaps indicating epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Sections of regenerating scales show the typical renewal phase of the epidermis, with an intensification of L‐CAM, N‐CAM and general cadherin immunofluorescence in the forming clear‐Oberhautchen layers, and in the following beta‐ and alpha‐layers as they start to differentiate from the basal layer. A higher immunolabelling for cell adhesion cadherins suggests that these proteins contribute to form an integrated epidermal unit along the regenerating scales that allows the ordered stratification and shedding of these layers in lizard epidermis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this study was to assess testicular morphology and spermatozoal structure spatially within the reproductive tract and temporally among seasons in the sauger ( Sander canadensis ). The testis exists as two separate lobes joined at the urogenital pore and were characterised as unrestricted lobular with seminiferous tubules terminating at the ventral periphery and coalescing dorsally on the main sperm duct. Differences were observed between the pre‐breeding season (November) and breeding season (March), with every stage of spermatogenesis occurring in spermatocysts in pre‐breeding season in contrast to only spermatozoa being present in the tubules and main duct during the breeding season. Longitudinal folds in the main duct epithelium increased in number with increasing proximity to the urogenital pore, greatly increasing epithelial height regardless of season. Sauger spermatozoa consisted of an ovoid head, a midpiece containing 2 – 4 mitochondria incorporated into the head and a single flagellum containing an asymmetrical lateral ribbon. Motile spermatozoa were found throughout the testis during the breeding season. A decrease in sperm concentration was quantified moving proximally, suggesting a hydration effect by the main duct epithelium during the breeding season. These observations fill an important knowledge gap regarding reproductive biology of this impactful recreational fish species.",

Recent analyses corroborated the monophyly of two species groups within this genus ( B. ephippium and B. pernix ), whereas the B. didactylus group appears to be polyphyletic. Herein, we compare and describe the skeletal system of all species from the Brachycephalus ephippium species group. We investigated diagnostic characters that are potentially useful to delimit similar species, confirmed the previously proposed genus definition and added six extra characters. We propose an osteological diagnosis for each species of the B. ephippium group, evaluating and describing intraspecific variations. Our results suggest that adults of B. ephippium group have ornamented parotic plates, ornamented post‐orbital crests, absence of quadratojugal and neopalatines, distal end of the otic ramus of squamosal expanded towards the parotic plate, reduced zygomatic ramus of the squamosals, posterolateral projection of the crista parotica, presence of ornamented spinal plates (except B. alipioi ) and ornamented paravertebral plates. We highlighted the importance of including more than one specimen per species when dealing with miniaturized taxa. A comparison with other Brachycephalus species groups and with Ischnocnema was also provided. Lastly, we suggest some characters to be included in future phylogenetic analysis.",

In Lutjanus argentimaculatus and L. russellii (family Lutjanidae), the scales of different flank regions were not different, while four characters showed variation in the scale of L. lutjanus i.e., scale shape (pentagonal, hexagonal and square), anterior margin (waved, scalloped and smooth), focus shape (circular and oblong) and focus position (postero‐central and central), displayed variation. Scale type (ctenoid) and posterior margin (transforming ctenii) did not show variation and could be considered to be specific in this family. In Epinephelus chlorostigma (family Serranidae), the scales of flank regions did not display variation, while in E. areolatus , E. diacanthus and E. radiates, the scales showed considerable variation. The most variable characters were scale shape, posterior margin and focus shape. Therefore, in fish systematics studies on the base of scale, it is particularly important to compare scales from the same flank regions. Also, some criteria such as size‐dependent alternation, ontogenetic changes and variation between flank regions, should be considered. This study supports the potential of scale morphology to help for the understanding of fish diversity in the coral reef ecosystem.",

Ultrastructure and functional features of midgut of an adult water mite Teutonia cometes (Koch 1837) (Hydrachnidia: Teutoniidae). — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91 : 222–232 The midgut of the adult water mite Teutonia cometes (Koch 1837) (Hydrachnidia: Teutoniidae) was investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy and on semi‐thin sections. The midgut is represented by a blind sac composed of the narrow ventriculus, two proventricular lateral diverticula and three pairs of postventricular caeca. A single‐layered epithelium consists of one type of endodermal digestive cells of quite different shape and size, which may form protrusions into the midgut lumen. The large nuclei are frequently lobed and contain one to three nucleoli. The apical cell membrane forms short scarce microvilli, between their bases the pinocytotic vesicles of unspecific macropinocytosis as well as the narrow pinocytotic canals are formed and immersed into the cell. The intracellular digestion of the food ingested into the midgut after extraintestinal digestion is predominant. The pinocytotic vesicles fuse with small clear vesicles of proposed Golgi origin to form secondary lysosomes. The digestive cells also contain small amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum, variously structured heterolysosomes, residual materials in the form of both the small electron‐dense bodies and the large variously granulated substances, reserve nutritive materials such as lipid and glycogen, as well as clear vacuoles. Residual materials are obviously extruded from the cells into the gut lumen.",

Due to this close dependence, mimetic systems promise deep insights into modes and means of evolution. Mimicry is known to occur in many taxa across different groups of organisms. However, while a plethora of mimetic systems exist, cross‐phyla convergences have only rarely been reported in shelled gastropods. Our literature survey brought to light several mimetic systems including gastropods (as model or mimic), all of them in either a marine or a terrestrial setting. We here report on the first potential case of mimicry involving freshwater snails. We found larval cases of European Helicopsyche caddisfly to closely resemble Valvata gastropod shells in shape and size. In particular, stunning is the detailed similarity of features in these trichopteran cases to those characteristic for snail shells, for example, apex, aperture and umbilicus, hinting at a strong selection pressure to be involved. We discuss this unique case of mimicry that might hold unparalleled insight in mimetic relationships, taking into account alternative environmental factors and potential predatory dupes, in particular birds that might have successively caused the evolution of coiled cases in helicopsychid trichopterans.",

Dissection is difficult when working on small or highly jagged otoliths. A common problem is that during otolith preparation some fish tissue may remain stuck to it, even after a mechanical cleaning. Then, supplementary cleaning with chemicals is needed. Classical methods are known to possibly alter otolith's structure and/or composition. Here, we present a chemical cleaning method using only sodium hydroxide. We have validated the method on two different fish species, Oblada melanura and Dicentrarchus labrax . Observation and analyses of morphological measurements have confirmed significant suppression of residual tissues. We propose this method as a good alternative to previously published mono‐ or multichemical methods.",

The newly described IEB s are distinctly different from the recently reported apical rings which are situated on the surface of individual epidermal cells. While apical rings are directly exposed to the external environment where sampling can occur, IEB s appear to reflect intra‐epidermal events such as sequestering of dead cell remnants.",

Both sexes mature in the first year following hatching and exhibit a seasonal reproductive pattern with maximum activity in spring and summer that appears to be influenced by temperature. Unlike small species of Sceloporus that inhabit pine–oak and tropical forests, S. jalapae exhibits an extended period of reproductive activity that allows females to produce at least two clutches of 3–7 eggs each, and contrary to other species of Sceloporus , in this species there is no correlation between female length and clutch size. The reproductive pattern of S. jalapae is like that shown by other oviparous species of the genus; nevertheless, some life history traits of this species are shared with oviparous and viviparous species of small size.",

A main band at 45–50 kDa and other weaker bands at lower or higher molecular weight for the EGF receptor are also present. The results indicate that degraded forms of the protein are present although the specific nature of the different bands could not be determined. Immunofluorescence indicates that EGF ‐labelled cells and EGF receptor are especially seen in the wound epidermis and in the cytoplasm of ependymal cells. Numerous basal keratinocytes of the wound epidermis and apical epidermal peg contain labelled nuclei for EGFR , suggesting that activated receptor stimulates intense cell proliferation of the wound epidermis. Blastema and labelled myoblasts are occasionally detected in early differentiating muscles, but almost no labelled chondroblasts are present in the differentiating cartilaginous tube.

Results showed that testicular arteries branch off from urogenital arteries and approach the testes via the mesorchium. At the dorsal surface of testes, arteries course towards the medial and lateral surfaces of the ovoid testes, pierce the tunica albuginea and run in the subalbugineal space and then penetrate the testicular parenchyma. In the parenchyma, they branch in all directions. At sites where larger branches arise, sphincters are present. Intimal cushions are found at the origin of smaller branches. Terminal arterioles capillarize and form a wide‐meshed capillary network around convoluted seminiferous tubules. Inter‐ and peritubular capillaries cannot be differentiated reliably. Arterio‐venous transition distances are short. Arterio‐arterial anastomoses and veno‐venous anastomoses are present. Testicular venules empty into a venous subalbugineal plexus which shows veno‐venous anastomoses of different lengths and calibres. Signs of the ongoing non‐sprouting angiogenesis, particularly intussusceptive branch remodelling, reflect the dynamics of the testicular parenchyma. The present study is the first that demonstrates the testicular microvascular anatomy in an anuran species and shows that X. laevis and men share the intricate convoluted seminiferous tubules with associated vascular patterns as a feature in common.",

The sheath epithelium is characterized by numerous infoldings of the basal plasma membrane. The nuclei present in the bulb belong to the proximal belt of the sheath epithelium and the apical cone epithelium. Nuclei of the basal cone epithelium are located insunk behind the proboscis bulb. The insunk cell parts pierce the septum of the bulb laterally near the proximal end. Different types of gland necks and sensory cells pierce the epithelia. Associated with the distal belt of the sheath epithelium, two sensory organs are found, containing multiciliary receptors with modified axonemata. Differences in organization of the proboscis musculature are described and compared with the organization in other species.

Our study shows that the Kneria opercular apparatus consists of two structures: an opercular cup and a posteriorly positioned opercular flange, each of which is composed largely of connective tissue with keratinized papillae and ridges positioned on the surface. Our results further show that the development of the opercular apparatus is linked directly to the development of the anterior vertebral elements (i.e. epicentral intermuscular bones and neural arches). Understanding the function of the opercular apparatus must therefore include an understanding of its associated skeletal elements. As a result of our morphological observations two hypotheses for the function of the opercular unit are addressed; as an auditory specialization, and as an adhesive device. Copyright",

AH appears as yellow corpuscles which extend as isolated bodies throughout the length of both kidneys in close apposition to the posterior cardinal veins. The yellow corpuscles are composed of convoluted cords of epithelial cells and tortuous sinusoids which empty directly into the cardinal veins. Wide lateral intercellular spaces and accompanying microvilli give the impression of pseudotubules or pseudofollicles to the cords of epithelial cells. The extensive network of tubules of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the many mitchondria with tubulo‐vesicular cristae, the conspicuous Golgi apparatus, lipid droplets, many pleomorphic granules and the presence of 3β‐HSD are indicative of the steroidogenic nature of the cells. Large, pleomorphic mitochondria and gap junctions are also typical of most cells. The fine structure of the cells in the AH of the reed‐fish most closely resembles that of other Polypteriformes, but the tissue is more widely distributed in the kidneys than in any osteichthylian so far reported.",

By the end of the subsequent protracted marine trophic phase, the testis had increased in cross‐sectional area by about 20 times and become organised into well‐defined cysts. Since approximately 40% of these cysts possessed spermatocytes and 12% contained spermatids or early sperm, meiosis is initiated prior to the non‐feeding upstream migration, which in G. australis lasts for the unusually long period of 15–16 months. The incidence of cysts with meiotic and post‐meiotic stages decreased during the first 3 months of the spawning run before starting to rise during subsequent months. Spermiogenesis was never completed in any animals caught in the field during the first 9 months of the upstream migration or in those subsequently held in the laboratory up to and beyond November, the month when spawning naturally takes place. The phasing and asynchrony of spermatogenesis during post‐metamorphic life in G. australis differs markedly from the situation in Northern Hemisphere lampreys.",

Two main types of lateral line canals are found. In one type rounded patches of sensory epithelia are separated by elevations of the canal floor. The other type is a straight canal without restrictions and with an almost continuous sensory epithelium. In addition, we found epithelia (type A) with very long apical microvilli on the supporting cells. These microvilli reach beyond the stereovilli of the hair cells. Another type (B) of sensory epithelium has short microvilli on the supporting cells. In this latter type of epithelium the stereovilli of the hair cells are comparatively tall and reach out beyond the supporting cell microvilli. New hair cells are found widely in both types of sensory epithelia. These always occur as single cells, unlike those described in teleost lateral line canal sensory epithelia where new hair cells seem to form in pairs. Dying hair cells are also widespread, indicating a continuous turnover of hair cells.",

Two main cell types are recognized. One, termed pinealocyte, predominates in number. Though slight morphological differences (e.g. electron density of the cytoplasm and content of organelles) were observed, this study indicates that the pineal of mink only contains one single population of pinealocytes. The other, termed glial cell, inserted between the pinealocytes, is characterized by the presence of elongated processes, containing microfilaments. Different treatments (ovariectomy and LH—RH administration) and different endocrine states during the year induced morphological changes in the pinealocytes. A rich network of nerve fibres containing electron-dense granules (40–50 nm) is observed. Microspectrofluorometrically these fibres exhibit the spectral characteristics of cateholamines. All the pinealocytes show a yellow fluorescence. This cellular fluorophor shows the same microspectrofluorometric characteristics as does the fluorophor of serotonin. Occasionally, synaptic ribbons are observed in the perikaryon and the processes of the pinealocytes. A large number of cellular junctions between pinealocytes and endothelial cells is present. Their presumed function(s) are discussed. There is evidence of a blood-brain barrier within the mink pineal gland.",

Bulk stained preparations provide a three‐dimentional view of the entire HN complex. The nucleus preopticus (NPO) which is oval in the ventral view appears boat‐shaped in the cross sectional view of the in toto stained brain. But it is in the form of an inverted L in median parasagittal section. Both pars magnocellularis and parvocellularis contribute fine fibers towards the formation of the right and the left main tracts which are composed of groups of loosely set bundles of axons. Unlike the earlier reported cases the main tract in this species runs lateral to the pituitary axis and independently enters it at the level of the proximal pars distalis without forming a common neurosecretory tract which is a feature not yet well known. In situ demonstration of the neurosecretory system in M. aculeatus has clearly revealed certain complex features which are difficult or impossible to understand through reconstruction studies of tissue sections. Extension of such in situ staining techniques to other species of teleosts may provide a wide variety of variations in the distributional patterns of their neurosecretory tracts which might throw additional light on the function and evolution of this system.",

No gastric ganglion or ganglion ingluviale has been found. Instead the oesophageal nerve forks near the junction of the proventriculus and the midgut. The two nerves run on either side of the midline as ingluvial nerves and enter the proventricular ganglionic masses. These ganglionic masses are connected by a transverse nerve, which has been called as the nervus transversus proventriculare. Both bipolar and multipolar types of sensory cells have been found over the surface of the crop. These cell bodies appear to be interconnected by connective tissue. Dendrites of these cells terminate on the longitudinal muscle fibres, surrounding the proventriculus and the midgut. The proximal processes of these cells enter the proventricular ganglionic mass. In methylene blue whole mounts they resemble the stretch receptors, hence it is quite probable that they play some role in the peristaltic movement of the gut. The corpora cardiaca lie dorsal to the pharynx and are connected to the brain by two pairs of nerves, the nervi corporis cardiaci (NCC I, NCC II). Unlike in other insects, the nerve connecting the corpora cardiaca with the corpora allata is slender and arises as a branch of the nerve, nervus corporis allati II. The corpora alata are spherical to ovoid in shape and lie ventral to the nerve cord. Anteriorly they are attached to the inner wall of the hypopharynx and posteriorly to the subesophageal ganglion by a pair of nerves, the nervi corporis allati II.",

    "abstract": "The paper deals with the structure and the degeneration of the pronephros in Cirrhina mrigala, an Indian carp. The earliest stage that was available for the study was the free swimming larva measuring 6 mm in total length. At the 6 mm stage the pronephros of C. mrigala is fully formed. It reaches maximum size at 10 mm stage. The stages between 11 and 15 mm may be regarded as transitional stages when the functional pronephros becomes non-functional. During this period the pronephric corpuscle becomes isolated from the pronephric tubules and the haemopoietic tissue and is progressively reduced in size. It is not absorbed by the pronephric haemopoietic tissue. The degeneration of the pronephric tubules is a slow process when compared with that of the pronephric glomerulus. The embryonic development of the pronephros in teleosts has been described by several workers (Swaen et Brachet, 1899, 1902; Audigé, 1910; Stroer, 1932; Mahon and Hoar, 1956; Rangarajan, 1957; and Ford and Newstead, 1958). It is an established fact that the pronephros in teleosts is a transient larval organ except in a few species in which it persists throughout adult life (Balfour, 1882; Guitel, 1906, 1908; Gerard, 1941; Fraser, 1950; and Rangarajan, 1957). Descriptions of the exact mode of the involution of the teleostean pronephros are available only in isolated instances (Cole and Johnstone, 1901; Audigé, 1910; and Ford and Newstead, 1958). Though detailed information about the mode of degeneration of the pronephros of Teleostei is relatively rare, Pavlenko (1916), Maschkowzeff (1926) and Fraser (1927) have described the development as well as the regression of the pronephos in three species of Sturgeons Acipenser sturio, A. stellatus and A. rubicundus respectively.",

Bioinformatic analysis suggests that the antibody recognizes FAT1/2 proteins. Western blot indicates a main band around 50 kDa, a likely fragment derived from the original membrane‐bound large protein. Immunofluorescence shows main labelling in differentiating wound keratinocytes, lower in ependyma, mesenchyme and extracellular matrix of the blastema. The apical epidermal peg contains keratinocytes with labelled peripheral cytoplasm, as confirmed using ultrastructural immunogold that also reveals most labelling located along the cell surface of mesenchymal cells. Myoblasts and differentiating myotubes of regenerating muscles are less intensely labelled. The regenerating cartilaginous tube contains sparse labelled chondroblasts, especially in external and internal perichondria. In regenerating scales, differentiating beta‐cells appear immunofluorescent mainly along the cell perimeter. In more differentiated muscle, cartilage and connective tissues of the new tail, the labelling lowers or disappears. The observations indicate that FAT1/2 proto‐cadherins are present in the apical blastema where an intense remodelling takes place for the growth of the new tail but where also a tight control of cell division and migration is active and may regulate potential tumorigenic process.",

With the journal celebrating its centennial, we have assembled a virtual issue that celebrates some of the morphological highlights from the history of Acta Zoologica, which has been a venue for precise and detailed anatomical descriptions of the morphology and ontogeny of major vertebrate taxa. Because our own focus of research has been the evolution of the musculoskeletal system of fishes, a bias toward these topics in our selection is readily apparent. However, these papers also reflect the tradition established by Holmgren's “Studies on the Heads of Fishes,” published in Acta Zoologica . We hope that by bringing together Holmgren's “Studies,” along with a selection of other papers from across the history of the journal will inspire the continued growth of comparative vertebrate anatomy, especially in an era where advanced technologies are available. We discuss various author's approaches to morphology, including Holmgren (1877–1954), Torsten Pehrson (1887–1970), and Alexej Nikolajevich Sewertzoff (1866–1936). The foundation that was laid by these and other workers offers the basis for continued investigation and testing of hypotheses. We feel that the true testament to the power of comparative anatomy is that even after so much study and the volume of baseline data available, new and important findings continue to be made from the careful observation of anatomical form.",

The reconstructions showed that, in contrast to some earlier reports, these cells are not located in an appreciable subepidermal space while they are crawling dorsally up the flank of the animal. Instead, they migrate while tightly sandwiched between overlying epidermal cells and the underlying basal lamina. The cytoplasmic region at the leading edge of the crawling cell has some characteristics of a large podosome, an F‐actin‐rich organelle with prominent roles in adhesion, matrix degradation and cell migration. The discussion includes a comparison of the precursors of epidermal sensory cells of amphioxus with migrating neurogenic cells from vertebrate placodes.",

However, there is little research concerning the pattern of gene expression related to testicular and ovarian function. In this study, we analyse expression of the protein of the Sox9 , Foxl2 and Vasa genes, and Δ 5 ‐3βHSD enzyme activity in ovaries and testicles of A. mexicanum . Correlating morphology with the expression of Sox9 and Foxl2 , we find that these genes manifest sexually dimorphic expression. Sox9 is expressed at higher levels in the testicle, whereas Foxl2 is specific to the ovary. Vasa was detected in spermatogonia in the anterior region of the testis, and in the ovary, it was located in previtellogenic oocytes. Δ 5 ‐3βHSD was located in Leydig cells of the testicles and theca cells of the ovaries. In summary, the dimorphic expression of Sox9 and Foxl2 , and that of Vasa in the germ line are similar to that described for other vertebrates, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms related to ovarian and testicular function in A. mexicanum follow a similar expression pattern that is not altered by neotenic characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The otolith and scale were analysed in the hybrid offsprings between two Aphanius species, that is, A. farsicus and A. sophiae to evaluate if they are suitable to trace hybridization. An artificial reciprocal hybridization was performed between two species. The hybrids of A. farsicus ♂ × A. sophiae ♀ had otoliths with long and pointed rostrum with a narrow depression in the middle of the ventral rim. The otoliths of hybrids between A. farsicus ♀ × A. sophiae ♂ were more close to A. sophiae ♂. As a result, the otolith contour of the hybrids was intermediate to those of the parents. Therefore, we suggest that some variations observed in the otoliths of Aphanius species may be resulted by hybridization particularly when they are sympatric or has geographic overlap. Also, no remarkable differences were found between the scales of hybrids and parents. This indicated that scale morphology and surface microstructures are not suitable for tracing the hybridization. If these species are sympatric due to possible translocation, it causes the genetic introgression of a native species through hybridization. This must be particularly considered in the conservation programme of endangered A. farsicus because artificial transplantation and consequent hybridization can lead to the extinction of this critically endangered species.",

Despite its wide distribution, there is still scarce information on Stenella clymene , including its reproductive biology. In this context, this work describes the morphology of the whole male reproductive tract of the Clymene dolphin. Five males ( N = 5) were studied after stranding on the northeast coast of Brazil. The analysis was performed through the use of macroscopic techniques and light and scanning microscopy. The male reproductive system consists of large testes wrapped around the tunica albuginea and adhered to the epididymis; the testes are attached to the abdominal cavity by the mesorchium. The ductus deferens is convoluted in the proximal portion and rectilinear in the distal portion. The prostate was the only accessory gland found, which is submerged by the prostate compressor muscle and lined with a dense fibroelastic capsule. The penis is classified as fibroelastic, with a spiral sigmoid flexure associated with a large volume of muscle tissue. The penis is inserted into two vestigial bones or pelvic bones, which exhibit no connection with the spine. In conclusion, the macro‐ and microscopic conformation and other morphofunctional features of the male reproductive organs of Stenella clymene are in accord with the anatomy observed in other Cetartiodactyla.",

The seasonal changes in photoperiod results in significant changes in the colour, texture, fat content and external plumage, and as of yet no reports exist on how it effects the structure of integument itself. As a primary report, we find that thin section of skin of the migratory buntings in breast region is very lightly attached to the underlying muscle tissue while supporting a major plumage transition. There exists an extensive network of blood vessels beneath the loosely attached skin raising a possibility of the role of blood to bring nutrients/factors for seasonal changes seen in the external features of these birds. Cresyl violet staining of skin also indicates the presence of nucleic acid in skin‐muscle pockets. Finally, we show the arrangement of small muscle pockets in such loosely attached skin which holds a repertoire of feathers.

Its absence or inactivity interrupts development and precludes metamorphosis. Histological changes are important diagnostic criteria for evaluating thyroid gland activity. However, there is a large larval diversity where the development of the thyroid gland development has not been studied. Pleurodema borellii is an anuran from northwest of Argentina with typical omnivorous pond tadpoles that can be easily raised in captivity. This study explores the histo‐morphological changes of the thyroid gland architecture during larval development. Histological parameters indicate peak glandular activity in parallel with the intensity of the metamorphic transformations. These parameters regress towards the end of metamorphosis, indicating low TH release. P. borellii's thyroid gland does not appear to have relevant activity in post‐metamorphic juvenile stages. This study is a first step towards understanding endocrine regulation during the development of Pleurodema borellii , and a reference to future studies in this species involving thyroid‐dependent processes.",

We found no sexual dimorphism in body size (SVL) between adult males and females, but males had, on average, wider heads and longer forearms. Both sexes had very similar sizes at sexual maturity and maximum body sizes, suggesting male–male competition for resources does not occur, and/or there are no sexual differences in survival rates. The smallest specimen had 24 mm SVL, and juvenile/immature specimens of similar or slightly bigger sizes were collected throughout the year suggesting a continuous turnover of individuals in the population. Adult males showed a continuous reproductive cycle, contrasting with a seasonal cycle of females, where maximum gonadal volume was observed from September to December. This is not uncommon and may be related to differential response to local environmental conditions, or because distinct investment in reproduction. Females have a small and fixed clutch size (two eggs per clutch), a pattern also observed in its congener G. amarali and in many geckonids, which is likely due to phylogenetic inertia. To compensate for a fixed clutch size, females may be able to lay more than one clutch per reproductive season.",

Adult intermoult female crabs in various oogenic stages were administered with 5‐HT and DA, weekly once for four weeks and the ovaries processed for histological and biochemical analyses. The results indicated that 5‐HT induced ovarian maturation by a significant rise in ovarian index, mean oocyte diameter, oocyte proportion values, gonial proliferation, folliculogenesis and degree of yolk deposition while DA showed a significant decline in the aforesaid parameters thus delaying ovarian growth when compared to the untreated controls. Further biochemical analyses confirmed the 5‐HT triggered ovarian growth as evinced from the significant rise in total protein, oligo and polysaccharide fractions, free amino acids, lipid and cholesterol contents compared to the significantly low values of DA‐treated group and control crabs. The present study clearly demonstrated the antagonistic effects of 5‐HT and DA on ovarian maturation in T. schirnerae . In conclusion, the stimulatory neurotransmitter, 5‐HT provides a non‐surgical practical solution for inducing ovarian growth and maturation in species of aquaculture importance.",

Acroloxus lacustris , like other Lymnaeoidea, have spermatozoa divided into the head, midpiece, glycogen region and endpiece. The sperm head contains an extremely long nucleus carrying three rounded keels and a cylindrical acrosome composed of an apical vesicle and homogeneously electron‐dense pedestal. The subnuclear ring is an electron‐dense cylinder sandwiched between the basal projection of the nucleus and mitochondrial derivative. The midpiece contains the mitochondrial derivative enclosing apically a single glycogen helix. The spermatozoa have a well‐developed glycogen region and an unusual endpiece with an axoneme anchored on an electron‐dense plaque. Several sperm characters of A. lacustris (solid acrosomal pedestal, rounded nuclear keels, single glycogen helix) differ from those of other Lymnaeoidea possibly representing euthyneuran plesiomorphies. The Acroloxidae may therefore be sister to the remaining Lymnaeoidea, branching off before these gained their characteristic sperm traits.",

The present autoradiographic and immunohistochemical study describes tail regeneration and formation of the axial skeleton in early regenerating tails of the Jamaican red‐tailed gecko, Sphaerodactylus argus . Cell proliferation, studied by tritiated thymidine, shows intense labelling mainly in forming scales and differentiating cartilaginous, muscle and ependymal cells of the regenerating spinal cord, while the labelling is more diffuse in the apical blastema and proximal connective tissues. The slow apical proliferation maintains the tail front growing while in more proximal regions, cells initiate differentiation, losing thymidine‐labelling. Cell proliferation is maximal at the beginning of scales, muscles and cartilage formation. Scales are regenerated following migration into the dermis of tritiated thymidine‐labelled keratinocytes to form epithelial pegs that later split and give rise new scales. Differentiation of new corneous layers begins underneath the external corneous epidermis, starting with a shedding layer followed by a beta‐layer that accumulates corneous beta proteins. Intense proliferation of apical myoblasts gives rise to long myotubes and segmented muscles. The vertebral column is substituted with a cartilaginous tube made of turgid chondrocytes accumulating chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan and elastin. Therefore, the regenerated tail remains flexible and capable of curling to maintain efficient the climbing ability in these geckos.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sesarmid crab, Muradium tetragonum , considered a key detritus consumer plays a significant role in the nutrient cycling and energy flow in most of the mangrove environments. Morphological and ultrastructural organization of the M . tetragonum male reproductive system are characterized through transmission electron microscopic studies. Adult males (3.2–4.2 cm) with dark violet carapace and white‐tipped cheliped were procured alongside the coastal areas of Tanjavur district, Tamil Nadu, India. The morphological analysis highlights the male gonads to be bilaterally symmetrical and anterolaterally located inside the cephalothorax. A pair of elongated testes lying attached to the hypodermis of the carapace leads to a long highly coiled vas deferens categorized into three distinct regions (Proximal vas deferens, Middle vas deferens and distal vas deferens) structurally and functionally with Posterior vas deferens receiving sac‐like accessory glands. It gets followed by an ejaculatory duct and ends with the penile papillae at the coxae's base of the fifth peripod. Structural modifications were observed in the ultrastructure of vas deferens envisage (considering) its functional role in storing spermatophores, active absorption and assisting the secretory activity. Spermatophores, witnessed as spherical bodies are bounded by a dense double wall. Aflagellate, immotile and spherical spermatozoa that measuring 3.6 μm in diameter encompasses a complex acrosome cupped by a nucleus. Moreover, perforatorium and the extending nuclear arms with chromatin, as displayed in the experimental organism M . tetragonum , are in synergy with that of certain brachyurans as specified in the study. Hence, the current study assessing the morphology and ultrastructure parameters of the male gonads could be useful in understanding the physiology of sexual maturation, annual cyclic changes, tracing the phylogenetic relationship among species and enhancing the brood‐stock management.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Under temperature sex determination (TSD), sex is determined by temperature during embryonic development. Depending on ecological and physiological traits and plasticity, TSD species may face demographic collapse due to climate change. In this context, asymmetry in bilateral organisms can be used as a proxy for developmental instability and, therefore, deviations from optimal incubation conditions. Using Tarentola mauritanica gecko as a model, this study aimed first to confirm TSD, its pattern and pivotal temperature, and second to assess the local adaptation of TSD and variation of asymmetry patterns across four populations under different thermal regimes. Eggs were incubated at different temperatures, and hatchlings were sexed and measured. The number of lamellae was counted in adults and hatchlings. Results were compatible with a TSD pattern with males generated at low and females at high incubation temperatures. Estimated pivotal temperature coincided with the temperature producing lower embryonic mortality, evidencing selection towards balanced sex ratios. The temperature of oviposition was conservatively selected by gravid females. Asymmetry patterns found were likely related to nest temperature fluctuations. Overall, the rigidity of TSD may compromise reproductive success, and demographic stability in this species in case thermal nest choice becomes constrained by climate change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We observed the presence of follicular cells (FC) in the ovaries of Penaeus subtilis ( n = 1198), which led us to classify the development of germ cells into six phases: oogonia, previtellogenic oocytes, primary and secondary vitellogenic oocytes, mature oocytes and atretic oocytes. The FC changes their shape according to the development of germ cells and showed a different distribution along the ovary, which allowed differentiating vitellogenic oocytes into primary and secondary. We also observed that the postovulatory follicles (POF) are composed of follicular cells. The presence of POF in penaeids ovaries is rarely reported, but allows the differentiation between spent and resting stages, commonly grouped in reproductive biology research. Furthermore, observation of ovarian lining was useful to differentiate immature females from females that had spawned at least once. Thus, ovarian development was classified into six stages: immature, early developing, advanced developing, ripe, spent and resting. The distribution and shape variations of FC, ovarian lining features and presence of POF were considered crucial for the classification of ovarian maturation stages. The methods developed here may improve estimates of their reproductive cycle, size at first maturity and spawning season, which are important variables in future studies of the reproductive dynamics.",

This study used light microscopy and morphological analysis to examine scale variation across the flank of four Tonguefishes species; Cynoglossus arel , C. bilineatus, C. lingua, and C. puncticeps . Scales were extracted from six flank regions, three on the eyed and blind sides, respectively. The most differentiated species was C. arel , which showed significant differences in four size variables in five regions. In Cynoglossus arel and C. lingua , the scales of the eyed side were ctenoid, and those scales from the blind side were cycloid; C. puncticeps have ctenoid scales on both flank sides and C. bilineatus has cycloid scales on both sides. All species' scales on the blind side have fewer ctenial spines (except in C. bilineatus ). This study indicated that scale morphology demonstrated considerable variation among the flank regions of the examined species. As a result, the scales from the head and the trunk regions of the eyed side and the scales from the head region of the blind side have a good power of species separation in this family.",

In this study, we provide information on relative litter mass (RLM) and other litter and neonate related characters of nine female Plestiodon lynxe captured in the field. We also recorded seven body dimensions in 16 neonates and 15 two‐month juveniles, and on the basis of these dimensions we compared the body shape of these two age classes to detect changes in the proportions of body parts. The average litter size (4.55) is larger than that found in other viviparous species of Plestiodon , but smaller than those of congeneric oviparous species of similar size. However, the average body size of newborns (25.49 mm) is similar to that of other oviparous and viviparous species of Plestiodon . The average RLM was relatively high (0.36). The relative size of the head and limbs becomes proportionally smaller, whereas the axilla‐groin length becomes proportionally larger in the first 2 months of life. We suggest that these changes are related to changes in locomotion and microhabitat use.",

The sexual dimorphism in anuran external morphology or limb muscles has been well studied in reproductive context, but less so outside the breeding season. Herein, the intersexual differences in 12 external morphological characteristics, 11 forelimb and 12 hindlimb muscles of Hylarana guentheri during non‐breeding season were investigated. We found that the males possessed significantly greater head width and tympanum diameter, while the females had significantly larger body size and head length; there was no sexual differences in the examined limb muscles, except for the mass of flexor carpi radialis. The larger body size means greater fertility for the females, and the longer head may be related to the allometry and reduce resource competition. For the males, the wider head is likely correlated with prey size and male–male competition, and also, the larger tympanum and heavier flexor carpi radialis probably aid the productive success. This study provides the comprehensive morphological accounts about the sexual differences of H. guentheri during non‐breeding season, which will contribute to clarify the sex‐specific resource allocation and reproductive strategies of anurans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In various groups of mammals, the intensity of intermale sperm competition relates to relative testes mass (RTM) with some evidence suggesting that this may also be the case for some aspects of sperm form. In murid rodents, a large RTM generally correlates with a streamlined sperm head, long apical hook and long tail with most data coming from species in the subfamily Murinae. In this study, RTM and sperm form are compared across 15 species of gerbils, seven from the Tribe Taterillini and eight from the Tribe Gerbillini. Marked interspecific differences in RTM and sperm morphology were observed. However, the Gerbilliscus species with the largest RTM do not have a sperm head with an apical hook nor a longer sperm tail than other species with smaller RTM whereas, by contrast, in the Tribe Gerbillini, species where the sperm head lacks a hook have a relatively small testes mass. We thus suggest that in gerbils, unlike in murine rodents, high levels of postcopulatory sexual selection have not invariably resulted in the evolution of a spermatozoon with a long apical hook and long sperm tail. The possible reasons for this are briefly discussed.",

Paired, elongated, sac‐like ovaries are parallel to the gut and fat bodies. Follicle stages include germinal nests of oogonia and primary oocytes, early and late previtellogenic follicles, early and late vitellogenic follicles and atretic follicles. Germinal nests of oogonia comprise oogonia and prefollicular cells. Nests of primary oocytes contain clusters of synchronously developing primary oocytes enclosed by connective tissue. Primary oocytes are associated with follicular cells. Previtellogenic follicles initially form the vitelline envelope, theca cell layers and patches of ooplasmic glycoproteins. Vitellogenic follicles contain heterogeneously sized spherical yolk granules. Atresia is present in several stages of developing follicles. The oviduct is divided into the anterior, middle and posterior parts. All oviductal parts are lined by non‐ciliated epithelium. A small number of mucous cells are present in the middle part. The cloaca of female I . supachaii is divided into the anterior and posterior chambers. The anterior chamber is lined by glandular stratified columnar epithelium, while the posterior chamber has stratified cuboidal epithelium with less mucus production.

The information available up to now states that the gametogenesis in males involves a modified meiosis, similar to mitosis. This is due to the haplodiploid sex determination system present in the order, where females are diploid and males are haploid. In the present work, we examined the spermatogenesis process in the parasitoid Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). We performed squash preparations from testes of individuals from the third larval instar until the adult stage. Some cytological traits, such as the presence of a monopolar spindle, were analysed in detail by means of histological semi‐thin sections. The spermatogenesis in this species comprises an abortive first division with the formation of an anucleated cytoplasmic bud and a nucleated cell, and an equal second division of the nucleated cell, leading to the generation of two mature spermatozoa. The results presented herein provide more information about the process of spermatogenesis in Hymenoptera, which has not been studied in depth in parasitic species.",

The intestinal folds are exclusively present in the anterior intestinal region. The liver comprises 30–40 incomplete hepatic lobes, lying in an imbricate manner. Each lobe is enveloped by haematopoietic tissue that produces and delivers blood cells into sinusoids. Hepatic parenchyma is organized into anastomosing, two‐cell‐thick plates, having sinusoids at the basal domain and bile canaliculi at the apical domain of hepatocytes. Pigment cells are scattered inside sinusoids. The pancreas contains pancreatic acini interspersed with islets of Langerhans. The gallbladder proper is thin and continuous with the cystic duct wall.

    "abstract": "Abstract Morphological studies are useful to develop analysis with taxonomic, phylogenetic, ecological, physiological and evolutionary approaches. During the life cycle, Anurans carry out gas exchange through different structures such as gills, skin and lungs. In general, the development of lungs during the larval period is scarce known and most studies analyse the morphology and ultrastructure of the lung wall at the adult stage. This study describes the development and morphology of the lung of Trachycephalus typhonius during the prometamorphic and metamorphic periods and adult stage. Lung development starts at premetamorphic stages and continues along the prometamorphic and metamorphic periods with the development of the lung wall vascularization and pulmonary septa. There are remarkable differences comparing the lung framework at the end of metamorphosis to the one in the adult stage, regarding different‐order septa and lung wall structure with a well‐developed vascular network. Therefore, the final organization occurs during the juvenile period. This work is the first approach to the study of lung development during larval stages in this species and complements previous studies on lung morphology. Also, contributes to the knowledge of lung morphogenesis and could be useful to interpret the respiratory physiology in different environmental conditions.",

This lizard is endemic to the Atlantic rainforest, occurring from Rio Grande do Norte to São Paulo. Herein, the aspects of trophic ecology, microenvironmental specificity and sexual dimorphism were analysed from 65 collected individuals and 15 sighted individuals in two conservation units: Camucim and Tapacurá, located in São Lourenço da Mata, north‐eastern region of Brazil. The data found classify G . darwinii as a saxicolous lizard, with a preference for rocky outcrops, without sexual dimorphism. According to its trophic ecology, the species is considered a generalist and sit–wait forager. Arthropods, especially Orthoptera and Araneae, dominate the lizard's diet. Neither of these aspects differed between seasons.

    "abstract": "Abstract Analysis of skin development in the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri , indicates that keratinocytes form 2 to 3 irregular layers in tadpoles of 2–5 cm in length and are fully stratified (7–12 layers) in juveniles of 16.5–26 cm in length. The epidermis produces mucus and mainly contains intermediate filament keratins of acidic nature but also a minute amount of neutral‐basic keratins (pI 7.0–7.3), which is unique among fish. The latter keratins of 60–62 kDa, are generally present in tetrapods but the specific gene structure and amino sequence of acidic, neutral and basic keratins in N. forsteri are presently unknown. No other epidermal proteins are detected although biochemical data suggest the presence of non‐keratin proteins, including a basic type (pI 8.0–8.2) of around 32 kDa of molecular weight. The spinulated bony layer of elasmoid scales contains glycoproteins involved in mineralization, such as osteonectin and osteopontin. Also, alkaline phosphatase, involved in calcium precipitation onto the collagen matrix, has been detected in scales of juveniles up to 26 cm in length. The present review concludes that the knowledge of the data derived from epidermal and dermal protein annotation from the recently sequenced genome of this fish species will contribute to address the study on the evolution of tetrapod skin.",

The female reproductive system of C. vulnerata has two ovaries, each containing 14 telotrophic meroistic ovarioles joined by two lateral oviducts that open in a common oviduct. In this type of ovarioles, the trophocytes within the germarium are transferred to the developing oocytes in the vitellarium via the nutritive cords. The oocytes in the vitellarium have three different development stages: previtello, vitello and choriogenesis. The ovarioles open in the lateral oviduct with a thin canal‐shaped pedicel. A pair of lateral oviducts opens distally into the common oviduct. The oviducts are surrounded by a monolayer cubical epithelium with deep folds toward the lumen and a thick muscle layer. A pair of spermatheca and a bursa copulatrix are seen near the common oviduct. Spermatheca has an elongated shape. The bursa copulatrix has an ovoid tube‐like structure. No work has been done on the female reproductive system of Cercopidae to date. This study was conducted to fill this gap and forms part of the female reproductive system morphology of this economically important insect.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although scorpions have comparatively low regenerative potential, legs and pedipalps are able to regenerate some structures in an often incomplete manner. The most intriguing scorpion appendages are the ventrally located pectines. These organs are equipped with numerous sensilla that scan the substrate for mechanosensory‐ and chemosensory cues. Due to their ventral position and frequent substrate contact, pectines are vulnerable to traumatic injuries. Pecten malformations have been hypothesized to be the result of incomplete regeneration. To investigate their regeneration capabilities, the pectines of postembryonic stages of Euscorpius italicus (Herbst, 1800) were amputated before the second moult at three different positions. Data on intermoult periods and the number of pectinal teeth were gathered for approximately 2.5 years. The regeneration process on exuviae of up to six moulting events was documented by photographs and confocal laser‐scanning microscopy. Regardless of the amputation site, no evidence for regenerative capabilities of pectines in E. italicus could be reported. Thus, incomplete regenerations mentioned in the literature are likely the result of simple wound healing. Depending on habitat complexity, substrate contact time of the pectines seem to differ, which might be interpreted as a trade‐off between highest sensory input and the avoidance of traumatic injury of the pectines.",

We worked with specimens previously collected in the spring and summer seasons (2014–2015), in which the gonads were studied based on morphological, histological and morphometric analysis. The reproductive system was analyzed using a stereoscopic microscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Histological preparations were made following the conventional protocol of dehydration, inclusion in paraffin and stained with haematoxylin–eosin, Mallory trichrome and PAS histochemical reactions. The anatomical and morphometric characteristics and the gametogenesis in R . bergi agree with what was proposed for other analyzed species of the Bufonidae family. Females with ovaries with oocytes in different stages of maturity and postovulatory females were found. The males presented continuous spermatogenesis. The results of this work serve as a basis for the characterization of the reproductive cycle in R . bergi and, at the same time, provide background information on the analysis of gametogenic activity. Future investigations will be focused on evaluating the reproductive cycle in this species, both in ovaries and testes as well as Bidder's organ, to compare and correlate with the results obtained in this study.",

However, little is known about the ontogenetic variation in otolith morphology. In this study, the development of otolith morphology in different life stages of Aphaniops kruppi , an endemic toothcarp of the Arabian Peninsula, is described and discussed. The results reveal (i) a significant correlation between standard length and otolith size (length) in larval and early juvenile stages, (ii) clear differences in otolith morphology between larvae/early juveniles and adults, and (iii) a temporal link between the appearance of the sulcus on the otolith's inner face and lifestyles, that is demersal in larvae and early juveniles, and pelagic in adults. Moreover, our new data on otoliths of Ap . kruppi propose that otoliths of larvae or early juveniles of Ap . kruppi can be recognized by adults not only because of their small size but also based on their short and rounded rostrum and antirostrum and shallow, wide excisura. As the above‐mentioned characteristics are also found in the otoliths of juveniles and larvae of several other studied aphaniids, it can be concluded that otoliths are not diagnostic at the species level in Ap . kruppi , and this holds for other closely related species.",

A total of 103 animals were collected, 87 females and 16 males (sex ratio of 5 females:1 male).

The males had average length of 20.353 ± 1.39 cm and an average weight of 96.90 ± 20.2 g. Females and males were in developing phases during fall and winter, and Spawning Capable in spring and summer. Spawning Capable females were collected in the fall. The closed fishing season determined for the species does not fully cover its reproductive period. This associated with the imbalance of the sex ratio, and over‐fishing of the species may be leading the species population to decline upstream of the Tucuruí reservoir on the Tocantins River.",

The adhesive function of these organs was mentioned in numerous studies; however, the mechanism of their temporary attachment is still unknown. Moreover, it is assumed that rhopalioids may be homologous to rhopalia of scypho‐ and cubozoans and provide sensory and integrative functions. Nevertheless, nervous elements associated with rhopalioids are poorly investigated. Thus, we focused on morphological features of rhopalioids in staurozoan Haliclystus auricula James‐Clark, 1863 using histological and semithin sections, and also confocal laser scanning microscopy. We described histological organization of rhopalioids and observed four types of epidermal gland cell, which presumably provide the attachment and reattachment to the substrate. Supposedly, the musculature of rhopalioids can also play a role in the attachment and reattachment. We have studied organization of the nervous system in rhopalioids, which includes FMRFamide‐, tubulin‐ and neurotensin‐positive nerve clusters and FMRFamide‐positive presumptive sensory cells. Based on our results, we assume that rhopalioids, besides the complex attachment, may act like sensory organs and play a role of integrative centres.",

Collecting specimens is only possible through excavation work, causing damage or even death to the specimens. Due to the obstacles of in situ studies, the scarce information comes from reports obtained indirectly, mainly through specimens preserved in museums. Considering the adaptations to fossoriality, investments in studying these groups could be very enlightening since they would contribute enormously to the knowledge of the evolutionary strategies developed throughout the colonisation of the subterranean world. Amphisbaena alba is the species of Amphisbaenia with the broadest geographic distribution in the world. It occupies virtually all countries in South America except for Chile and southern Argentina. This study, carried out over the last 36 years, aims to provide data on the biology and behaviour of A. alba in captivity and in the field. Our main objective is to provide subsidies to expand the knowledge of the life history of this species and, by extension, of amphisbaenians in general.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In cetaceans, each otic capsule is bound anteriorly to the remainder of the endocranium by an aliform structure called the supracochlear lamina. This lamina has been established here as the homologue of the sphenocochlear commissure of other mammals. Most researchers believe that these two structures arose within mammals. However, a comparative study involving data from both extant and extinct craniates suggests that the supracochlear lamina and the sphenocochlear commissure have a long premammalian history. The conclusion is that the lower of the two pharyngeal segments at the upper end of the mandibular branchial arch first became incorporated in the endocranium, constituting the cartilago trabecularis in the embryos of jawed craniates. The distal, or posterior, extremity of the trabecular cartilage projected outwardly to form the basitrabecular process. This process, which when ossified is called the processus basipterygoideus, functioned as a jaw support. Later, one more jaw support, termed the basivincular, evolved immediately in front of the basipterygoid process. Both these supports for the upper jaw existed in the piscine forerunners of the tetrapods. Subsequently, in the lineages leading to mammals, the basivincular jaw support became the processus alaris to which is attached an upper jaw endoskeletal remnant, called the ala temporalis. The basipterygoid jaw support, however, vanished as a consequence of the evolution of an exoskeletal joint system for the jaws of mammals. Yet the basipterygoid process persisted and as the sphenocochlear commissure or the supracochlear lamina assumed the new function of supporting the cochlear part of the auditory capsule.",

This continued after metamorphic climax in the juvenile toadlets, diminishing later in the adult stage.",

The bulbous pharynx itself, typical of the genus, is a highly muscular organ, also lined internally by an insunk epithelium; it also bears at least two different types of gland cells. Externally the pharynx is enveloped by a thin, flat epithelium. The gastrodermis consists of phagocytes and Minotian gland cells, as typical for most Tricladida. No ciliary covering was observed along the whole digestive system; instead, phagocytic cells have long microvillar projections. Preliminary attempts to follow the digestive process using external markers and cytochemical reaction for acid phosphatase were successful in demonstrating endocytic activity in the phagocytes. These data, besides being a contribution to morphology and systematics, also speak in favour of the general digestive theory of Turbellaria proposed by Jennings and serve as a starting point for experimental studies on intracellular digestion within the Lecithoepitheliata.",

The axonemal structure in Zygentoma is the one most similar to those of the pterygote insects. The protofilaments of the axonemal doublets were seen to have a somewhat widened interspace between some pairs of protofilaments and these ‘gaps’ coincided with the location of the basal parts of the outer dynein arm, the inner dynein arm, the spoke, and the intertubular material.

    "abstract": "The prolactin (PRL) cells of the pituitary are less active in seawater (SW)-adapted eels than in freshwater (FW) ones. The kinetics of their response during adaptation to SW or readaptation to FW was investigated. Morphometric studies show that transfer into SW induces a rapid nuclear atrophy, and a reduction of the cell height and of the amount of cytoplasmic granules. These parameters still continue to decrease slowly for one month, becoming then fairly stable. Readaptation to FW stimulates PRL cells after 2 to 10 days. After one or two months, the cells are similar to those of eels kept in FW. The responses of PRL cells appear to be slower in the eel than in Cyprinodonts, which need PRL to live in FW. A complete adaptation to both environments requires one month at least in Anguilla.",

The bases of the light guides are located oposite to an aperture in the lightproof cup enclosing the escal light gland. The light guides have an axial light‐transmitting core enclosed by a tubular wall with an opening or window through which light is emitted. The wall consists of a layer of reflecting cells, in two of the three species supplemented by an outer layer of pigmented cells. The window either has a terminal position or is located in the light guide wall near its closed end. A special annular window, situated beneath an inverted cone of reflecting cells, is present at the flattened tip of the light guide within the distal appendage of P. micractis . In one of the species studied ( L. coronata ) it appears likely that a sphincter of smooth muscle cells may regulate the transmission of light from the light gland to the light guides.",

Instead, they originate in the basal part of the horizontal rootlet a short distance from the basal bodies. In Monocotyle spiremae (Monocotylidae), the vertical rootlets are less distinct, with no apparent cross‐striation, but they also originate from the basal part of the horizontal rootlets. Epidermal cilia of the oncomiracidium of Zeuxapta seriolae (Monogenea, Polyopisthocotylea, Axinidae) lack vertical rootlets like all other neodermatans examined, but bundles of fibres extend from the basal bodies a short distance into the cytoplasm of the epidermal cells. Monopisthocotylean Monogenea would be intermediate between rhabditophorans and the other neodermatans (in having weakly developed vertical rootles), if these structures were homologous in the two groups. However, in view of the different origin of vertical rootlets in turbellarians and monopisthocolylean oncomiracidia, it is suggested that they are not homologous, and vertical rootlets in the Monopisthocotylea are therefore named “false vertical rootlets”.",

The paired gland at each side consists of a reservoir sac into which the secretory cells open through their accompanying duct cells. The secretory cells are characterized by a well developed Golgi apparatus, numerous mitochondria and strands of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The reservoir opens near the abdomen tip, which facilitates deposition of the secretory products onto the substrate. The large reservoir of the postpygidial gland may enable the incessant trail laying of at least one of the investigated species.",

It is concluded here that both these allostotic components of the human temporal bone derive from spiracular allostoses, except for the zygomatic process of the pars squamosa, this being a cheek allostosis that has been secondarily united with the squama. This is the first recognition of erstwhile spiracular allostoses in tetrapods. These conclusions challenge the widely accepted Reichert‐Gaupp theory as well as the oft‐alleged monophyletic status of the mammals and their derivation from therapsid reptiles.",

This cartilage appears for the first time in 8 day old fish, postero‐ventral to the notochord. During its growth, perichondral and endochondral ossification occurs, beginning at the anterior end of the cartilage. Comparison with the anatomy and ontogeny of the typical caudal skeleton of teleosts allows us to interpret the caudal cartilage of A. leptorhynchus as an hypuro‐opisthural component that is homologous to the cartilage that occurs at the tip of the axial skeleton in Eigenmannia virescens.",

Other neoophoran platyhelminths have a constant number of eight stereocilia per collar receptor, the only exception being members of another family of Temnocephalida, the Didymorchidae, where collar receptor cells with five and six stereocilia have been recorded. Therefore, the presence of a lower number of stereocilia per collar receptor is likely to be an apomorphic trait of the Temnocephalida.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The condition, CI = [body mass (g)/length (cm) 3 ]‐1000, tends to increase in toads growing in the laboratory on a diet of meal‐worms. The allocation was therefore studied of ingested food to growth corresponding to maintenance of standard condition (Δ W S ) and to increases in condition, expressing bulky growth. A condition index of 100, typical of toad populations, is chosen to characterize standard growth, higher values expressing bulky growth. The relationship between mass specific standard growth (Δ W s / W 0 ) and actual growth in mass (Δ W / W 0 ) was the same in controls and growth hormone‐treated toads and was independent of sex and season. It could be described by the allometric equation Δ W s / W 0 = 0.28 (Δ W / W 0 ) 1.36 , r = 0.93. The composition of mass representing increases in bulk in excess of a CI = 100 was assessed from allometric relationships established between the indices of the chemical constituents and the overall condition index. The increases in condition were partitioned among the organs and parts of the body from allometric relationships established between indices of organs and body parts and the overall condition index. Treatment with growth hormone enhanced growth in mass and significantly increased the relative proportion of mass allocated to standard growth. However, the effect was not specific to growth hormone, but was an indirect effect of the increased growth rate. Water was the predominant constituent of the growth in bulk, amounting to about 70% of increases in CI. Fat and protein contributed about equally initially, 5–10%, with fat strongly increasing and protein slightly decreasing with increasing condition, fat to approach 20–30% when CI approached 200. Increases in water content largely reflected increases in volume of blood and lymph.",

The protrusions extend into the saccus lumen. In parr the protrusions become more spherical during the spring season, while in smolt the opposite process takes place. Parr coronet cells have most of the mitochondria in the apical part of the cell, while in smolt they are concentrated basally.

To further characterize these cytotoxic cells we have examined their ultrastructural morphology and effector cell‐target cell membrane contacts. We also studied the sensitivity of these two effector cells to low temperature (4°C). Our results showed that SK effector cells are lymphocytes (10 μm) which contain numerous vacuoles and osmiophilic granules, while IK effectors are another lymphocyte population (up to 12 μm) with a small amount of cytoplasm and few mitochondria. Both IK‐ and SK‐mediated lytic responses were suppressed significantly by low temperature. These observations allow us to propose that frog SK and IK cells may be homologous to mammalian NK and CTL.",

Qualitative X‐ray microanalyses indicate that the concretions are composed of calcium, phosphorus, barium and perhaps magnesium and sodium. In Zygonemertes sp. and Z. virescens minute hook‐like structures occur throughout the epidermis. The hooks develop by one week post‐fertilization and appear to be non‐calcified in both larvae and adults. Each hook is formed within a large vacuole and consists of several fused subunits. The subunits lack well defined cortical and medullary regions and seem to be produced by the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the epidermal secretory cell. The possible relationships between the calcareous concretions and proboscidial stylets of nemerteans are discussed and the structure of the integumentary hooks is compared to that of rhabdite‐like bodies secreted by other invertebrates.",

The centrioles give rise to two parallel, free flagella of the Trepaxonemata 9 + ‘1’ pattern, growing out in opposite directions. Spermatids undergo a latero‐ventral rotation of the flagella and a subsequent disto‐proximal rotation of centrioles, and a distal cytoplasmic projection appears. The former rotation involves the compression of a row of microtubules and allows the recognition of a ventral side and a dorsal side. At the end of the differentiation, the centrioles and cortical microtubules lie parallel to the sperm axis. The modifications of the intercentriolar body and the migration of the nucleus and the centrioles toward the distal projection are described. The mature spermatozoon of C. cristatispina is filiform, tapered at both ends and shares several features with the other Rhabdocoela gametes. Nevertheless, the posterior extremity is capped by an electron‐dense material. A gradient between mitochondria and dense bodies exists along the sperm axis. This study has enable us a phylogenetic approach of the Rhabdocoela through a comparison of the ultrastructural features of C. cristatispina with the other Rhabdocoela taxa. We propose the disto‐proximal rotation of centrioles as a synapomorphy of the Rhabdocoela.",

Collagen fibrillogenesis was investigated in developing fibrous connective tissue (tooth band) in shark mandible by transmission electron microscopy. Fibrils varied considerably in shape and size. Both thin and thick fibrils 40–200 and 400–500 nm in width, respectively, were observed, with the latter showing irregular contours. Examination of both transverse and longitudinal sections of fibril suggested that the irregular, thick fibrils were formed by fusion of the thin fibrils. This was in agreement with a previously proposed mechanism of collagen fibrillogenesis in a variety of tissues, in which formation of thin fibrils is followed by their coalescence into thicker fibrils. Detailed high resolution ultrastructural examination revealed decorin-like, 4.5- to 5.5-nm-wide polygonal frames and 3-nm-wide ribbon-like structures previously identified as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan ‘double tracks’ localized within the interfibrillar spaces. These structures may be closely involved in collagen fibrillogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study was to determine the age at sexual maturity and the relationships between age and internal reproductive organs of Cosmopolites sordidus . Male banana weevils become sexually mature 18 days after emergence ( DAE ), that is after 2 weeks of adult eclosion, in spite of the fact that spermatogenesis is completed at emergence. A positive correlation exists between age and male internal organs, for example for mean testis diameter ( r = .849, p ≤ .001), mean seminal vesicle diameter ( r = .679, p ≤ .001), mean accessory gland length ( r = .561, p ≤ .01) and mean accessory gland diameter ( r = .498, p ≤ .05), respectively. Significant differences were recorded between sexually mature and immature weevils with respect to mean testis diameter ( T = 4.471, p ≤ .001) and mean seminal vesicle diameter ( T = 3.939, p ≤ .001), but not with mean accessory gland length and mean accessory gland diameter ( T = 1.899 and 1.661). Male internal organs were visibly underdeveloped at emergence but became significantly enlarged and developed on attainment of sexual maturity. Female C. sordidus, on the other hand, are sexually mature at 5 DAE . There was also a strong, positive correlation between age of females and mean ovariole length ( r = .656, p ≤ .001), and significant differences existed between mean ovariole lengths of sexually mature and immature females ( T = 4.306, p ≤ .001). Increasing age of females witnessed progressive increases in ovariole lengths and developmental changes within female ovarioles and calyces. The findings made here may be helpful in Musa germplasm screening works, as weevils bred on susceptible cultivars may reveal similar results, while those bred on resistant ones may experience possible delays in their reproductive developments.",

Localization of type II collagen in the lingual mucosa of rats during the morphogenesis of circumvallate papillae. —Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 92: 67–74. Immunoreactivity specific for type II collagen was recognized first in the mesenchymal connective tissue just beneath the circumvallate papilla placode in fetuses on E13. At this stage, most of the lingual epithelium was pseudostratified epithelium composed of one or two layers of cuboidal cells. However, the epithelium of the circumvallate papilla placode was composed of several layers of cuboidal cells. Immunoreactivity specific for type II collagen was detected mainly on the lamina propria just beneath the lingual epithelium of the rudiment of the circumvallate papilla in fetuses on E15 and on E17, and slight immunostaining was detected on the lamina propria around the rudiment. In fetuses on E19, immunoreactivity specific for type II collagen was widely and densely distributed on the connective tissue around the developing circumvallate papillae and on the connective tissue that surrounded the lingual muscle. Immunoreactivity specific for type II collagen was sparsely distributed on the lamina propria of central bulge. After birth, morphogenesis of the circumvallate papillae advanced gradually with the increase in size of the tongue. Immunoreactivity specific for type II collagen was distinctively distributed in the lamina propria around circumvallate papilla, in the central bulge, and in the connective tissue that surrounded the lingual muscle.",

Does submergence into water during fall induce changes in physiological and morphological traits? We investigated whether such changes occur in both sexes from the entrance into the water (November) to the exit from the water (May) in the laboratory. Mean duration of stay in the water was 21.7 weeks in males and 19.0 weeks in females. Spermiation began 13.8 weeks after the males entered the water. Sperm storage lasted for 6.3 weeks. Spawning occurred 18.3 weeks after the females entered the water. Cloacae swelled greatly soon after the sexes entered the water. In males after entering the water, tail shape changed from sticklike to finlike. Although physiological and morphological traits in other species change simultaneously in both the submergence into water and the onset of breeding activity only during spring, such changes occurred in individual H. kimurae firstly during fall (shortly after entering the water) and secondly during spring (shortly after awaking from hibernation). This difference suggests that these two‐step changes during a prolonged period (fall–spring) are concentrated in a short period of aquatic‐breeding activity during spring in other species with terrestrial hibernation and associated reproductive cycles.",

The most remarkable feature in these extant agnathans was the occurrence of large blood‐sinuses. In larval lampreys, blood‐sinuses are well developed in the velum, an organ that functions to introduce water and accompanying food particles from the mouth into the gill and alimentary regions. The sinuses in the velum may act to transduce the force of contraction of velar muscles to the stroke‐like movement of the velum; without these sinuses muscular contractions might simply cause the velum to collapse. In adult lampreys, blood‐sinuses are well developed in the peribranchial space that surrounds the branchial (gill) sac and is surrounded by the branchial pouch. It is possible that the force of contractions of the branchial‐pouch muscles is transduced effectively to the branchial sac via the peribranchial blood‐sinus and facilitates the expiration of water through the external gill pores. If the peribranchial sinus were absent, the muscular contraction might deform the branchial sac in an inappropriate manner. In the hagfish, the blood‐sinus system is also well developed in the velum and peribranchial space, although the peribranchial sinus lies outside the muscular branchial pouch. In agnathans, the blood‐sinus system may function, at least in part, as a kind of hydrostatic skeleton that transduces the force generated by muscular contraction.",

The sperm head is ovoid rather than cuneiform, lacks a ventral nuclear groove and has an acrosomal distribution over approximately 85–90% of its dorsal surface. Immediately adjacent to the nuclear membrane the peripheral nucleoplasm in most spermatozoa form an irregular series of distinctive evaginations previously not described in the spermatozoa of any other marsupial. The midpiece is extremely thickened and short, containing no helical network or peripheral plasma membrane specializations. Axonemal structure is unspecialized with no connecting lamellae; dense outer fibres are closely adherent to axonemal doublets. The sperm morphology of this species is highly aberrant in comparison to other macropod taxa and supports the retention of Lagorchestes as a distinctive genus. In light of this new information, skeletal and serological data should be re‐evaluated to determine the true taxonomic and phylogenetic position of this species.",

The zonulae occludentes between two adjacent cells prevented the tracers from reaching the ventricular or vascular sides.

    "abstract": "The accessory olfactory organ of Lampetra fluviatilis was found to consist of clusters of interconnected vesicles in tenuous connection with the exterior medium via the cavity of the olfactory organ. The walls of the vesicles are composed of two types of cells. One type are primary sense cells that resemble the olfactory sense cells in that their nucleus is situated peripherally and their axons pass directly into the brain. They differ from the olfactory sense cells in the size and number of cilia they bear, and also in the internal structure of the cilia. The second cell type are supporting and/or secretory cells. It is concluded that this sense organ is capable of responding to a “special kind” of chemical stimulus and its possible function is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The liver is a well‐defined organ regarding its functions; however, it may present morphological variations among species. Since anurans may be exposed to toxic substances in their environment, which can disrupt liver's morphology and function, descriptive studies of organs are important to be carried out under natural condition. Thus, this study aimed to describe morphological aspects of liver in three Neotropical anuran species commonly used as experimental models: Physalaemus cuvieri (Leptodactylidae), Leptodactylus fuscus (Leptodactylidae) and Rhinella diptycha (Bufonidae). Anatomical, histological and ultrastructural analyses of six male samples of each species were carried out. A restricted analysis of the three species showed that livers' anatomy and ultrastructure are quite similar—they present three lobes, rounded nucleus polyhedral hepatocytes and some glycogen contents; however, histologically, there was a difference in the structural arrangements. In R. diptycha the parenchyma was arranged in a single cord, whereas in P. cuvieri and L. fuscus , there were double ones. This parenchyma structuring is highly variable considering Amphibia class. Knowledge about hepatic morphology and ultrastructure in amphibians is a key measure to detect changes in experimental studies and to infer about possible physiological and / or metabolic changes, when these animals are exposed to adverse conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many studies of the limb bones from birds of the major clades reveal a mosaic evolution in morphological characters. From this, we assume that uninterrupted compact bone evolved independently multiple times outside of the crown group. We hypothesise that there are key intraskeletal changes in the osteohistological features, such as the organisation of the vascular network. To test these hypotheses, we analysed and described the osteohistological features of five different midshaft samples of Gansus yumenensis , a non‐ornithurine Euornithes from China, based on virtual models obtained from synchrotron microtomography scans, a less invasive method that the traditional physical cross section. We performed quantitative analyses with volume, surface area and estimated ratios. The osteohistological features of Gansus yumenensis were compared with those of stem and crown birds. From our analyses, we discuss the pros/cons of using synchrotron microtomography scans compared to traditional physical cross section. Our analyses demonstrate that Gansus yumenensis is the fourth described extinct Euornithes to exhibit uninterrupted bone deposition in all bone samples, providing further support for multiple origins of this feature outside of the bird crown group. Finally, our osteohistological investigation of Gansus yumenensis provides future study avenues regarding the evolution and development of bone tissue in fossil birds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In Squamate reptiles, vitellogenesis in females is marked by an increase in the number and size of follicles, leading to an increase in aerobic metabolism to support the rising energy demand during reproductive activity. Male gametes are smaller than female gametes, and spermiogenesis requires less energy than vitellogenesis. This investigation compares the relationship between aerobic metabolism and reproductive effort in male and female viviparous Tomodon dorsatus snakes. We evaluated the influence of the males' and females' reproductive stages, along with the masses of follicles and testicles, on their aerobic metabolic rate. Our findings show that females have higher maintenance cost of pregnancy than metabolic costs of vitellogenesis. In males, we found no evidence of the reproductive effort influencing aerobic metabolic rates. In T. dorsatus , females have a long period of development and high fecundity. Therefore, the metabolic costs of vitellogenesis represent a critical component in the reproductive effort. On the other hand, males of T. dorsatus maintain a similar mass of gonads throughout the year with constant energy demand. These results reflect the difference in reproductive efforts between females and males of T. dorsatus .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Brachyuran crabs are considered one of the most representative groups in mangroves, being recognised as mangrove engineers. However, species that present commercial interest may have their population structure and spatial distribution affected by human activities, such as crab capture. Therefore, monitoring populations over time is essential. We investigated the population biology, size‐weight relationship, condition factor and spatial distribution of Ucides cordatus in a mangrove ecosystem from southern Brazil, providing information for population status assessment. Males and females differed in abundance and frequency, body size, size‐weight relationship and condition factor. Nonetheless, they presented the same spatial distribution pattern. Abundance, sex ratio and body size also revealed a possible influence of anthropised areas in the configuration and distribution of the species. Our results indicate a possible increase in the exploitation of the species, mainly due to the decrease of the largest male size classes’ frequency. Interspecific competition seems to be a possible biotic factor influencing its condition factor. The spatial species distribution highlighted the importance of sites with less anthropogenic influence for the maintenance of the species that can be considered as key areas for the conservation of the U . cordatus in Babitonga Bay.",

The spermatozoa of the species studied are filiform, consisting of a head region, a midpiece and a tail. The head is characterized by the following features: a depressed acrosome anteriorly, an acrosome vesicle divided into cortex and medulla, paracrystalline subacrosomal material, a pointed tip perforatorium, a circular perforatorium base plate inside the subacrosomal cone, an epinuclear lucent zone separated from the subacrosomal cone by a membrane, a large nuclear rostrum, and round nuclear shoulders. The midpiece presents a bilateral stratified laminar structure, a distal centriole, peripheral fibres 3 and 8 grossly enlarged, columnar mitochondria with linear cristae, dense body rings and a triangular annulus. Finally, the tail is composed of a principal piece and an end piece. An axoneme and a fibrous sheath characterize the principal piece, and the end piece is formed only by an axoneme, which loses its pattern in the last portion. Comparisons with members of Teiidae revealed differences in the numbers of dense rings. A well‐developed epinuclear lucent zone in Mabuya is less prominent among teiids. In the spermatozoa of Mabuya , the first ring of dense bodies is very large, uniquely resembling the condition present in snakes.",

The rostral part of the neurohypophysis abuts on the pars distalis of the adenohypophysis, but does not interdigitate with it. The caudal part of the neurohypophysis is stained densely with aldehyde fuchsin and extensively interdigitates with the pars intermedia, forming a neurointermediate lobe. This organization of the neurohypophysis is intermediate between that of holosteans and that of non‐osteoglossomorph teleosts. The median eminence‐like features of the rostral part of the neurohypophysis are distinct in the Osteoglossidae in contrast to non‐osteoglossomorph teleosts. In Osteoglossum bicirrhosum , immunohistochemical study reveals the presence of somatotropin release‐inhibiting factor‐like substance in the rostral part of the neurohypophysis. Fibers immunoreactive to anti‐arginine vasopressin occur in the neurointermediate lobe almost exclusively. These observations also may support the assumption that the rostral part of the neurohypophysis corresponds functionally to the median eminence. For comparison, the occurrence and distribution of somatotropin release‐inhibiting factor‐like substance, luteinizing hormone‐releasing factor‐like substance and arginine vasopressin‐like substance in the neurohypophysis of Gymnarchus niloticus are described.",

Microtubules appear within the perinuclear plasm and become especially concentrated in a nuclear concavity. Cytoplasmic pores are present locally within the lamella of ER. In addition, localized or discrete bodies composed of fibrogranular material become closely associated with single pore complexes in the lamella of ER. A close association exists between pore complexes (annulate lamellae), the small granular and fibrillar subunits of the fibrogranular bodies, polyribosomes and the nuclear‐associated microtubules during much of spermiogenesis. While the fibrogranular material becomes less concentrated during spermiogenesis, the number of pore complexes in a single section increases such that two, three or even four short annulate lamellae are intercalated within many longitudinally oriented microtubules which are present in the furrow of the spermatid nucleus. Structural relationships observed between cytoplasmic pores (annulate lamellae), fibrogranular bodies, polyribosomes and microtubules are discussed in relation to information about the timing of RNA and protein synthesis. This study extends previous observations about the distribution and structural variations of annulate lamellae elsewhere in the spermatid cytoplasm.",

Abnormalities in these cells result in the disorganization of the bundles of spermatic cells, leading to their destruction and elimination, thereby contributing to the diminished fertility of this mutant.

An extensive granular endoplasmic reticulum and well developed Golgi complexes participate in the mucus manufacture. The balancer epidermis is also extensively innervated throughout by non‐myelinated neurites, most of them without Schwann cells, a feature which argues strongly in favour of the organ also having a sensory function, whose nature has yet to be determined.",

In inner ear sensory epithelia, dark hair cells (DHC) have been suggested to be apoptotic cells. We have examined whether dark cells represent dying cells or whether they are the results of fixation artefacts. The effects of buffer osmolarity and different fixation methods on the incidence of dark hair cells in the inner ear macula sacculi of the rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) were investigated by light and electron microscopy. Glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer with osmolarities of 0, 135, 225, 425, and 560 mosmol were used for fixation by immersion. For comparison, fixation by vascular perfusion as well as the effects of mechanical injury and delayed fixation were studied. DHC were found in all examined saccular maculae except for the delayed fixation protocol where almost all the sensory cells were lost. The number of DHC accounted for 2.5–12.9‰ of the sensory cells. Neither the buffer osmolarity nor the fixation method had significant effects on the frequencies of DHC. Mitotic cell division events were seen exclusively in the apical cell strata of the sensory epithelium. The DHC are suggested to be associated with apoptosis rather than fixation artefacts.",

Eels were hypophysectomized the day before their transfer; in agreement with previous results, electrolyte modifications in sea water were not clearly affected after hypophysectomy for 20 to 50 days. In intact fresh water eels, 8 or 15 injections of cortisol (500 μg/day) induced a reduction of sodium, potassium and calcium levels, and an increase of chloride. After hypophysectomy, only sodium and calcium were reduced. In intact sea water eels, cortisol treatment did not produce significant electrolyte changes after 8 injections, but a slight increase after 20 days. In hypophysectomized animals, after 15 injections, a transitory increase of sodium, potassium and chloride occurred, calcium was slightly affected.

The circadian cycle of secretion of both hypothalamic neurosecretory nuclei N. supraopticus and N. paraventricularis in mice was studied by histological, histochemical, biochemical and electron‐microscopical methods. Both areas undergo a circadian secretion cycle (24 h‐rhytm). The activity of metabolism increases at the beginning of night, whereas by day the cells are considered to be in a phase of restitution and transportation of the secretion. Especially increases the volume of the cell nuclei (synthesis of RNA and proteins) and the activity of the extralysosomal unspecific esterase rises to maximal values. From midnight till the beginning of the light‐phase the cells show a maximal volume of the nuclei and an increased secretion as well as higher activity of acid phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. Unspecific esterase activity, on the other hand, diminished. There was a noticable increase in the quantity of neurosecretion in both areas, it reached a maximum at the beginning of the light‐phase, whereas the volume of the nuclei and the activity of acid phosphatase and thiamine pyrophosphatase diminished. The neurosecretion is more and more transported to the hypophysis. The cells restitute during the light‐phase and reach their starting level.",

Looking for a reference size for quantitative studies The variability of the brain‐weight in the rainbow trout ( Salmo gairdneri ) is less than that of the body‐weight. The variability of the lengths studied (standard, total, preanal and cephalic lengths) is comparable and approaches that of the body‐weight's cubic root. The intraspecific brain/body‐weight relationship shows an allometric coefficient of .472, a little more than in Reptilia (Saurians: .39) and much more than in Mammalia (.23). The study of the various relationships brain‐weight/lengths and lengths/body‐weight shows that the preanal length is the best, and the cephalic length the worst in each case. It is therefore possible to substitute for the body‐weight this preanal length, the variation of which following most closely, in our instantaneous sample, both body‐ and brain‐weight's variations. Zusammenfassung Das Gehirn der Regenbogenforelle (Salmo gairdneri, Pisces, Teleostei, Salmonidae). Untersuchung einer Bezugsgrösse für quantitative Studien Bei der Regenbogenforelle ( Salmo gairdneri Richardson) ist die Variabilität des Hirngewichts deutlich geringer als die des Körpergewichts. Die Variabilität verschiedener untersuchter Liniarmasse (Standardlänge, Totallänge, Preanallänge und Kopflänge) ist vergleichbar und ähnlich jener der Kubikwurzel aus dem Körpergewicht. Die innerartliche Hirn‐Körpergewichtsbeziehung folgt bei Salmo gairdneri einem Allometriekoeffizienten (Regressionskoeffizienten) von 0,462, d.h. ist merklich grösser als bei den Eidechsen (0,39) und den Säugern (0,23). Das Studium der Beziehungen zwischen dem Hirngewicht und den verschiedenen vorgenommenen Längenmessungen und der letzteren mit dem Körpergewicht zeigt, dass die Korrelationen mit der Praeanallänge ( a ) am besten, die mit der Kopflänge ( c ) am schlechtesten sind. Man kann deswegen das Körpergewicht durch diese Praeanallänge ersetzen, deren Variation denen des Gehirns und Körpers am besten korreliert ist. Résumé Chez la Truite Arc‐en‐ciel ( Salmo gairdneri Richardson), la variabilité du poids encéphalique est bien plus faible que celle du poids somatique. La variabilité des diverses mesures linéaires testées (longueurs standard, totale, préanale et céphalique) est comparable et voisine de celle de la racine cubique du poids somatique. La relation pondérale encéphalo‐somatique intraspécifique a pour coefficient d'allométrie 0,462 (coefficient de régression) chez Salmo gairdneri , c'est à dire sensiblement plus que chez les Reptiles Sauriens (0,39) ou les Mammifères (0,23). L'étude des relations liant le poids encéphalique aux diverses mensurations effectuées et ces dernières au poids somatique indique que c'est la longueur préanale ( a ) qui est la meilleure et la longueur céphalique ( c ) la plus mauvaise.

This study serves to provide information on the morphology and ultrastructure of the spermatozoa and testes of P. pardus that can be used to help in the development, testing and optimization of reproductive techniques. The objectives of this study were (i) to assess the morphology and ultrastructure of the spermatozoa by means of fluorescence and electron microscopy respectively, and (ii) to examine the morphology and ultrastructure of the testicular tissue as well as of the stages of spermatogenesis using light and electron microscopy. In this study, it was noted that the morphology and ultrastructure of the spermatozoa are similar to those reported in other feline and mammalian species and that a high amount of morphologically abnormal ejaculated sperm was found to be a common occurrence in all samples obtained.",

Three male morphs (grey, yellow and orange) coexist in Sceloporus aeneus , a Mexican endemic oviparous lizard. Using a histological perspective, we test the hypothesis that spermatogenic output does not vary across morphotypes of S . aeneus during its maximum testicular activity. Males of S . aeneus (five grey, five yellow and five orange) were collected in Calimaya, Estado de México, Mexico. Snout‐vent length ( SVL ), testis mass, diameter and epithelial heights for the seminiferous tubules and epididymis, and the number of layers of germ cells did not vary among morphs; moreover, according to principal component analysis, a high overlap among lateral colour morphs exists. Our results suggest strongly that the lateral colour morphs in S . aeneus have the same spermatogenic output, and natural selection may be a stronger driving force than sexual selection within this species. Further studies into other lizard species with multiple morphotypes are required to determine whether the lack of variation in spermatogenic output observed in this endemic lizard is consistent across polymorphic species which will provide a greater understanding of the selective mechanisms acting on an individual’s fitness.",

High Mobility Group Proteins ( HMG s) are involved in chromatin assembling and control of transcription, especially during development. Transcriptome data indicate that HMG s are abundantly expressed in the early regenerating tail of lizards but their cellular localization remains unknown. Protein bands at 60–62 and 28–30 kD a are detected in western blots, more intense in the regenerating blastema. Immunodetection of HMG s in regenerating tail of the lizard Podarcis muralis indicates that these proteins are mainly localized in tissues where cell proliferation is as active as the apical wound epidermis, ependyma of the spinal cord and pro‐muscle aggregates. Few immunolabelled cells were seen in the regenerating cartilage and growing myomeres or nerves. Only in the wound epidermis labelled cells show a prevalent nuclear labelling while in other tissues a cytoplasmic labelling is prevalent. Only sparse immunolabelled cells are observed in the apical mesenchymal blastema and in the derived connective tissues formed in the mature regions of the regenerating tail, also destined to form adipose cells. The study suggests that the tissues with the highest immunolabelling correspond to those containing more proliferating cells, and that HMG s are mainly activated in these cells to promote cell division for the growth of the new tail.",

Meckel's cartilage, composed of hyaline cartilage, was present within the neurovascular canal of both species. The persistence through to sub‐adulthood of Meckel's cartilage in the ostrich and emu is a feature not previously reported in any other avian species. The proximal end of Meckel's cartilage was ossified in the region of the articular bone and the distal end was ossified in some specimens. Although this structure may ossify at a much later stage in life, the function in young and sub‐adult birds may be to dampen shockwaves along the intramandibular nerve that result from the action of pecking. In the ostrich, the M. pseudotemporalis superficialis tendon inserted onto the supra‐angular bone and Meckel's cartilage. In the emu, a small portion of the tendon was attached to the supra‐angular bone and the main part to Meckel's cartilage. The persistence of Meckel's cartilage in adult lepidosaurs, crocodilians and ratites represents an unusual shared trait between the extant members of the above groups.",

Microridge patterns progress in complexity during fish embryogenesis, often transitioning from abundant surface microvilli to the classical fingerprint arrangement.

Fluorescent labelling of F‐actin and morphometric analysis were therefore used to assess changes in epidermal microridge patterns in juvenile and adult sunfish ( Lepomis gibbosus ). The microridge patterns found in adult pumpkinseed were similar to that described for many fishes, consisting of whorls or complex multi‐branched ridges. The microridge patterns of the scales from three different‐sized groups of juvenile pumpkinseed were distinctly different from that of adult, however, and were present mainly as unbranched concentric or nearly concentric rings in the two larger juvenile groups. In the smallest juveniles, microridges were often apparent as fragmented ridges with abundant actin puncta. Larger juveniles sometimes displayed mixed patterns, with some microridges similar to that of both adult and juvenile patterns. The results show a transition from simple microridge patterns in juvenile pumpkinseeds to distinctly different, diverse and more complex patterns in adults. The different pattern types may reflect particular microridge functions relevant to fish size and age.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hymenoepimecis wasps (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) are ectoparasitoids of spiders that modify the hosts’ behaviour by inducing changes in webs. Variations in the male reproductive tract contribute to enhancing our understanding of the reproductive behaviour of these insects. This study describes the morphology of the male reproductive tract of Hymenoepimecis bicolor (Brullé, 1846) using light microscope. The male reproductive tract of H. bicolor consists of a pair of testes, each containing a single follicle, two vasa deferentia , one ejaculatory duct and two accessory glands. The testis follicle has cysts at various stages of spermatogenesis, indicating ongoing sperm cell development and maturation. The vasa deferentia are elongated, with a coiled distal portion, whereas the proximal regions are laterally associated with a pair of accessory glands. The wall of the vasa deferentia has simple cuboidal epithelium. The accessory glands had a simple columnar epithelium with the lumen filled with heterogeneous content. The seminal vesicle is absent. The similarity in the anatomy and histology of the male reproductive tract of H. bicolor with other Hymenoptera suggests that the parasitoid behaviour does not result in significant alteration to their reproductive organs, indicating that the reproductive tract is conserved in Hymenoptera, regardless of their behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Body and limb size are associated with many aspects of the biology of animals. Geographic variation in morphological traits has often been investigated through ecogeographical rules. Bergmann's rule posits an inverse relationship between body size and temperature in homeotherms, while Allen's rule posits that endothermic animals inhabiting colder climates have relatively shorter protruding parts (e.g., limbs) in comparison to populations from warmer climates. However, the applicability and validity of these rules in poikilotherms are currently contentious. In this study, we aimed to test predictions of Bergmann's and Allen's rules in populations of the Neotropical frog Boana platanera . We analysed 142 adult male museum specimens from 17 localities along a mountain range in western Venezuela. We obtained six external morphological measurements and assessed the correlation of body size and limb size with temperature data for each locality. Our results were contrary to the expectations but consistent with previous studies. All this together indicates that exceptions to the Bergmann's and Allen's rules are frequent and idiosyncratic in anurans. We discuss alternative hypotheses that could explain geographic variation of body and limb size in future studies.",

Carapace length (CL, mm) and width (CW, not including lateral spines, mm) were measured, and the sex and stage of morphological maturity were identified. A total of 403 females and 427 males of C. ornatus were found and analysed. The overall sex ratio did not differ from 1:1. Males were larger and heavier than females. Biometric relations (CL‐CW and TW‐CW) were different between sexes. The size at first morphological maturity (CW m ) was 38.20 mm for females and 44.00 mm for males. The reproductive and recruitment periods were continuous, with some peaks throughout the year. Despite C. ornatus being a frequent species in shrimp bycatch, its exploitation status is still unknown.",

Ticks are seriously damage the production of sheep and goats, resulting in heavy economic loss to farmers. The present study investigated microscopic and molecular identification of ticks and tick‐borne anaplasmosis infesting sheep and goats in three agro‐ecological zones of Pakistan. The collected ticks were identified at species level based on their morphological features through microscopy by using taxonomic keys. Four Rhipicephalus (R.) species namely: R. guilhoni Rh. geigyi , R. annulatus , R. pulchellus , two Haemaphysalis (Hae) spp. Hae. sulcate , Hae. punctate , one Ixodes ricinus and Hyalomma anatolicum were identified. The morphological variations in their body sizes, scutal pattern, female genital opening, spiracular plate length and male adanal plate were recorded. Furthermore, we assessed the effectiveness of utilizing the 16S rRNA gene sequence to differentiate Anaplasma samples at the species level. Microscopically suspected positive blood samples for Anaplasma were subjected to DNA extraction. Anaplasma was observed in the blood of 14 animals. The sequence similarity between Anaplasma marginale and the reference genome were 99.25%, while below this value indicating a distinct species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close similarity with A. marginale isolates from Iran, Vietnam and Pakistan This study contributes to the epidemiology of ticks and TBPs in the KP province and highlights the importance of proactive TBP surveillance in livestock.",

In some insects, the fat body has two types (peripheral and perivisceral fat bodies) according to its location. In the fat body, trophocytes are known to be the basic cell type. Other fat body cells differentiating from the trophocytes are urocytes, mycetocytes, chromatocytes and haemoglobin cells. The study aimed to demonstrate the general structure and cell types of the fat body during the postembryonic developmental stages of Bombyx mori (L.). With Haematoxylin–Eosin staining, there is a single type of fat body throughout the larval stages but during Pp and P0 stages it consists of perivisceral and peripheral fat bodies. We also observed that the compact structure of the fat body at the beginning of the larval stage began to loosen as it transformed into the pupal stage. In the adult stage, it was reorganized during the metamorphosis and it didn't show both fat bodies distinction. At this stage, the fat body appeared in a loose, lace‐like structure. We determined that B. mori fat body only consists of trophocytes and also among them; the fat body associated cells, oenocytes are detected.",

In evolution, mucous cells perform the classical secretory function of mucus and act as sentinels for external insults, particularly in mammals. However, this topic has not been much analysed in the lower metazoans. This study aims to investigate the role of mucous cells in Actinia equina (Anthozoa, Hexacorallia) (Linnaeus, 1758) by using confocal microscopy and bioinformatics. The results show colocalization of Toll‐like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Mucin2 (MUC2) on these cells, suggesting a crosstalk between defence response and mucus secretion in cnidarians. Furthermore, the presence of TLR2 on the surface of mucous cells suggests their involvement in host defence responses, as occurs in vertebrates. Moreover, through in silico analysis, we confirmed the presence of orthologous genes for the tested antibodies, providing additional evidence to support our results from an evolutionary perspective. These data suggest that mucous cells play a defensive role throughout evolution, helping us understand how these cells have developed and adapted across phylogenesis. This information also provides new insights into the defensive strategies of invertebrates and clarifies their evolutionary history.",

Therefore, in the present study, we analysed and described the squamation pattern and scale morphology of five species of Zeiformes occurring on the Brazilian coast: Allocyttus verrucosus , Grammicolepis brachiusculus , Xenolepidichthys dalgleishi , Zenion hololepis and Zenopsis conchifer . Our analysis revealed greater morphological diversity than previously reported for this order. All species, except the scaleless Zenopsis conchifer , presented cycloid scales of spinoid subtype. Grammicolepis and Zenion presented exclusively scales of the spinoid subtype, whereas both Allocyttus and Xenolepidichthys also displayed true cycloid subtype. A. verrucosus is characterised by two distinct groups of scales of different sizes that form scale clusters. G. brachiusculus and X. dalgleishi presented a unique vertically elongated scale covering most of the body. Small bony plates were observed at the dorsal‐ and anal‐fin bases of G. brachiusculus , X. dalgleishi and Z. hololepis . The variation observed is putatively useful for the systematics of the order.",

There were suggestions it could have been used in defence, assisted in the mastication process, aided in the formation of words (i.e. speaking), or that it played a role in mate choice. None of these explanations were satisfactory. This paper, backed up by observations on people from different parts of the world and cultures, using their chin to hold or clamp down objects resting on a person's arms in front of the body or to free the person's hands for other tasks, offers an explanation that has support from results on the evolution of bipedalism from apes to bipedal australopithecines, including Homo sapiens , and the importance of the hands in hominids as well as the heritability of the trait.",

This study provides a detailed histological and ultrastructural characterization of gill morphology in two sympatric endemic aphaniids, Aphaniops furcatus and Aphaniops hormuzensis , inhabiting an ecologically extreme environment in southern Iran. Specimens were collected from the Khurgu hot‐sulphuric spring in the Hormozgan River System which drains into the Persian Gulf, and examined using haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Both species exhibited gill structures typical of teleosts, with primary and secondary lamellae essential for efficient gas exchange. In A. furcatus , gills displayed variations linked to size and gender, with numerous secondary lamellae and a variety of epithelial cells, including squamous, chloride, mucus, blood, and pillar cells. Air exposure led to interlamellar cell masses (ILCM) growth, reducing the lamellae surface area. In A. hormuzensis , gill arches featured a double row of primary filaments with secondary lamellae facilitating oxygen exchange, supported by pillar cells and dense distribution of mucous cells throughout the epithelium. The study highlights the adaptive mechanisms of A. furcatus in response to fluctuating environmental conditions and underscores the evolutionary conservation of gill morphology among teleosts. These findings provide crucial insights into respiratory efficiency and ecological adaptability, emphasizing eco‐evolutionary acclimation to extreme aquatic habitats.",

Since other studies have shown considerable variations in molluscan gut histology and the relatively few recent ultrastructural reports have revealed novel cellular structures in the molluscan gastrointestinal tract, this investigation was directed toward ultrastructural clarification of the neritid intestine. Seven principal cell types constituted the intestinal architecture, including absorptive cells, zymogen cells, neural and endocrine cells, myocytes, pigment and gland cells. The intestinal epithelium was composed mainly of tall ciliated (9 plus 2 complement of microtubules) columnar absorptive cells which also possessed microvilli, extensive deposits of non‐membrane‐bound lipid‐like droplets, and large reservoirs of glycogen‐like granules. Less frequent, columnar zymogen cells contained numerous large zymogen secretory granules and possessed microvilli but not cilia. Small endocrine‐like cells with secretory granules were observed basolaterally between some absorptive cells, resembling mammalian gut endocrine cells. Nerve fibers were prevalent in close association with the epithelial cells. A thin layer of non‐striated muscle was present, as well as a serosally located gland composed of storage cells with a granular matrix and large granules.",

The former type was not completely differentiated 3 months post‐hatching, but was the main glial cell type at the age of 1 yr and in adulthood. Smaller numbers of oligodendrocytes were found in the white matter of adult animals than fibrous astrocytes. It was concluded that during growth, there is a progressive decrease in the dark, basophilic and electron‐dense glioblasts, most of which develop as astrocytes.",

The applications of such techniques to the problem of crustacean evolution is first examined using the results presented by Wilson (in this issue). It is found that the degree of correlation of characters in the head vs trunk regions explains very well the grouping of taxa in the cladograms, suggesting that the groups are nothing more than mathematical constructs. The argument is presented that functions of different parts of the crustacean body need to be determined, along with an understanding of how the body morphology is designed in accordance with the dominant functions. A method for producing hypothesized phylogenetic sequences from an analysis of body morphology is proposed and examined using the amphipod family Iphimediidae. It is suggested that cladograms are merely hypotheses and can be tested using functional morphological information of the type outlined.",

Formed progressively, the cyst can indicate the extent of entry into diapause. In this study the ultrastructure of the midgut epithelium during encystment of CIV was compared with that of active CIV and females. In active individuals two well‐differentiated epithelial cell types were observed: vacuolar cells (B‐cells), and cells without vacuoles but with more densely packed microvilli and abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (F/R cells). In encysted specimens a striking transformation of the midgut epithelial layer was noted. Only inactive nuclei with highly concentrated euchromatin and encircled by a thin rim of hyaloplasm were observed. Compartments of both urosome and especially cephalothorax displayed large lipid‐rich lacunae. At the beginning of encystment, the midgut epithelium showed an intermediate state. Changes in ultrastructure observed in the midgut epithelium of D. thomasi clearly reflect different stages of diapause, and represent clear evidence of profound reorganization, which is progressively induced by diapause in the organism.",

Although the larynx is an important morphological structure for sound production in frogs, few studies describe the structures and processes of its parts in hylids. We studied the hyolaryngeal anatomy of both males and females of Scinax ruber (Laurenti, 1768), using clearing and double staining methods, comparing it with that of Scinax wandae (Pyburn and Fouquette, 1971) , Scinax kennedyi (Pyburn, 1973) and other hylid species. We found that S. ruber has the largest arytenoid cartilage of any species of the subfamily Scinaxinae studied to date. We described both the laryngeal differences among three Scinax species and the interspecific variability in the shapes of the projections of the arytenoid in the males of these species. The taxonomic characters (presence/absence of processes of the cartilage of Santorini, oesophageal process or bronchial processes) described here can play a key role in differentiating these species from Scinax species and from other species. In addition, we want to contribute to the natural history and comparison of the larynges in Scinax and within the genus and the Hylidae.",

Because little is known about the nutritional ecology of this species, we investigated the nutritional physiology of C. santaanae to better understand their dietary and energetic needs with the goal of generating data useful in conservation efforts. Individuals of C. santaanae were raised for six weeks on an algal diet in the laboratory. They digested approximately 45%, 55% and 80% of protein, soluble carbohydrate and lipid, respectively, from the algal diet. Their metabolic rate (~0.0024 mg O 2 min −1 g −1 ) suggested they would need to eat more than their body mass per day of an algal diet to thrive. Digestive enzyme activities of the laboratory‐reared and wild‐caught fish showed patterns typical of a “plug‐flow reactor” gut with high intake and rapid gut transit. However, lipase activities remained elevated throughout the gut, and this result, coupled with the lipid digestibility data, and evidence of feeding selectivity on specific diatom taxa in nature, suggests that C. santaanae targets diatoms as it grazes and that diatom lipid may be crucial to their survival. Our data set provides parameters that can be used in conservation modelling efforts towards habitat restoration.",

The Aspidoscelis gularis complex is one of the groups of whiptail lizards that exhibits one of the widest distributions in North America, occupying a great variety of environments. Its members are similar in morphology, which has contributed to the taxonomic uncertainty in the group. In this study, variation in size and head shape was analysed considering a phylogenetic hypothesis based on the Cytb and ND2 mitochondrial genes. Six evolutionarily significant units were found, of which the morphological patterns were analysed. Eleven morphological characters and two landmark configurations of the head were used. Analysis of size revealed a pattern of sexual dimorphism, while geometric morphometrics suggested that there is no dimorphism in head shape. Neither size nor shape shows unique patterns of morphological variation between the evolutionarily significant units, which could be attributed to morphological conservatism and recurrent hybridization in whiptails.",

The males show maximum gonadal activity from March to July; in August, they show a rapid regression, and in September, quiescence is evident only in some males while in others recrudescence has already begun. Finally, in October and November, the process of recrudescence is obvious. The females showed some asynchrony, but for most, vitellogenesis occurred from April to June and eggs in the oviduct were evident in May, June and August. Oviposition occurs in July and August and by September or October there is no more gonadal activity in the ovaries. The clutch size was 5 ± 0.2 eggs, and hatchlings appeared in May–June and September suggesting that possibly two clutches are produced per breeding season. Reproductive activity in both sexes was like that of other lizards from temperate environments. However, the long period of gonadal recrudescence in both sexes (6 months) and rapid regression and quiescence in males of the studied population suggest plasticity in gonadal activity.",

A change in environments occurs for alpine newts in the course of the annual cycle because of its aquatic adaptations for reproduction. The results confirmed the variability in the shape and size of olfactory organs between breeding and non‐breeding seasons. The presence of the ovoid cells with microvilli at its apical part was determined in the OE of males and females during breeding season. Giant ORNs, a subtype of ciliated ORNs, were observed only during the newt's non‐breeding season. The presence of the ovoid cells during the terrestrial phase was not determined. Thus, its role might be associated with reproduction.",

Therefore, we explored this using samples from a population of each. The first sample from Corong Corong Beach, El Nido, Philippines, consisted of 81 adult C. incisum , of which 33 were female and 48 were male. The second sample from Olango Island, Philippines consisted of 73 adult C. esculentum , of which 40 were female and 33 were male. Bias in sex ratio between species was not significant. However, there was bias in sex ratio within species, where males from both species were smaller in axial length than females. We found no evidence of pseudohermaphroditism. The black colouration of the aperture is a phenotype shared by many stromboidians, and 7.4% of C. incisum population exhibited this trait, while the C. esculentum population contained 50.1% black apertures specimens. Preliminary DArTseq analysis indicates that organisms with the black aperture colouration are nested within the populations. Our study fills a knowledge gap on C. incisum and C. esculentum population structure, and gives greater insights to size dynamics of stromboidian taxa in general.",

In E. bilineatus , the epididymal duct epithelium is simple, composed of secretory cells, cylindrical in shape and acidophilic cytoplasm. In the testis of the three lizards there was a positive immunolocation accentuated for α‐SMA in the dense connective tissue of the tunica albuginea. A moderate reaction was observed in the connective tissue albuginous and in the layer of smooth muscle fibers in a circumferential arrangement of the epididymal duct. The immunolocation for desmin was accentuated in the fibers of the testicular albuginea of E. bilineatus , while in U. vautier and E. perditus was moderate. In the epididymis, only in E. perditus and E. bilineatus positive immunoreaction was verified.

They were laparatomized for evaluation of macroscopic characteristics and the digestive tube segments were collected for fixation in 10% neutral formalin for histological processing, after 48 h of fixation. Macroscopically, the digestive tube had an oesophageal segment in the abdominal cavity, with a J‐shaped saccular stomach, in addition to a small intestine divided into duodenum, jejunum‐ileum and terminal ileum. In the large intestine, an organ dilatation was observed from the small intestine with a one‐way oral‐aboral ending in the anus, which was called the descending colon. Morphological similarity of the walls of all segments with those of other mammals was observed; however, it presented some peculiarities such as the absence of oesophageal glands, Brunner in the intestine, cecum and appendages. The anatomical disposition and tissue pattern were similar to that found in other insectivorous species. The adaptations of the digestive tube of this species are possibly due to the insectivorous feeding habits, which can be impacted due to anthropic actions in foraging environments.",

This study describes the digestive tract and accessory organs of I. japonica , using morphological and histological methods. The fish (10 individual fish, 24.5 ± 0.98 cm in total length) were obtained from Libong Island, Thailand. Integrated morphological and histological data showed that the digestive tract was composed of oesophagus, stomach, pyloric caeca and intestine, with accessory organs. All digestive tracts consisted of four layers, including mucosa, submucosa, muscularis and serosa. Two stomach regions were identified (cardiac and pyloric stomachs). Several clusters of gastric glands were identified in the cardiac stomach. Each gland was a unicellular structure. The apical surface of this gland contained the vacuolar cell. The intestine was lined with a simple columnar structure with goblet cells that was similar to pyloric caecum. Goblet cells were rare in the anterior intestine, in contrast to the posterior intestine where goblet cells were abundant. The numerous of hepatocyte was mostly observed in the liver, whereas an exocrine acinar cell of pancreas was also identified. The results of our observations provided the first information of the digestive tract of I. japonica and can be applied to advanced study, such as physiology and histopathology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Myzostomida are putatively nested within the errant Annelida and exhibit a unique morphology. The latter fact might possibly be related to their long host‐dependent radiation. Hence, an incomplete segmentation, lack of prominent sensory structures in adults and a dorso‐ventrally flattened body are just some examples. Although numerous investigations of the nervous system exist for myzostomids, detailed ultrastructural as well as histological examinations of neuronal structures are lacking so far. Therefore, we investigate the nervous system of Myzostoma cirriferum Leuckart, 1836 using a comparative approach including paraffin histology, serial semi‐thin sections, immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural investigations. Our analyses reveal a lack of complexity within the anterior‐most neuronal condensation (herein called brain) of adult specimens. Hence, prominent tracts or glomeruli are absent, and a glial layer surrounding the brain or radial‐like glial cells are lacking. Nevertheless, the ultrastructure of the ventral nervous system is comparable to other Errantia. Therefore, our investigations hint towards a reduction of neuronal complexity in Myzostomida. Additionally, an ontogenetic simplification seems plausible, although further investigations are necessary to verify such a hypothesis. A simplification of neuronal structures due to a drastic change in lifestyle was so far mainly observed for basally branching annelid clades.",

A comparison was conducted between the terminal segments and muscles of S. nudiseta and previously studied species of the subfamily Azeliinae. Notable differences were found between previously studied species of the subfamily Azeliinae and Synthesiomyia + Muscina . These differences correspond to apomorphic character states in Synthesiomyia + Muscina , including the large size of the ejaculatory apodeme and the powerful constrictors of the ejaculatory apodeme M 23; the completely membranous sternite VI; the membrane connection of the muscle ISM 5 ( lower ); the small size of pregonites and postgonites; and the joints of the phallapodeme muscles М 2 1 at the base of the hypandrial arms. Based on these differences, Synthesiomyia + Muscina can be assigned to the subfamily Reinwardtiinae, as has been confirmed by recent molecular studies. However, similarities in the set of pregenital muscles and the set of phallapodeme muscles between Synthesiomyia + Muscina and the Azeliinae were also noted. These similarities may be considered as plesiomorphic character states, indicating their phylogenetic relationship. It can be argued that Reinwardtiinae + Azeliinae constitute sister groups and occupy the basal position within the family Muscidae.",

We analysed measurements of legs of 127 species of all genera of Polistinae, and of 18 species of other subfamilies, with the intent of investigating the occurrence and phylogenetic locations of morphometric patterns. Body‐size variation across Polistinae was determinant as to the absolute dimensions of legs, but allometric effects are generally small when comparing proportional length differences between differently sized species. Quite differently, size‐independent shape aspects are notably distinct as expressed by regression residuals and are clearly phylogenetically structured. Most distinctive are the very long mid and hind legs (and simultaneously exceedingly short forelegs) of Mischocyttarus species, and the comparatively shorter legs of some Epiponini. We found that forelegs have evolved with relative independence of the mid and hind legs, which is probably related to functions associated with the transport and manipulation of food and materials. Most examined solitary species showed mid and hindlegs shorter than most social polistines and vespines. Forefemur shape in some solitary species (euparagiines, masarines and some eumenines) may be functionally related to fossorial habits.",

The terminal cells also contain Golgi complexes and large membrane‐bound vacuoles containing electron‐dense material. The ciliary bundles (flames) of terminal cells 2 and 3 protrude into the lumen of the centrally located terminal cell I. The complex is surrounded by a sheath containing numerous filaments. The terminal complex of H. rostratus resembles that of the macrostomid Paromalostomum proceracauda , lending support to the view that the two taxa are closely related. © 1998 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

    "abstract": "The structural organization of the head of the spermatozoon from the African murid rodent Dasymys incomtus was investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy and after incubation in various chemical agents. The results show that it is falciform in shape with a bifurcated rostral extension lying just caudal to the apical hook. The nucleus protrudes into the base of this extension but it is largely composed of a massive elaboration of the sperm head cytoskeleton which is very resistant to dispersion by chemical agents. This elaborate accessory structure of the sperm head shows similar morphology to the ventral processes on the sperm head of Australasian hydromyine rodents. The possible functional and evolutionary significance of these findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The nervous system of three species of the Temnocephalida has been studied using the GAIF method (which in small flatworms mostly reveals sensory catecholaminergic neurons). These species represent the evolution from the primitive “turbellarian‐like” temnocephalids to the most specialised ones with tentacles and a sucker. The numbers and positions of GAIF‐positive neurons are invariant within each species and do not change from hatching to full maturity. A characteristic unpaired neuron contributing to the innervation of the anterior margin of the body is present in all species: such a cell has previously been found only in marine Thalassovortex tyrrhenicus (Dalyellidae) which confirms close relationships between these taxa. Our series of species shows (i) a reduction in number of GAIF‐positive perikarya associated with the lateral cords and reduction of GAIF‐positive innervation on the ventral side of the body, which is probably related to the loss of ciliary locomotion (the shift to passive hunting and looping locomotion) and (ii) reinforcement of the GAIF‐positive innervation of the anterior end of the body which begins to play an important role in capturing the prey. The retention of the medial unpaired neuron and nearly identical sets of GAIF‐positive neurons in Diceratocephala boschmai and Craspedella pedum (rather different in morphology) give the first indication (in the Plathelminthes) of persistence of homologous neurons through significant evolutionary transformations of the organs they innervate.",

Regeneration was most rapid and greatest in posterior and median regions. Removal of anterior-posterior and left-right middle thirds and of anterior, posterior, right or left dorsal or ventral quarter anlagen (R. catesbeiana) showed similar regenerative gradients. Regeneration never occurred when entire anlagen were removed. Extirpations of early and half-developed lingual cornua were made in metamorphosing and young adult R. catesbeiana, R. clamitans R. palustris and R. pipiens. Regeneration occurred where preoperative cornua did not exceed 1.5 mm, but never when they exceeded this length. It is concluded that anuran tongue anlagen, at the stages operated on, possess considerable reorganizing powers following partial extirpations.",

In the spaces between the cells in the upper half of the epithelium there are loosely arranged cuticular lamellae adjacent to the microvillous borders. The epithelial cells have large, basally situated nuclei, whereas the apical parts have extensive arrangements of tightly packed and orderly arranged smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Clear vesicles and microbod–ies are present in the cytoplasm. The gland has a structural potential for high pheromone‐producing capacity (the well‐developed endoplasmic reticulum) as well as an effective emission apparatus (the microvillous borders/cuticular lamellae). These two elements could facilitate a pulsed pheromone emission that is effective in arousing the sensory system of males.",

All the cell types were evident in one day‐old animals, except for immunoreactive folliculotropic cells which were first apparent in five day‐old animals. Mammotropic cells were small and relatively inactive in neonatal animals compared with the juvenile and adults. Somatotrops increased in apparent activity between one and five days postpartum, were most active in the juveniles, and less so in the adults. The corticotrops, found predominantly in the anterior regions of the pars distalis, appeared to increase in number and activity in adult seals. The gonadotrops increased in numbers as the animals aged, but the cells tended to be smaller in the juvenile and adult animals. The thyrotrops were small cells found only in the central regions of the pars distalis.

At the mouth, between the integumental epithelium and the pharyngeal epithelium proper, was a transition zone. Among the epithelial cells of this transition were monociliated sensory cells and the necks of bucco‐pharyngeal secretory cells of two types. The pharyngeal epithelium proper was densely ciliated, with long ciliary rootlets and mitochondria. It was surrounded by two layers of muscles. The gastrodermis consisted of phagocytes and typical secretory Minotian cells. It was underlain by a delicate basal lamina and muscle fibers. Distinctive of the phagocytes was the presence of differentiated cilia, cup‐shaped mitochondria, and vacuoles with dense inclusions. Morphological differences between pharyngeal and gastrodermal cilia suggest functional differences. Experiments using latex beads as tracers and the identification of acid phosphatase in cytoplasmic vacuoles pointed to a high level of endocytotic and digestive activity in the phagocytes. Our data demonstrate that the basic structure of the digestive tract in S. grande conforms well to that of other free‐living platyhelminths, but it does have ultrastructural peculiarities.",

The diameter of the TCMROs was shown to increase distally, with an increase up to 350% recorded for the crayfish. The tapered shape of the crayfish TCMRO was demonstrated to amplify movements mechanically at the transducer region where the afferent nerves attach. Serial sectioning of the TCMROs, showed that the fibre number increased in the proximal to distal direction from 14 to 30 fibres in the crayfish and from 7 to 20 in the crab. Optical sectioning with the laser scanning confocal microscope revealed that the increase in fibre numbers was the result of muscle fibres branching in the distal third section of the TCMRO. The percentage of muscle tissue in the cross‐sectional area in the TCMRO was found to be only 35.2% and 64.6% in the crayfish and crab, respectively. Longitudinal sectioning using laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed the average sarcomere length of the TCMRO muscle fibres of both species to be in the intermediate range for crustacean muscle fibres (4.1 ± 0.1 µm and 4.55 ± 0.34 µm for the crayfish and crab) compared with the long sarcomere muscle fibres in the associated promotor muscles (7.87 ± 0.2 and 10.6 ± 0.6 µm). The distinct morphology of the TCMRO muscle fibres – smaller diameter, intermediate sarcomere length and branching of fibres compared to the larger, long sarcomere promotor fibre muscle fibres – suggest that the TCMRO muscle fibres are specialized in their role of proprioception.",

Vascular endothelial growth inhibitor ( VEGI ), vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and its receptors (flk1/ KDR , flt1/fms, flt4) are required for epithelial and endothelial cell survival and apoptosis. Especially, VEGF and its receptors are critical for the development of the lung and serve as a maintenance factor during adult life. To determine the function of VEGI , VEGF and its receptors in the posthatching lung development, we revealed its expression and localization using by immunohistochemical procedure. VEGI , VEGF and its receptors were observed in the structural components of the bronchi, atria and air capillaries, as well as in the pulmonary blood vessels throughout the posthatching development period. On the other hand, immunostaining for VEGI , VEGF and its receptors was faintly detected in the glands of the secondary bronchi. Furthermore, it was determined that the secondary bronchial and atrial muscles did not display VEGF immunoreactions. Our results showed that VEGF and its receptors (flt1/fms, flk1/ KDR and flt4) and VEGI were expressed at varying intensity by different cell groups. Therefore, they are also required for the development of the lung component during posthatching period.",

After the excision of DBXI segment, no FB + motoneurons supplying c‐ TRAP were found while the mean number of those supplying th‐ TRAP was significantly decreased. A slight decrease in average numbers of sensory and autonomic neurons implemented in the innervation of both parts of TRAP was also observed.

    "abstract": "Abstract The vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) family belong to the platelet‐derived growth factor supergene family and is involved in angiogenesis and mitogenesis. The VEGF – VEGFR system regulates endothelial cell proliferation, migration, vascular permeability, secretion and other non‐endothelial cells functions. To clarify the possible role of endothelial and non‐endothelial cells, VEGF and its receptors, vascular endothelial cell growth inhibitor ( VEGI ) were immunohistochemically examined in oropharyngeal organs. Ten adult partridges were used in this study and the pharynx and larynx were dissected together with the palate and tongue. VEGI , VEGF and its receptor were highly expressed in luminal epithelial and stromal cells, when compared to glandular epithelial and muscle cells ( P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, VEGF , its receptors and VEGI were expressed rather strongly in the endothelial cells of the blood capillaries and in both the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the large and small blood vessels. In conclusion, VEGF and its receptors (flt1/fms, flk1/ KDR and flt4) and VEGI were expressed by various cell groups at varying intensity in the oropharyngeal organs. This demonstrates that they play a critical role in the regulation and maintenance of the functions in cells different from endothelial ones as well as in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The running speed of Agama stellio stellio was 2.1 ± 0.3 m s −1 at preferred body temperature (T b , 30°C). To account for sprint locomotion, we meaured two mechanical parameters and examined the ultrastructural features of a major locomotory muscle in normal walking and running locomotion, the iliofibularis muscle, which is considered to act as an extensor of the lower hind limb. The time to peak isometric twitch tension and time to half relaxation were 52 ± 7 ms and 76 ± 5 ms, respectively. The comparative ultrastructure of the fast and slow fibes provides structure‐to‐function correlation. The sarcoplasmic reticulum and T‐tubules system are abundant in fast fibres which serve to transmit Ca 2+ and spread the excitatory impulse intracellularly with great rapidity. In contrast, the membranous system of slow fibres is relatively poor and this indicates slow impulse propagation. Thus, these results show that the fast locomotion of Agama stellio stellio can, in part, be explained by the physiology and ultrastructure of the fibres of the locomotory muscles.",

Expansions are straight or curved in shape. They have the same thickness as the microtubule walls, but they rarely constitute links between microtubules. The manchette disappears naturally at the end of spermiogenesis. The action of colchicine on spermatids leads to the complete disappearance of the microtubules and expansions, and inhibits the lengthening of the nucleus.",

The various metal residues found in storage bodies in ovarian tissues from lead-poisoned quails were analyzed by means of energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometrical analysis. Out of a total of eight electron-dense, metal-containing inclusions which were analyzed, two contained lead. Other elements found in the inclusions were chlorine, phosphorus, iron and calcium, the latter element not being present in detectable amounts in those inclusions which also contained lead. Some correlation was found between the morphology and the elemental composition of the metal residues.",

Results showed variation in snout‒vent length (SVL), body mass and clutch size among populations. An ANCOVA between SVL and clutch size showed an increase of the latter in females from Alvarado and Valle Nacional; ANCOVA between body mass and SVL revealed an increase in body mass in most populations. A canonical correlation analysis showed a positive relationship between SVL, body mass, and clutch size with elevation and precipitation, but not with temperature. Future studies should assess the effect of seasonality and food resource availability on reproductive investment among populations of S. variabilis to determine whether these characteristics are a function of differences in key ecological factors (e.g. availability of resources and seasonality) associated with each population, and determine the causes of geographic variation in morphological and life history characteristics among populations.",

Knowledge regarding the population structure of the pest species, whether morphological or genetic, is considered as an essential tool in making effective management decisions. Thus here, we performed the phenotypic characterization of H. armigera populations collected from varied geographic locations across India. Studied populations differed significantly for several external morphometric traits studied at larval, pupal and adult stages. Significant differences were also observed with respect to the intensity of black pigmentation on larval body as well as adult eye and forewing colour patterns. Besides external phenotypic traits, the length of genital organs like aedeagus and valva in males, and bursa copulatrix and bursa seminalis in females also differed significantly amongst populations. The dendrogram based on selected traits showed clear cut differentiation of studied populations into two major groups, one including all the South Zone populations and the other having populations from North and Central Zones. Differences based on phenotyping in the present study indicate the possibility of the existence of different subspecies within the Indian populations of H. armigera .",

Aegla concepcionensis is restricted to a small and intervened Chilean basin, and its conservation status has varied from extinct in nature to endangered. We characterized their life history measuring population, morphological and environmental variables during an annual cycle capturing individuals with a catch and release method based on electroshocking. Although the maximum water temperature was related to the recruitment, it can be physiologically risky for the remaining macroinvertebrate community. The relationship between abundance and narrow pH variations indicates a condition of unstable equilibrium given the environmental deterioration by deforestation. Sex ratio was predominantly male biased during copulatory activity, and sexually dimorphic body size distributions supported the hypothesis of greater natural selection in females and sexual selection in males. The period of ovigerous females was comparatively restricted, late and consistent with an efficient ecophysiological strategy of reproductive investment. Patterns of pubertal moult, onset of morphometric maturity, absence of morphological differentiation in both sexes suggested that A. concepcionensis tends to maximize reproductive performance favouring the recovery of their relict populations.",

Recently, several strains of transgenic cloned pigs that are presumed to ubiquitously express green fluorescent protein (GFP) have been created. Thus, the purpose of this study was to elucidate the features of porcine OE using the tissues of GFP transgenic cloned pigs. Based on observations of Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and measurements of thickness, porcine OE tissue portions were classified into three categories (thick, standard, and thin). Cryosections revealed that the prominent GFP signals were expressed in olfactory sensory neurons (OSN), Bowman's glands, and olfactory nerve. A few GFP‐expressing sustentacular cells were seen; however, the intensity of GFP fluorescence was slight. In the thick portion, numerous GFP‐expressing polygonal OSN that did not possess dendrites were found. In the standard portions, GFP‐expressing cells had longitudinal dendrites. A few GFP‐expressing cells were found in the thin portion. In the thick and standard portions, most of the prominent GFP‐expressing cells were positive for olfactory marker protein. Moreover, double immunofluorescence staining with boiled GFP and Sox2 antibody revealed that GFP expression patterns in OSN are synchronized with Sox2 immunoreactive patterns.",

(Ephemeroptera: Ephemeridae) during metamorphosis.] (Zoologisches Institut der Universität Basel, Schweiz.) — Acta zool. (Stockh.) 61(2): 93–103. The corpus cardiacum (cc) of Ephemera danica is an unpaired organ in the dorsal wall of the aorta. During the last four instars there has been no significant change in the volume of the cc of the males. In the females, however, the cc enlarges in the final nymphal instar due to a thickening of the organ. Owing to a shortening prior to the subimaginal moult the volume has diminished in the subimagines and imagines. In the electron microscope different types of axons and secretory granules could be observed. The type a axons contain electron opaque granules with a mean diameter of 125 nm. The granules in the axons of type b are smaller (mean diameter 85 nm) and are more or less electron opaque, and the type c axons are filled with less electron opaque secretory droplets with mean diameters of 170 nm. In the fourth type of axons (d) the granules are approximately the same size as those of the type a but are more irregular in shape. In addition to the different axons two cell types—interstitial and secretory cells—are described, and the probable mechanism of the release of neurosecretory material is discussed. During metamorphosis only minor changes were apparent at the ultrastructural level.",

The caudal neurosecretory system of the mudsucker, Gillichthys mirabilis, was investigated using continuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation, electron microscopy, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and bioassay. A strong light-scattering band near the 41 % sucrose concentration was shown to contain neurosecretory granules by electron microscopy and urotensin II activity by bioassay. Aliquots of this band were run in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the selected regions of the gel containing those bands unique to urophysial tissue were cut out and eluted after the gel had been sliced longitudinally. The eluate from the region of the unique band (rf 0.46) gave the highest urotensin II bioassay activity when compared to adjacent areas. The remaining half of the gel was stained to confirm the localization of the unique bands. Gels made from regions adjacent to the 41 % sucrose concentration showed less stainability of the bands, and eluate of regions from its unique bands contained correspondingly less bioactivity.",

Immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of type VI collagen in the lingual mucosa of rats during the morphogenesis of filiform papillae. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 80–87. We examined the distribution after immunostaining of immunofluorescence of type VI collagen, differential interference contrast (DIC) images, and images obtained using confocal laser‐scanning microscopy in transmission mode, after toluidine blue staining, during morphogenesis of the filiform papillae, keratinization of the lingual epithelium and myogenesis in the rat tongue on semi‐ultrathin sections of epoxy resin‐embedded samples. Immunoreactivity specific for type VI collagen was dispersed over a relatively wide range of connective tissue in the mesenchyme of fetuses on day 15 after conception (E15), at which time the lingual epithelium was composed of one or two layers of cuboidal cells and the lingual muscle was barely recognizable. Slight immunoreactivity specific for type VI collagen was scattered within the lamina propria in fetuses on E17 and on E19, and immunoreactivity was relatively distinct on the connective tissue around the lingual muscle during myogenesis. In fetuses on E19, the epithelium was already stratified squamous. At postnatal stages from P0 to P14, keratinization of the lingual epithelium advanced gradually as morphogenesis of the filiform papillae proceeded during postnatal development. In newborns on P0, myogenesis of the tongue was almost completed. The intensity of immunoreactivity specific for type VI collagen at postnatal stages was mainly restricted on the endomysium and perimysium around the lingual muscle, while scant immunoreactivity was evident in the connective tissue in the lamina propria. Immunoreactivity around the fully mature lingual muscle on P7 and P14 was weaker than that on E19 and P0. Thus, type VI collagen appeared in the connective tissue that surrounded the lingual muscles such as the endomysium and perimysium, in parallel with changes in extracellular components during myogenesis of the tongue.",

The absence of the system for this period had some very significant anatomical effects. The growth of the fish as well as the viscera was strongly retarded whereas the kidneys, the mesonephros, were enlarged. If the caudal peduncle was cut away from the 6—7 vertebrae numbered from the urostyle a new system regenerated and the fish showed normal growth and development. If the site of pedunclectomy was at vertebra 12 numbered from the tailfin or anterior to it no regeneration of the system took place. The urophysial hormones seem to play an important role as synergetic factors for normal growth and development of the fish. Observations indicate their possible interaction with the preoptico‐hypophysial system in osmoregulation.",

The basement membrane was shown to consist of three layers: lamina lucida, lamina densa, and lamina reticularis. The lamina densa appeared amorphous and homogeneous with tannic acid impregnation. The lamina reticularis appeared as a dense network of 10–12 nm fibrils. Anchoring fibrils cross this layer and form loops. Along their length they contact hemidesmosomes of muscles, thus connecting muscle to muscle and to tegument. The tegument/basement membrane contact is enhanced by extensions of the lamina densa into infoldings of the tegumental basal membrane. Where tegumental spines reach the basement membrane, the contact is reinforced by hemidesmosomes that connect to anchoring fibrils reaching toward the underlying muscles. The basement membrane thus seems to be a complex structure integrating the distal tegumental layer with underlying tissues and transducing muscle contractions to the tegument and its spines.",

The distal lobe has no direct arterial blood supply and receives blood solely from a pituitary portal system basically similar to that of other sarcopterygians. The primary capillary plexus of the median eminence receives its arterial blood from the infundibular arteries, which on their way distribute some small branches to the prechiasmatic region. The primary plexus also receives capillaries from the adjacent pial hypothalamic plexus. The primary capillary plexus of the median eminence comprises a rostral ‘uncovered’ and caudal ‘covered’ part which are not sharply delineated. Distinct portal vessels connect the ‘uncovered’ rostral part of the primary plexus with the secondary capillary plexus supplying the rostral subdivision of the pars distalis. The ‘covered’ caudal part of the primary plexus merges into the proximal subdivision of the pars distalis, apparently without formation of distinct portal vessels. The primary plexus has some connections with the plexus intermedius via a hypophysial stem capillary plexus. The plexus intermedius has a substantial arterial supply and gives off capillaries to the parenchyma of the pars intermedia. The adenohypophysis is drained into an unpaired hypophysial vein. The significance of the vascular pathways is discussed from comparative, functional, and evolutionary viewpoints.",

In the final nymphal stage four types of neurosecretory cells (nsc) were found in the medial protocerebral cell group, showing differences in shape, size, and the contents of the cytoplasm, especially of the secretory granules. In addition to the medial nsc, some cells in the frontal part of the brain and in the deutocerebrum are described. They contain electron-opaque granules and probably have a neurosecretory function. The secretory product of the medial nsc is transported along the axons of the nervus corporis cardiaci 1 (ncc1), an unpaired nerve tract on the ventral side of the brain. Leaving the brain the ncc1 immediately enters the corpus cardiacum. Connections between secretory granules and neurotubuli point to an important role for the neurotubuli in the transport of secretory material.",

Signet ring cells contained 5191 vanadium, 23945 bromine and 15281 sulphur. Compartment cells had 606 vanadium, 20700 bromine and 24309 sulphur. Other less abundant cell types such as lymphocytes, macrogranular amoebocytes, carotenoid pigment cells and granular amoebocytes were also analysed and found to contain (in ppm) 4384, 6652, 2366 and 10246 vanadium, 19652, 15630, 5964 and 11735 bromine and 13289, 15309, 3106 and 42968 sulphur, respectively. Sulphur occurred in high levels in all cell types, which could indicate its involvement in the vanadium concentration process, while bromine, incorporated into complexes, may be utilised for anti‐fouling rather than as a deterrent to predators.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study presents data on myosin Va localization in the central nervous system of rainbow trout. We demonstrate, via immunoblots and immunocytochemistry, the expression of myosin Va in several neuronal populations of forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord. The neuronal populations that express myosin Va in trout constitute a very diverse group that do not seem to have many specific similarities such as neurotransmitters used, cellular size or length of their processes. The intensity of the immunoreactivity and the number of immunoreactive cells differ from region to region. Although there is a broad distribution of myosin Va, it is not present in all neuronal populations. This result is in agreement with a previous report, which indicated that myosin Va is approximately as abundant as conventional myosin II and kinesin, and it is broadly involved in neuronal motility events such as axoplasmatic transport. Furthermore, this distribution pattern is in accordance with what was shown in rats and mice; it indicates phylogenetic maintenance of the myosin Va main functions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ultrastructural observations suggest that lipid material of lizard digital pads derives from degenerating cells in the inter‐scale region. Acta Zoologica (Stockholm). Production of epidermal lipids in lizards occurs in mesos‐ and alpha‐layers, including those present in gecko adhesive pads. Lipid material is present over the setae and spatulae of adhesive pads where adhesion takes place. Lipids are hypothesized to influence the process of adhesion keeping hydrophobic the spatula that contacts the substrate. The origin of lipids in pad lamellae that are lost as footsteps during gecko movements is unknown. To maintain setae lipid‐coated requires a large and continuous supply of lipids and the most likely source is an epidermal region rich in lipids. Ultrastructural observations show that lipid material is released from sloughed mesos and alpha‐cells in the inter‐scale region of the lamellae. It is hypothesized that lipids passively move from the hinge region and reach the outer lamella surface. Lipids may also derive from frictional damage of the thin alpha‐cells located in the hinge regions during pad extension for climbing or moving on the substrate. The discharged lipid material is likely pushed out from the hinge region by progressive accumulation of secreted material. The present hypothesis presents a simple model illustrating lipid movement from inter‐scale regions that coat the setae, contributing to the indicated influence of lipids on spatula adhesion.",

In support of previous studies, the present experimental and immunohistochemical analysis has detected some markers (CD3, CD5, MHCII) of mammalian T‐lymphocytes and macrophages of inflammatory type in three different conditions where inflammation is activated. Bioinformatics comparisons indicate that the employed antibodies cross‐react with lizard cells. While in regenerating tails few or no immune cells are seen, in microbial‐infected and non‐regenerating tails, a massive infiltration of mast cells, sparse macrophages and T‐lymphocytes is present. In healing limbs, immunolabelled cells likely represented by macrophages and lymphocytes remain in healing tissues of the stump for 2–3 weeks. In the regenerating blastema after heat cauterization of the apical region, a massive infiltration of mast cells and granulocytes occurs at 1–3 days post‐injury and a scarring outgrowth is later formed. Although the three markers appear not discriminate the types of immune‐cells in lizard, they confirms that immunolabelled cells expressing markers of inflammation are produced in large number in the tail or limbs with strong inflammatory condition. Coupled with previous studies, the present observations support the idea that a high inflammation attracting numerous mast‐cells, inflammatory macrophages and T‐lymphocyte inhibits regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Spinal ganglia and peripheral nerves innervate the regenerating tail and muscles of lizards, which provide new opportunities to probe the mechanisms leading to successful functional recovery following spinal cord injury. The regenerated spinal cord and peripheral nerves were detected using immunohistochemistry in original and regenerating tails of Scincella tsinlingensis. Our results showed that positive PCNA, GFAP and SOX2 cells were observed in the ependymal ducts at 15 and 30 days after the autotomy (dpa), with a small number of immunopositive NSE neurons. GFAP and SOX2 positive cells were primarily localized along the regenerated spinal cord after 45 dpa, and the descending nerve of medulla tissue showed positive NSE. Peripheral axons distributed around the muscle and inside the connective tissue and muscle tissue at 15 dpa. The number of axons decreased after 30 dpa. The peripheral axons was mainly distributed between the connective tissue, muscle group and the muscle and epidermis, presenting a radial distribution centred on the cartilage tube at 120 dpa. MBP myelination labelling of the regenerated tail at 30 dpa revealed that the regenerated axons rapidly myelinated along the rostro‐caudal axis. The density of NMJ significantly increased at 120 dpa and 250 dpa. In the second regenerated tails, NMJ density at 250 dpa was still greater than original tails. Overall, these results indicated that neurogenesis was an early event and the ependymal cells were heterogeneous in the regenerated spinal cord of S. tsinlingensis . The regenerated peripheral axons presented a radial distribution centred on the cartilage canal, and the regenerated axons were rapidly myelinated along the rostro‐caudal axis. During the process of regeneration, there were a large number of regenerated neuromuscular joints with high density.",

We employed immunohistochemical techniques using a specific anti‐human CXCL14 antibody. CXCL14‐immunoreactive cells were detected in the caudal lobe of the pars distalis. CXCL14‐immunoreactive puncta were densely distributed in the external layer and sparsely distributed in the internal layer of the median eminence. CXCL14 staining was absent after pre‐absorption of the antibody with recombinant human CXCL14. All CXCL14‐immunoreactive cells corresponded to growth hormone (GH)‐producing cells in the caudal lobe. In addition, the majority of CXCL14‐immunoreactive puncta in the median eminence corresponded to somatostatin‐containing fibres. CXCL14 secreted from GH‐producing cells and somatostatin‐containing fibres may act as an inhibitor of GH release via an autocrine mechanism and neuroendocrine signalling, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tail regeneration in lizards derives from the formation of a regenerative blastema. Numerous snoRNAs exclusively up‐regulated in the regenerating tail but absent in the scarring limb of the lizard Podarcis muralis have been detected suggesting they are key genes for regeneration. While most snord‐, snora‐ and scarna‐RNAs are activators of protein synthesis and cell proliferation (oncogenes) some may also be tumour suppressors. A tail blastema of 2–3 mm in length consists of proliferating mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts and keratinocytes with active nucleoli, rosette‐patterned ribosomes and few rough endoplasmic cisternae. In few days, the blastema grows into a new tail indicating intense protein synthesis within this short period. A quantitative RT‐PCR analysis of snord87 , snord26 , snord74 , snora63 , scarna11 , U2 and U4 shows that, aside snord87 , the other ncRNAs are up‐regulated, particularly, U2 , U4 and scarna11 . These ncRNAs might regulate the rate of production of ribosomes from the nucleolus (snora‐ and snord‐RNAs), the splicing process (snord‐ and scarna‐RNAs, U2 and U4), the speed of protein synthesis (snora‐ and snord‐RNAs) and cell proliferation in the blastema. These non‐coding‐RNAs are hypothesized to intensify the production of more functional ribosomes that accelerate the rate of protein synthesis and rapid growth of the blastema into a new tail.",

Moreover, the frequency of tail loss can vary at different levels, between sexes, populations, seasons and at an intra‐ and inter‐population level. In this study, we analysed the breaking position of the tails in individuals and frequencies of tail loss between years, sexes, seasons and populations of the lizard Sceloporus variabilis that inhabit contrasting environments. The results showed a low frequency of tail loss at the ends (distal and proximal) of this organ (except for individuals from the xeric scrubland population) and there was a higher proportion of complete than incomplete tails in lizards for all analysed populations. Also, there was no variation in the frequency of tail loss among populations, sexes (except in one population), years or seasons. A higher proportion of organisms with complete tails suggests that this organ is an important element for these lizards. In addition, the lack of variation in the frequency of tail loss may indicate a similar behaviour such as escape from predators among the groups analysed.",

Here we studied the male and female reproductive patterns, clutch size, and clutch frequency of the oviparous lizard Sceloporus aeneus from a population in the southeast of Hidalgo State, Mexico, from April 2010 to March 2011. The gonadal analysis showed that the minimum snout‐vent length at sexual maturity in males and females was 46 mm. Both sexes exhibit seasonal reproductive patterns; males present maximum gonadal activity in winter‐spring (February–May), and females are vitellogenic in spring‐summer (May–July). Clutch size averaged 7 eggs (range 5–9) and did not show a relationship with female body size. Females produce at least two clutches per breeding season. The reproductive patterns described in this study were similar to those observed in other populations of S. aeneus, although some events in the reproductive phenology of both sexes appear to be related to local environmental factors.",

The present report describes an association between a giant cell that patrols the epidermis and the formation of IEBs. The giant cell, likely macrophage‐related, is a broadly spread cell with lengths up to ~90 μm and average spread areas &gt;600 μm 2 . Time‐lapse video microscopy was used to monitor formation of IEBs and determine any association between the IEB and the giant cells. Giant cells were observed to form IEBs, and as an IEB dissipated a giant cell was observed to exit the area previously occupied by the IEB. These observations suggest the IEB is a transitional form of the giant cell, serving as a temporary compartment to isolate and initiate breakdown of the debris scavenged by the giant cell.",

The right lung has a similar configuration except for the basal border, which is located above the fifth to the sixth CCJ. The cardiac incisure is more prominent in the right lung and is formed by the notched space between the ventral margins of the cranial and middle lobes. The lungs are well‐lobated, with complete fissures laterally but none medially. The trachea and primary bronchi are large and have a wide, thin membranous part. The muscular front limbs could limit cranial thoracic expansion, with the result that the bulk of the functional lung capacity is present caudal to the tricipital line. Recommended sites for intracardiac injections are on either side of the fifth CCJ, and for thoracocentesis, just dorsal to the seventh or eighth CCJ. Care is needed while intubating a lion's trachea because of the delicate membranous part.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Walking is a locomotion mode in which animals move over the ground using their appendages. Walking is observed in both terrestrial and aquatic animals, but the morphology and diversity of appendages in the latter group have been less extensively studied. The present paper reports on the “adhesive areas,” which may represent morphological and physiological adaptations for stable aquatic walking, in the paintpot cuttlefish, Ascarosepion tullbergi . This animal employs arm IV as a forelimb and an ambulatory flap as a hindlimb for walking, resulting in a gait‐like manner of movement. The structure of the adhesive area is exclusively located on the ventral skin surface of arm IV and the ambulatory flap, which are in contact with the ground during walking. The “adhesive areas” are characterized by a dense population of adhesive mucus‐secreting cells and the development of numerous wrinkles on the surface. These features may enhance the gripping and sticking capacity of the ground‐contact area, thus improving walking stability. The use of adhesive areas for walking is a unique feature of A. tullbergi , as other cuttlefish with adhesive areas primarily use them for attaching to substrata in strong currents. Our results contribute to the understanding of the locomotion strategy of cuttlefish.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The distal swellings of growing flagella in spermatocytes of Ephestia kuehniella Z. contain dense material associated with the ends of axonemal microtubules. In order to define the nature of this material, spermatocytes were lysed under microtubule‐stabilizing conditions, spun onto cover‐slips, probed with an antibody against β‐tubulin and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. Whereas the dense material was lost from the cells when untreated spermatocytes were used, a block of stained material was visible in cold‐treated spermatocytes. Most probably, cold‐treatment alters the dense material and guarantees its survival during preparation of the cells for anti‐tubulin immunofluorescence. The positive reaction with the antibody indicates the presence of β‐tubulin. Flagellar outgrowth in spermatogenesis of the moth starts in late prophase I and continues throughout both meiotic divisions. Therefore, spindles and flagella compete for tubulin monomers. A tubulin reserve, deposited early in development at the elongating tip of axonemes, may ensure their uninterrupted growth, independent of tubulin‐consuming cytoplasmic events. In order to test this hypothesis, flagellar outgrowth was studied in the spermatocytes of a long‐horned beetle, Agapanthia villosoviridescens de Geer (Cerambycidae, Coleoptera) using electron microscopy. In this species, flagella begin to elongate only in telophase II, when the second meiotic spindle is just disassembling. The absence of dense material at the tip of flagellar stubs in the beetle corroborates the hypothesis formulated above.",

Readaptation to FW stimulated the Ca-s cells after 2–10 days; after 1 or 2 months, the cells tend to be similar to those of eels kept in FW. Plasma calcium decreases slightly but significantly in SW eels. The response of the Ca-s cells is not modified by an ovine prolactin treatment inducing hypercalcemia, hypernatremia and stimulation of the corpuscles of Stannius. Minor changes occurring in the MSH cells remain difficult to interpret; the short stimulation during readaptation to FW may be related to a stress effect and/or to release of other peptides present in the MSH cells of fish.",

Further, they reveal a clearly two-phased regeneration process. The first phase leads to a repaired wound, the second results in a rebuilding of the missing part. Ecto- and endoderm are differently involved in regeneration. A greater importance of the endoderm for the first stages of regeneration has been found. Finally, the experiments prove an existing polarity in the polyp. On the basis of these findings it can be concluded that the polyp meets the major criteria of regeneration.

In 60 squat lobsters (30 ♂ 30 ♀), this pair of medial dorsal/ventral (MDV) cell bodies was found in 4 distinct cell pair configurations: ventral/ventral, 24; dorsal/dorsal, 5; right ventral/left dorsal, 14; right dorsal/left ventral, 17. MDV cell bodies were never found lying midway between the dorsal and ventral surfaces. The distribution of configurations was approximately the same for both sides of the ganglion and for both sexes, and whether a cell occurred ventrally or dorsally was found to be independent of the position of its partner. The determination of cell body location appears not to be influenced by any cell‐cell interaction, despite an apparent ‘point of close association’ between the two soma neurites and a strong bias overall towards the ventral location (dorsal 1/3, ventral 2/3).",

The enzyme reaction intensity is also related to different metabolic activities of the body tissues and compared with other histochemical and histological features of the cells. ALP and AMP distribution pattern is investigated in the Malpighian tubules, the gut, ovary, testicle and the storage and epidermal cells during female and male gonad development. The results strongly support the hypothesis that the Malpighian tubules are osmoregulatory‐excretory organs and may also perform secretory functions. They show morpho‐functional variations which are related to sexual maturity and differ in the female and the male: possible physiological roles are discussed. In the female all the tissues here examined undergo changes in size, enzyme activities and other features that show a relationship with phases of both oogenesis and molt: a physiological explanation is suggested that takes into account previously obtained evidence of neuroendocrine regulation. In the male the stages of testicle maturity and molt seem to be independent of each other and the changes of the body tissues found in the female are less or not evident.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To clarify whether the unique postural control of the upside‐down swimming catfish ( Synodontis nigriventris , family Mochokidae) is related to the histological characteristics of the otolith organs, we performed light microscopic observation of the utricle, the saccule and the lagena. The histological aspects of the otolith organs were compared between S. nigriventris and Synodontis multipunctatus , which belong to the same genus. S. multipunctatus usually shows upside‐up swimming posture except for feeding behaviour near water surface. As controls, we additionally used a miniature catfish, Corydoras paleatus and goldfish, Carassius auratus , which shows upside‐up swimming posture. We concluded that the structural aspects of the otolith organs did not cause the unique postural control of S. nigriventris. Light microscopic observation clarified the following aspects: (1) The utricle of S. nigriventris was located at the anterior region of the otocyst and under the semicircular canals, and the saccule and the lagena were located at the posteroventral region of the otocyst like those of S. multipunctatus and the other two fishes. (2) The hair cells of the utricle were arranged on the horizontal plane of the fishes with a variation in cell size at the ventral and ventrolateral sites in S. nigriventris , S. multipunctatus and the other two fishes. (3) The hair cells of the saccule and lagena of S. nigriventris , S. multipunctatus and C. auratus presented perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the fish. (4) Region‐specific differences in the size and shape of the hair cells of S. nigriventris were observed along the three‐dimensional axes of the otolith organs like those of S. multipunctatus and the other two fishes. It is unlikely that the unique postural control of upside‐down catfish is related to the localization of the utricle, the saccule and the lagena and the distribution of the different types of hair cell of the otolith organs. Furthermore, the distribution of the hair cells suggests that the otolith organs in S. nigriventris can detect three‐dimensional postural changes like the organs of other fishes showing generally observed upside‐up swimming posture.",

In the grey short‐tailed opossum, the muscle in both sexes has a distinct proximal origin from the anterior superior iliac spine. The number of muscle fibres is higher in male than in female opossums on average, but the difference is not statistically significant. Retrograde tracing, achieved by injecting B‐cholera toxin into the muscle, showed that labelled neurons occupied several spinal cord segments, the bulk being in L2–L4. There was no overall sex difference in the number of labelled neurons. It is concluded that cremaster muscles are present in both sexes of the grey short‐tailed opossum Monodelphis domestica , contain approximately equal numbers of fibres, and differ only in their insertion target. Since the motor innervation also shows no dimorphisms in this species, it is concluded that the whole neuromuscular complex is homologous in the two sexes. This is in marked contrast to the situation in adult eutherian mammals where the muscle is possesed by males only, and where the cremasteric nucleus is highly dimorphic in terms of motor neuron numbers.",

The species is characterized, among other features, by an asymmetrical penis papilla, an extremely large, elongated copulatory bursa, and by the absence of testes in animals with fully developed male and female copulatory apparatus. Instigated by the sexual cycle of this new species, the study opportunely reviews whether planarian flatworms generally are simultaneous or sequential—in particular protandrous—hermaphrodites. It is concluded that real protandry does not occur in triclads and that even less extreme cases of sexual segregation, such as complete reduction of the testes or the more or less complete separation of male and female functionality as present in some species, have only sparsely and convergently evolved within the group of the triclad flatworms.",

However, several important differences were detected between the two species in the head region (shape of the anterior acrosome, size of acrosome and nucleus) and especially in the midpiece (size of the midpiece, the presence of regular rows of dense bodies, size and number of mitochondria and beginning of the fibrous sheath). Both species shared more characters with the Sphenomorphus + Egernia group than with the Eugongylus group proposed by Jamieson, Oliver, and Scheltinga ( Acta Zoologica, 77, 85). Differences in the spermatozoan ultrastructure between T. punctatissima and A. meleagris could be due to distinct ecological and physiological requirements for fertilization, but additional research on these genera and within the Scincidae is required to disentangle this hypothesis, and to disentangle the phylogenetic relationships among skinks.",

Different stages in the life cycle of ARs were established using time‐lapse video microscopy of Koi scale epidermis in situ. The organization of the F‐actin cytoskeleton corresponding to the stages of ring formation in live tissue was determined from phalloidin staining of scale epidermis. ARs form from localized swollen regions of microridges that subsequently elongate laterally, progressing into complete circles with well‐defined inner and outer borders that encircle unperturbed microridges. The ARs close in a centripetal movement to form a circular structure, the terminal disc, and subsequently an underlying vesicle, the terminal body. During this latter stage, a rapid rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton occurs resulting in the emergence of a newly identified corkscrew‐like structure, termed the Helical Core. Furthermore, fluid‐phase markers are incorporated into the terminal bodies, identifying these vesicles as macropinosomes. The findings are discussed with respect to F‐actin organization and macropinocytosis at the epidermal surface of fish.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Species of the gammaridean amphipod genus, Urothoe , commonly occur on intertidal and shallow subtidal sandy bottoms. Sexual dimorphism is reported for some species of Urothoe , but the descriptions are semi‐quantitative, lacking allometric growth models. A distinct sexual dimorphism was detected in Urothoe carda Imbach, 1967 collected from an intertidal sandflat in western Kyushu, Japan, in March, June, August, and October, 2015. The analysis for the total length–frequency distribution and maturity in each sex showed a female‐biased sex ratio (3.6 for mature individuals). Mature males had the larger eye and longer antenna 2 versus total length, expressed as generalized linear models (gamma distribution; logarithmic link‐function). Based on other studies on Urothoe spp. and peracarids, the above differences may suggest higher mate searching activity in male U. carda , with its larger eye functioning during the nocturnal excursion into the water column and its longer antenna 2 equipped with calceoli effective in detecting receptive females in the sediment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Byssus production of Ruditapes philippinarum clams becomes reduced with growth. This tendency is well recognized but has not been analysed in detail. Additionally, it remains uninvestigated whether the lack of competence to produce byssus threads in the adult stage is caused by atrophy of the byssal glands or not. The objective of this study was to evaluate the byssus production ability of clams through the juvenile to adult stages and to examine the importance of two endogenous factors (i.e. shell size, somatic condition) in determining the byssus production probability (proportion of clams with byssus production in a population). This study also histologically confirmed the presence of byssal glands in juvenile to adult clams. For these purposes, field surveys to investigate the relationship among byssus production, shell size and somatic condition of clams collected from four intertidal sites and a histological study for byssal glands of the clams was conducted. This study revealed that byssus production probability decreases with increasing shell size and declining somatic condition and that the lack of byssus production is not caused by the loss of the byssal glands.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Spermatozoa of the Megaloptera Corydalus diasi (Corydalidae) showed a two‐layered acrosome, similar to Raphidioptera, but different from the acrosomal arrangement in Ascalaphidae, Coniopterygidae and Myrmeleontidae (Neuroptera families) and Sialidae (Megaloptera). Also, the acrosomal shape differs from both Raphidioptera and Neuroptera examined so far. The nucleus is cylindrical with condensed chromatin, resembling the sperm of Sialidae, Raphidioptera and Neuroptera. The transition region of C. diasi does not have the nucleus surrounded by centriolar microtubules, and thus, it differs from Sialidae, whose character has been previously considered a synapomorphy between Megaloptera and Raphidioptera. The flagella analysed here possess a 9 + 9 + 2 axoneme arrangement, two elongated circular mitochondrial derivatives and triangular accessory bodies, which are also reported in Raphidioptera. In summary, there are numerous sperm differences between Corydalidae and Sialidae, besides several characters shared between Corydalidae and Raphidioptera. However, several of these similarities appear to be plesiomorphisms rather than synapomorphies. Additionally, this is the first spermatic description for Corydalidae and the second for Megaloptera order. Therefore, considering the number of genres that comprise this family and the lack of spermiocladistics studies for Corydalidae, we recommended that new studies on the field should be performed to better understand the sperm pattern within the Corydalidae genus.",

Despite its ecological importance, A. aestiva is listed as an imminent danger of becoming extinct, as it is one of the most illegally traded native species in Brazil, besides losing its habitat due to deforestation and forest fires. The cranial oesophagus mucosa is lined with a non‐keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, and the basal layer presents melanocyte accumulation. No mucous glands were observed in the lamina propria/submucosa. The ingluvium two different muscular layer patterns were observed, one internal and circular and one very thick, external and longitudinal. The proventriculum submucosa consists of polygonal proventricular glands and contents into a broad central duct lined with simple columnar epithelium Periodic acid‐reactive Schiff positive (PAS+) and Alcian blue positive (AB+). The 5‐HT cells are dispersed in the proventricular glands located at base and apex. The ventricle mucous layer contains numerous branched folds lined by a simple columnar epithelium. The epithelium was negative reaction for PAS and positive for AB only on the fold surfaces. The 5‐HT cells were scarce and observed only at the base of the ventricular gland, as well as in the adjacent connective tissue.",

The aim of this work was to contribute to a better understanding of the digestion of L. maximus based on the description of the macroscopic structure of the stomach, and the histologic characterization and glycosylation pattern of the cardiac and pyloric regions. The stomach of L. maximus is monocavitary with an entirely glandular mucosa. This organ presented an acute angular incisura, so the cardiac and the pyloric regions got close together forming a “U” shaped stomach. The techniques applied put into evidence marked variations—according to the anatomical region analysed—in the histochemical profile of the mucous cells of the secreting epithelium, the gastric pits and glands. Moreover, the glycosylation pattern of mucous cells varied along the longitudinal axis of the cardiac and pyloric glands: differences between cells near the gastric pits (superficial zone of the glands) and those near the muscularis mucosae (deep zone of the glands) were observed. The information produced in the present work could be used as a relevant biological tool, contributing to the morphological bases for future anatomical and histophysiological analyses of the species.",

In all treatments, survival was &gt;90%. Female body coloration and total carotenoid content, for both males and females, did not statistically differ among treatments. Female weight was similar for the three temperatures, while male weight was higher at 20ºC and 24ºC. Total lipid content was higher in female and male shrimps raised at 20ºC. Total protein content was higher in females exposed at 28ºC, but in contrast, males showed the lowest value at the same temperature. The histological and histochemical analyses of the male reproductive system did not reveal differences among treatments. At 20ºC, a delay in ovaries maturation was observed, as well as a smaller amount of ovigerous females at the end of the experimental period. Hence, these results suggest that a temperature range from 20ºC to 28ºC is adequate for satisfactory growth, with no change being exerted on spermatophore quality, body female coloration or carotenoid content, but biochemical composition was affected. Nevertheless, the lowest temperature had a clear impact on the metabolism and reproduction of N. davidi .",

Here, we examined 19 extant species as well as a few fossil species of crocodylians to identify individual (intraspecific) variation in the intervertebral joint polarities. We found joint alteration in eight individuals from seven extant species and three individuals from two extinct species. Most variant specimens show sacrocaudal joint alteration, while single Osteolaemus tetraspis peculiarly displays multiple joint polarity reversions (cotyle to condyle and vice versa) in anterior caudal vertebrae. Because the sacrocaudal joint polarity is frequently reversed and the first caudal vertebra becomes procoelous, caution should be taken when identifying an isolated first caudal vertebra of basal and outgroups of eusuchians. Almost exclusive occurrences of joint alteration at the less mobile sacrocaudal joint in crocodylians are consistent with the hypothesis that the joint alteration takes place at joints with a lesser range of motion.",

Three ageing groups ( n = 5) of male Columba were collected at about three weeks, six months and five years old. Histological studies were made. Morphometric measurement of both retinal and cerebellar cortex layer thicknesses has been determined. For evaluation of the neuronal synapses, quantitative GFAP biochemically and immunohistochemically staining was performed. Also, biochemical analysis of glucose transporter 1, serotonin and dopamine was carried out to demonstrate their functional activity. Flow cytometric assessments of quantitative cell death were accomplished by using annexin V. The present findings revealed quantitative and qualitative increase of GFAP parallel with decrease of serotonin, dopamine and glucose transporter 1 as well as increase of UR and LR annexin V reflecting cell death in old groups. These were confirmed by damaging of the retina and cerebellar layers. The present findings concluded that retinal and cerebellar cells associated with ageing were determined by sharp rise in both cell death and GFAP levels. Additionally, a decrease of dopamine, serotonin and GluT1 level manifested maybe led to functional alteration of both retina and brain.",

TYPE I MCs are characterized by a well‐developed Golgi complex (GC), numerous large granules from a finely grained to flaky central content varying from low to increased electron density and rare electron‐dense osmiophilic granules. TYPE II MCs have a well‐developed granular endoplasmic reticulum (GER), GC and secretory homogeneous granules of high electron density with clear membranes. Some MCs demonstrate a sharp expansion of GER with complete membrane reduction and the formation of a homogeneous secret of “varnished” appearance and were presumably assigned to TYPE III MCs of a seromucous nature. Three types of mucocytes are suggested as different directions of cytodifferentiation of the stem cells. The data on MC polymorphism is discussed in the light of the pluripotent nature and high evolutionary plasticity of the skin's secretory epithelium. The development of MCs with seromucous secretion is proposed as a sort of MGs “proteinization,” in some way connected with the adaptation of tetraploid toads to the severe environment of Central Asia.",

This intracranial compartment is probably called in being as a result of the pushing forward from the orbita of the points of origin of the ipsilateral oblique eye muscles. Its alleged presence in lizards as a part of the orbita and in mammals as a part of the cavitas encephalica cranii is shown to rest on false premizes. In reality, these two component parts are not homologous, and of all the craniate animals, extant and extinct, some actinopterygian fish alone have cavitates orbitonasales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Developmental programmes for many marine invertebrates include the assembly of muscular systems appropriate to the functions of swimming and feeding in pelagic larvae. Upon metamorphosis, that musculature is often radically re‐organized to meet very different demands of post‐larval life. To investigate the development and fate of musculature in the nudibranch Phestilla sibogae , embryos, larvae and metamorphosing stages were fixed, labelled with phalloidin and examined with confocal microscopy. The resultant images revealed the sequential development of both large retractor muscles and numerous finer muscles that allow the larva to manipulate the velum, foot and operculum. Observations of living specimens at the same stages as those fixed for microscopy revealed the actions of the muscles as they developed. During metamorphosis, muscles with shell attachments disintegrate as the larva transforms into a shell‐less juvenile. Notably, the massive velar, pedal and opercular retractor muscles disappear during metamorphosis in a sequence that corresponds to their loss of function. Other muscles, however, that appear to be important to the embryo and free‐swimming larva persist into juvenile life. The comprehensive and detailed observations of the musculature presented here provide a solid foundation for comparisons with other species with different phylogenies and life histories.",

The eyes and retinae were examined by light microscopy and computerized tomography. DAPI labelling was used to visualize cell nuclei in the ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers. Two zones of increased GC density in the nasal and temporal retina were bridged by a horizontal streak with the GC density ranging from 5600 to 8000 cells/mm 2 . The maximum cell density ( area retinae temporalis) ranged from 9492 to 14,112 cells/mm 2 , and the total number of GCs varied from 286 x 10 3 to 326 x 10 3 cells in three individuals. The theoretical anatomical spatial resolution (the anatomical estimate of the upper limit of visual acuity) was minimum in the ventral periphery (smaller fish, 1.43 cpd; larger fish, 1.37 cpd) and maximum in area retinae temporalis (smaller fish, 2.83 cpd; larger fish, 2.41 cpd). The relatively high density of GCs and presence of the horizontal streak and area retinae temporalis in the H. japonicus are consistent with its highly visual behaviour. The present findings contribute to better understanding of the factors affecting the topography of retinal ganglion cells and mechanisms of visual adaptation in fish.",

We have proposed that the dogfish ( Scyliorhinus canicula ) is a suitable model for the study of basic processes of cardiac morphogenesis in vertebrates, since the heart of this primitive fish probably outlines the original bauplan of the vertebrate heart. In order to study in this model the endocardial and epicardial epithelial‐mesenchymal transition under scanning electron microscopy, we have used a technique of paraffin‐embedding, partial sectioning, dewaxing and critical‐point drying. Our results showed: 1) A centrifugal pattern of epicardial development from the atrioventricular groove to the sinus venosus and conus arteriosus; 2) A close spatial and temporal relationship between the endocardial and epicardial epithelial‐mesenchymal transition, although the transformation of the endocardium starts earlier and ends later the epicardial transformation; 3) A complex arrangement of the fibrous extracellular matrix which is established prior to the migration of the mesenchymal cells. Subepicardial, but not subendothelial mesenchymal cells, coalesce in unicellular or pluricellular ring‐like structures that probably are related to the origin of the cardiac vessels.",

In one‐day amputees, epidermal cells from the wound edge migrated, evidently by means of contractile lobopodia, forming a loosely associated monolayer on the cut surface. In the three‐day amputee, cells covering the regenerate had resumed their tight‐packed hexagonal array; however, in the six‐ and ten‐day samples, the cells covering the regenerating tail were loosely associated again and smaller than before. Surprisingly, in the same six‐ and ten‐day samples, the epidermal cells covering all body regions anterior to the regenerate had changed conspicuously—their apical cell membranes had shrunk, thereby opening up an intercellular gap, although the cells maintained their hexagonal shape and appeared to have the same neighbours as before. This gapped stage (of unknown significance) lasted about a week, after which the gaps closed up, and all the epidermal cells, including those on the regenerating tail, resumed their close association with their neighbours in a hexagonal grid.",

Specialization on bovids ( Bison/Bos ) can be added for this site. The megafauna contain few Eemian warm period remains of a large horse Equus ferus fossilis . Most (95%) of the megafauna is attributed to the Late Pleistocene glacial (Weichselian/Wuermian). Horse bones are dominated by distal leg elements from the smaller Przewalski horses Equus ferus przewalskii (26% of NISP).

This study evaluated the ploidy of eggs from queens found together with worker‐laid eggs in the brood cells of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona xanthotricha . In the brood cells with two eggs, there was a difference in size between them, with the smaller one being a similar size to those found in brood cells with only one egg. The frequency of diploid eggs in brood cells with one egg was 96.6%, whereas, in those with two or more, it was 39.3%. These results suggest that egg fertilization can be identified by workers, because when there is a worker‐laid egg, those from the queen are often haploid, supporting a prediction from Hamilton's theory of kin selection.",

The evaluation was done with 955 specimens (494 males, 251 females, and 210 intersexes) captured in Persian Gulf (Iran) during January to December 2015. Animals were submitted to measurements related to weight (BW, total wet weight) and body size related to cephalic shield (SW, width; and SL, length) and propodus of both chelipeds (CPL, length; and CPW, width). Males were larger and heavier than females and intersexes. Both males and females showed a negative allometric growth for the SL–BW and SL–SW relationships, but a positive allometric growth to intersex specimens. To SL–CPL relationship, a negative allometric growth was confirmed in males and females independent of the laterality of the CPL, whereas a contrast was verified in intersexes, with a positive allometric growth occurred for both hands. To SL–CPW relationship, a negative allometric growth ( b &lt; 1) occurred in females, independent of the laterality of the CPW, while in males, a positive allometric pattern was confirmed. In intersexes, this relationship was positive except for the right CPW which was isometric. Sexual dimorphism was evident in Clibanarius signatus , with males being the largest and females the smallest specimens in the population.",

Acta Zoologica (Stockolm). Tail regeneration in lizards occurs after an immune‐privileged blastema and is formed where various immunosuppressive cells and biomolecules keep inflammation low. Molecules that limit inflammation may include glutathione and glutathione S‐transferase (GST). These molecules reduce reactive oxidative species (ROS) and detoxify extraneous molecules. In the present study, the presence of GST has been analysed in the early phases of tail regeneration in the lizard Podarcis muralis . Using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against epitopes present in GST of P . muralis , a light and electron microscopy immunohistochemical and Western blotting study has been done. The study detected proteins of 25 and 32 kDa in pale‐medium electron‐dense and large granules present in promyelocytes and myelocytes of likely basophilic or eosinophilic fate that is present in the bone marrow of tail vertebrae. These cells are still proliferating and give rise to basophilic or eosinophilic granulocytes that also migrate into the regenerating tail. The enzyme stored in granules of promyelocytes and myelocytes is also localized in the cytoplasm of granulocytes present in the regenerating blastema‐cone, basophilic or/and eosinophilic. It is suggested that these granulocytes in the blastema reduce ROS and detoxify potentially inflammatory metabolites, contributing with other molecules to limit inflammation and favour regeneration.",

L-T4 was added to McCoy's 5A medium to concentrations of 14 ng/ml or 14 ng/100 ml. To control for possible physicochemical effects, D-T4 was added to other media in the same concentrations, and saline vehicle was added to control media. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to a duplicate set of cultures (0.2% w/vol) as a nutritive supplement. After 48 h alkaline phosphatase (E.C. 3.1.3.1) specific activity was significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in segments cultured with 14 ng L-T4/100 ml (non-BSA) compared to saline control cultures. With 14 ng L-T4/ml (BSA) phosphatase activity had increased significantly compared to segments treated with 14 ng L-T4/100 ml (BSA), while those cultured with D-T4 (BSA) had significantly lower activities than all other BSA-treated groups including controls. Total protein content was significantly elevated in all D-T4 treated segments, both non-BSA and BSA-treated, compared to protein values of all other treatment groups. Following 48 h of culture the fine structure of epithelial mucosal cells usually showed condensed cytoplasm, while goblet cells were well developed, structural features appearing in all segments regardless of treatment. The responses after treatment further support a direct role for T4 in duodenal development.",

According to the canonical axis, C.A., the mean allometry in this species is 0.473±0.03; an allometry value of 0.5 is considered to be characteristic of Caudata. No significant difference was observed between the four reduced major axes (R.M.A.) of lowland animal samples (mean value of the pooled samples, C.A. = 0.469±0.210). In contrast, between the mountain samples a significant difference exists, the R.M.A. in the sample from l'Alpe d'Huez (Isère, France) being 0.331±0.57 as compared to 0.72±0.18 in the sample from Durmitor (Montenegro, Yugoslavia). In spite of this difference, their encephalisation index (Ie) did not differ significantly, having on average a value of 118.18±8.5, against Īe = 93.8±8.0 for lowland samples. A significant difference in encephalisation index between mountain and lowland alpine newts thus exists. This is probably the first observation in vertebrates of an encephalisation index increase with altitude. A biological hypothesis is proposed to explain this peculiar observation.",

The observations indicate clear differences between neurons of developing and mature zooids, and show that lytic activity occurs in the neurons of this turbellarian species. The differences in ultrastructure, size and nucleoplasms (NP) index motivate a division of the aminergic neurons of the zooids into three categories: (1) small aminergic neurons (SN) which occur in developing zooids; (2) flocculent aminergic neurons (FN) characterized by a network of flocculent splittings in the cytoplasm; (3) vacuolated aminergic neurons (VN) with large membrane limited vacuoles occupying a large part of the perikaryon. Slight acid phosphatase (AcPase) activity occurs in GERL of SN. An increased amount of AcPase reaction products in the Golgi apparatus, primary lysosomes and autophagosomes are observed in FN. Typical for VN are prominent lead deposits in the large vacuoles. The development and functional significance of the large vacuole are discussed.",

Some neurosecretory cell extensions are interposed between the cerebral neuropil and nerve cell perikarya; others overlie the photoreceptor cell processes of the eyes. The advanced encapsulated larva possesses a frontal complex, consisting of modified epidermis, secretory cells, gland ducts and nerve cell processes. The advanced larva is transparent and diminished in size, advantages possibly due in part to the extraordinary process of comprehensive nuclear condensation during ontogeny. The larva has a uniform epidermal ciliation and, while sharing certain features with trochophore larvae, is not of the trochophore type.",

These cells were similar in shape, location and frequency to the previously described B‐, A‐, D‐ and PP‐cells. The secretory granules of the B‐cells were round or oval in profile, with an internal core of variable shape. The mean diameter of the B‐cell granules was 780 nm (range 350–1000 nm). The A‐cell granules were round, oval or irregular in shape and highly electron dense, with a narrow electron lucent space between the core and the limiting membrane. The mean diameter of these granules was 450 nm (range 200–750 nm). The D‐cell granules were round, oval or irregular and of moderate electron density, with an average diameter of 340 nm (range 200–500 nm). The limiting membrane was closely apposed to the core or separated from it by a narrow lucent space. PP‐cell granules were round with high electron density and with a narrow space between the core and the limiting membrane, and their average diameter was 150 nm (range 50–350 nm); these secretory granules accumulated at the cytoplasmic process. Tracing of the cytoplasmic processes of PP‐cells in serially cut ultrathin sections revealed that most of these processes ended in the vicinity of blood capillaries, indicating that the PP‐cells were endocrine rather than paracrine.",

Socialisation with members of the opposite sex restores gland size, but replacement of females twice a week is less effective than constancy of partner. The glands respond to the level of blood testosterone, but glandular development appears to be heavily influenced by other factors.",

Four morphological types of coelomic cells are described: amoebocytes, mucocyte‐like cells, pigment cells and crystal‐containing cells. The amoebocytes are characterized by the presence of spherical to oval electron‐dense granules, phagocytic vacuoles and numerous microtubules located in the Golgi areas. The mucocyte‐like cells show the features of the mucocytes reported in enchytraeid worms (globular inclusions with filamentous and homogeneous, moderately electron‐dense material, as well as a filopodous process). The pigment cells contain typical spindle‐shaped osmiophilic granules, microtubules (not reported before) and glycogen particles. The crystal‐containing cells show inclusions which are polygonal in section with a striated substructure (periodicity of about 4.5 nm). Apart from the mucocyte‐like cells, the coelomocytes showed cytoplasmic processes attached to the basement membrane of the spaces. The possible functions of these cells are discussed and a common peritoneal origin is postulated on the base of their morphological and cytological features.",

The results are consistent with the suggestion that some sort of oviposition inhibitor(s) is released by the snails in the culture water.

The vascularity of the rostral and middle nasal conchae increased about 4‐fold, while there was a progressive decrease in the relative size of the epithelium and connective tissue compartments, during the maturation period. Arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) were present already at hatching and their density increased 3‐fold during the second week of posthatching development. The seromucous glands form by a process of invagination of the epithelium, which occurs predominantly during the first week after hatching. The glands continue to grow in size and an increasing fraction of the cells becomes mucous‐secreting. The observations are discussed in relation to the role of the nasal mucosa in temperature regulation and conditioning of the inhaled air.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Previous reports of tunicate endostyles have suggested that they contain little or no acidic glycoproteins in the glandular zones. The endostyles of Ciona intestinalis and Styela plicata were examined after anhydrous fixation with cyanuric chloride. Polyanions were stained with alcian blue (AB) at pH 2.5 or azure A, while sulfomucins were stained with high‐iron diamine (HID) or AB at pH 1.0. Endostyles were also tested for sensitivity to acid hydrolysis (AH) and saponification. In Ciona zones 2 and 4 sometimes demonstrated positive HID and AB 1.0 responses. Almost invariably zone 6 was AB+ at pH 2.5; zones 2 and 4 were frequently responsive to AB, but less intense. Each of these 3 zones, when AB+, was sensitive to AH. Responses by zones 3 and 5 to AB (pH 2.5), azure A and saponification suggest that these zones contain mostly nuclear material. In secretory zones 2, 4 and 6 histological responses are consistent with the histochemistry of sialomucins. Zones 1 and 8 had sulfated material in the apical edges in both animal groups. Among the fixatives used for Ciona , only anhydrous fixation demonstrated most of the positive responses to polyanion‐sensitive stains.",

In one‐day‐old male worms, the testis is organised as two zones. One zone consists of individual germ‐line cells, while the other consists of a supporting syncytium which embeds the cells and forms the boundary of the testis. The surface of the testis is covered by a fibrous non‐cytoplasmic coat. In seven‐day‐old male worms, the syncytium has lost its compact form, breaking down into multinucleate units connected by cytoplasmic processes and apparently forming a loose syncytial network throughout the testis. The germ cells are now randomly distributed and are surrounded by wide spaces among the segments of the supporting syncytium. The fibrous coat, lined internally by an irregular layer of the syncytium, forms the testis envelope. This basic structure is maintained in the testis of 14‐day‐old and sexually mature male worms.",
