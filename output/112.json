    "abstract": "Regional centro-axial anaesthesia, primarily spinal block, is the preferred method of anaesthesia for elective caesarean section because it entails fewer risks for the mother and the foetus compared to general anaesthesia. The most common side effect associated with spinal block is hypotension due to sympatholysis, occurring in up to 75% of cases. Spinal block-induced sympatholysis leads to vasodilatation and consequently causes maternal hypotension, which may compromise uterine blood flow and foetal circulation, and thus cause foetal hypoxia, bradycardia and acidosis. The selection of the most efficient treatment strategy to achieve haemodynamic stability during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section continues to be one of the main challenges in obstetric anaesthesiology. A number of measures for the prevention and treatment of spinal block-induced hypotension are used in clinical practice, such as preloading and coloading with crystalloid and/or colloid infusion, wrapping of lower limbs with compression stockings or bandages, administering an optimal dose of local anaesthetic and achieving an optimal spinal block level, left tilt positioning, and administering inotropes and vasopressors. Instead of administering vasopressors after a drop in blood pressure has already occurred, the latest algorithms recommend a prophylactic administration of vasopressor infusion. The preferred vasoconstrictor in this case is phenylephrine, which is associated with a lower incidence of foetal acidosis, and maternal nausea and vomiting compared to other vasoconstrictors.",

The domains of social functioning were lowest in patients with diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy, while the physical functioning domains were rated lowest in patients with diabetic nephropathy, diabetic foot ulcer, and multiple chronic complications. All domains were rated lowest by patients with multiple complications and highest by those without any complications.

Vitamin B12 plays an important part in the metabolism of the nervous system, although its exact role under pathological conditions is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency in the light of the characteristics of the patients enrolled. This retrospective, clinical study included 38 children with neurological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency. Records of 38 patients referred to a single center of the university hospital outpatient child neurology clinic due to neurological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency between February 2012 and December 2013 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients aged 0-18 years with symptoms including syncope, dizziness, convulsion, hypotonia, developmental retardation, tremor, ataxia, tingling sensations and paresthesia, blurring of vision, fatigue and concentration difficulty caused by vitamin B12 deficiency were included in the study. Patient neurological findings included syncope (n=6), dizziness (n=4), hypotonia (n=9), inability to sit or walk without support, or gait ataxia (n=2), convulsion (n=4), hand tremor (n=1), tingling sensations and paresthesia (n=3), vision blurring (n=1), fatigue and concentration difficulty (n=8). All patients with neurological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency recovered within one month after vitamin B12 supplementation. In conclusion, clinical characteristics of vitamin B12 deficiency are broad and nonspecific and may not be associated with anemia and increased mean corpuscular volume. Since different clinical characteristics can be seen without anemia, awareness and cautious approach are essential in order to avoid severe clinical disease, especially in children from underdeveloped countries.",

The aim of this study was to get an insight into the quality of life (QOL) in subjects with RA in connection with pain perception and functional ability. The following instruments were used: the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS Pain). The results indicated that there was no statistical difference in the QOL between subjects with RA and healthy population according to SF-36 Croatian norms. Also, the results showed that stronger pain experience was significantly associated with poorer social functioning assessment (SF36SF, Spearman's rho=-0.463, p<0.05), poorer general health perception (SF36GH, Spearman's rho=-0.432, p<0.05) and poorer physical functioning (WHOPH, Spearman's rho=-0.688, p<0.01). Furthermore, the subjects evaluating their general functional state worse were found to have worse physical functioning (SF36PF, Spearman's rho=-0.699 and WHOPH, Spearman's rho=-0.769), poorer social functioning (SF36SF, Spearman's rho=-0.580) and experienced greater pain intensity (SF36BP, Spearman's rho=-0.652). Therefore, additional efforts should be invested to define a holistic and integrative model of treatment and rehabilitation of people with RA, focused on pain relief, improvement of functional ability, encouraging social interaction and supporting positive emotional responses.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid gland has a key role in maintaining the body homeostasis.Thyroxine is the main hormone secreted from the thyroid gland, its effect being predominantly achieved after the intracellular conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine, which exhibits a higher affinity for the receptor complex, thus modifying gene expression of the target cells.Amiodarone is one of the most commonly used antiarrhythmics in the treatment of a broad spectrum of arrhythmias, usually tachyarrhythmias.Amiodarone contains a large proportion of iodine, which is, in addition to the intrinsic effect of the medication, the basis of the impact on thyroid function.It is believed that 15%-20% of patients treated with amiodarone develop some form of thyroid dysfunction.Amiodarone may cause amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH) or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT).AIT is usually developed in the areas with too low uptake of iodine, while AIH is developed in the areas where there is a sufficient iodine uptake.Type 1 AIT is more common among patients with an underlying thyroid pathology, such as nodular goiter or Graves' (Basedow's) disease, while type 2 mostly develops in a previously healthy thyroid.AIH is more common in patients with previously diagnosed Hashimoto's thyroiditis.Combined types of the diseases have also been described.Patients treated with amiodarone should be monitored regularly, including laboratory testing and clinical examinations, to early detect any deviations in the functioning of the thyroid gland.Supplementary levothyroxine therapy is the basis of AIH treatment.In such cases, amiodarone therapy quite often need not be discontinued.Type 1 AIT is treated with thyrostatic agents, like any other type of thyrotoxicosis.If possible, the underlying amiodarone therapy should be discontinued.In contrast to type 1 AIT, the basic pathophysiological substrate of which is the increased synthesis and release of thyroid hormones, the basis of type 2 AIT is destructive thyroiditis caused by amiodarone, desethylamiodarone as its main metabolite, and an increased iodine uptake.Glucocorticoid therapy is the basis of treatment for this type of disease.",

The aim of the study was to examine gender differences in health-promoting lifestyle among medical students and to analyze changes between the first and second year of the study. This cross sectional study was conducted on a sample of 1186 students (36% male). Data were collected by self-administered anonymous questionnaire, the Health- Promoting Lifestyle Profile [HPLP II] (Adult Version), and analyzed by descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests. The 941 HPLP II questionnaires were collected and analyzed (79% response rate). Both genders showed a medium level HPLP II total score (male M=2.68; IQR=2.42-2.92 vs. female M=2.65; IQR=2.46-2.90), without significant gender difference. A significantly higher score was observed in the subscales on health responsibility (p=0.027) and interpersonal relations (p<0.001) among female compared to male students, and a significantly higher score in the subscales on physical activity (p<0.001) and stress management (p=0.025) among male compared to female students. Considering differences in the health-promoting lifestyle between study years, a significantly higher score was recorded among second-year students in the HPLP II total score (p=0.004) and the subscales on physical activity (p=0.007), stress management (p=0.006) and spiritual growth (p=0.029). In conclusion, study results implied the need of organized health care and physical activity programs for university students based on specific requirements and needs.",

Postoperative ablation therapy with radioactive iodine (I-131) is indicated in all high-risk patients, however, there is disagreement regarding its use in low- and intermediate-risk patients. Over the last few decades, thyroglobulin (Tg) has been established as the primary biochemical tumor marker for patients with DTC. Thyroglobulin can be measured during thyroid hormone therapy or after thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation, through thyroid hormone withdrawal or the use of human recombinant TSH. In many studies, the cut-off value for adequate Tg stimulation is a TSH value ≥30 mIU/L. However, there is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that this long-established standard should be re-evaluated, bringing this threshold into question. Recently, a risk stratification system of response to initial therapy (with four categories) has been introduced and Tg measurement is one of the main components. The relationship between the Tg/TSH ratio and the outcome of radioiodine ablation has also been studied, as well as clinical significance of serum thyroglobulin doubling-time. The postoperative serum Tg value is an important prognostic factor that is used to guide clinical management, and it is the most valuable tool in long term follow-up of patients with DTC.",

This photosensitivity caused by drugs can appear as phototoxic reactions (which occur more often) or photoallergic reactions (which occur less often and include allergic mechanisms). The following drugs stand out as medications with a high photosensitivity potential: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cardiovascular drugs (such as amiodarone), phenothiazines (especially chlorpromazine), retinoids, antibiotics (sulfonamides, tetracyclines, especially demeclocycline and quinolones), etc. In recent years, photosensitive reactions to newer drugs have appeared, e.g., targeted anticancer therapies such as BRAF kinase inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib), EGFR inhibitors, VEGFR inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors, etc. In patients taking drugs over a longer period of time (e.g., NSAIDs, cardiovascular drugs, etc.), a particular problem arises when an unrecognized drug-induced photosensitivity on the skin manifests in summer months. When taking patient histories, the physician/dermatovenereologist should bear in mind that any drug the patient is currently taking may be the cause of skin reactions. Therefore, patients who use potentially photosensitive drugs and treatments on a long term basis should be warned of the possibility of these side effects on their skin and advised to avoid direct exposure to sunlight and to use adequate photoprotection. If patients carefully protect themselves from the sun, it is often not necessary to stop treatments that include photosensitive drugs. If such reactions appear, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic therapies should be introduced.",

Therefore, the aim was to analyze RNFL thickness and VF changes in study groups with unilateral exfoliation syndrome (XFS), bilateral XFS and bilateral exfoliative glaucoma (XFG), and compare it with controls. The study included 114 subjects (228 eyes) divided into 4 groups according to the presence of exfoliation: 30 subjects with unilateral XFS (30 with clinically visible XFS and 30 fellow eyes), 24 subjects (48 eyes) with bilateral XFS, 28 (56 eyes) subjects with bilateral XFG, and control group (32 subjects). All subjects underwent VF and RNFL measurements after ophthalmologic examination. Both eyes of unilateral XFS (clinically -visible and fellow eye) showed positive correlation between Mean Defect (MD) and square root of Loss of Variance (sLV) and between MD and inferior quadrant RNFL thickness. In bilateral XFS and XFG, there was negative correlation between MD and inferior quadrant RNFL thickness. Inferior, superior and nasal quadrant RNFL thickness was lower in XFG group than in other groups. In bilateral XFS group, the inferior quadrant RNFL thickness was lower as compared with unilateral XFS group (in both eyes). The mean RNFL thickness negatively correlated with MD in bilateral XFS and XFG groups. In conclusion, structural changes before VF impairment have an important role in early detection of glaucoma in subjects at risk.",

    "abstract": "Although breast cancer (BC) occurs more often in older women, it is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women of childbearing age. Owing to the overall advancement of modern medicine and the growing global trend of delaying childbirth until later age, we find ever more younger women diagnosed and treated for BC who have not yet completed their family. Therefore, fertility preservation has emerged as a very important quality of life issue for young BC survivors. This paper reviews currently available options for fertility preservation in young women with early-stage BC and highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to fertility preservation as a very important quality of life issue for young BC survivors. Pregnancy after BC treatment is considered not to be associated with an increased risk of BC recurrence; therefore, it should not be discouraged for those women who want to achieve pregnancy after oncologic treatment. Currently, it is recommended to delay pregnancy for at least 2 years after BC diagnosis, when the risk of recurrence is highest. However, BC patients of reproductive age should be informed about the potential negative effects of oncologic therapy on fertility, as well as on the fertility preservation options available, and if interested in fertility preservation, they should be promptly referred to a reproductive specialist. Early referral to a reproductive specialist is an important factor that increases the likelihood of successful fertility preservation. Embryo and mature oocyte cryopreservation are currently the only established fertility preservation methods but they require ovarian stimulation (OS), which delays initiation of chemotherapy for at least 2 weeks. Controlled OS does not seem to increase the risk of BC recurrence. Other fertility preservation methods (ovarian tissue cryopreservation, cryopreservation of immature oocytes and ovarian suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists) do not require OS but are still considered to be experimental techniques for fertility preservation.",

Research has shown that endothelial dysfunction is one of the major pathophysiological mechanisms in the development of IHD. Endothelial dysfunction also affects regional perfusion of the esophagus, thus compromising esophageal tissue defense mechanisms. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of endothelial dysfunction in the mechanisms of GERD development in patients with IHD. For the purpose of this study, we collected data on serum levels of endothelin-1, nitric oxide metabolites and lipid peroxidation products, gastric pH, parameters of regional blood flow, and quality of life assessment. Study results revealed that in IHD patients with concomitant GERD, endothelial dysfunction manifested by a significant increase in the levels of endothelin-1 and lipid peroxidation products, with decreased levels of nitric oxide metabolites, regional blood flow and quality of life. These findings suggest that hypoxia of the esophageal mucosa, caused by endothelial dysfunction, leads to a decrease in the esophageal tissue resistance and to esophageal lower sphincter dysfunction, which, in turn, are the leading factors in the development of GERD.",

Insight was measured with the Scale to assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder and self-stigma with the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness. Results showed 88.6% of the patients to have high or moderate insight, with a mean value of 2.73. General insight showed the highest level (2.58) and insight in positive symptoms the lowest level (2.9). The self-stigma score in general was 2.13, with stereotype endorsement being lowest (1.98). According to study results, 77.1% of patients felt minimal or low self-stigma across all subscales, except for stigma resistance subscale. Statistically significant correlation was found between insight and four subscales of self-stigma, while no correlation was found for the stigma resistance subscale only. These results imply the need of individually tailored antistigma and insight promoting programs for patients with schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "The concept of diagnostics and therapy of musculoskeletal and neuropathic diseases of the stomatognathic system, which are the subject of this paper, has been developing for decades. It can be said that in order to avoid misunderstanding, the orofacial pain as a clinical problem, in the narrower sense, involves non-odontogenic and non-malignant causes of orofacial region. In this study, the results of clinical diagnosis of the population of 557 consecutive patients with orofacial pain based on multidisciplinary diagnostics were evaluated. 15.6% of patients have given up on the participation in the study. It has been shown that the patients who dropped out of the study were significantly older (p=0.0411) than those who agreed to participate, but there was no difference in gender ratio (p=0.185) since the proportion of female patients prevailed. In an analysis of 84.4% of patients participating in the study, the elevated anxiety values were established (mean value on STAI 1 was 39.2 and STAI 2 was 41.1) and statistical significance was found in correlation between elevated anxiety and intensity of pain as shown on visual analogue scale on open mouth (p<0.0001). Compared to the age, the statistical significance was for STAI 1 (p=0.0097) but not for STAI 2 (p=0.5599). The most common form of therapy is Michigan stabilization splint: for disc displacement of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in 38.9% of patients and in combination with physiotherapy in 18.7% of patients; for osteoarthritis of TMJ in 28.4% and in combination with physiotherapy in 26.4% of patients. The treatment with anticonvulsant drugs for trigeminal neuralgia predominates in 54.3% of patients, which is combined with acupuncture in 25.7% of patients and only acupuncture in 17.1% of patients. In this study, a multidisciplinary co-operation in initial diagnostics and differential was designed to develop subspecialist knowledge on orofacial pain.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common diseases of the central nervous system and usually occurs at the age when people would be expected to be in the prime of their sexual lives. In everyday practice, sexual dysfunction is underestimated because clinicians mostly concentrate on the classic neurologic deficits and often overlook symptoms that can seriously affect the quality of life. Our study included 98 patients (42 men and 56 women, mean age 35±12 years) with relapse from our MS register, with established diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis according to McDonald criteria. Patients completed the questionnaires (Sexual Satisfaction Scale, SSS and Beck Depression Scale BDS), and underwent neurological assessment (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS). All patients were in the group with EDSS 2 to 4 points (mobile patients). There was no statistically significant difference in BDS and SSS values according to EDSS score. Correlation coefficients were calculated (BDS and SSS) for men (p=0.42) and women (p=0.44), yielding positive correlation. There was no statistically significant difference in BDS and SSS values according to gender, disease duration or immunomodulatory therapy. In our group of patients, despite low EDSS score (fully ambulatory without aid, self sufficient patients) we found positive correlation between sexual dysfunction and depression, showing that even in such patients the quality of life can be decreased. In conclusion, sexual dysfunction and depression are mostly under-recognized by neurologists because they are not part of routine testing; therefore, some additional questionnaires should be used in the evaluation in MS patients, even those with low EDSS score, in order to improve their quality of life.",

The management of patients should include individualized assessment for fracture risk factors and bone mineral density. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation should be recommended in all patients with chronic liver diseases and osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are the most efficient drugs used in the treatment of hepatic osteodystrophy.

    "abstract": "Alcohol addiction is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder according to both phenotype and etiology.Difference in phenotype characteristics manifests in the manner the addiction arises, history of the alcoholic and history of drinking, comorbid disorders, and the phenomenon of abstinence difficulties.Concerning the etiology of alcoholism, the disease itself is considered to be a consequence of an interactive influence of the environment and genetic factors.Numerous researches conducted in the last decades discovered many aspects of the biochemical, cell and molecular bases of alcohol addiction, leading to a conclusion that alcoholism is, like many other addictions, a brain disease.By recognizing alcoholism as a disease which basically implies changes of the neurobiological mechanisms, as well as a clear genetic basis, it was supposed that the disease, having its basis solely in the symptomatology, is essentially heterogeneous.By trying to solve the problem of a clinically heterogeneous nature of the disease during the last fifty years, various sub-classifications of such patients have been suggested.According to Cloninger, subtypes of alcoholism differ also according to changes in the brain neurotransmission systems, i.e. it is supposed that patients suffering from alcoholism type 1 have a more pronounced dopaminergic transmission deficit, while dopaminergic transmission is not disturbed significantly in patients diagnosed with alcoholism type 2, who, however, have a significant lack of serotonergic transmission.In such a way, Cloninger actually presented the basis of the so-called neurobiological alcoholism model.Since he has connected differences in neurotransmission with differences in personality characteristics, this model is also known as the psychobiological model of alcoholism.The characteristic of alcoholism type 1 is avoiding damage (Harm Avoidance, HA) decreased dopamine transmission and increased serotonin transmission, while the significant characteristic of alcoholism type 2 is seeking for excitement (Novelty Seeking, NS), unchanged dopamine transmission and decreased serotonin transmission.These neurochemical differences among alcoholism subtypes represent the basis for a different therapy approach.Intake of alcohol changes different gene expression in the human brain.The inheritance model of alcoholism is not fully explained, however, it is considered that the disease is connected to a larger gene number included in neurotransmission, cell mechanisms and general metabolic function, with a simultaneous influence of the environment.The contribution of genetic factors is stronger in certain types of alcoholism and thus we have been confronted in the last years of alcoholism research with studies researching the connections of some alcoholism subtypes with the polymorphism phenomenon in the genes coding the synaptic proteins included in the alcoholism etiology.The primary role of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the brain is catalysis of deamination of the oxidative neurotransmitter amines, i.e. serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine.Thus, this enzyme is the key factor for maintaining cytoplasmic concentration of various neurotransmitters and for regulation of the neurotransmitting synaptic activity.",

However, mood disorders frequently remain unnoticed and therefore untreated. The aim of the study was to examine all the potential risk factors and determine the independent predictors of early-onset depression after first-ever stroke, which would help identify high-risk patients, establish early diagnosis and timely treatment that would improve the course and prognosis of this disorder. This prospective study included 60 patients treated for their first-ever stroke; there were 30 patients diagnosed with depression and 30 patients without depression. The study included collection and analysis of all socio-demographic and clinical risk factors for PSD. Testing was performed two weeks after stroke. Depression was diagnosed according to the Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview, DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, and depression severity was quantified by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Cognitive impairment was assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination. Neurological deficit was assessed by the US National Institute of Health Stroke Scale. Our results showed that the independent predictors of early-onset depression after stroke were previous depressive episodes, cognitive dysfunction, and more severe neurological deficit.",

In our study, differences in disc herniation recurrence and clinical outcome of surgical treatment of lumbar disc herniation with and without the use of operating microscope were assessed. Our study included 167 patients undergoing lumbar disc surgery during a three-year period (SD, n=111 and MD, n=56). Clinical outcome assessments were recorded by patients via questionnaire forms filled out by patients at three time points. Operation duration, length of hospital stay and revision surgeries were also recorded. According to study results, after one-year follow up there was no statistically significant difference between the SD and MD groups in functional outcome. However, we recorded a statistically significant difference in leg pain reduction in favor of the MD group. According to the frequency of reoperations with the mean follow up period of 33.4 months, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the MD group (SD 6.3% vs. MD 3.2%). There appears to be no particular advantage of either technique in terms of functional outcome since both result in good overall outcome. However, we choose MD over SD because it includes significantly lower recurrent disc herniation rate and higher reduction of leg pain.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between central adiposity and hyperinsulinemia, as well as inflammation markers with vertebral and femoral BMD and bone turnover markers in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. Femoral and vertebral BMD, osteocalcin, pyrilinks D, beta-CrossLaps (B-CTx), insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were measured in 114 postmenopausal female patients with diabetes type 2. The patients of similar age, HbA1c levels and diabetes duration were divided into 2 groups based on their body mass index (BMI) values: lower or equal to 27 kg/m(2) (31 patients) and higher than 27 kg/m(2) (83 patients). Lower levels of osteocalcin (p=0.001), B-CTx (p=0.000007) and pyrilinks D (p=0.0365), and higher femoral BMD (p=0.00006), insulin level (p=0.0002), PAI-1 (p=0.00000) and CRP (p=0.002) were found in the overweight group. There were no signifi cant differences in vertebral BMD and fibrinogen. Osteocalcin and B-CTx showed inverse correlation, and femoral BMD positive correlation with waist circumference, insulin level and PAI-1. This suggests that abdominal obesity and hyperinsulinemia as components of the metabolic syndrome could increase femoral BMD by lowering bone rate. In addition, the only inflammation marker linked with femoral BMD was PAI-1, which is associated with increased mineralization of cortical bone in mouse.",

Lifetime prevalence of wheezing was 22.7%, rhinitis symptoms 22.5%, and eczema symptoms 17.9%. Period prevalence in the past 12 months was 7.9% for attacks of wheezing, 9.9% for rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms, and 10.1% for eczema symptoms. Of the children in which skin prick test was performed, 20.2% were positive for at least one of the allergens used, with house dust mite sensitization being the most frequent one. Risk factors for allergic disease include allergic disease in family, atopy, sensitization to indoor and outdoor allergens, and environmental tobacco smoke exposure at home.

    "abstract": "Missile injuries are among the most devastating injuries in general traumatology.Traumatic brachial plexus injuries are the most diffi cult injuries in peripheral nerve surgery, and most complicated to be surgically treated.Nevertheless, missile wounding is the second most common mechanism of brachial plexus injury.Th e aim was to evaluate functional recovery after surgical treatment of these injuries.Our series included 68 patients with 202 nerve lesions treated with 207 surgical procedures.Decision on the treatment modality (exploration, neurolysis, graft repair, or combination) was made upon intraoperative fi nding.Results were analyzed in 60 (88.2%) patients with 173 (85.6%) nerve lesions followed-up for two years.Functional recovery was evaluated according to functional priorities.Satisfactory functional recovery was achieved in 90.4% of cases with neurolysis and 85.7% of cases with nerve grafting.Insuffi cient functional recovery was verifi ed in ulnar and radial nerve lesions after neurolysis, and in median and radial nerve lesions when graft repair was done.We conclude that the best time for surgery is between two and four months after injury, except for the gunshot wound associated with injury to the surrounding structures, which requires immediate surgical treatment.Th e results of neurolysis and nerve grafting were similar.",

Improvement and innovations in technology, but also the growing experience of the radiologists who deal with kidney transplant patients as part of the transplant team lead to earlier detection of complications in the postoperative period, which are the leading cause of transplant failure. In this article, we describe, through diagnostic imaging examples, detailed evaluation of all possible complications that can occur after kidney transplantation, with evaluation of different possible diagnostic methods that can be used in the preoperative assessment and postoperative follow up and care of the transplanted patient. The goal of this article is to demonstrate and summarize in detail the possible complications of renal transplantation and how to best diagnostically approach them, with special reference to ultrasound which is the main imaging method for this group of conditions.",

We aimed to determine the age at which obesity related autonomic dysfunction becomes significant and whether it decreases differently according to metabolic profile. We analyzed HRV in 99 adults using Wildman's criteria for metabolic profile and 5-minute HRV for autonomic nervous system. In MHO, high frequency (HF) decreased in the 4th decade of life. In MUO, standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences of all R-R intervals (RMSSD), number of adjacent intervals differing by more than 50 ms expressed as percentage of all intervals in the collecting period (pNN50), HF, low frequency (LF), LF/HF (LF divided by HF) and total power (TP) decreased in the 4th decade of life (partial shared variance 28%-36%). In conclusion, an age dependent decrease of HRV occurs in MUO between the third and fifth decade of life. In MHO, HF significantly decreases around the age of 40 years. Cardiometabolic profile influences metabolic aging, altering the autonomic nervous system.",

However, it carries the risk of postprostatectomy urinary incontinence (UI) and erectile dysfunction (ED) which significantly reduce patients' satisfaction with surgery and quality of life (QoL), therefore it is important to decrease the possibility or severity of these complications to a minimum. There are several preoperative prognostic factors such as urethral length and closing pressure obtained by magnetic resonance imaging and profilometry, as well as several variations in the surgical approach such as preservation of the neurovascular bundle (NVB) and puboprostatic ligaments, sparing or reconstruction of bladder neck, Retzius-sparing approach, and meticulous surgical dissection, used to predict or prevent unwanted side effects of RP. In addition, there are postoperative methods that can help reduce complications. In this review, we will present the role of pelvic rehabilitation with an emphasis on pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in reducing consequences of radical surgery.",

    "abstract": "Children with atopic dermatitis (AD) usually develop symptoms when they reach the age of 6-7 years, but the risk of developing respiratory allergies, asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) remains high.In most children with AD, the development of asthma and AR is associated with sensitization to food allergens and/or aeroallergens, while only a small percentage missed atopic diathesis.In about 35% of children with AD, food allergy is the provoking cause, and 60% of infants who had AD in the fi rst 3 months of life were sensitized against aeroallergens by the age of 5. Th e aim of the study was to follow development of asthma and AR and to assess the most signifi cant risk factors for developing respiratory allergy.A total of 114 children with AD were followed up for fi ve years.At annual visits, the severity of disease, total immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody values, skin prick tests, specifi c IgE antibodies to food allergens and aeroallergens, and absolute eosinophil count were assessed.Information on the family history of atopy and AD, feeding patterns during infancy, data on sensitivity to food allergens and/or aeroallergens, and on the occurrence of bronchial obstruction and nose symptoms were obtained.Asthma developed in 36 children, median age 7.7 years; 33 children had symptoms of AR, and 13 children with AD had both diseases associated; 38 children had sensitivity to food, of which 24 developed asthma and 13 AR; asthma developed in 18/23 children with sensitivity to aeroallergens, and almost an equal number of children developed AR.Th e increased absolute eosinophil count and specifi c IgE to aeroallergens and food allergens were the best asthma predictors, while AR predictors were family history and early onset of AD.In conclusion, children with AD are at a signifi cant risk of developing respiratory allergies, and those with the increased absolute eosinophil count, positive specifi c IgE to aeroallergens and food allergens, heredity of AD, and early onset of AD are at the highest risk.Identifi cation of risk factors will enable us to improve the treatments of AD in order to reduce the severity of disease and prevent manifestation of respiratory allergy.",

The highest prevalence of traumatic dental injury (TDI) was found in the 7-12 age group and maxillary central incisors were most frequently affected (80.9%) in both primary and permanent dentitions. Enamel-dentin fracture without pulp exposure (31.9%) was the most common TDI of dental hard tissue in both dentitions, whereas subluxation (27.3%) was the most common periodontal tissue injury type. The most frequent location, cause and seasonal variation of trauma were at home, falling and spring. Soft tissue injuries were observed in 203 (45.4%) patients. Soft tissue injuries were less likely when fewer teeth were traumatized (p<0.001). Comparison of children with and without soft tissue injuries yielded a statistically significant difference in the time to arrival between primary and permanent teeth (p<0.01). Because soft tissue injuries include bleeding and clinical presentation appears more dramatic, the time elapsed between injury and initial treatment was shorter than in non-bleeding injuries, pointing to the need of education focused on parents and school teachers regarding the importance of immediate therapy for both bleeding and non-bleeding TDIs.",

    "abstract": "Th e aim of this review is to analyze current diagnostic approaches to obesity in adult men, the potential mechanisms linking obesity to infertility, and treatment options aimed at improving reproductive health.Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic with the estimated prevalence increasing from 28.8% to 36.9% between 1980 and 2013.In terms of diagnosis, numerous simple techniques have been developed including body mass index, waist to hip ratio, waist circumference, bioelectrical impedance analysis, ultrasound and skinfold measurements.Additionally, several other less available but more accurate techniques have been suggested, such as air displacement plethysmography, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.In addition to cardiovascular and other disorders, male obesity can negatively aff ect the male reproductive potential through abnormal reproductive hormone levels, reduced semen quality, increased release of adipose-derived hormones and adipokines, as well as thermal, genetic and sexual mechanisms.In the management of obesity related male infertility, natural weight loss is the cornerstone and regular exercise the fi rst-line treatment.Although bariatric surgery results in greater improvements in weight loss outcomes when compared to non-surgical interventions, further research is required to clarify its overall infl uence on male fertility.",

A new pregnancy was present in 84 (83.2%) of the women after EP treatment. There was no significant difference among the women having undergone medical treatment (methotrexate), surgical treatment, medical treatment followed by surgical treatment, or observational management approach in terms of achieving a new pregnancy after treatment and time to and prognosis of the new pregnancy.

In our patients, scabies was unrecognized for months during which time the patients were treated for allergic/immune diseases (nummular eczema, drug-induced reaction, allergic contact dermatitis, autoimmune skin disease). Additionally, none of our patients had lived in unhygienic conditions or were close to infected persons, but all had concomitant itch. Because of the similarity between scabies and pruritic allergic disorders, it is important to exclude scabies before diagnosing an allergy, based on patient history and skin examination.

    "abstract": "Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis and is defined as infected ascites in the absence of any recognizable secondary cause of infection. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence, incidence, pathogens and clinical outcome of SBP. This prospective observational study included 108 cirrhotic patients with ascites treated during 18 months. Patients were divided into two groups according to diagnostic criteria of SBP: SBP group (n=23) and non-SBP group (n=85). Differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed, including mortality rate, incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia/sepsis and frequency of rehospitalization. The pathogens responsible for SBP were analyzed in SBP group. The prevalence of SBP was 21% and incidence 14.1% per year. Statistically significant between-group differences were recorded in mortality (26% vs. 4.7%; P=0.017), incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (39% vs. 11.7%; P=0.015) and rehospitalization frequency (47.8% vs. 20%; P=0.05). The incidence of sepsis following episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was similar in both groups (55.5% vs. 50%; P=0.892). The following pathogens were responsible for SBP: Escherichia coli (n=7), MRSA (n=2), Acinetobacter spp. (n=2), Staphylococcus aureus (n=1), Streptococcus spp. (n=1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=1) and Enterococcus faecalis (n=1). As indicated by study results, the incidence and mortality of SBP were high. Patients with liver cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were found to be at a high risk of developing sepsis with or without clinically proven SBP. The pathogens responsible for SBP were mostly gram-negative microorganisms; however, there were also a significant proportion of gram-positive microorganisms and hospital infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Study results suggested the spectrum of pathogens to change due to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within the hospital setting.",

However, it has not been established whether the intensity of the immune response during diabetes-associated chronic inflammation affects the development and/or progression of type 2 diabetes and its microvascular complications. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-1082G/A for IL-10 gene in development of diabetes type 2 and its complications. DNA was extracted from blood cells of 240 overweight/obese subjects for IL-10 genotyping. Based on the presence of diabetes type 2, patients were divided in two groups: experimental group of 144 patients with diabetes type 2 and control group of 96 age- and gender-matched subjects without diabetes. Compared to control group, diabetic group had higher levels of leukocytes (p=0.012), fibrinogen (p=0.049) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (p=0.009), and lower levels of albumin (p=0.001). There were no differences in the frequency of SNP-1082G/A for IL-10 gene between the two groups (p=0.654). When considering diabetes related traits in all subjects in relation to specific genotype, a group with homozygous (AA) genotype had higher values of the mean fasting glucose (p<0.000001), HbA1c (p<0.000001) and HOMA-IR (p=0.003632), while the mean HOMA-B value (p=0.000178) was lower when compared to the groups with GG and GA genotypes. There was no difference in devel-opment of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy and polyneuropathy between the IL-10 polymorphism genotypes. In conclusion, obese diabetes type 2 patients had an increased inflammation activity com-pared to obese non-diabetic individuals. There was no association of the investigated polymorphisms and development of type 2 diabetes and its microvascular complications. However, diabetes related traits clearly depended on the presence of specific IL-10 genotype.",

Since CVD is the leading cause of death in Montenegro, we aimed to assess the risk of CVD as assessed by RRS and to examine its association with cardiometabolic parameters in apparently healthy middle-aged population. In addition, we aimed to test whether obesity had an independent influence on RRS. A total of 132 participants (mean age 56.2±6.73 years, 69% females) were included. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), blood pressure (BP) and biochemical parameters (fasting glucose, insulin, lipid parameters, creatinine and high sensitivity C-reactive protein) were determined. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were calculated. Compared with females, a significantly higher number of males were in the high RRS subgroup (χ2=45.9, p<0.001). Furthermore, significantly higher fasting glucose (p=0.030), insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides (p<0.001 all), anthropometric parameters (e.g., BMI and WC; p=0.004 and p<0.001, respectively), and creatinine, but lower eGFR and HDL-c (p<0.001 both) were recorded in the high-risk subgroup compared with low and medium risk subgroups. In all participants, in addition to LDL-c, diastolic BP and creatinine, WC was independently positively associated with RRS (β=0.194, p=0.006; β=0.286, p=0.001; β=0.267, p=0.001; and β=0.305, p=0.019, respectively), and 40% of variation in RRS could be explained with this model.

    "abstract": "Phenotypic detection of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) in Acinetobacter (A.) baumannii is a serious challenge to clinical microbiologists. MBLs are inhibited by metal chelators such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) (EDTA). Production of MBLs cannot be recognized based on resistance phenotype. Therefore, phenotypic tests using EDTA are recommended. The aim of this study was to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of inhibitor based tests (EDTA) for detection of MBL. A total of 172 A. baumannii strains (123 carbapenemase positive and 49 carbapenemase negative) were analyzed. Phenotypic detection of MBLs was performed by the combined disk test with EDTA (CDT-EDTA) and EPI-dilution test (EPI-DT). Both tests were positive in all 11 isolates possessing VIM-1 MBL, showing 100% sensitivity. However, false positive results were observed in strains with class D carbapenemases using both tests, i.e. all OXA-23 and OXA-24/40 producing organisms and most OXA-58 positive strains (77% with CDT-EDTA vs. 65% with EPI-DT). False positive results can occur because oxacillinases are converted to a less active state in the presence of EDTA, leading to augmentation of the inhibition zone around the carbapenem disk or reduction of carbapenem minimum inhibitory concentrations. This study showed high sensitivity but low specificity of phenotypic methods in the detection of MBLs.",

    "abstract": "Trigeminal neuralgia causes severe to excruciating pain that often cannot be successfully reduced with current forms of treatment.The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines trigeminal neuralgia as a sudden, usually unilateral, powerful, short, stabbing, recurrent episode of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve.Trigeminal neuralgia can be caused by vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve or a tumor process.Pressure on the nerve itself causes nerve demyelination, which is the cause of abnormal depolarization, resulting in the development of ectopic impulses.Pain can be provoked by brushing teeth, shaving, eating, cold, heat, etc.After diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia, magnetic resonance imaging should be performed to rule out multiple sclerosis, a tumor process that can secondarily cause trigeminal neuralgia.The drug of choice for treating trigeminal neuralgia is still carbamazepine.If pharmacological treatment fails, invasive surgical microvascular decompression, stereotactic radiation therapy (gamma knife), percutaneous balloon micro compression, percutaneous glycerol rhizolysis, and percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) may be used.",

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy is the attractive treatment option for prostate cancer and has a clear role in all stages of the disease.Over the last decade, advances in technology, imaging capabilities, and improved radiobiological understanding have deeply transformed radiotherapy for prostate cancer, allowing dose escalation and wide adoption of hypofractionation.Furthermore, the integration of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and improved physical precision of dose delivery have given an impetus to additionally target intraprostatic tumor lesions, previously agnostic to conventional radiotherapy target definition concept.The emerging data from randomized clinical trials and observation research show that ultra-hypofractionation is a safe approach while further follow-up is needed to assess its efficacy compared to standard fractionation.There is an ongoing uncertainty surrounding true alpha/beta ratio for prostate cancer since hypofractionation has so far failed to yield theoretically envisioned superior biochemical control outcomes.Finally, recently published randomized trial settled ongoing controversy regarding the role of elective pelvic lymph node radiotherapy in patients with high-risk prostate cancer, showing clear benefit when pelvic nodes were treated to 50 Gy.The role of partial gland dose escalation/tumor boosting is evolving, and more data is needed to adopt this approach in routine clinical care.Going forward, molecular imaging will be crucial to assess biology of the disease, predict a response potentially, and optimally personalize radiotherapy treatment decisions.In this narrative review, we critically analyzed the published literature and provided practical summary of recent prostate radiotherapy advances for busy clinicians.",

    "abstract": "To our knowledge, there is no study investigating whether fatigue and depression as the most commonly reported symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients have arisen from primary mechanisms of MS or from secondary associated conditions such as OSA in MS patients. The aim of our survey study was to determine whether depression and fatigue in MS patients were associated with clinical features of OSA or with MS. We conducted a self-administered survey using four validated questionnaires (STOP-BANG, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale and The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised) in 28 consecutive outpatients with proven MS. The prevalence of MS patients at an increased risk of OSA was 29% and age was positively correlated with this risk (p=0.019). None of the clinical features of MS patients (subtype, disability status, disease duration, modifying therapy, other medication) was correlated with depression and fatigue. On the contrary, excessive daytime sleepiness as a hallmark of OSA was significantly and positively associated with the level of depressive symptoms (p=0.004) and level of fatigue (p=0.015). Also, depression was significantly and positively correlated with the increased risk of OSA (p=0.015) and age of MS patients (p=0.016). Finally, a significant positive correlation was found between fatigue severity and level of depressive symptoms (p=0.003). OSA is a common disorder in MS patients. The clinical features and risk factors for OSA in MS patients are associated with the two most commonly reported symptoms of depression and fatigue, thus supporting the hypothesis that both symptoms are due to a secondary condition in MS.",

The study included 122 patients. All participants completed a questionnaire on sociodemographic data, duration of symp-toms, types of treatment and preventable risk factors (body mass index and waist circumference). The presence of neuropathic pain was assessed by painDETECT, according to which subjects were classified into three groups (neuropathic pain likely, possible, or unlikely). Neuropathic pain was likely in 18 (14.8%), possible in 30 (24.6%) and unlikely in 74 (60.7%) subjects. A significant positive correlation was found between visual analog scale for pain and painDETECT score. There was no statistically significant difference in gender, age, waist circumference and body mass index among three groups of participants according to painDETECT score. In conclusion, knee osteoarthritis patients with neuropathic pain component were experiencing higher levels of pain, implicating poorer pain control with common analgesics. Recognizing these patients as a distinct subgroup would allow clinicians to improve their treatment by using unconventional analgesics with central activity.",

    "abstract": "Endometriosis is a common chronic disease characterized by growth of the endometrial gland and stroma outside the uterus. Symptoms affect physical, mental and social well-being. Extrapelvic location of endometriosis is very rare. Abdominal wall endometriosis occurs in 0.03%-2% of women with a previous cesarean section or other abdominopelvic operation. The leading symptoms are abdominal nodular mass, pain and cyclic symptomatology. The number of cesarean sections is increasing and so is the incidence of abdominal wall endometriosis as a potential complication of the procedure. There are cases of malignant transformation of abdominal wall endometriosis. Therefore, it is important to recognize this condition and treat it surgically. We report a case of a 37-year-old woman with abdominal wall endometriosis 11 years after cesarean section. She had low abdominal pain related to menstrual cycle, which intensified at the end of menstrual bleeding. A nodule painful to palpation was found in the medial part of previous Pfannenstiel incision. Ultrasound guided biopsy was performed and the diagnosis of endometriosis confirmed. Surgery is the treatment of choice for abdominal wall endometriosis. Excision with histologically proven free surgical margins of 1 cm is mandatory to prevent recurrence. A wide spectrum of mimicking conditions is the main reason for late diagnosis and treatment of abdominal wall endometriosis. In our case, the symptoms lasted for eight years and had intensified in the last six months prior to surgery.",

Thirty-six patients with confirmed Graves' disease and active TAO were included, 21 (58%) of them with early DON (eDON) and 15 (42%) free from any signs of eDON. All study patients underwent Doppler ultrasound examination to determine the blood flow rates in the internal carotid artery, ophthalmic artery, and central retinal artery.

The outcome was assessed in 2016. Out of 48 patients, 39 responded at follow up. The seizure frequency was reduced in 18 (46.2%) patients; 13 (33.3%) of them reported ≥50% reduction after 12 months of therapy. The responder rate was higher among patients implanted before the age of six years. Ictal severity decreased in 22 (56.4%), seizure duration in 19 (48.7%) and post-ictal recovery time in 22 (56.4%) patients. Favorable effects on the quality of life (QOL) were improved alertness in 33.3%, concentration in 41.0%, energy and mood in 38.5%, and memory in 17.9% of patients. Reduced seizure burden and improved QOL were more often observed in patients implanted at a younger age. Shorter duration of epilepsy was significantly associated with QOL improvement. Adverse effects were transient. Overall positive effects showed VNS to be a safe, well-tolerated and effective adjunctive treatment in most severe drug-resistant epilepsy patients. Implantation at a younger age and shorter duration of epilepsy before implantation could be important predictors of better outcome.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases are multifactorial disorders the clinical manifestation of which depends on the interaction among immune response, genetic and environmental factors. There is growing evidence that cytokines and gene polymorphisms have an important role in disease pathogenesis in various populations although molecular mechanism of their signaling and interactions is not fully understood yet. The present study aimed at exploring the effects of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 rs1800795 polymorphism on the development of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel diseases overall and at determining differences between inflammatory bowel disease patients and healthy controls. A total of 132 inflammatory bowel disease patients and 71 healthy blood donors were investigated. In order to assess the clinical relevance of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein serum concentration and interleukin-6 rs1800795 single nucleotide polymorphism in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, we performed a cross-sectional, case-control study. Quantitative assessment of serum interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein was performed with solid-phase, enzyme-labeled, chemiluminescent sequential immunometric and immunoturbidimetric assay, respectively. A real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based method on a LightCyclerTM PCR 1.2 was used for genotyping of IL-6 rs1800795 polymorphism. Both interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein serum levels were elevated in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Positive correlations were observed between C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 serum concentration and ulcerative colitis activity index as measured by modified Truelove-Witt's severity index scale. C-reactive protein serum level was higher in Crohn's disease patients without intestinal resection than in Crohn's disease patients with prior intestinal resection. In ulcerative colitis patients, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein serum levels were statistically significantly higher in CC interleukin-6 genotype in comparison to GG+GC genotype. Analysis of the promoter region of the interleukin-6 rs1800795 gene polymorphism showed no statistically significant difference in allele frequency either between inflammatory bowel disease patients and healthy controls or between the two inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes and healthy controls. Associations presented in this study give a potentially important insight into the role of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein signaling and interleukin-6 polymorphism in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis disease.",

    "abstract": "The influence of facet orientation and tropism on the process of spinal degeneration has been extensively studied during the last few decades, but there are still many controversies and conflicting results in this field of research. The biomechanical cause of accelerated degeneration of stabilizing structures in lower lumbar spine lies within the combination of several factors, but two most important ones are compressive load and more coronal facet orientation that offers less resistance against torsional loading. Axial rotation of lower lumbar spine is undoubtedly associated with higher strain in disc annulus, and enhanced range of secondary rotational movements may be even more significant for the progression of annular degeneration. Accordingly, more pronounced facet tropism could be having part in faster progression of disc degeneration in lower lumbar spine, as indicated by a number of recent studies. More sagittal facet orientation in patients with a higher facet osteoarthritis score at lower lumbar segments is very likely related to arthritic remodeling commonly seen in other synovial joints. There is also a possibility that it could be associated with the adaptation to partial loss of lumbar lordosis, as both coincide with advanced age.",

Th e research encompassed 100 patients of both sexes, aged from 20 to 65. Immediately before induction of anesthesia with propofol, the patients in the experimental group (50 study subjects) received 30 mg/ kg bolus dose and magnesium sulfate infusion at 10 mg/kg/h, whereas the subjects in the control group (50 patients) were administered normal saline.Anesthesia was achieved and maintained with sevofl urane, fentanyl and rocuronium.Th e hemodynamic variables of mean arterial pressure and heart rate were measured every fi ve minutes, starting immediately before magnesium infusion.Statistical analysis of the categorized values of mean arterial pressure and heart rate revealed a statistically signifi cant between-group diff erence at 60 th and 90 th minute of anesthesia.In conclusion, magnesium sulfate as an adjuvant to anesthesia in patients with arterial hypertension reduces hemodynamic changes during anesthesia.",

The research was designed as a cross-sectional study. The study included 71 premature newborns, gestational age (GA) ≤33 weeks. Quantitative determination of IGF-1 was performed in the 33rd post-menstrual week (pmw) to make the measurements more comparable. We used an enzyme-bound immunosorbent test for quantitative determination of IGF-1. Our results showed the mean IGF-1 level in premature newborns in 33rd pmw to be 23.1±4.56 (range 15.44-39.75) µg/L. There was no difference in IGF-1 values between male (23.1±4.98 µg/L) and female (23.1±4.87 µg/L) newborns. There was no significant difference in the average IGF-1 levels between male and female newborns with BW <50th and BW >50th percentile for GA either (p>0.50). Only BW <33rd percentile newborns had a statistically significantly lower IGF-1 level compared to newborns with greater BW. Based on our results, it is concluded that serum IGF-1 level reflects intrauterine growth only in BW <33rd percentile newborns. This fact could be used for further therapeutic purposes.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the controversial influence of anthropometry on clinical severity and prognosis of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We prospectively analyzed 250 patients with acute STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (September 2011 – September 2012). They were grouped according to the following anthropometric parameters: body mass index (BMI) (<25.0, 25.0-29.9, ≥30.0 kg/m²), waist circumference (WC) (<102/88, ≥102/88 cm), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (<0.90/0.85, ≥0.90/0.85) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) (<53/49, 53/49-62/57, ≥63/58). The groups were analyzed by baseline, as well as severity (clinical, laboratory, echocardiography, coronary angiography, in-hospital complications) and prognostic parameters (major adverse cardiovascular events and sick leave duration during 12-month follow up). Patients with BMI <25.0 kg/m2 had the highest rates of dyspnea and those with BMI ≥30.0 kg/m² had the longest hospitalization and widest stents; patients with WHR ≥0.90/0.85 had higher rates of significantly stenosed proximal/middle coronary segments, while those with WHtR ≥63/58 had the highest rates of heart failure and total in-hospital complications (p<0.05). BMI <25.0 kg/m2 increased (odds ratio (OR) 2.00, confidence interval (CI) [1.09-3.68], p=0.026) and BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 reduced (OR 0.52, CI [0.30-0.91], p=0.022) the risk of dyspnea; WHR≥0.90/0.85 increased the risk of significant proximal/middle coronary segment stenosis (OR 3.34, CI [1.13-9.86], p=0.029) and WHtR ≥63/58 the risk of heart failure (OR 2.05, CI [1.13-3.71], p=0.017) and total in-hospital complications (OR 1.94, CI [1.13-3.33], p=0.017) (p<0.05). In conclusion, WHR and WHtR are better anthropometric parameters than BMI in predicting acute STEMI severity, while WC has no influence on it. Anthropometry has no influence on prognosis.",

There is ever more evidence suggesting the key role of leptin in the occurrence of breast cancer. The aim of the study was to investigate serum leptin levels in patients with benign breast tumors, as well as in various breast cancer phenotypes, taking into account leptin levels connected to menopausal status and body mass index (BMI). The study included 97 patients having their breast tumor surgically removed. Serum leptin level was determined by ELISA method in all study patients. Study results showed that significantly more women, regardless of having malignant or benign tumors, were postmenopausal and had a significantly higher level of leptin compared to the premenopausal group. The highest level of leptin was recorded in the group of postmenopausal obese women compared to other postmenopausal women but also compared to premenopausal women. According to BMI alone, obese women had a significantly higher level of leptin regardless of the type of tumor. The most significant differences in leptin levels observed through BMI were found in the Luminal B1 group. In conclusion, serum leptin level was shown to be a good diagnostic parameter suggesting a higher possibility of breast cancer development.",

For this purpose, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients with primary carcinomas of head and neck mucosal sites, salivary gland tumors, as well as neck metastases. Two pre-COVID-19 years (2018-2019) and two pandemic years (2020-2021) were compared. Demographic data, overall number of patients, TNM classification of the two most affected sites (oral cavity and larynx), time from symptom onset to first outpatient admission to our department, and time from first admission to treatment initiation were noted. Study results revealed a higher number of patients during the pandemic period and difference in the distribution of tumor sites (χ2=33.68, df=9, p<0.001). Oral cavity cancer prevailed over laryngeal cancer during the pandemic period. A statistically significant difference was observed in delay of initial presentation to head and neck surgeon for oral cavity cancer during the pandemic period (p=0.019). Furthermore, significant delay was found for both sites concerning time from initial presentation to the beginning of treatment (larynx: p=0.001 and oral cavity: p=0.006). Despite these facts, there were no differences in TNM stages comparing two observed periods. Study results indicated that there was a statistically significant delay of surgical treatment for both cancer sites observed (oral cavity and larynx) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survival study is necessary in the future to definitely reveal the true consequences of COVID-19 pandemic on treatment outcomes.",

The study also aimed to identify the risk factors for gastrointestinal side effects. Over 6 months, we conducted a cross-sectional single-center study of consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed RA. Activities of daily living, pain intensity, and disease activity were evaluated by the Health Assessment Questionnaire, visual analog scale, and disease activity score, respectively, in 28 joints. Of 73 patients diagnosed with RA, 48 (66%) regularly took NSAIDs. Compared to non-users, NSAID users used glucocorticoids less frequently. The decision to use NSAIDs was independent of disease activity, pain intensity, degree of functional impairment, or presence of gastrointestinal risk factors. However, a higher degree of functional impairment was associated with a longer duration of continuous NSAID and glucocorticoid use. NSAIDs are still relevant for RA treatment. The decision to use them is not necessarily affected by disease activity or pain intensity, but their prolonged use is required in patients with a higher degree of functional disability. NSAIDs enable exclusion of glucocorticoid use, sparing patients of glucocorticoid-related side effects.",

The SERVQUAL scale was used as a starting point for our research, which resulted in a new, adopted scale called MEDQUAL. The MEDQUAL scale aims to measure the quality of healthcare provided by medical staff of one hospital department instead of the overall quality of hospital services or parts of services on which medical staff in one department has no influence. The study was conducted in a clinical hospital department in Croatia and included 300 respondents (169 patients and 131 medical staff members). The MEDQUAL scale, designed and tested in the study, showed high reliability in all established dimensions, i.e. trust in doctors (Cronbach's Alpha 0.923), nursing professionalism (0.913), medical professionalism (0.938), and departmental organization (0.810). The scale proposed evaluates both patient satisfaction with the quality of healthcare received and medical staff satisfaction with the quality of healthcare provided. The results were comparable to the groups of respondents, departments, and institutions with potential longitudinal studies of this phenomenon. MEDQUAL is a simple, repeatable and cost-effective scale, applicable to almost all departments and used for measuring the quality of healthcare services both provided and received, the aim of which is to contribute to the assessment of healthcare quality and its improvement.",

Children of obese pregnant women are more likely to develop obesity in childhood and adulthood. We analyzed the outcome of 51 pregnancies in obese pregnant women and 50 pregnant women with normal body mass index. All women in both groups were diagnosed with gestational diabetes by the IADPSG criteria. We analyzed gestational age at delivery and mode of delivery, gestational weight gain, presence of concomitant diagnosis of gestational or chronic hypertension, difference in birth weight, and prevalence of hypertrophic newborns. There was no significant difference in gestational age at pregnancy termination and in the mode of delivery. There was a significant difference in gestational weight gain, number of pregnant women with hypertension, neonatal birth weight and number of hypertrophic children.

Considerable difference has also been noticed in disease outcome, wherefore there is the need for a more detailed classification of this tumor subtype. The clinical and pathologic parameters of 147 luminal B (HER2 negative) breast cancers were examined. The expression of hormone receptors in correlation with other prognostic factors and disease outcome was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression analysis. The Kaplan-Mayer analysis showed that low positivity of estrogen (ER) and PR receptors in tumors was associated with a significantly worse disease outcome (overall survival (ER), p=0.020; disease free survival (ER), p=0.019; overall survival (PR), p=0.026; disease free survival (PR), p=0.038)), unlike Ki-67, which did not show a statistically significant connection (overall survival, p=0.343; disease free survival, p=0.322). The intensity of receptor staining and Ki-67 relative to other histopathologic prognostic factors showed a statistically significant correlation solely with histologic grade of tumor. By using the Cox regression model, PR proved to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (p=0.004) and disease free survival (p=0.029). The luminal B (HER2 negative) breast cancer with low expression of hormone receptors, independent of the Ki-67 proliferation index, and in correlation with a higher histologic grade, could be a unique subtype of cancer.",

After the treatment of UUO rats with quercetin, approximately 71%, 81%, 51%, and 57% of the length of the PCT, DCT, Henle's loop and collecting ducts remained intact, respectively (p < 0.01). After the treatment of UUO rats with sulforaphane, approximately 42% and 41% of the length of the PCT and DCT remained intact, respectively (p < 0.01). Changes in the length of Henle's loop and collecting ducts were not significant. In conclusion, quercetin and sulforaphane were found to be effective in preventing some structural renal damage in the direct obstruction model. Quercetin had a more ameliorative role on renal structures.",

Besides platelet count, immature platelet fraction (IPF) can be used as a tool to predict megakaryocytic activity in ITP patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of extended platelet indices in ITP diagnosis and their association with disease persistence and severity. This case-control study (1:1), conducted from January 2015 to December 2017, included 111 ITP patients and 111 healthy controls. ITP patients were grouped as newly diagnosed ITP, persistent ITP, chronic ITP, and refractory ITP patients. Peripheral blood was collected and complete blood profile parameters were recorded using Sysmex XN 1000. Significant (p≤0.05) difference between the groups of ITP patients and healthy control subjects was determined by Fisher exact test, while Pearson correlation was used to evaluate platelet count correlation with IPF using SPSS ver. 23. Low hemoglobin and platelet counts with high total leukocyte count and IPF were detected in ITP patients as compared to healthy subjects (p≤0.001). Among all groups of ITP patients, very low platelet count (6.9±6.02.x109/L) with highest mean IPF (27.1±19.2%) was observed in newly diagnosed ITP group. Other platelet parameters including mean platelet volume (MPV), plateletcrit, platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR) and platelet distribution width values were also altered in patient groups. Pearson correlation revealed negative relationship between platelet count and IPF in all patient groups. With the advent of new, sophisticated hematologic analyzers, the IPF and other platelet parameters provide simple, reliable and easier tools for predicting platelet disorders such as ITP, and to some extent the disease severity. Besides IPF, the MPV and P-LCR seemed to predict disease severity, treatment responsiveness, and duration of the disease to some extent.",

More than 90% of adults experience headache once a year, which makes headache one of the most common symptoms and diagnoses in medicine. Tension-type headaches occur in at least 40% of the population and their impact on the health insurance costs and diminished productivity is significant.

In this article, we present a case of botryoid cyst from our clinical practice, accompanied by literature review of previous cases reported in the literature so far. Study results showed that botryoid cysts mostly affected population in their fifties, with a slight female (53.5%) predominance over males (46.5%). The mandible was the most frequently affected region, accounting for 70 (83.3%) cases. Maxilla was only sporadically affected accounting for 14 (16.7%) cases. Radiographic appearance of botryoid cysts can be multilocular or unilocular. It is concluded that the recurrence rate is relatively high (30.1%), therefore long term follow up is needed.",

Shots were made with Russian AK-74 assault rifle (5.45 mm) into gelatin blocks. Computed tomography scans of the blocks were obtained, translated to digital format, and analyzed using computer software. The area of selected cross-sections of the wound channel was calculated. Maximal destruction of the tissue simulant was recorded between 180 and 220 mm of the missile trajectory. Total and segmental areas of the tissue simulant destruction and missile directions showed significant variation. The method was found to measure terminal ballistic phenomena of the wound channel with considerable precision. It would allow for the effects of different weapons to measure, with implications for the understanding and treatment of gunshot wounds.",

    "abstract": "A 55-year-old female with a history of psychosis and rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to the hospital for fatigue and dizziness. At admission, macrocytic anemia, high serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and gastrin concentrations, decreased serum vitamin B12 concentration, with macroovalocytes and poikilocytes in peripheral blood smear suggested the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) was negative. Surprisingly, treatment by vitamin B12 and folic acid administered for two weeks was ineffective and followed by transitory worsening of hemoglobin concentration on day 8. Repeat direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and IAT were positive. This immunotransfusion conversion, suggesting the presence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, could be explained by change in the macroblastic erythrocyte population, i.e. emerging red cells with completely exposed membrane antigens due to vitamin B12 treatment and/or higher degree of dysregulation of the lymphocyte clone secreting erythrocyte autoantibodies. We proposed the coexistence of pernicious and autoimmune hemolytic anemia; therefore, methylprednisolone was added to vitamin B12 treatment. This therapy successfully improved hemoglobin and erythrocyte concentration. Although megaloblastic-pernicious anemia is a common disease, association of pernicious and autoimmune hemolytic anemia with two mechanisms of hemolysis (ineffective erythropoiesis and immune mechanism) is a rare condition, with only several dozens of cases described so far.",

Furthermore, nonspecific clinical signs and the rare occurrence of this lesion in craniocerebral injuries make the establishment of a diagnosis more difficult. The aim of the paper is to point to the advantages of early diagnosis. During the 1982-2008 period, 18 patients with EHPCF were operated on at University Department of Neurosurgery, Clinical Center of Montenegro in Podgorica. The clinical picture, neuroradiological examination findings and outcome of operated patients were retrospectively analyzed. In our patient series, EHPCF accounted for 0.11% of craniocerebral injuries or 7.9% of epidural hematomas recorded. In 11 cases, the injury was inflicted in traffic accidents and in 7 patients it was caused by fall. Linear fracture of the occipital bone was detected by radiographic investigation in 12, isolated diastasis fracture of lambdoid suture in four, and linear fracture of the occipital bone with diastasis fracture of lambdoid suture in two patients. Glasgow Coma Scale of 8 and less was present in three, 9-12 in seven, and 13-15 in eight patients. The majority of cases (90%) were detected within 24 hours. In all cases, the diagnosis was made by computed tomography. Mortality rate was 11.11%. Early computed tomography of the head in combination with clinical picture and timely surgical intervention could reduce the mortality and morbidity in these lesions.",

Many sexual and reproductive dysfunctions may be found in these patients including individual's low self-esteem, delay of orgasm, erectile or ejaculatory disorder and abnormalities of semen, which are characterized by lower sperm motility or viability. Owing to improvements in physical medicine and rehabilitation, the focus has been shifted from keeping patients alive towards ensuring the quality of life and improvements of sexual dysfunctions and later reproduction. Erectile dysfunction can be treated by using phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, intracavernosal injections, vacuum devices and penile prostheses. Semen can be retrieved from anejaculatory patients by medically assisted methods utilizing penile vibratory stimulation, electroejaculation, prostate mas-sage, or surgically. Although there is low chance for pregnancy in natural way in most of SCL pa-tients, fatherhood is possible through the introduction of assisted medical management. By use of various medical, technical and surgical procedures for sperm retrieval combined with assisted reproductive methods, high pregnancy rates have been reported comparable to those in able-bodied subfertile patients. Nevertheless, future studies are needed to improve semen quality and methods of assisted ejaculation in patients with SCL.",

    "abstract": "Saliva is a complex body fluid that has various functions in the oral cavity. Central nervous system has the most important role in regulating salivation. Saliva as a sample is suitable for simplicity of sampling and because it contains analytes in the free active form. Stress is a condition in which the internal (psychophysical) balance of the body is disturbed. It activates the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, so salivary cortisol is a free cortisol indicator that correlates well with its serum value and reflects the free fraction that is biologically active. At the same time, stress conditions stimulate the sympathetic neuronal system causing change in the secretion of salivary α-amylase from salivary glands. The hypothesis of this study was that students with daily intensive physical activity are ex-posed to chronic stress compared to other students who have minimal physical activity. The study in-cluded 54 healthy volunteers, students of the University of Zagreb, divided into two groups. One volunteer group consisted of physically active volunteers (n=27) from the Faculty of Kinesiology (FK), and the other group consisted of physically inactive volunteers (n=27) from other faculties (OF). The subjects were first administered a psychological test that consisted of two questionnaires, Quality of Life Questionnaire and Questionnaire of Stressful Styles, and then underwent sampling of saliva. By comparing biochemical and psychological indicators in relation to stress, it was concluded that the two groups of students were equalized and that there was no objective support for either group to be considered exposed to chronic stress. Despite the substantial differences in physical activity, there was no difference between the two student populations.",

Forty nasal polyp patients (20 asthmatic and 20 nonasthmatic) requiring surgical treatment were included. Nasal secretion samples were collected from nasal cavities of all 40 subjects. The levels of T-helper type 1 (Th1) proinflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-12, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6, antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 and chemokine IL-8 were measured using flow cytometric method. Each of the 40 patients was staged clinically according to global nasal symptom score, endoscopic score, and Lund-Mackay computed tomography (CT) score. Eosinophils were counted in hematoxylin-eosin stained sections of all nasal polyp samples. The concentrations of Th2 proinflammatory cytokines IL-5 and IL-6 were significantly higher (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) in patients with nasal polyposis and asthma compared with nasal polyp patients without asthma. Positive correlations were observed between IL-2 concentration in nasal secretions and nasal symptom score, endoscopic score, and Lund-Mackay score only in nasal polyp patients without asthma. We also found positive correlation between Lund-Mackay score and the levels of IL-8, IL-4, and IL-1beta in nonasthmatic patients. A positive correlation between IL-5 levels in nasal fluid and endoscopic score was found only in asthmatic patients. Eosinophil counts were higher in asthmatic patients' polyps compared with nonasthmatic ones, but without statistical significance. Nasal polyposis in asthmatic patients has different immunological patterns compared to those without asthma. The concentrations of cytokines measured in nasal fluid were not sensitive enough to be universal criteria to determine the severity of all forms of nasal polyposis.",

    "abstract": "Self-perceived stress during undergraduate medical training could influence forthcoming career choices. The aim of this study was to explore the attitudes and potential differences between 1st and 6th year students regarding aspects of medical training and career plans. As many as 570 students in 1st and 400 in 6th year of studies at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, were recruited on December 2-9, 2013. Data were acquired through a self-administered questionnaire. Students in both years rated \"Helping other people\" as the most important reason to study medicine. Freshmen rated statistically significantly higher 'good incomes' and 'social status' as reasons to study medicine (p=0.003 and p=0.037, respectively). The most desirable fields of specialization were surgery and internal medicine (36.4% and 18.7% for 1st year, and 26.3% and 36.6% for 6th year, respectively). Significantly more freshmen would prefer working abroad (χ2=3.891, p=0.029). In terms of careers abroad, students in both years expressed the highest interest in working in western and northern Europe. Desires for specialty training among medical students follow the pattern of the most frequent disciplines in the Serbian physician population, with gender differences comparable to other populations. A certain percentage of students would likely emigrate.",

    "abstract": "Nocardia is a ubiquitous microorganism which can be the cause of local and disseminated infection in humans. Immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients both can be affected and Nocardia cyriacigeorgica was reported as a pathogen isolated in patients worldwide. In most cases, nocardiosis is present as pulmonary infection because inhalation is the primary way of bacterial exposure. Nocardial brain abscess occurs usually secondary to a septic focus elsewhere in the body. Considering the facts that the elderly population is growing, such as the number of immunocompromised patients together with high mortality rate in patients with nocardial infection of the central nervous system, we have to raise awareness of the possibility for this rare but potentially fatal condition. We present a case where nocardial abscesses of lung and brain were initially suspected as lung cancer with brain metastases. The patient was treated with a combination of surgical resection and antimicrobial therapy with good outcome.",

    "abstract": "Lately there has been an increased consumption of herbal preparations, distributed as nutritional supplements, often claimed to be 'natural' and harmless. However, as their use is not subjected to strict pre-marketing testing and regulations, their ingredients are not clearly defined and there is no quality control or proof of their effectiveness and safety. A growing body of references accentuate their harmful effects, in particular hepatotoxicity, which varies from minimal hepatogram changes to fulminant hepatitis requiring liver transplantation. This case report describes liver damage that was highly suspected to originate from Herbalife® products consumption. We excluded alcohol, viral, metabolic, autoimmune and neoplastic causes of liver lesions, as well as vascular liver disease, but we noticed a connection between the use of Herbalife® products and liver damage. The exact mechanism of liver damage in our patient was not determined. After removing the Herbalife® products, liver damage resolved and there was no need to perform liver biopsy. Taking into consideration the growing consumption of herbal products and their potential harmfulness, we consider that more strict regulations of their production process and sale are necessary, including exact identification of active substances with a list of ingredients, toxicologic testing and obligatory side effect report.",

    "abstract": "Primary malignant tumors of the trachea are very rare with the incidence of less than two per million people per year, and only ten percent of them are adenoid cystic carcinomas. Eighty percent of all tracheal tumors are malignant. Diagnosis is usually late because the symptoms mimic other conditions such as asthma. Clinical picture may sometimes be dramatic when airway is almost closed and emergency recanalization is necessary. Diagnosis is made by chest computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Definitive treatment is surgical resection alone or followed by radiation therapy or radiation therapy alone. Radical resection is only accomplished in about half of all cases because of the submucosal tumor growth and limited length of tracheal resection. The role of adjuvant radiation therapy in negative resection margin cases is not clear but all patients with positive resection margin benefit from radiation therapy. We present a case of a 43-year-old patient with primary adenoid cystic carcinoma of distal trachea treated by emergency bronchoscopic recanalization and resection of the tracheal tumor with end-to-end anastomosis.",

The AEI was measured on lateral digital skull images as the angle between the best fi t line drawn along the posterior wall of the articular eminence and the Frankfurt horizontal plane. No statistically significant (p>0.05) differences between the left and right side AEI were found between MP skulls and RP skulls. The mean value of MP AEI was 45.5˚, with a range of 20.9˚-64˚. The mean RP AEI value was steeper (61.99˚), with a range of 30˚-94˚. Difference between the mean MP and RP AEI values was statistically significant (p<0.05). Values of AEI vary a lot. Nonsignificant differences between the left and right side AEI confirmed the natural left-right side asymmetry. The values of AEI differ between the RP and MP groups, most probably due to different type of food consumption in medieval time, and consequently different masticatory loads and forces.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Diagnosis of prostate cancer poses a significant challenge, due to several different key parameters that need to be evaluated, such as age, history of prostate specific antigen (PSA), clinical examination and more recently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The current diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer has resulted in overdiagnosis and overtreatment as well as underdiagnosis and missed diagnoses in many men. Multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) of the prostate has been identified as a test that could alleviate these diagnostic errors. Before prostate cancer treatment pathological confirmation is mandatory. Prostate biopsy is an invasive procedure with rare but not negligible potential complications. There are several methods of prostate biopsy of which most common are systemic or planar prostate biopsy and cognitive or targeted MRI-guided prostate biopsy. Multiparametric MRI has demonstrated better accuracy and reproducibility in detecting, locating and evaluating prostate cancer and also sparing some men unnecessary biopsies. Recent studies have shown a mpMRI benefit for better procedure planning regarding prostate cancer location, extent of disease and length of the urethra. There are still some challenges ahead, such as ensuring high-quality execution and reporting of mpMRI and ensuring that this diagnostic pathway is cost-effective. According to the latest urological clinical guidelines mpMRI became fundamental tool in management of prostate cancer. The aim of this study is to give a brief insight in use of mpMRI in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.",

Diagnostic work-up included thorough physical and neurological examination, complete laboratory serum assessments, neuroendocrine and immunohistochemistry analysis, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, neurophysiology assessment, ophthalmologist examination and neuroimaging. Th e most important diagnostic tool in deriving the diagnosis of THS was neuroimaging evaluation that included baseline and follow-up cranial contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Baseline cranial contrast enhanced MRI detected a nonspecific inflammatory granulomatous lesion in the right cavernous sinus extending basally towards the right trigeminal cave (Meckel's cave) and anteriorly towards the apex of the right orbit. Systemic intravenous high-dose corticosteroid therapy was administered for 3 consecutive days and then tapered down to lower oral steroid doses. Following therapy, the patient experienced complete regression of symptoms. Follow-up cranial contrast enhanced MRI showed significant regression of inflammatory lesion in the area of right cavernous sinus, thus verifying the efficacy of the treatment applied. This paper shows that an extensive diagnostic schedule for THS must be conducted prior to therapeutic treatment, for the possibility of alternative diagnosis. Patients suspected of having THS require careful evaluation, appropriate treatment, and follow-up.",

We present a case of a 30-year-old primipara admitted to our department in 39th week of gestation after sudden onset of intense abdominal pain. On admission, the patient was pale, tachycardiac, but with normal blood pressure and afebrile. Symptoms of acute abdomen were clear and surgery was indicated. Diagnosis was confirmed during cesarean section. Enlarged gravid uterus compressed the ruptured artery and prevented heavier bleeding. Acute bleeding due to arterial rupture causes severe symptoms, predominantly abdominal pain. Changes in blood count become significant some time after the onset of rupture. As the gravid uterus compressed the arterial rupture, preoperative bleeding was by far less abundant than the bleeding after the baby had been delivered and the size of the uterus decreased. Any cause of acute abdomen during pregnancy (abruption of the placenta, spleen rupture, visceral artery thrombosis) requires urgent surgical treatment, as well as intraoperative and postoperative intensive treatment. Rupture of the internal iliac artery is a rare complication in pregnancy, but has to be considered as a differential diagnosis of abdominal pain.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter (H.) pylori is the cause of one of the most common chronic bacterial infections in humans.Risk factors for the development of laryngeal cancer are cigarette smoke, alcohol, and human papillomavirus.Several papers report on H. pylori isolated in tooth plaque, saliva, middle ear and sinuses.Many articles describe the presence of H. pylori in laryngeal cancer cases, however, without noting the possible source of infection, i.e. stomach or oral cavity.Th e aim of this study was to determine which patients and to what extent simultaneously developed H. pylori colonization in the stomach and the larynx.Prospective examinations were performed in 51 patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.Th e study group included patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma histopathologically confi rmed by two independent pathologists.Th e patients underwent fi ber esophagogastroduodenoscopy with tumor tissue biopsy.Laryngeal and gastric biopsies were examined by histologic staining technique for histopathologic detection of H. pylori and with DNA analyses using the standardized fl uorescent ABI Helicobacter plus-minus PCR assay.Laryngeal carcinoma patients showed positive H. pylori test results simultaneously in the laryngeal and stomach areas, implying H. pylori transmission from the stomach to the laryngeal area.In addition, H. pylori positive test results along with negative H. pylori results in the stomach region were also recorded, suggesting a possible bacteria migration from the oral cavity.In conclusion, H. pylori was found in the area of laryngeal carcinoma, and its migration appeared likely to occur both upwards (from the stomach to the mouth) and downwards (from the oral cavity to the stomach).",

    "abstract": "Currently, topical are studies that examine different reasons for delay of tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and its impact on disease prognosis. The aim was to examine three time periods associated with treatment delay: patient related, health system related and total delay. This retrospective-prospective study included 100 consecutive patients hospitalized at Department of Pulmonology, Clinical Center of Serbia, in the period from March to December 2015. Study results showed median patient delay to be 92.5 days. Total delay was affected by patient related delay. Median healthcare delay was 18.5 days. Patients that reported excessive alcohol consumption were more likely to have prolonged time to seek medical help. Years of alcohol consumption yielded moderate positive correlation with patient related delay (r=0.362, p <0.001). Correlation between the number of cigarettes and patient delay was moderate, positive and statistically significant (r=0.314, p=0.001). Delay in seeking medical help was more likely in patients with negative family history of TB. There was no difference in the effect of the presence of symptoms on patient related delay (p>0.05). Clinical characteristics such as patient TB category and chest radiograph abnormalities were not associated with prolonged patient related delay (p>0.05). Study results point to the importance of health education and/or health intervention in the population group at a high risk of TB.",

The patient underwent an urgent surgery according to the radiographs. Electromyography was performed during the early postoperative care and revealed an acute lesion of the right-sided C5 nerve root. Postoperative follow-up magnetic resonance imaging revealed intact brachial plexus bundles at the site of injury. Symptoms of reduced muscle strength and limited range of motion of the upper right extremity prevailed. Penetrating neck injuries represent a rare entity of all trauma injuries. Meticulous preoperative radiographs revealed close proximity of the knife blade tip to the right-sided vertebral artery and common carotid artery. Limited abduction at the right shoulder during postoperative period correlated to the C5 nerve root injury.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral ventricular system is a sporadic location of intracranial aneurysms including those of basilar artery tip.Treatment of such aneurysms remains challenging regardless of endovascular or microsurgical techniques applied.Basilar tip aneurysm presenting as third ventricular mass is rarely associated with obstructive hydrocephalus, mimicking midbrain expansive process and urging precise diagnostics and prompt treatment.Hence, the management of such patients may be delicate, having an uncertain outcome.We report on a case of a patient with unilateral hydrocephalus caused by large basilar tip aneurysm mimicking a midbrain tumor.We also discuss different operative strategies influencing the outcome, including our own endovascular treatment technical modification.A 62-year-old female patient presented with slightly decreased cognition, minor gait disturbances and urinary incontinence.Computed brain tomography revealed a third ventricle mass with unilateral ventricular dilatation, indicating hypertensive obstructive hydrocephalus.Magnetic resonance and digital subtraction angiography identified the third ventricular mass as a large saccular basilar tip aneurysm.The patient was selected for endovascular treatment followed by cerebrospinal fluid derivation.After aneurysm endovascular occlusion and temporary external ventricular drainage, the symptoms diminished and ventricular dilatation decreased.On post-procedure day 10, the hydrocephalus was relieved and external drainage removed.The patient recovered fully and was discharged without neurological deficit.In conclusion, large basilar tip aneurysms associated with obstructive hydrocephalus are rare and best treated by a combination of endovascular obliteration and cerebrospinal fluid ventricular diversion.The possibility of such an aneurysm should always be considered on the differential diagnosis of cerebral ventricular growths.",

The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between serum bilirubin, which is an endogenous antioxidant with anti-inflammatory activity, and pro- and anti-inflammatory serum adipokines in asymptomatic normal weight and overweight individuals. Healthy men and women aged 25-49 participated in this cross-sectional study. All participants underwent fasting serological measurements of adipokines, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), total and direct serum bilirubin, and other biochemical parameters. Participants were divided into normal weight and overweight groups. We found a significant negative association between total bilirubin and CRP, TNF-α, visfatin and resistin values, and a significant positive association between total bilirubin and adiponectin values in both normal-weight and overweight groups. Importantly, after adjusting for body mass index, we also found a significant negative association between total serum bilirubin levels and both visfatin and CRP serum levels. Moreover, visfatin, resistin and CRP were predictors of the total serum bilirubin levels.",

    "abstract": "Isolated maternal hypothyroxinemia (IMH) is defined as the presence of low maternal total thyroxine (TT4) level in conjunction with normal maternal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. The aim was to investigate whether IMH is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome in North Macedonia. Dried blood spot samples were obtained from 359 pregnant women meeting the inclusion criteria and analyzed for TT4 and TSH. Postpartum data were entered from their medical histories. Out of 359 women, 131 (37.42%) belonged to IMH group. There were statistically significant differences in birth weight (p=0.043), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (p=0.028), Apgar score at 1 min <7 (p=0.018) and cesarean section for dystocia/disproportion (p=0.024) between the IMH and normal thyroid function (NTF) groups. In regression analysis, TSH was a significant variable predicting Apgar score (βst=0.05597, p=0.047), body mass index predicting birth weight (βst=0.02338, p=0.045) and TT4 predicting small for gestational age/IUGR (βst=-0.089834, p=0.029) in IMH group. TT4 was a strong predictor of birth weight (βst=-0.004778, p=0.003) and premature delivery (βst=0.028112, p=0.004) in NTF group. The impact of IMH in pregnancy remains controversial. IMH was associated with an increased maternal BMI and higher birth weight of neonates. Overweight could be a potential risk factor for thyroid dysfunction in pregnant women, and specifically IMH. The worst fetal outcome was seen in IMH mothers examined in second trimester. We found TSH, TT4 and BMI to be strong predictors of perinatal outcomes.",

The aim of this study was to determine which factors affect the success of prosthetic rehabilitation after transtibial vascular amputation. The study included 61 patients who had undergone transtibial amputation (mean age, 64.2±10.4 years; 50 (82%) males). Patients who were able to walk at least 45 meters without aids or with only one walking stick after rehabilitation program were classified into the group of successful prosthetic users. Age, gender, comorbidities, patency of the popliteal artery, wound healing complications, and presence of the phantom limb pain were used as predictive variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictive factors of successful prosthetic rehabilitation. The model included all variables explaining up to 59.8% of variance, however, only age, absence of functional patency of the popliteal artery and compromised wound healing made significant contribution to the model. In conclusion, good general condition of the patient and sustained patency of the popliteal artery reliably led to clinical improvement and realization of full capacity of rehabilitation after below-knee amputation.",

A total of 1084 aspirates from intra-abdominal organs including liver, spleen, pancreas and kidneys obtained by ultrasound (US) guidance during a 10-year period were included in the study. The smears were classified as benign, malignant or suspected of malignancy, and unsatisfactory for interpretation. The liver accounted for more than half of the US-guided FNA procedures, followed by the pancreas with 38%. Out of 1084 aspirations, 192 (17.7%) were inadequate for cytologic analysis. Over half of aspirated lesions in the pancreas were primary cancers, while one-third of pancreatic lesions were benign. In the majority of kidney lesions (83%), cytology found benign changes, mostly cysts. Spleen FNA was least likely; in most cases (59%) it showed lymphoid tissue hyperplasia; in four cases cytologic diagnosis was lymphoma and three lesions were suspected lymphoma. During the study, no major complications were observed on any US-guided FNAC procedure. In conclusion, intra-abdominal FNA is a reliable, sensitive and specific method with a high diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of malignant lesions. It can be utilized as a preoperative procedure for the management of all intra-abdominal lesions.",

In Croatia, women with epilepsy are treated by neurologists at tertiary centers according to the place of residence. We prospectively followed-up pregnancies in women with epilepsy and healthy controls, and analyzed the factors responsible for their delivery outcomes and development of their babies. Healthy pregnant women had a higher level of education and economic status, but pregnant women with epilepsy took folic acid in a higher proportion than controls, possibly due to timely preconception counseling. Complications during pregnancy depended on the number of antiepileptic drugs and epilepsy control. We noticed some behavioral and cognitive aspects in children exposed in utero to valproic acid, which required follow up. The rate of congenital malformations was not increased. In conclusion, women with epilepsy should receive preconception counseling about the risk for pregnancy, but also about the possibilities to minimize that risk. We have introduced a model of integrative management of pregnancy and epilepsy based on close collaboration among different clinical experts in Croatia, in order to provide prompt counseling and timely intervention.",

The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) has been recommended as a standardized international screening and monitoring tool for brief cognitive assessment. The aim of our study was to assess the reliability and validity of the Serbian version of the BICAMS. A total of 500 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and 69 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy control (HC) subjects were examined. All participants performed the BICAMS test battery, which includes the oral version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), California Verbal Learning Test second edition (CVLT-II), and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised (BVMTR). A randomly selected subset of patients were retested one to three weeks after baseline. Statistically significant differences between patients and HCs were evident on the SDMT and BVMTR (p<0.001). HCs had higher CVLT-II scores but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.063). Cognitive impairment, defined as an abnormal test score on ≥1 subtest, was found in 62.9% of MS patients. There were statistically significant correlations between BICAMS scores and age, education, EDSS and disease duration in patient sample. Test-retest reliability was confirmed with Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.70 in all measures. This study supported the reliability and validity of the Serbian BICAMS, although the CVLT-II version tested here lacked sensitivity to detect MS compared to healthy volunteers.",

Optimal management of such an injury remains controversial, requiring full understanding of its pathophysiology and a multidisciplinary expert approach. Herein, we report a case of penetrating brain and associated perforating eye injury and discuss relevant literature providing further insight into this demanding complex multi-organ injury. We present a case of 39-year-old male patient with transorbital penetrating brain and perforating ocular injury undergoing emergency surgery to remove a retained sharp metallic object from the left parietal lobe. Following appropriate and urgent diagnostics, a decompressive left-sided fronto-temporo-parietal craniectomy was immediately performed. A retained sharp metallic object (a slice of a round saw) was successfully removed, while primary left globe repair and palpebral and fornix reconstruction were performed afterwards by an ophthalmologist. A prophylactic administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics was applied to prevent infectious complications. Early postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient was discharged on day 45 post-injury having moderate right-sided motor weakness, ipsilateral facial nerve central palsy, and light motoric dysphasia. The vision to his left eye was completely and permanently lost. In conclusion, management of non-missile transorbital penetrating brain injury can be satisfactory when proper clinical and radiologic evaluation, and amply, less radical surgical approach is performed early. A multidisciplinary routine is a prerequisite in achieving a favorable management outcome.",

It is classified in the following categories: congenital and acquired, which may be involutional, paralytic, cicatricial and mechanical. Depending on the etiology and the predominant location of ectropion, a variety of surgical techniques are available for its correction. In this retrospective study, 52 eyelids in 40 patients with lower eyelid ectropion were operatively treated at our Department during the 2005-2010 period. Involutional ectropion was present in 23 (44.2%), ectropion due to cicatricial changes in 13 (25.0%) and paralytic ectropion in 16 (30.8%) cases. The method of surgical repair was dependent on the underlying etiology and the predominant location of the ectropion. Surgical procedures for involutional entropion repair included pentagonal excision, Kuhnt-Symanowski type procedure, medial wedge excision, lazy-T procedure and lateral canthal sling. Cicatricial ectropion was treated with Z-plasty, local flaps, full-thickness skin graft, or their combination. Tarsorrhaphy and other surgical techniques for support and tightening of lower eyelid were used in paralytic ectropion repair. In 80% of patients, satisfactory functional and cosmetic outcome was achieved with a single surgical procedure. Eight (20%) patients with severe ectropion needed additional surgery. Ectropion repair presents a challenge in oculoplastic surgery. Therefore, individualized surgical approach based on adequate and thorough preoperative evaluation concerning the etiology and the predominant location of the ectropion is mandatory.",

    "abstract": "We decided to reply with this letter regarding the entity that is often unrecognized in daily clinical practice. Ashman phenomenon is an aberrant ventricular conduction most frequently seen during atrial fi brillation. Th is phenomenon is an intraventricular conduction abnormality caused by a change in the heart rate. Ashman beat is typically seen when a relatively long cycle is followed by a relatively short cycle1. Th e beat with a short cycle often has right bundle-branch block (RBBB) morphology (Fig. 1a). Th is phenomenon may cause diagnostic confusion with premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) (Fig. 1b), and a series of consecutive aberrantly conducted supraventricular impulses may be mistaken for ventricular tachycardia (Fig. 1c). Th e pathophysiology of Ashman phenomenon depends on the relative refractory period of the conduction tissues and the heart rate. Th e duration of the refractory period of the heart muscle is proportional to the R-R interval of the preceding cycle. A longer cycle will prolong the ensuing refractory period, and if a shorter cycle follows the beat terminating the cycle is likely to be conducted with aberrancy. Th e refractory period of the right bundle-branch is longer than the left one and it will still be in the refractory period when supraventricular impulse reaches the HisPurkinje system resulting in a complex with RBBB2,3. Ashman phenomenon is principally diagnosed by a 12-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Rarely, in diffi cult cases, invasive electrophysiological studies will be required to establish the source of an arrhythmia whether supraventricular or ventricular4. For daily use, useful criteria to establish the diagnosis of Ashman phenomenon are those described by Fisch5: 1) relatively long cycle immediately preceding the cycle terminated by the aberrant QRS complex; 2) RBBB-form aberrancy with normal orientation of the initial QRS vector, a series of wide QRS supraventricular beats is possible; 3) irregular coupling of aberrant QRS complexes; and 4) lack of fully compensatory pause. Clinically, Ashman phenomenon by itself is asymptomatic and does not require any specifi c treatment. Finally, although Ashman phenomenon has been known for more than sixty years now1, it still often stays unrecognized, or misdiagnosed as PVCs. Understanding Ashman phenomenon is useful and necessary in daily clinical practice because, for example, in 24-hour Holter ECG records we can fi nd even several thousand wide QRS complexes caused by Ashman phenomenon. It usually occurs with atrial fi brillation, and atrial fi brillation is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disturbance, increasing in prevalence with age6. Furthermore, not only the cardiologists, but often physicians of diff erent profi les such as neurologists, anesthesiologists, general practitioners, etc. see it and treat it.",

Case records of 224 patients treated for traumatic injury of parenchymal abdominal organs from January 2003 until December 2015 were reviewed. Th e values of ISS and AIS of injury severity were calculated and compared to the values obtained according to the etiology, state of consciousness and survival. Of the 224 patients, 172 (76.8%) were treated by surgical approach and 52 (23.2%) were treated conservatively. Th e mean patient age was 40.1}18.3 years. Th ere were 97 (43.3%) polytrauma cases. Of the 224 injured patients, 143 (63.8%) were treated with transfusions of blood products. Two hundred and six (92%) patients survived. Th e mean AIS and ISS values were significantly lower in patients that survived (AIS=3; ISS=28) than in those that died (AIS=5; ISS=34) (p< 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in AIS and ISS values between conscious (AIS=2.7; ISS=25.9) and unconscious (AIS=3.2; ISS=33) patients (p< 0.001). Of the 224 patients that did not survive, 18 (8%) were hemodynamically unstable. Survival depended on hemodynamic stability at admission; the ISS and AIS values were associated with the injuries and state of consciousness at admission. Hemodynamic stability, state of consciousness, and ISS and AIS values were the quality predictors of survival after abdominal traumatic injury.",

The study included 2198 consecutive patients referred to our emergency department due to acute UGIB from January 2008 to December 2012. All patients underwent urgent upper GI endoscopy within 24 hours of admission, and 842 patients diagnosed with PUB were enrolled and prospectively followed-up. The cumulative incidence of UGIB was 126/100,000 in the 5-year period. Two out of five patients had a bleeding peptic ulcer; in total, 440 (52.3%) had bleeding gastric ulcer, 356 (42.3%) had bleeding duodenal ulcer, 17 (2%) had both bleeding gastric and duodenal ulcers, and 29 (3.5%) patients had bleeding ulcers on gastroenteric anastomoses. PUB was more common in men. The mean patient age was 65.9 years. The majority of patients (57%) with PUB were taking agents that attenuate the cytoprotective function of gastric and duodenal mucosa. Rebleeding occurred in 77 (9.7%) patients and 47 (5.9%) patients required surgical intervention. The 30-day morality was 5.2% and 10% of patients died from uncontrolled bleeding and concomitant diseases. In conclusion, PUB is the main cause of UGIB, characterized by a significant rebleeding rate and mortality.",

The study was based on an empirical survey research approach and quantitative research paradigms and included all Slovenian (n=14) and all Croatian (n=35) maternity hospitals. Leaders of midwifery team of 14 Slovenian and 35 Croatian labor wards were invited to participate. The study was conducted in 2013, with 67% of Slovenian and 66% of Croatian maternity hospitals having responded. A causal and non-experimental method of empirical research was used. The research instrument was a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics was used on data analysis. The independence hypothesis was tested with the χ2-test or Kullback 2Î-test. A vast ma-jority of study wards employed delayed umbilical cord clamping, i.e. clamping the cord after pulsa-tion had ceased. Only 10% of Slovenian in comparison with 36.4% of Croatian maternity hospitals practiced dry cord care. Others applied disinfectant on the cord, in Slovenia most frequently 6% po-tassium permanganate, and in Croatia a combination of octenidine and phenoxyethanol. Most Croa-tian -maternity wards (95.7%) still covered the stump, while it was not regular practice in Slovenia. The authors estimate that the prevailing Slovenian and Croatian practices in regard to cord clamping are in accordance with the evidence, while improvements could be made regarding stump care, since dry cord care is the recommended method.",

All of them were in advanced stage of the disease, with visual field defect worse than 12 dB in mean defect, when measured with the Octopus Visual Field Analyzer. In order to assess the quality of life, we used the Impact of Vision Impairment questionnaire. Additionally, we used General Information Questionnaire, which was developed for the purpose of this study. The information obtained from the questionnaires was analyzed using the Robust Discriminant Analysis program. Difference analysis was performed for each of the three areas of the questionnaire (reading and accessing information, mobility and inde-pendence, and emotional well-being). Results of this study confirmed the difference between the groups of patients with different levels of visual impairment, varying from total visual loss up to vis-ual acuity 0.5 on the better-seeing eye in the effects of visual impairment on the quality of life. All levels of visual impairment had the largest effect in the area of reading and accessing information, slightly less in the area of mobility and independence, and the least effect was in the area of emotional well-being. Based on the results, it is concluded that all levels of visual impairment have negative effect on the quality of life in glaucoma patients.",

TFF1 and TFF3 genes and proteins were expressed in breast tumors, while the levels of TFF2 gene and protein expression were very low or undetectable. TFF1 was significantly more expressed in benign tumors, while TFF3 was more expressed in malignant tumors. Gene and protein expression of both TFF1 and TFF3 was greater in lymph node-negative tumors, hormone positive tumors, tumors with moderate levels of Ki67 expression, and in grade II tumors. A strong positive correlation was found between TFF1 and TFF3 genes, and the expression of both negatively correlated with Ki67 and the level of tumor histologic differentiation.

The question arises whether surgeons urge more easily to laparoscopic exploration due to its less invasiveness, faster recovery and adequate exploration of the entire abdominal cavity than to observation in unequivocal cases. This retrospective analysis (2009-2016) included 1899 patients undergoing laparoscopic (lap) or gridiron intra-abdominal approach treated at Zagreb University Hospital Centre. The analysis included total negative appendectomy, negative-negative appendectomy (normal appendix and no other pathology found), and negative-positive appendectomy (normal appendix but another pathology found) in children (≤16 years) and adults. There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of negative appendectomy (children) - lap vs. open (p=0.24); negative appendectomy (adults) - lap vs. open (p=0.15); negative-negative appendectomy (children) - lap vs. open (p=0.36); negative-negative appendectomy (adults) - lap vs. open (p=0.21); negative-positive appendectomy (children) - lap vs. open (p=0.53); negative-positive appendectomy (adults) - lap vs. open (p=0.56); and laparoscopy group negative appendectomy in children vs. adults (p=0.56). There was a statistically significantly higher perforation rate with the open approach in total (p<0.0001), in children (p<0.0001) and in adults (p=0.02). There was no statistically significant difference between adults and children in the perforation rate with laparoscopic approach (p=0.24) and perforation rate with open approach (p=0.29). Results confirmed that there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of negative appendectomy in all subgroups. It is concluded that laparoscopic appendectomy should be offered as the method of choice in any patient population with suspicion of acute appendicitis.",

It is the consequence of the lack of expression of genes on the paternally inherited 15q11.2-q13 region. Hyperphagia, obesity, short stature, psychomotor retardation and deterioration of behavior predominate in clinical presentation. Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy, along with restriction of caloric intake, has become the mainstay in the management of PWS patients. Anthropometric parameters (height, body mass index (BMI)), therapy effect on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and occurrence of side effects were monitored in four children with PWS treated with rhGH for ≥2 years at doses of up to 1 mg/m2/day. During the follow-up, the height standard deviation score (SDS) increased in comparison with baseline values, and after ≥2 years of treatment with rhGH it was within the reference range for the general children population. BMI SDS decreased after the first year of treatment, but thereafter increased again; still, the level of BMI SDS was much better in comparison with most children with PWS of the same age and gender. RhGH therapy had no negative effect on glucose and lipid metabolism, nor caused any other adverse effect. Therapy including a customized diet for PWS, along with rhGH therapy, provided a satisfactory growth rate and prevented development of morbid obesity without side effects. This treatment approach would ensure transition of a greater number of PWS patients into adult care, where the multidisciplinary approach in care should be continued.",

Its application at Clinical Department of Traumatology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center began in 2001. The operative procedure should be performed using a minimally invasive technique without fracture opening in order to maintain optimal conditions for fracture healing including hematoma management. However, in everyday practice it is often impossible to obtain satisfactory fracture reduction using the closed procedure, so open reduction and additional fixation with wires or screws are mandatory. Over the last 14 years, fixation of fractures with the locking nail was performed in more than 400 patients. Cases of pseudarthrosis and pathological fractures were also managed successfully. There were more female patients. The mean time from injury to surgery was 2.4 days. Surgery was performed immediately upon admission to the emergency service whenever possible. This study comprised 234 patients with humeral shaft fractures treated with the humeral nail (antegrade insertion was applied in 103 and retrograde in 131 patients). The aim of the study was to stress out the complexity of appropriate operative treatment of humeral shaft fractures using intramedullary fixation, as well as the importance of proper reduction and stable fixation.",

Our study included 157 COPD patients, both outpatients and those hospitalized at the Knez Selo Department of Pulmonology of the Niš Clinical Centre during a six-month period, while in the phase of disease exacerbation. The symptoms of COPD in each patient were estimated by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale. The parameters of pulmonary function (FEV1 and FVC), acid-base status, body mass index, history of exacerbation and comorbidities were also evaluated. The level of CRP, but not leukocytes, showed significant correlation with the severity of clinical presentation according to GOLD classification. The higher the CRP concentration, the higher was the disease severity determined according to GOLD classification (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in CRP level and leukocyte count according to comorbidities (p = 0.29). The level of CRP was higher in patients with a high CAT score and mMRC scale (p < 0.001). The same trend was observed for leukocyte count when compared with CAT results, but not when correlated to mMRC scale. The level of CRP during COPD exacerbation can be an independent predictor of the disease severity and paraclinical findings.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of pregnancy related diabetes has been steadily increasing during the past decade. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the type and prevalence of gestational diabetes complications after implementing new diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes. The incidence of gestational diabetes, maternal age, mode of delivery and birth weight were analyzed. Study patients were divided into three groups. The first group consisted of patients who gave birth during 2005, the second group during 2011 and the third group during 2012. In 2005, the World Health Organization criteria were used on diagnosing gestational diabetes, whereas in 2011 and 2012 the criteria issued by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups were considered. There was no statistically significant difference among the groups according to maternal age, birth weight (p=0.203) and mode of delivery (p=0.883). Cesarean section was performed in about 30% of deliveries in all groups combined. There was no significant difference in the number of neonatal hypertrophy (p=0.348), although the distribution of hypertrophy showed a tendency towards higher values in 2005. The incidence of gestational diabetes was 2.2% in 2005, 6.6% in 2011 and 12% in 2012. In conclusion, difference in the incidence of pregnancy related diabetes appeared to have resulted directly from using different diagnostic criteria. The new criteria contributed to a relatively higher incidence of gestational diabetes but also achieved better gestational glycemic control and consequently better fetal growth regulation.",

Data on 91 patients with symptomatic carotid disease who first underwent ultrasonography followed by DSA were evaluated. Color Doppler criteria were previously set for four categories of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis: mild, moderate, severe, and occlusion. DSA classified ICA stenosis into the same categories. Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient was calculated. Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient between ultrasound and angiography in detecting various degrees of carotid stenosis was 0.86. Ultrasonographic criteria for detection of severe ICA stenosis showed a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 98%, false positive ratio of 20%, false negative ratio of 25%, positive predictive value of 95%, negative predictive value of 85%, and accurate diagnosis of 88%. Ultrasonographic criteria for ICA occlusion showed a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 98%, false positive ratio of 10%, false negative ratio of 18%, positive predictive value of 94%, negative predictive value of 95%, and accurate diagnosis of 95%. Our combination of various ultrasonographic parameters was sensitive for detection of various degrees of carotid stenosis, with a very high specificity, thus providing highly positive predictive values for such a classification. A lower sensitivity was obtained due to the lower sensitivity of angiography in detecting minimal flow in near-occluded ICAs.",

    "abstract": "Elevated level of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) is an established parameter to help determine the need to perform prostate biopsy. The aim of the present study was to determine whether PSA density (PSAD) could better predict pathologic finding of 12-core prostate biopsy in men with PSA 4-10 ng/mL than PSA alone. Transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy was performed in 125 men with PSA within this range. The rate of cancer detection was 24%. Study results showed a significant difference in PSAD between the two patient groups with negative and positive biopsy findings (P=0.002), while difference in the measured PSA levels was not significant (P=0.091). Study results suggested that PSAD could serve as an additional parameter in predicting negative outcome of prostate biopsy, with a cut-off value of 0.15 ng/mL/mL within PSA range of 4-10 ng/mL (sensitivity 86.7% and negative predictive value 91.5%).",

The knowledge was assessed by our questionnaires based on the Centers for Disease Control general handouts. Additional information was collected to examine the prevalence and reporting practice of NSI. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistical analysis, independent-samples t-test, proportion analyses, and combined factor analyses of categorical and quantitative variables in SPSS and R. In total, 206 students participated in the survey. The overall level of HBV- and HCV-related knowledge was poor, with the mean scores of 61.90% and 51.35%, respectively. Moreover, students enrolled in the first year demonstrated significantly lower levels of knowledge in comparison with their older peers. Of all participants, 18.2% had sustained a NSI and the majority of them (78.95%) had never reported the injury. In conclusion, DMS have low levels of knowledge on important occupational pathogens and poor NSI reporting practice. Moreover, formal education in the current form has failed to significantly improve student competence and theoretical knowledge translates poorly into more conscientious injury reporting practice. We should look for a better way to increase student awareness and level of knowledge on this topic.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the IOP lowering efficacy of both cyclocryotherapy (CCT) and transscleral diode laser cyclophotocoagulation (TS-DCPC) in the management of refractory primary open-angle glaucoma. This prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial included 40 patients (40 eyes) with refractory glaucoma treated at the Eye Department, Clinical Center of Vojvodina, Novi Sad, Serbia, between January 2016 and June 2019. Twenty patients underwent CCT (group 1), while another twenty patients were treated with TS-DCPC (group 2). Each patient underwent complete eye examination on the treatment day, as well as follow-up eye examinations 7 days and 1, 6 and 12 months after the intervention, when IOP and number of anti-glaucoma drugs used were recorded. The median baseline IOP was 36.50 mm Hg (IQR, 28.75-42.00) in group 1 and 27.00 mm Hg (IQR, 22.00-35.00) in group 2. Follow-up measurements of IOP in group 1 showed the following results: 16.50 mm Hg (IQR, 7.75-20.00) (60% decrease from the baseline value), 12.00 mm Hg (IQR, 9.25-18.00) (67% decrease from the baseline value), 9.00 mm Hg (IQR, 2.00-13.75) (73% decrease from the baseline value), and 9.50 (IQR, 2.50-12.00) (75% decrease from the baseline value) after 7 days, 1, 6 and 12 months, respectively. Follow-up measurements of IOP in group 2 showed the following results: 16.00 mm Hg (IQR, 10.00-17.00) (48% decrease from the baseline value), 14.00 mm Hg (IQR, 10.00-16.00) (56% decrease from the baseline value), 14.00 mm Hg (IQR, 12.25-16.50) (43% decrease from the baseline value) and 14.00 mm Hg (IQR, 11.25-15.75) (53% decrease from the baseline value) after 7 days, 1, 6 and 12 months, respectively. The mean number of antiglaucoma drugs used decreased from 4 to 0.65±0.81 and 2.25±1.07 in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

    "abstract": "Providing in-patient nursing care inevitably involves shift work and shift patterns have been identified as an important factor in determining well-being and satisfaction among nurses. Shifts of 12 h or longer have become increasingly common for nurses in hospitals in some European countries. Longer shifts offer a potential to benefit from a compressed working week, with fewer work days and more days off-work, lower commuting costs, and increased flexibility. Most people find shift work less desirable compared to standard working hours. A cross-sectional cohort study was conducted at the Mostar University Hospital in 2019. A total of 157 subjects participated in the study, 22 (14%) of which were male (medical technicians) and 135 (86%) female (nurses). The mean age of study subjects was 33.3 years (min=20, max=54, SD=8.033). Results of this study suggested that nurses working irregular rotating shifts, with more family members to look after and more than 18 years of professional experience were affected by sleep disturbances between shifts. The study showed that shift work nurses had significantly higher levels of cortisol and prolactin compared with first-shift nurses/medical technicians. The results of this study are expected to stimulate further studies of sleep disturbances among shift nurses.",

In addition, different shapes of foramen ovale were described. The most common shape of foramen ovale on both sides was oval, followed by the round, almond and elongated shapes. Modest to strong positive correlations between all foramina and age for the whole sample and both subsamples were presented, except for the right foramen rotundum area in the male subsample, which did not show significant correlation with age.

Fractures of the posteromedial process of the talus are very rare and represent an important diagnostic problem. Difficult x-ray visualization makes these fractures often misdiagnosed as ankle sprains. Complications due to this kind of fractures can include serious consequences such as avascular osteonecrosis, tarsal tunnel syndrome, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, or chronic pain. Timely diagnosis represents an important factor in the development of these conditions. A heightened awareness in examining ankle traumas with specific patient history details is of great importance. The most common mechanism of injury includes dorsiflexion and pronation of the foot. However, in an increasing number of cases alternative mechanisms have been described, all including high-energy impacts. Our patient sustained a fracture of the posteromedial process of the talus in dorsiflexion and supination with high-energy impact due to a 3-m fall. The patient was treated with excision of the fragment six months after the injury, and 18 months after the surgery the patient returned to his normal daily activities with significantly less pain in the posteromedial part of the ankle.",

    "abstract": "Many papers have been published investigating the eff ects of intraoperative mechanical ventilation on the incidence of intra-and postoperative respiratory complications.Th e potential advantages of protective pressure over volume-controlled ventilation mode during laparoscopic surgery have yet to be proven.Th is study included 60 patients aged between 18 and 70 with ASA score 1-3, body mass index (BMI) ≤35 kg/m 2 , and without prior history of chronic respiratory diseases, who were scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia.Patients were assigned randomly to protective pressure or volume-controlled mechanical ventilation mode.Th e initial results showed no signifi cant diff erences in respiratory and hemodynamic parameters between the groups.Comparison of patients with BMI ≥25 showed signifi cantly lower peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak) at 15 (18.52 vs. 21.83cm H2O, p=0.022), 30 (18.73 vs. 21.83cm H2O, p=0.009) and 45 (18.94 vs. 22.667 cm H2O, p=0.010) minutes after tracheal intubation in the pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) group.Other measured parameters were of similar characteristics.It is concluded that PCV and volume-controlled ventilation were equally eff ective in maintaining adequate ventilation, oxygenation and hemodynamic stability in the groups of patients observed.However, comparison of obese patients revealed some advantages of PCV which, given the present pace of change, should be additionally investigated.",

    "abstract": "Results of the first research of this kind on the 23-year long-term outcome in children born during the war in Vukovar are presented.This retrospective clinical study surveyed the potential 23-year long-term consequences and morbidity of children born between May 1, 1991 and November 19, 1991, during the siege and occupation of Vukovar.Data were obtained from women having delivered their babies in that period and from delivery protocols of the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Vukovar County Hospital.According to the survey and the data collected, there were 9 (3.98%) preterm deliveries, 60 (81%) of the total of 77 subjects were breastfed, 14 (19%) were not breastfed, while three babies died in the postpartum period.However, the breastfeeding period was evidently shorter, as only 10 women breastfed for a period longer than 6 months, while the mean length of the breastfeeding period was 9.9 weeks, i.e. 2.5 months.Allergyrelated illnesses and proneness to infections in childhood and preschool age were found in 27.3% and 16.9% of children, respectively, while two children developed diabetes type 1.One child had atopic diathesis, two started speaking after the age of two, one child started walking late (after 20 months) and started speaking after the age of two, one child had loud sound phobia, and one used to overreact and express anger in inconvenient situations, all of them being of female gender and born prematurely.Cognitive and attention disorders and stress reactions were found in 6.5% of the children.Regular elementary school education was completed by 74 (96%) children, while three (3.8%)children experienced failure at school due bad behavior, i.e. delinquency.At the age of 23, 34 (46%) children had developed bad habits, i.e. 33 of them smoked, 2 were addicted to alcohol, whereas one was addicted to both smoking and alcohol.Forty (54%) subjects did not use any harmful substances.Psychiatric disorders related to anxiety, depression or other illnesses were not found in this research.In conclusion, it should be noted that pregnant women who gave birth during the study period spent the first trimester of their pregnancy in a relatively peaceful pre-war period without acute stressors, so the long-term results and morbidity actually did not differ from those in the general population.The most important isolated risk factor was premature delivery with the known short-term and long-term consequences typical for premature delivery (perinatal mortality, slow neuromotor and cognitive development).",

    "abstract": "Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is an enzyme that converts thiopurine drugs into inactive metabolites. Over 20 variant TPMT-encoding alleles, which cause reduced enzymatic activity, have been discovered so far. Our aim was to investigate the frequencies of variant alleles, i.e. genotypes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and healthy individuals and to compare these frequencies with selected world populations. The most common variant alleles TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B and TPMT*3C were analyzed with polymerase chain reaction-based assays and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction-based assays in 685 participants including 459 IBD patients and 226 healthy volunteers. Study results revealed 434/459 (94.55%) IBD patients and 213/226 (94.25%) healthy subjects to be homozygous for the wild-type allele (TPMT*1/*1). TPMT*1/*2 and TPMT *1/*3C genotypes were found in 4/459 (0.87%) and 7/459 (1.53%) IBD patients, respectively; in healthy volunteers they were not found. TPMT*1/*3A genotype was found in 14/459 (3.05%) IBD patients and 13/226 (5.75%) healthy subjects. Variant genotypes were statistically significantly more common in Crohn's disease subgroup than in ulcerative colitis subgroup. The prevalence of variant genotypes was 23/338 (6.80%) in Crohn's disease subgroup as compared with 2/121 (1.65%) in ulcerative colitis subgroup (χ2 = 4.59; p = 0.032). In conclusion, the most frequently occurring nonfunctional TPMT allele in Croatian population is TPMT*3A. The overall frequency of mutant alleles in our population is statistically nonsignificantly lower when compared with other populations of Caucasian origin. The Crohn's disease group had more mutant alleles than the ulcerative colitis group.",

    "abstract": "There are many false assumptions, both in the general population and among physicians, regarding the influence of radiation on pregnant patients and the fetus during diagnostic procedures, in spite of scientific facts based on studies. These false assumptions are mostly based on the idea that every diagnostic procedure using ionizing radiation is a cause for serious concern and that artificial abortion as a possible solution might be considered. We analyzed data from counseling of pregnant patients exposed to ionizing radiation during diagnostic procedures in the Merkur University Hospital during a 4-year period. In this period, 26 patients presented for counseling after exposure to diagnostic ionizing radiation during pregnancy. Results showed most of these patients to have been exposed to radiation between the 2nd and 3rd week of gestation (36%), between the 4th and 5th week 32%, before the 2nd week 24%, and after the 6th week of gestation less than 8%. To provide reasonable estimate of fetal doses, Report No. 174 from the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) was used. Data from the Report include estimate of the fetal dose from direct and indirect exposures. Th e mean doses were up to 0.01 cGy in 46.2%, 0.01-0.15 cGy in 19.2%, 0.2-1 cGy in 26.9% and 1 cGy or more in 7.7% of patients. None of the counseled patients had medical indication for abortion, even though in a small percentage of patients abortion was a personal subjective decision. Considering that there are no Croatian guidelines for counseling patients exposed to ionizing radiation during pregnancy, it is recommended to use the International Commission on Radiological Protection guidelines in the management of pregnant patients exposed to ionizing radiation.",

OO is commonly localized in long bones, and therefore, it is rarely considered in differential diagnosis of chronic shoulder pain. We report a case of a 22-year-old male athlete, without history of previous trauma, who presented to our Department with chronic shoulder pain, which escalated during the night and responded to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment. Considering these typical symptoms, diagnostic pathway was immediately directed towards OO, with magnetic resonance and computed tomography confirming the diagnosis of OO of the coracoid process (CP). Since neurovascular structures are in the proximity of CP, and this very delicate area does not support radiofrequency ablation, we decided to perform an open procedure with drilling of the lesion and excochleation. The pain withdrew immediately after the procedure, and on six-month follow up the patient remained pain free. In the treatment of OO of the CP, we recommend open surgical procedure with tumor ablation by drilling instead of CP resection, presenting a safe, simple and low-cost method that simultaneously completely destroys the lesion and preserves the anatomical and functional role of CP",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychological testing of patients in the course of their recovery from brain injuries enables analysis of cognitive deficiencies and/or emotional changes. The principle study objective was to define organic and/or reactive personality changes and the course of these changes in the function of the time span following brain artery aneurysm surgery in both female and male patients. The study was carried out at the Clinical Department of Neurosurgery, Zagreb University Hospital Center in Zagreb. The data refer to the period from 1989 to 2012 collected in two time intervals, i.e. 11 months and 12-48 months following brain artery aneurysm surgery. Of 72 patients included in the study, there were 28 male and 44 female patients. Neuropsychological testing consisted of clinical interview, clinical assessment of frontal lobe syndrome, Cornell personality questionnaire and Emotional Profile Index. Study results showed evidence of frontal lobe syndrome in 32% of patients on first testing and significant recovery on retesting, when only 17% of patients presented with frontal lobe syndrome. The reactive personality changes found in both testing intervals indicated increased neuroticism. In the first testing period, asthenic syndrome occurred most often, followed by conversion and aggressive-antisocial syndromes, while in the second testing interval asthenic syndrome was most pronounced and conversion and antisocial syndromes showed the same level of expression. The results also showed higher depressive and disorganizing states, which were even more pronounced in the second testing interval. As regards sex differences, the inclination toward cardiovascular somatization and destructiveness was more expressed in females than in males, showing a tendency of aggravation with increasing the time span following surgery. It may be concluded that the study has contributed to better understanding of organic and/or reactive personality changes in patients undergoing brain artery aneurysm surgery.",

This observational clinical study included 1498 ACS patients treated at UCCK ED and followed-up by phone call for one year after discharge from the hospital. According to multivariate Cox regression analysis, age (HR=2.37, 95% CI 1.67-3.52), pre-hospital emergency care (HR=3.92, 95% CI 2.35-6.54), STEMI (HR=6.17, 95% CI 3.22-15.31), diabetes mellitus (HR=3.01, 95% CI 1.98-3.78), left ventricular ejection fraction <40% (HR=17.63, 95% CI 11.2-30.54) and ex-smoking (HR=2.34, 95% CI 1.57-3.85) were significant predictors of mortality in ACS patients. In-hospital mortality of patients admitted with ACS remains high in Kosovo as compared with developed countries. A better strategy for pre-hospital emergency care in Kosovo is recommended to save lives in these high-risk patients.",

The study included 204 elderly (136 females and 68 males, age median 71, range 60-92 years), and 83 younger control subjects (63 females and 20 males, age median 45, range 19-55 years). Subjects with prior thyroid dysfunction were excluded. Serum thyrotropin (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), TPOAb, total cholesterol, height and weight were measured. Mann-Whitney, χ2-test and Student's t-test were used on statistical analysis. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH >5 mU/L) in elderly was 7.4% vs. 3.6% in younger subjects, with the highest prevalence of 8.8% in elderly women vs. 4.8% in younger women, and 4.4% in elderly men. The prevalence of hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism in elderly subjects was 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively. In women with subclinical hypothyroidism, the prevalence of TPOAb was 77% in elderly women and 67% in younger women (overall 19.9% in elderly and 14.3% in younger women). The mean FT3 level was lower in elderly women as compared with elderly men (p<0.01) and younger women (p<0.05). The mean cholesterol level was higher in elderly subjects in comparison with younger ones (p<0.01), and in elderly women vs. elderly men (p<0.01), but without difference between subclinical hypothyroidism and euthyroid subjects (6.0 mmol/L). In conclusion, subclinical hypothyroidism is the most prevalent thyroid dysfunction in elderly, with the highest prevalence in elderly women, and autoimmune thyroiditis is the most common etiology. Hypercholesterolemia was more related to older age, especially elderly females, but not influenced by subclinical hypothyroidism.",

FMV was graded as easy in 50 (80.5%),slightly difficult in 10 (16.1%) and difficult in 2 (3.2%) cases.There were 29 (46.78%)slightly difficult DLIs and one (1.6%)case of difficult DLI.The study confirmed clinically relevant incidence of difficulties with FMV and DLI in otorhinolaryngologic surgery patients.However, there should be stronger evidence to identify a single preoperative variable predicting difficult airway.",

    "abstract": "Quality of recovery after anesthesia is an important indicator of patient postoperative outcomes. Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) is a validated and widely used multidimensional 40-item questionnaire that measures postoperative quality of recovery. The aim of this study was to perform translation and psychometric validation of the Croatian version of QoR-40, which included validity, reliability, responsiveness, and clinical acceptability. The QoR-40 and Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaires were administered to patients undergoing general anesthesia for elective surgery on the day before surgery and on postoperative day 3. The quality of recovery was also assessed with visual analog scale (VAS) 0-100. Of 192 enrolled patients, 162 completed the study protocol. Convergent validity assessed by Pearson correlation (r) between the QoR-40 and VAS scores was 0.68 (p<0.001). There were moderate correlations of QoR-40 with SF-36 Physical component scale (r=0.521; p<0.001) and with SF-36 Mental component scale (r=0.580; p<0.001). Construct validity was supported by negative correlation with the length of hospital stay (r=-0.21; p=0.007) and significant difference in total postoperative QoR-40 scores between patients with and without postoperative complications (p<0.001). Internal consistency of the global QoR-40 was high (Cronbach's α=0.93) and of the QoR-40 dimensions it was moderate to high (≥0.714). Split-half coefficient was 0.87, Cohen's effect size was 0.81, and standardized response mean was 0.762. Our translated QoR-40 is a valid, reliable and comprehensive questionnaire for measuring quality of postoperative recovery across surgery spectrum in Croatian population with psychometric properties similar to the original version.",

Collecting duct carcinoma generally pursues a more aggressive course than conven-tional renal cell carcinoma. Metastases to regional lymph nodes, bone, adrenal glands, lung, skin andmeninges have been reported. During the 1998-2000 period, 161 patients underwent nephrectomydue to renal cell carcinoma at our hospital. The patients’ age ranged from 24 to 90 (mean 59.5) years.There were 50 female and 111 male patients. Collecting duct carcinoma was diagnosed in three (1.9%)male patients aged 79, 66 and 67 (mean age 71.0) years. The patients presented with hematuria as-sociated with fever, weight loss, pain and palpable abdominal mass. On gross examination, the tu-mors were located in the medulla of the kidney and extended into the cortex and adjacent adiposetissue. Histologically, the tumors showed tubulopapillary, tubular or solid areas. Immunohisto-chemically, positive staining with cytokeratin, EMA and Ulex Europaeus agglutinin was observed.All patients had regional lymph node metastases, and two of them died within one month fromsurgery. The third patient was alive and without signs of recurrence six months from presentation.Key words:",

    "abstract": "Scientists have for centuries tried to localize and define artistic talent. Modern diagnostic techniques that enable visualization and measurement of brain morphology and function are positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD) and some biochemical methods. In the majority of people, the left hemisphere is dominant, but the right hemisphere is considered to be creative, visual, imaginative and intuitive. Right hemisphere is associated with musical skills and good three-dimensional orientation. It is also associated with good coordination and athletic skills. Creative people have less marked hemispheric dominance. Using the functional (fMRI) technique, the activation of visual cortex while watching different kinds of compositions was visible; the specific pattern of cortical activation was identified for looking at the landscapes, portraits, abstract compositions or different combination of colors. For music perception, the interplay of activity on both sides of the brain is necessary. In the right side, the centers for perceiving pitch, certain aspects of melody, harmony, timbre and rhythm are placed, and in the left side the processes of rapid changes in frequency and intensity, both in music and words are taking place. Adaptation of the brain, i.e. brain plasticity can arise upon listening or performing music. It is possible to use music, painting and dancing as an aid in the treatment of somatic, neurologic or psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a common problem and a significant cause of chronic gastric inflammation. H. pylori, ongoing gastric inflammation and its severity are the most critical component of precursors of gastric cancer. Hypothetically, every chronic tissue injury activates platelets, and the mean platelet volume (MPV) reflects this action well. The potential relationship between H. pylori and platelet count has been shown before. However, there are few and conflicting papers about the relationship between MPV and H. pylori related chronic gastric inflammation and its severity. The study aimed to assess any potential relationship between MPV and presence of H. pylori, as well as the severity of chronic gastric inflammation. A total of 6890 endoscopic reports were initially evaluated, and a total of 218 dyspeptic patients having undergone upper endoscopy were included. Of these, 118 (54.2%) were H. pylori positive and 100 (45.8%) were H. pylori negative. At least four gastric biopsies were obtained and evaluated according to Sydney classification. Age, gender, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin, serum iron and C-reactive protein, as well as endoscopic findings were also recorded. A p<0.05 was accepted as significant. The MPV and platelet count did not differ between H. pylori positive and H. pylori negative groups of patients (p>0.05). There were no differences and correlation between MPV and gastric inflammation severity according to Sydney classification (p>0.05). When stratifying MPV as <9.15 fL and >9.15 fL, there was no difference between H. pylori positive and H. pylori negative groups either (p>0.05). In this study, we found no relationship between MPV and presence of H. pylori or severity of gastric inflammation. Although there are still conflicting publications on this issue, in our opinion and according to the results of this study, MPV is not a suitable marker for evaluation of gastric inflammation severity, being H. pylori either positive or negative.",

In this clinical trial, 50 children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years diagnosed with ADHD and CI received orthoptic therapy that included home-based exercises (pencil push-ups and stereograms) and office-based therapy on synoptophore. Binocular vision and NPC were measured before, during and after therapy. Study subjects showed significant improvement (p<0.05) in NPC and binocular vision after orthoptic exercises. We found statistically significant correlation between stereovision improvement (Lang I) and near point of convergence, suggesting that improvement of binocular function is possible in children with ADHD and CI. Our results showed that NPC enhancement improved stereovision in patients with ADHD. Since progress of binocular function has positive effect on near work and diminishes visual symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD and CI, it might be reasonable to suppose that orthoptic therapy helps these children improve concentration as well. Further studies are needed to determine whether it might have positive impact on attention.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether periodontal disease, oral hygiene index, i.e. bleeding on probing (BOP), full mouth plaque index (FMPI), smoking, systemic diseases, as well as implant characteristics (length and diameter) affect failure of implant-prosthodontic therapy. Data on 670 patients were retrieved in whom 1260 dental implants had been placed and followed-up for at least five to ten years. Categorical data were analyzed by the χ2-test, whereas Mann-Whitney test was used for continuous variables (age, BOP and FMPI). The values of p<0.05 were considered significant. The effect of local and systemic factors on the success of implant-prosthodontic therapy was assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Forty-five (6.7%) patients had systemic diseases, of which diabetes mellitus was most common, followed by atherosclerosis, diabetes and atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus type 1, lymphoma, and hepatitis C. One-third (33.4%) of the patients were smokers. Periodontal disease was present in 170 patients, while 500 patients were without periodontal disease. Nine implants were lost during the period of five years. There were no differences regarding the type of implant or type of connection to the prosthetic suprastructure. However, most of these patients had a periodontal disease. There were no significant differences in dental implant failure rates between smokers and non-smokers or between patients with and without systemic diseases. Furthermore, the results of this study showed that implant type (straight vs. tapered) and type of connection with prosthodontic appliance (cemented or screw retained) did not affect BOP and FMPI. In smokers, significant improvement of BOP and FMPI was noticed. Initially, smokers had a significantly worse BOP (0.0037) when compared to non-smokers; however, there were no differences regarding FMPI (p=0.4218) between the two groups. In patients with periodontal disease, improvement of BOP and FMPI was seen at 5-year follow-up and no significant differences were found when compared to patients without periodontal disease. There were no significant differences in BOP and FMPI between patients with and without diabetes at 5-year follow-up. Atherosclerosis had a significant negative effect on BOP, but not on FMPI at 5-year follow-up. It is concluded that periodontal disease had a significant impact on the implant-prosthodontic therapy.",

Data were retrospectively collected from medical records of patients actively treated at the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetology, Pulmonology and Allergology, Department of Pediatrics, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center. The t-test was used for independent samples to compare the mean levels of HbA1c before and after the inclusion of CGM. CGM was used by 81 (32.1%) of our patients with type 1 DM, of which 43 met the inclusion criteria. The mean HbA1c level 6 months before the introduction of CGM was 8.2%±1.9 and after 12 months of CGM use it was 7.4%±1.2, which was a statistically significant improvement (p=0.026). Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the greatest improvement in HbA1c level was recorded in the groups of young adults (18-25 years) and youngest children (<12 years). We confirmed the efficacy of CGM in achieving better control of type 1 DM by significantly improving HbA1c levels in a population of highly motivated patients.",

    "abstract": "Th e aim of the study was to determine the influence of RET, p27 and cyclin D1 on regional lymph node metastases in papillary microcarcinoma. The analysis included 70 patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma that underwent surgery at Split University Hospital Center between 1999 and 2001. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue by the RET, p27 and cyclin D1 antibodies. Quantification was based on the intensity and distribution of nuclear staining, dividing tumors into those that showed expression (expressors) and those that showed no expression (non-expressors). Univariate analysis using χ²-test and Fisher exact test was performed with the level of statistical significance set at p<0.05. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of metastases according to the expression or non-expression of RET mutation (χ²-test: p=0.459; Fisher exact test: p=0.672). Among 25 cases with cyclin D1 expression, 6 had metastases, whereas only 2 of 45 cases with no cyclin D expression had metastases (χ²-test: p=0.014; Fisher exact test: p=0.021), indicating that the expression of cyclin D1 is not crucial for the development of metastases in lymph nodes. In contrast, analysis of p27 expression showed it to be significantly associated with lymph node metastasis because 3 of 45 patients with p27 expression had metastases, indicating a statistically significant correlation between p27 expression and lymph node metastases (χ²-test: p=0.093; Fisher exact test: p=0.124). This study confirmed the importance of the evaluation of RET, p27 and cyclin D1 expression and demonstrated the validity of their application in the assessment of microcarcinoma behavior.",

This retrospective study included data on 374 patients with hip fracture with surgery delayed by more than 24 hours and complete blood count repeated prior to surgery after fluid resuscitation for a minimum of 24 hours. The hemoglobin level (g/L) was analyzed after admission and after rehydration. The results were compared by Student's t-test. The mean hemoglobin drop was 6.1 g/L, 12.05 g/L and 16.52 g/L for capsular, pertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures, respectively. This hemoglobin drop was statistically significant in all frac-ture types. The significant drop of preoperative hemoglobin should be taken in consideration when planning transfusion for hip fracture patients.

At the time of study enrolment, detailed medical history was obtained and all subjects underwent physical examination, chest x-ray and echocardiography. OPG levels were measured in all subjects, and serum N-terminal of the pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT pro BNP) levels were determined in patients with AS. Serum OPG levels were elevated in patients with AS compared to control subjects (p=0.001). Patients with heart failure due to AS had elevated serum OPG levels in comparison to patients without heart failure (p=0.001). A significant correlation between OPG and symptomatic status was observed in all patients with AS (p<0.001), however, it was not the case in patients without heart failure (p=0.425). There was a positive correlation between OPG and NT pro BNP concentrations with objective signs of heart failure on chest x-ray (p<0.001). Negative correlation of OPG concentrations with aortic valve area was present (p<0.040), as well as with left ventricular ejection fraction (p<0.001). Serum OPG could be a valuable biomarker in the evaluation of severity of calcified AS and serve as an additional indicator besides clinical presentation and echocardiography in the assessment of surgical treatment or aortic valve replacement.",

A retrospective chart review was conducted on 10 eyes, all younger than 11 years, with pediatric glaucoma that underwent AGV implantation for medicamentously uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) between 2010 and 2014. Outcome measures were control of IOP below 23 mm Hg (with or without antiglaucoma medications) and changes in visual acuity. Complications were recorded. After AGV implantation, IOP values ranged from 18 mm Hg to 23 mm Hg (except for one eye with postoperative hypotonia due to suprachoroid hemorrhage, where the postoperative IOP value was 4 mm Hg). The number of antiglaucoma medications was reduced, i.e. four patients had two medications, one patient had one medication, and the others did not need antiglaucoma medication on the last follow-up visit. One eye had suprachoroid hemorrhage, one eye had long-term persistent uveitic membrane, and two eyes had tube-cornea touch. In conclusion, AGV implantation appears to be a viable option for the management of refractory pediatric glaucoma and shows success in IOP control. However, there was a relatively high complication rate limiting the overall success rate.",

Forms of PUVA therapy are: systemic photochemotherapy (PUVA therapy with oral administration of psoralen); PUVA bath therapy; and PUVA therapy with topical psoralen application. PUVA therapy is more effective than UVB therapy in clearing psoriasis in most patients, but since UVB is easier to administer and does not involve an oral photosensitizing medication, it is often selected before PUVA. UVB and PUVA have been administered alone or in combination with topical corticosteroids, salicylic acid, anthralin, calcipotriol and tazarotene, and with systemic therapies such as retinoids. The most important po- tential long-term side effects of UVB and PUVA are accelerated skin aging and an increased risk of cutaneous cancer.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY ∑ Polypoid lesions of the gallbladder can be divided into benign and malignant lesions. Benign polypoid lesions of the gallbladder are divided into tumors and pseudotumors. Pseudotumors make up the majority of polypoid lesions of the gallbladder. They can occur in the form of polyps, hyperplasia or other miscellaneous lesions. Adenomas are the most common benign neoplasms of the gallbladder. Ultrasound has been demonstrated to be significantly better in detecting polypoid lesions of the gallbladder as compared with computed tomography and cholecystography. Recommendations for an optimal strategy in the management of gallbladder polyps are presented. Generally, no treatment is required in a young patient with very small gallbladder polyps, who is completely free from symptoms. In patients with unequivocal reccurrent biliary colic, elective cholecystotomy is warranted, especially in case of coexistence of stones and polyps. Cholecystectomy is also indicated in patients with gallbladder polyps greater than 10 mm, irrespective of symptomatology. In patients with gallbladder polypoid lesions smaller than 10 mm, cholecystectomy is only indicated if complicating factors are present, e.g., age ≥50 and coexistence of gallstones. If a gallbladder polyp is smaller than 10 mm and if complicating factors are absent, the “watch-and-wait” strategy seems to be recommendable.",

It is characterized by numerous signs and symptoms of pregnancy, except for confirmation of the presence of a fetus. The aim of this article is to present a patient with pseudocyesis. A 24-year-old woman, married, childless, was admitted to gynecolgoy emergency clinic for metrorrhagia, after delivery that had allegedly occurred earlier that day. Gynecologic examination showed neither pregnancy nor postpartum state, therefore consultant psychiatrist was included in patient examination. Upon interview with the patient and her family, and in agreement with gynecologists, the diagnosis of pseudocyesis (undifferentiated somatoform disorder, according to ICD 10 criteria) was made, and the patient who was acutely restless, tearful, occasionally agitated, exhibiting referential ideas, was hospitalized at psychiatry department for treatment. The need of team work of gynecologists and psychiatrists in the treatment of patients suffering from pseudocyesis is emphasized.",

Methods We retrospectively studied 36 patients treated at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Zagreb University School of Medicine, Croatia, in the period from 1978-1998. Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to examine the prognostic significance of menstrual status, clinical stage, architectural grade, nuclear grade, DNA ploidy, proliferative activity, and mode of therapy. Results The 5-year survival for this group of patients was 75%. The following parameters proved to be statistically significant in a univariate analysis: clinical stage (P=0.042), architectural grade (P=0.009), and nuclear grade (P=0.002). In the multivariate analysis, the nuclear grade (P=0.007) turned out to be the only statistically significant parameter. According to the nuclear grade, the five-year survival was 80% in the prognostically favorable and only 30% in the unfavorable group of patients. Conclusion Our data showed that in patients with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix the nuclear grade, clinical stage, and architectural grade of the tumor represent the most important prognostic parameters. The analysis of DNA ploidy and proliferative activity had no prognostic significance.",

Between January 2011 and October 2014, 349 novice runners were included. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, and data on running motivation and self-perceived health and fitness were collected. Subjects were screened for lower extremity injuries at regular three-month intervals. The cohort mean age was 35.46±7.31 years, and 271 (79.5%) were female. There were 173 (49.9%) injuries recorded, less frequently among women (42.9% vs. 62.7%, p=0.016; OR 0.878, 95% CI 0.788-0.977). The mean body mass index was 23.89±3.88 kg/m2 at baseline and 22.99±3.35 kg/m2 post-school (p<0.001). Median self-perceived fitness level on a ten-point visual analog scale was 4 (interquartile range (IQR) 3-5) at baseline and 8 (IQR 7-8) post-school (p<0.001). Median self-perceived overall health was 6 (IQR 5-8) at baseline and 8 (IQR 7-9) post-school (p<0.001). The knee had a significantly higher rate of injuries compared to other anatomic regions (p<0.001). Subjects listed improvement of fitness as the most common motivation for entering the school (n=159; 45.7%). In conclusion, novice runners should include strengthening exercises for knee injury prevention into their training routine.",

Among 230 lesions, histopathologic findings showed 34 high-risk breast lesions and 29 DCIS, which were compared with 167 ductal invasive carcinomas. High-risk lesions had lower values of all sonoelastographic features than ductal in situ and invasive carcinoma, however, only E-ratio showed a statistically significant difference in comparison to DCIS (3.7 vs. 6, p<0.001). All sonoelastographic features showed significant difference between in situ and invasive carcinoma. There was a significant correlation between lesion size and stiffness (r=0.36; p<0.001). Stiffness measured by SWE is an effective predictor of the histopathologic severity of sonographically detectable breast lesions. Elasticity values of high-risk lesions are significantly lower than those of malignant lesions. Furthermore, we showed that along with the sonographic appearance, which in most cases shows typical microcalcifications, DCIS had significantly different elasticity parameters than invasive carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "A 24-hour shift is one of the major stressors for physicians because, apart from causing fatigue and circadian rhythm disorders, it often requires making vital decisions for patients within a short time frame. It is known that workplace stress leads to the activation of the coagulation system, which can result in imbalance of the coagulation and fibrinolysis system. The state of stress can also generate proinflammatory mediators. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of 24-hour shift on global coagulation tests of D-dimers and fibrinolysis, and on C-reactive protein (CRP) as an acute inflammatory agent and proatherosclerotic factor. Sixty physicians (residents) aged 25-35 participated in this study (30 participants in the experimental group and 30 participants in the control group). In experimental group, blood samples were collected on three occasions: shortly before 24-hour shift, twelve hours after the shift had begun, and at the end of the shift. Blood samples were collected from control group participants at the same time points. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the values of D-dimer and fibrinolysis between the experimental and control groups. CRP values were statistically significantly higher in the experimental (1.57, 1.49 and 1.50) than in the control group (0.79, 0.75 and 0.84) on all three measurements (p=0.024, p=0.020 and p=0.030, respectively). These results confirmed the existence of proinflammatory changes in the endothelium of blood vessels, which is a factor associated with accelerated atherosclerosis.",

Data on 3470 women with submucosal myomas or endometrial polyps suspected on ultrasound were retrospectively analyzed. Hysteroscopy was performed in all these women in order to make a more precise diagnosis. Histologic analysis of endometrial samples obtained during hysteroscopy was used to confirm the diagnosis. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 20.0.0 software. The mean age of study women was 49.1±13.3 years. The number of procedures performed due to the referral diagnosis of endometrial or submucosal myoma significantly increased over the 16-year study period. A significantly higher number of women had a benign histopathologic diagnosis. Histologic analysis revealed malignancy in 67 women. The youngest woman and oldest woman with malignant findings was aged 32 and 75, respectively. A significantly higher number of women with atypical hyperplasia and malignancy were in menopause. A comparable number of women with different histologic findings lived in urban and rural areas. There were a significantly larger proportion of widows among women with the histologic diagnosis of atypical hyperplasia or malignancy. The prevalence rate of malignancy in women having undergone hysteroscopy for polyps and myoma found by ultrasound was 1.93%. Postmenopausal status and older age were associated with an increased risk of malignancies, but premalignant changes and malignancies were also found in young and premenopausal women. Therefore, diagnostic hysteroscopy can be recommended in women of all age groups.",

Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria are a serious threat to public health. This study aimed to compare data on inpatient antibiotic consumption with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli invasive strains in Montenegro and provide targets for improving antibiotic use. We used the national data on antibiotic consumption from 2009 to 2015, Point Prevalence Survey data on inpatient antibiotic consumption from 2015, and national AMR data on 79 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 68 Escherichia coli isolates collected from 8 hospitals from 2016 to 2018. The most commonly used antibiotics were third-generation cephalosporins with a median annual consumption of 0.66 DDD/1000/day. Ceftriaxone was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic in the treatment of community/hospital acquired infections and surgical/medical prophylaxis. The highest resistance rates were recorded for Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and gentamicin (93.59%, 90.79% and 89.87%, respectively), and Escherichia coli to aminopenicillins, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime (89.06%, 70.15% and 61.54%, respectively). High consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics in Montenegro is accompanied by the high rate of resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli to these agents. Antibiotic misuse demands the introduction of an antimicrobial stewardship program in Montenegrin hospitals.",

Nineteen patients were included in the randomized observational study, divided into two groups: group A (intervention) and B (control). Preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation was performed in group A, and only postoperative rehabilitation in group B. Rehabilitation was carried out according to a predefined protocol. We used ABG to evaluate respiratory function, two-minute walk test (2MWT) and sit-to-stand test to assess functional capacity. The following data were obtained from medical documentation: duration of MV, length of stay at ICU, occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications, and length of total hospitalization in both groups. Significant between-group difference was found for the length of total hospitalization and duration of MV (p<0.05 both). Analysis of the mean values of 2MWT on the last day of hospitalization (p=0.005), sit-to-stand test before surgery (p=0.022) and on the last day of hospitalization (p=0.008) showed statistically significant differences. The length of hospital stay significantly correlated with preoperative rehabilitation in group A (r=0.885; p<0.0001). There was no difference in ABG parameters between the groups. The study showed that preoperative respiratory rehabilitation had an effect on reducing duration of MV and length of total hospitalization, and improved functional capacity.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancies burdened with gestational diabetes (GDM) are more likely to end in birth of a macrosomic child, where the frequency of operative termination of pregnancy is more common, accompanied with more complications and injuries of both mother and child in comparison to the general population. The need to calculate fetal weight right before delivery has led to the development of numerous methods for greater estimation accuracy. We reviewed the related literature from 1980 to 2020, using the terms macrosomia, ultrasound assessment, gestational diabetes, and relevant articles were considered in preparation of this article. The most frequently used methods are based on two-dimensional ultrasound measurements of individual fetal biometric parameters and their combination in a mathematical regression model. Some methods involve the addition of other mother and child conditions to increase reliability of the method in recognizing macrosomia. In daily work, especially with pregnant women suffering from GDM, it is necessary to have reliable data on the estimated fetal weight before making the correct clinical decision on how to terminate the pregnancy. In this regard, we bring a review of the literature related to the assessment of fetal macrosomia, especially in women with GDM.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional printed polyetheretherketone (PEEK) extravascular stent was applied to treat a 14-year-old boy with nutcracker syndrome. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a segment of the left renal vein (LRV) with reduced contrast filling immediately before its inflow into the inferior vena cava, and high-pressure gradient. The three-dimensional reconstruction model demonstrated that the LRV and the duodenum were contracted at the aortomesenteric angle, resulting in LRV compression from the abnormal high-level duodenal compartment. When duodenum courses between the abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery (duodenal interposition), the LRV entrapment occurs even at <90 aortomesenteric degrees. Three-dimensional printed PEEK extravascular stent was chosen to elevate the superior mesenteric artery and lower the duodenum position, thus relieving LRV compression. This extravascular application has significant advantages over open surgery, endovascular stenting and artificial vessel procedures with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. It provides better cellular vitality by ensuring soft tissue proliferation. By reducing external acceleration and centrifugal force, a three-dimensional printed PEEK extravascular stent reduces adverse side effects. Such a stent has a distinctive personalized design, good stiffness, and durability that allows blood vessel growth, preventing stent migration and thrombosis. Therefore, it is suitable for both adult and pediatric patients. According to the abdominal ultrasound and multi-slice computed tomography scan, the postoperative follow-up results were satisfactory one year after surgery. The patient felt well, the blood flow in the LRV was not obstructed, and the blood flow velocity was average. The external stent was in place.",

A random sample of 2193 farmers (1333 female (F) and 860 male (M), mean age 50.61±17.12) were enrolled. Questionnaire and clinical examination were conducted. Participants provided a spot urine and fasting blood sample. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Subjects were classified according to the KDIGO guidelines. The overall prevalence of CKD (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) was 8.83% (F vs. M 9.9% vs. 6.3%; p<0.001). Albuminuria (albumin-to-creatinine ratio >30 mg/g) was found in 8.45% (F vs. M p>0.05). Sharp increase in CKD prevalence was found to begin after the sixth decade (29.44% in subjects older than 65 years; F vs. M 30.9% vs. 26.8%; p<0.01). The strongest predictor factors for CKD were age >65 years (OR 22.12), hypertension (OR 6.53), albuminuria (OR 5.71), fasting blood glucose >7 mmol/L (OR 5.49), diabetes (OR 3.07), abdominal obesity (OR 2.05) and non-smoking (OR 0.41). In multivariate analysis, age (OR 1.13), female gender (OR 0.60) and diabetes (OR 1.75) were the independent predictor factors for CKD. In conclusion, CKD prevalence is high in rural population, being higher in women than in men. In both genders, eGFR significantly decreased with aging. Aging is a significant independent predictor of CKD.",

    "abstract": "The municipality of Bogatić, part of Mačva District, belongs to the Pannonian Basin, where high concentrations of arsenic in artesian wells were detected. Numerous epidemiological studies have confirmed the association of exposure to arsenic in drinking water and bladder cancer (C67). This retrospective ten-year analysis included age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) and age-specific incidence rates of C67 in the municipality of Bogatić and rural municipalities of Mačva District. The concentration of arsenic in drinking water was determined at Šabac Public Health Institute (PHI) laboratories in 2015. ASRs were estimated using data from regional cancer registries at Šabac PHI and compared by use of the Mann-Whitney U test. Control population was recruited from an area where there were no artesian wells or hydrogeological conditions that would indicate elevated concentrations of arsenic in drinking water. Arsenic levels in all artesian wells in Bogatić municipality were 1.4 to 41 times higher than the maximum permissible concentration (mean 120 µg/L±165). Female subjects from Bogatić municipality had higher ASRs of C67 compared with the populations in rural municipalities of Mačva District (p<0.01), while the incidence of bladder cancer was by 13% greater than that in central Serbia (standardized incidence ratio, 113; 95% CI 96.97-131.35). Male subjects from Bogatić municipality had higher ASRs of C67 but the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). Our analyses suggested that exposure to arsenic in drinking water could triple the risk of bladder cancer. These results support the conclusions of previous studies that there may be an association between higher concentrations of arsenic in drinking water and higher ASRs of bladder cancer in both male and female subjects.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery ectasia or aneurysms are dilatation of an arterial segment to a diameter at least 1.5 times that of the adjacent normal. Blood flow through such arteries is disturbed and turbulent, which, with the activation of endothelium, leads to chronic thrombosis in the blood vessel wall. Percutaneous coronary interventions in ectatic / aneurysmal vessels carry a high risk of complications, primarily a \"no-reflow\" phenomenon. No-reflow is common in patients with acute coronary syndrome, especially ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In this article, we present the occurrence of the no-reflow phenomenon in a stable patient undergoing percutaneous intervention due to a significant stenosis of the aneurysmally altered right coronary artery. Despite the rapid placement and optimization of stents and the applied drug therapy combined with thromboaspiration periprocedurally, it was not possible to establish TIMI 3 flow. However, after the initial failure and development of periprocedural STEMI, the patient was successfully stabilized with unexpectedly good recovery of infarcted myocardial function. Control coronarography 6 weeks after the initial event confirmed a proper stent patency with normal TIMI 3 flow.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to compare the efficiency of large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) and cold-knife conization according to the incidence of positive cone margins in histopathologic analysis of the cervical cone. In the study, data obtained from 568 female patients with cone biopsy due to cervical changes during a four-year period (2012-2015) were retrospectively analyzed. Group 1 included patients who were operated on using LLETZ technique and group 2 consisted of patients with cold-knife cone biopsy. LLETZ was a method of choice in 334 (59%) patients, whereas 234 (41%) patients underwent cold-knife cone biopsy. The percentage of positive cone margins was much higher with LLETZ technique, even 39% (131 patients), as compared to 20% with cold-knife cone biopsy. In conclusion, the technique and cone configuration should be individualized, depending on the specifics of the lesion. The transformation zone is not always removed during one LLETZ procedure. High percentage of positive cone margins is not a disadvantage of LLETZ technique because of differences in indications, approach and multiple cutting. The real success of conization can be measured only by the relapse frequency over a long period of time with a high number of patients.",

Four specific monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP are available for prevention of episodic and chronic migraine in adults with at least four migraine days per month. The aim of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the use of monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP in migraine prevention in Croatia. The questions were formulated using the Patients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) criteria, with evidence-based answers. To assess the quality of scientific evidence, a review of the literature available in PubMed was performed. Relevant studies were reviewed by the Expert Group of the Headache Section of the Croatian Neurological Society, and served as the basis for formulating the recommendations outlined in these guidelines. We found high quality evidence for good safety and efficacy of anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies in the preventive treatment of episodic and chronic migraine. These medications may be considered as first-line prophylactic therapy depending on the patient's history, concomitant diseases, and disease burden. Further real-world studies are needed to elucidate other aspects of their application.",

Major improvements in the results of management of this injury awaited the development of advanced techniques. The introduction of AO implants and AO principles has markedly improved functional results for the patient, depending on the degree of soft tissue injury. Presentation is made of a ten-year follow-up of forearm fractures operatively treated at the Department of Surgery, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital in Zagreb. The follow-up included 354 forearm fractures in 331 patients. Complete forearm shaft fractures were recorded in 121 (34%), fracture of the ulna alone in 130 (37%) and of the radius alone in 102 (29%) patients. Compound fractures occurred in 67 (19%) patients. All patients underwent operative treatment. Compound fracture was the indication for early operation in 85 (24%) patients. Internal fixation was performed by use of a narrow dynamic compression plate (DCP), mostly small DCP, and occasionally semitubular plate. Second and third degree open fractures were treated with external fixation. Postoperative plaster immobilization was employed in 39 patients for three to four weeks. Complications included infection (2.8%), nonunion (3.9%), refracture (1.4%), and synostosis (2.8%). Results of surgical treatment were considered excellent in 62%, good in 16%, satisfactory in 12%, and poor in 10% of patients.",

The aim of this study was to introduce the method of induced sputum in our clinical practice and to get an insight into airway inflammation by examining cell count differences in 15 asthmatic patients, 30 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and 15 healthy controls. Gradually increas- ing concentrations (3%, 4%, 5%) of hypertonic saline were inhaled. Subjects were encouraged to cough in order to expectorate. The quality of the sample was scored on the volume of the plugs (considered to represent lower respiratory tract secretion) and salivary contamination (proportion of squamous cells in the slides). A sample score ≥4 was considered adequate, 3 intermediate, and ≤2 inadequate. Cytologic sputum analysis was done after microscopic selection of the plugs. The results showed that inhalation of hypertonic saline is a safe method to get adequate sample for investigating various inflamatory mechanisms in lower airways. There were differences in sputum from three groups of subjects, i.e. a higher proportion of neutrophils in COPD (32%) in comparison to asthmatics (15%) and healthy controls (10%). The percentage of alveolar macrophages also differed (COPD 56.5%, asthmatics 46%, healthy 40%). Asthmatic patients had a higher proportion of eosinophils (asthmat- ics 18.5%, COPD 1.9%, healthy 0.06%) and metachromatic cells (asthmatics 0.3%, COPD 0.039%, healthy 0.014%).",

The most common precipitantsof NPE are epileptic seizures, head injury, and subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage. Since the mostcommon neurologic events are associated with increased intracranial pressure, intracranial hypertension isconsidered to be a key etiologic factor. Various theories regarding the pathogenesis of NPE have beenfocused on the potential roles for the hypothalamus, the medulla, elevated intracranial pressure, and activa-tion of the sympathoadrenal system. A distinctive form of myocardial injury, contraction band necrosis, isthe likely pathologic substrate of cardiac injury. NPE characteristically presents within minutes to hours ofa severe central nervous system insult. Resolution of NPE usually occurs within several days. Dyspnea isthe most common NPE associated symptom, and mild hemoptysis is also present in many patients. Defin-itive diagnosis of NPE is difficult because of the nonspecific nature of the clinical signs and routine diagnos-tic tests. The outcome of patients with NPE is usually determined by the course of the neurologic insultthat has produced NPE, and specific treatment should focus on the underlying disorder. NPE is generallymanaged in a supportive and conservative fashion because many cases of NPE are well tolerated and themajority of them resolve within 48 to 72 hours.Key words: Lung Œ physiopathology; Lung diseases Œ physiopathology; Pulmonary edema Œ physiopathology;Pulmonary edema Œ etiology; Pulmonary edema Œ diagnosis; Brain diseases Œ complications",

Implicit delaying of nursing care is an intermediate step, linking nurses with the quality of outcomes for patients and nurses, and it is the result of prioritization of health care measures within the assigned group of patients cared for by nurses. The Perceived Implicit Rationing of Nursing Care instrument is a tool used to assess the rationing of care in nursing practice. Study participants were nurses working at hospital wards in 4 university hospitals in the Republic of Croatia. The questionnaire was filled-in by 438 nurses. Data were collected between April and November 2018. After principal axis factoring, a single factor solution based on the correlation matrix was adopted. The measured construct is one-dimensional, and the extracted factor explains 47.2% of its variance. Additionally, the reliability of the whole questionnaire was determined by using the internal consistency coefficient Cronbach alpha on the Perceived Implicit Rationing of Nursing Care with 31 of 0.96 particles, which is extremely high internal consistency reliability. In conclusion, the study found a high level of reliability and validity of the translated Perceived Implicit Rationing of Nursing Care questionnaire, fully comparable to that of the original.

The predominant type of germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage in the intrauterine growth restriction group was hemorrhage grade 1. Germinal matrixintraventricular hemorrhage was more often present in the intrauterine growth restricted neonates than in the control group.",

    "abstract": "Strabismus is a common disorder in which eyes are not aligned with their optical axis, resulting in an abnormal binocular interaction, thus leading to amblyopia. Accordingly, early detection and diagnosis are mandatory. Despite technology development and constant knowledge growth, the foundations of physiology and the diagnosis of strabismus were set back in the 19th or early 20th century and have not changed since. In this paper, a novel, properly tested and evaluated eye-tracking based method for manifest strabismus diagnosis is presented. The evaluation showed the aforementioned method to have both high sensitivity and specificity in detecting manifest strabismus without the need for a skilled examiner, thus being suitable for population screening and highlighting the need for future research regarding testing of latent strabismus.",

    "abstract": "Within social sciences, the standards of beauty were for a long time considered to be culturally determined, meaning that different people with different life experiences in different cultures acquire different standards of beauty, as captured in the famous sentence \"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder\". However, two groups of findings have challenged this common assumption: first, people in different cultures generally agree on which faces are attractive; second, preferences emerge early in life, before cultural standards of beauty are likely to be assimilated. Evolutionary psychology explores the psychological adaptations (evolved psychological mechanisms constructed by natural selection) that constitute human nature. From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, beauty is not a cultural construct and appreciating beauty is not learned but is rather a biological adaptation, a part of universal human nature: the preferences for some physical characteristics reflect adaptations for mate choice because they signal aspects of mate quality. Theory of natural selection explains the adaptations, which help organisms in their tasks of survival. However, an organism can be adapted and survive for many years without passing its qualities to future generations--to pass them it must reproduce. The theory of sexual selection explains the adaptations that have arisen as a consequence of successful mating. In order to gain reproductive success, women and men adopt certain mate selection strategies--integrated sets of adaptations, not necessarily conscious, which organize and guide the individual's reproductive efforts.",

However, very little is currently known about possible OL cell cycle disturbances in schizophrenia, a phenomenon which has been described for the birth of new hippocampal neurons in schizophrenics. When morphometrically analyzing the density of prohibitinexpressing OLs in diff erent prefrontal white matter areas of patients with schizophrenia, we found a signifi cantly increased density of this OL subpopulation in the anterior cingulate cortex. Prohibitin is a mitochondrial protein, which is expressed both in neurons and OLs. Among many other functions, this protein plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis by regulating the GTPase OPA1. Hence, out data might be taken as possible hint for disease-related cell cycle abnormalities.",

Patients that underwent carotid endarterectomy (CES) are at a higher risk of progression of contralateral carotid stenosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the management and natural history of the contralateral internal carotid artery disease in patients with internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO). During one year, 297 patients with ICAO were investigated. Follow up examinations were retrospectively analyzed and patients were divided into groups according to contralateral carotid disease. Out of 297 patients, only one investigation was performed in 90 patients with carotid occlusion. Thirty three patients were followed up due to postoperative ICAO. In 14 patients, ICAO developed during ultrasonographic follow up. In this group of patients, 9 had unchanged contralateral findings, whereas in 5 patients disease progression was observed. Out of 44 patients with ICAO and contralateral subtotal stenosis at initial investigation, 42 underwent carotid surgery. Postoperatively, 32 patients had normal findings, 6 developed mild carotid stenosis, 2 developed moderate carotid stenosis, and 2 had postoperative carotid occlusion. Two patients were followed-up without intervention. Nine patients with bilateral ICAO were followed-up for years. Follow up was continued in 106 patients with ICAO and contralateral mild to moderate changes. The finding was unchanged in 68 patients. In 21 (30%) patients the disease progressed to subtotal stenosis and 18 patients underwent carotid surgery. Accordingly, contralateral carotid disease progression was observed in one third of patients with carotid occlusion. Additional studies on the issue are needed.",

Health tourism is a service industry and therefore labor-intensive industry in which human resources are one of the key factors of business success. The aim of this study was to analyze business performance of special hospitals for medical rehabilitation and health resorts in Croatia in relation to the structure of employees, specifically the number of physicians and total medical personnel, as well as the share of physicians and medical personnel in the total number of employees. The assumption was that those who employ more physicians and medical employees are more successful. The empirical research was conducted and the assumption was tested firstly by correlation analysis and afterwards by regression analysis. The total number of employees in the researched health resorts and special hospitals amounted to 2,863, of which the share of physicians specialists accounted for almost 7%, while the share of total medical staff was almost 53%. From the results of our research, it can be concluded that special hospitals for medical rehabilitation and health resorts, which employ more physicians and medical personnel, are achieving better financial business performance. Based on the results obtained, it is possible to provide guidance for further growth and development in the direction of basing the primary offer on medical-health offer, rather than on wellness offer, which is a strong trend in the world. These findings are important for planning the health and tourism policies in Croatia and similar countries.",

All patients underwent clinical and biological examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to the same protocol. Patients with complicated VO were significantly older (p = 0.038). They were longer treated with antibiotics parenterally (p = 0.047) and more often surgically (p < 0.001). In these patients, high Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score was more often observed (p = 0.024), as well as liver cirrhosis (p = 0.013) and degenerative spine disease (p = 0.007) as comorbidities. Patients with advanced MRI changes of VO had a modified CCI score of 2 or more (p = 0.006). They more often experienced neurological deficit (p = 0.021). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated bacterium from blood and tissue samples. Advanced MRI changes and complicated VO were more often observed in patients with high CCI score due to impaired immune system caused by chronic comorbid disease(s) or modulation of immunity with medications. High CCI scores were more frequently associated with positive blood cultures due to bacteremia because of impaired immunity. Patients with complicated VO were longer treated with antibiotics parenterally and more often surgically treated for phlegmon and abscess formation. Liver cirrhosis and degenerative spine disease, which were more often found in patients with complicated VO, obviously impacted the course of the disease.",

The inability to ventilate and oxygenate is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality associated with general anesthesia for cesarean section. The aim of this paper is to present and analyze modern guidelines and algorithms for the management of difficult airway in obstetrics as an important segment of anesthesiology practice. Modern difficult airway management guidelines for pregnant women describe the procedure of difficult facemask ventilation, difficult airway management by using supraglottic devices, difficult endotracheal intubation, and emergency cricothyrotomy or tracheotomy in a situation where oxygenation and ventilation are impossible. Algorithms describe the procedures and equipment for each variant of difficult airway and decision-making strategies in situations when neither airway nor adequate oxygenation can be provided. Croatian anesthesiologists in most obstetric departments have appropriate equipment, as well as necessary experience in difficult airway management for pregnant women, and modern algorithms from the most developed countries can be adopted and accommodated to our daily practice, as well as incorporated into the training curricula of residents.",

Persistent nociceptive pain is a risk factor for nociplastic pain, which can often occur in isolation or combination with other types of pain, most often in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain (osteoarthritis, lumbar and cervical syndrome, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, complex regional pain syndrome, tendinopathy, etc.). Diagnosis of central sensitization is established through clinical examination, questionnaires and quantitative sensory testing (QST), which serves to assess and quantify sensory functions, i.e., determine the threshold for detection of sensory stimuli (heat-cold, pressure, vibration). Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) testing is important for clarifying pain modulation profiles, which can be pro-nociceptive (less effective CPM facilitation) and anti-nociceptive (effective, inhibitory CPM effect). In the pronociceptive modulation profile that is common in patients with musculoskeletal disorders, there is a higher risk of developing chronic pain, a higher prevalence of pain conditions and higher pain associated with injury. CPM testing is also important in the individualization of drug therapy for pain, based on predicting the effectiveness of drugs in the treatment.",

Postoperative pain management is in central focus when planning postoperative treatment and is becoming the standard of care after surgical protocols - Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS). There are various serious complications associated with poorly controlled postoperative pain in adult surgical patients - cardiopulmonary complications, unplanned hospital admission, prolonged hospital stays, development of chronic pain, opioid side effects, opioid hyperalgesia and addiction. Studies have identified activation and sensitization of peripheral nociceptors and spinal dorsal horn neurons after surgical incision, and their specific mechanisms have been investigated. Basic scientific data and many clinical investigations suggest that different pain states result depending on the type and location of the incision, and that additional surgical procedures cause pain states of various severities in other sites. Supported by basic science, these observations have led to the development of the concept of procedure-specific postoperative pain management. The main value and novelty of procedure-specific postoperative pain management guidelines are that the guidelines are evidence-based, consider relevant patient characteristics, the role of anesthetic and surgical techniques, the balance between the invasiveness of the analgesic technique and the intensity of postoperative pain, as well as balance between analgesic efficacy and adverse event profile of the analgesic medications and procedures. In this review, the authors discuss the preventive and multimodal strategies of acute pain therapy, the pharmacotherapy of multimodal analgesia and local and regional techniques for specific surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "Intracranial tumors are the second most common malignancy of childhood, immediately following leukemia1. The overall (population) incidence of intracranial neoplasms varies between 1:20,000 and 1:100,000 in different series. These tumors may be slightly less common in adolescents than in younger children2. Primary brain tumors are the most common solid tumors that occur in chlidhood. The clinical symptomatology of intracranial tumors is often atypical, with only minor clinical symptoms that may not be different from those in common benign illnesses of children. Therefore, the possibility of a brain neoplasm should always be borne in mind, even if it materializes only rarely. The symptoms and signs differ with the location of the tumor and, to a certain extent, its histologic nature, these two factors being related. It is also essential to realize that the clinical significance of pathologic grading may be different from its biological value. A benign tumor that is strategically located so as to be impossible to remove without interfering with the essential neural function is malignant for the patient even if histologically benign. Generally, supratentorial tumors account for about half the cases. The location varies with age. In infants, there is a predominance of supratentorial tumors, and in children older than 4 years of infratentorial tumors. The reasons for the changing age distribution of supraand infratentorial tumors are poorly understood3. Most tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) occur in children without personal or familial predisposing conditions. Signs of intracranial hypertension are: headache, vomiting, papilloedema, and diplopia. Headache may be severe and relieved by vomiting. More often it is mild, but persistent, especially if it occurs in the morning, and must always attract the physician’s attention. Vomiting is one of the most constant signs of intracranial hypertension. It is usually but not always associated with headaches. Vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure is usually unremarkable except for its repetition and frequent morning reccurrence1,4. Papilloedema makes an intracranial mass highly probable, but it is absent in more than half the children with brain tumors. So, its absence does not exclude the possiNEUROLOGIC SYMPTOMS AS FIRST SIGNS OF BRAIN TUMOR IN CHILDREN",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY ∑ The development of atrial pacing for prevention of drug refractory atrial fibrillation was a logical step in the management of this arrhythmia. The electrophysiologic rationale for the efficacy of atrial pacing is based on the reduction of global and local atrial activation times during pacing, which results in reduced dispersion of atrial refractoriness and decreased interatrial conduction delay. However, the atrial pacing strategy should be considered in different populations with atrial fibrillation. To date, there is increasing evidence that single site atrial pacing is beneficial for atrial fibrillation prevention in patients with sick sinus syndrome. Both dual-site right atrial and interatrial septal pacing have an incremental benefit as compared with single-site right atrial pacing, and can be used in selected patients with resistant symptomatic atrial fibrillation, especially if they have prolonged interatrial conduction. The efficacy of biatrial pacing is still unproven, and technically is associated with frequent coronary sinus lead dislodgment. Further studies with multi-site atrial pacing and new algorithms for atrial fibrillation prevention are needed, possibly in combination with antiarrhythmic drug therapy or ablation, which should expand the use of atrial stimulation in the treatment of symptomatic atrial fibrillation.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n Keloids and hypertrophic scars are the consequence of excessive collagen deposition during the process of wound healing. The increasing number of operations and injuries, the widely accepted culture of piercing, and higher cosmetic criteria have led to a greater interest in the methods of their treatment. Due to the lack of an appropriate animal model, the respective research is based solely on clinical experience. A great number of therapeutic options indicates that no ideal therapy has yet been found. Use of multiple modalities is often necessary to treat the lesions successfully. The molecular, biochemical and clinical features of keloids and hypertrophic scars as well as treatment modalities are discussed.",

Visual acuity was of 'counting fingers at 2 meters' on the right eye due to keratoconus and 'counting fingers at 1 meter' on the left eye as a consequence of trauma. The Octopus visual field showed diffuse re-duction in retinal sensitivity and the Ishihara color test indicated dysfunction of color perception on the left eye. Relative afferent pupillary defect was also present. Computed tomography revealed multifragmentary fracture of the frontal sinus and the roof of the left orbit without bone displacement. Based on the findings, conservative corticosteroid therapy without surgery was conducted. The patient responded well to treatment with complete ophthalmologic recovery.",

The connection between ZACD incidence, age, left/right temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and comorbidity with diagnosis of TMJ disorder was analyzed. Panoramic radiographs and MRIs of 140 TMJs of 70 consecutive patients with previously confirmed TMJ diagnosis were compared in the study. A grading system (4-point scale from '0' for absence to '3' for most extended pneumatization) was used to determine low signal on MRIs as pneumatization of temporal bone. ZACD was diagnosed in 22 joints of 15 patients (incidence, 20.4%), with seven patients having bilateral appearance. In the joints of nine patients, ZACD was identified as extensive accord-ing to the grading scale. The validity of ZACD findings on panoramic radiographs compared with MRI findings yielded 0.45 sensitivity and 0.98 specificity. There was no relation (p>0.05) between comorbidity of ZACD and TMJ disorder, either by age or side of the body. More prevalent ZACD in our MRI analysis than in other researches based on panoramic radiographs could be explained by the expected superimposed osseous structures in the area of articular eminence.",

The study was conducted in a tertiary high-volume thyroid center, in pediatric patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who were consecutively treated during the 1965-2015 period. A total of 45 patients aged ≤18 years having undergone total thyroidectomy with or without selective neck dissection were included in the study. Decision on postoperative I-131 ablation was based on tumor characteristics, postoperative thyroglobulin level, preablative whole body scintigraphy, and/or neck ultrasound. Median age at diagnosis was 15 years. The presence of cervical lymph node metastases was significantly associated with papillary thyroid cancer, larger tumor size, involvement of two thyroid lobes, and multifocal disease. The presence of distant metastases was significantly associated with larger tumor size. None of the patients died during follow-up period, and the 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates were 100%. The 5-year and 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 87% and 73%, respectively. Male gender (p=0.046), age ≤15 years (p=0.029) and tumor size >15 mm (p=0.042) were significantly associated with inferior PFS. A significant positive trend of increase in the number of newly diagnosed patients was observed over time (p=0.011). Clinical management of pediatric thyroid cancer is challenging, especially in the light of increasing incidence in this population. Male patients younger than 15 years and with tumors of more than 15 mm in size require additional caution due to lower PFS observed.",

Patients were classified into three groups according to type of hypertrophy (concentric, eccentric and asymmetric) and into three subgroups according to the degree of hypertrophy (mild, moderate and severe). All patients had their blood pressure measured, and they underwent electrocardiography and echocardiography. Antihypertensive drugs and the duration of previous treatments were taken into consideration. Pulse pressure was significantly higher in patients with concentric LVH than in those with eccentric and asymmetric LVH (p=0.029), the values of which did not differ statistically. It rose with LVH degree (not significantly, p=0.217). There were no significant differences in systolic pressure among study groups (p=0.177).

    "abstract": "The use of lasers for treatment of oral leukoplakia has gained a lot of interest in the past years, however, data on the use of Er:YAG laser are scarce. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of Er:YAG laser and 1% topical isotretinoin in the treatment of 27 oral leukoplakia patients. Er:YAG laser (LightWalker AT, Fotona, Slovenia) was used in 27 patients with 27 leukoplakia lesions. Postoperative pain was assessed by use of visual analog scale (VAS), and the impact of laser treatment on the quality of life was assessed by the OHIP-14 questionnaire (Croatian version). Control group consisted of the same 27 patients previously treated with 1% topical isotretionin three times a day during the period of one year. No improvement in the size of leukoplakia lesions was observed after treatment with topical isotretinoin. There were significant differences between men and women according to leukoplakia localization, number of laser sessions and VAS (p<0.05). At follow-up after six months and one year, there was no recurrence of lesions. Er:YAG laser is a successful treatment for oral leukoplakia. Topical isotretionin treatment is unsuccessful in patients with oral leukoplakia.",

Collected data included gestational age, birth weight, sex, weekly weight measurements and fundus examination records. Results showed the cut-off values of gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW) used in Croatia to be appropriate and postnatal weight gain in the first 28 days could be used as an additional criterion on screening in the following way: net weight gain in the first 28 days of ≤932 g for prediction of any form of ROP and of ≤660 g for prediction of severe ROP should be added to the existing criteria of GA (≤32 weeks) and/or BW (≤1500 g). Infants with a non-physiological postnatal weight gain are exception. This is the first Croatian study to propose postnatal weight gain as an additional criterion on ROP screening and requires further validation on a larger sample of Croatian infants.",

Cross-section of the temporary cavity was measured as a function of distance from the missile entry point. The missile track was found to be unpredictable, with deviations to the left, right, up and down. The missiles were unstable regarding precession. Study results showed the temporary cavity to be relatively narrow and regular in the first 10 cm from the missile entry point, becoming much larger and more irregular along the missile track. The largest tissue disruption was found between 150 and 200 mm of the missile path. The missiles were not found to deform or fragment. On the basis of the images obtained, it would be possible to calculate the volume of temporary cavity, which is one of the most significant indicators of tissue disrupting potential of particular missile types.",

    "abstract": "To date, there are no reliable endoscopic criteria to discriminate a diminutive (<5 mm) colorectal adenomatous from nonadenomatous polyps. Studies have demonstrated the usefulness of high-resolution chromoendoscopy (high-resolution colonoscopy with topically applied indigo carmine dye) in discrimination of adenomatous from nonadenomatous colorectal polyps. However, the clinical utility of standard videocolonoscopy and chromoscopy with indigo carmine dye in differentiating diminutive colorectal polyps has not yet been completely defined. The aim of this study was to determine whether a combination of standard videocolonoscopy and staining with indigo carmine dye could differentiate between adenomatous and nonadenomatous colorectal polyps smaller than 5 mm. Colonoscopy by use of an Olympus EVIS 140 video system was performed in 42 patients in whom colorectal polyps smaller than 5 mm were found. Polyps were sprayed with up to 40 ml of 0.5% indigo carmine dye, and polypectomy was performed, and the material was referred for histology. In 42 patients included in the study, 48 polyps sized <5 mm were detected. Histologic analysis showed 14 of them to be adenomatous and 34 nonadenomatous polyps. Endoscopist’s diagnosis was confirmed by histology in 12 of 14 (85.7%) adenomatous and 31 of 34 (91.2%) nonadenomatous colorectal diminutive polyps. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of standard videochromocolonoscopy in distinguishing between adenomatous and nonadenomatous polyps sized <5 mm were 85.7%, 91.2%, 80% and 93.9%, respectively. The likelihood ratios (LR) were 0.157 (LR-) and 9.74 (LR+). In conclusion, standard videocolonoscopy combined with indigo carmine dye is a reliable method to differentiate adenomatous from nonadenomatous colorectal polyps sized <5 mm. Such a technique could limit the requests for unnecessary biopsies and repeat colonoscopy, thus significantly reducing the cost of colorectal cancer screening.",

The aim of the study was to assess the possibility of TCS to differentiate PD from other movement disorders by the measurement of NS. TCS was performed in 28 PD patients, 10 patients with movement disorders different from PD (4 with essential tremor, 2 with neuroleptic parkinsonism, 4 with cervical dystonia) and 18 age-matched healthy controls. Fifteen patients were excluded due to inappropriate temporal acoustic bone window. TCS was applied by standardized protocol; NS was displayed, encircled, and measured twice, and mean area was calculated. Mann Whitney U-test was used for between-group comparison. TCS was possible to perform in 56 of 71 (79%) subjects. NS was undetectable or barely detectable in 9 (50%) healthy controls and 2 (20%) patients with movement disorders. Median NS size in controls was 0.17 (0.16-0.21) cm 2 . A 0.21 cm 2 cut-off margin was used for detection of hyperechogenicity. Combined hyperechogenic NS was detected in 25 (89%) PD patients, 2 (20%) patients with movement disorders, and 3 (16%) healthy individuals. Study results showed a statistically significant difference in NS echogenic size between PD patients and control group (Mann Whitney u=42; p<0.001) as well as between patients with movement disorder and PD group (Mann Whitney u=23.5; p<0.001) but no significant difference between controls and patients with movement disorders (Mann Whitney u=83.0; p=0.737). Thus, assuming appropriate temporal ibone-windowi, the measurement of NS by use of TCS is a valuable tool in differentiating PD from other movement disorders.",

Inclusion criteria were sinusitis symptoms persisting for more than three months and maxillary sinus mucosa thickening by > 6 mm, considered as maxillary sinusitis. Patients with asthma, polyposis, recent infection, systemic steroid therapy or previous sinus surgery were excluded. Patients were treated endosinusally with 2 mg dexamethasone and 40 mg gentamycine per maxillary sinus daily for 5 days. Patients rated nasal / chronic rhinosinusitis disease-specific symptoms and completed a self-administered questionnaire concerning sinusitis symptoms at inclusion and after 30 days. Sinus lavage with 5 ccm of saline was taken prior to the first endosinusal treatment. Tryptase, MPO and ECP were determined from lavage fluid. Biopsy specimens of maxillary sinus mucosa were taken with a biopsy forceps during sinusoscopy through the inferior meatus in local anaesthesia. 15 (50%) patients showed improvement and symptom alleviation after the treatment (responders), 15 (50%) were unchanged or worsened (IR 0.05). Responders had higher level of MPO and ECP in sinus lavage and higher number of mononuclears and eosinophils in biopsy specimens of maxillary sinus mucosa than nonresponders. There was no statistical difference for tryptase and for other examined histologic parameters (number of mononuclears, oedema, fibrosis, seromucous glands and goblet cell density) between responders or nonresponders. Eosinophilia in maxillary sinus mucosa specimens was closely correlated with the ECP level in sinus lavage and inversely correlated with fibrosis (p<0.05). Other inflammatory cells (mononuclears and neutrophils) in maxillary sinus mucosa specimens did not correlate to the level of any cytokine in sinus lavage or to other histologic parameters. Globlet cell density was correlated with the ECP level (p<0.05) and inversively correlated with MPO level in sinus lavage (p<0.01). Fibrosis was closely correlated to tryptase (p<0.01) and MPO (p<0.05) level in sinus lavage and inversely correlated with edema (p<0.01). Results indicate higher level of MPO and ECP in sinus lavage and higher number of mononuclears and eosinophils in biopsy specimens of maxillary sinus mucosa to predict better response to endosinusal steroid/ antibiotic treatment.",

The cross-sectional study included random sample of 201 schoolchildren aged 7-12 years (64% of boys) from Podgorica. Children's nutritional status was determined according to the International Obesity Task Force criteria. CMR was assessed using a sum of z values of the following five indicators: glucose, total cholesterol, inverted value of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and hypertension. Higher CMR was found among both overweight and obese boys compared to normal weight boys (p<0.001). The effect size of the difference in CMR between overweight and obese girls and normal weight counterparts was less prominent (p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that body mass index was independent predictor of high CMR [odds ratio (OR)=1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.02-1.10); p=0.002]. On the contrary, we found no impact of socioeconomic status, physical activity or sedentary time on CMR in the examined cohort of schoolchildren. In conclusion, both overweight and obesity even among young population are related to higher CMR and this effect is more prominent among boys as compared to girls.",

Urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and thyroid function parameters were measured in all subjects. In LW, breast milk iodine concentration (BMIC) was measured and iodine and salt rich food frequency questionnaire data were collected. Results of analysis indicated that 99.2% of the LW used iodized salt in household and 20.4% used iodine-containing vitamin and mineral supplements. Median (IQR) UIC was 75 µg/L (19.0-180.5 µg/L) in LW and 234 µg/L (151.0-367.5 µg/L) in infants, whereas BMIC was 121 µg/kg (87.8-170.8 µg/kg). Multivariate regression analysis revealed BMIC to be a significant predictor of infant UIC (p<0.001). Positive correlation was recorded between LW and infant thyroid function. This was the first study in Croatia demonstrating BMIC to be a reliable biomarker of iodine status during lactation and predicting iodine intake in breastfed infants. The study confirmed that mandatory salt iodization in Croatia ensured sufficient dietary iodine for LW and optimal iodine intake for breastfed infants via breast milk.",

    "abstract": "Oral cavity and perioral area are constantly exposed to a variety of antigens, including food and additives, which have a potential role in the development of different oral mucosal and perioral cutaneous diseases since they can cause hypersensitivity reactions.Oral and perioral diseases mainly include angioedema, burning mouth syndrome, cheilitis, gingivostomatitis, oral lichenoid reactions, and perioral dermatitis.Previous studies were focused on delayed-type oral allergies by performing patch testing but did not include tests for immediate-type allergic reactions.Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine common nutritive and additive allergens in the prevalent oral and perioral diseases by using skin prick tests.Our study evaluated 230 participants, i.e. 180 patients with oral/perioral diseases (angioedema, burning mouth syndrome, cheilitis, gingivostomatitis, oral lichenoid reactions, and perioral dermatitis), and 50 healthy control subjects.The results of skin prick tests showed that immediate-type allergic reactions to food and additives were mostly seen in patients with burning mouth syndrome (40%) and cheilitis (33.3%), whereas allergies were least frequently observed in perioral dermatitis (10%) and gingivostomatitis (20%).Fruits, mushrooms, and vegetables were the most frequent causes of nutritive allergies in oral and perioral diseases.The most commonly identified additive allergens were glutaraldehyde, citric acid, and sodium glutamate.Study results suggest the possible association with nutritive and additive allergies be considered in cases of persistent oral mucosal or perioral skin disease accompanied by respective medical history.",

    "abstract": "Robot-assisted brain tumor biopsy is becoming one of the most important innovative technologies in neurosurgical practice. The idea behind its engagement is to advance the safety and efficacy of the biopsy procedure, which is much in demand when planning the management of endocranial tumor pathology. Herein, we provide our earliest institutional experiences in utilizing this mesmerizing technology. Cranial robotic device was employed for stereotactic robot-assisted brain glioma biopsy in three consecutive patients from our series: an anaplastic isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) negative astrocytoma (WHO grade III) located in the right trigone region of the periventricular white matter; a low grade diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II) of bilateral thalamic region spreading into the right mesencephalic area; and an IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) of the right frontal lobe producing a contralateral midline shifting. Robot-assisted tumor biopsy was successfully performed to get tissue samples for histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis. The adjacent tissue iatrogenic damage of the eloquent cortical areas was minimal, while the immediate postoperative recovery was satisfactory in all patients. In conclusion, considering the preliminary results of our early experiences, robot-assisted tumor biopsy was proven to be a feasible and accurate procedure when surgery for brain glioma was not an option. It may increase safety and precision, without expanding surgical time, being similarly effective when compared to standard stereotactic and manual biopsy. Using this method to provide accurate sampling for histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis is a safe and easy way to determine management strategies and outcome of different types of brain glioma.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of this technique in patients who, along with suspected HPT, also have thyroid nodules. Retrospective analysis included a period of 8 years (2006-2013). The study included 91 patients with clinical or laboratory suspected HPT. Pathologic changes in parathyroid glands were demonstrated in 47 (70%) of 67 patients with positive scintigraphy. Pathologic changes in parathyroid glands were not evident in the remaining 20 (30%) patients. Out of nine patients with negative scintigraphy results but with suspected enlargement of the parathyroid gland examined by ultrasound, eight (89%) patients did not show pathologic changes in the parathyroid gland, whereas one (11%) patient had evident changes. Eight (54%) of 15 patients with suspected scintigraphy had positive ultrasound findings, as well as fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) findings with parathyroid hormone (PTH) determination in the aspirate. Seven (46%) patients had negative FNAC findings and PTH in the aspirate. The study showed scintigraphy to have high sensitivity (98%) in detecting patients with pathologic changes in the parathyroid glands. In patients with suspected HPT, scintigraphy needs to be combined with FNAC and PTH determination in the aspirate due to its low specificity of 28%.",

Pain was evaluated by the visual analog scale, while the sensory and affective pain components were evaluated by the McGill Pain Questionnaire, and anxiety as a trait was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-form X. Women in labor with a higher level of anxiety had a significantly increased affective component of pain, but did not significantly more frequently decide on labor with epidural analgesia. The women having chosen epidural analgesia experienced more intense pain during delivery before epidural analgesia, with the sensory component of pain being less pronounced in the women in labor without epidural analgesia, while there was no difference in the affective component of pain.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a malignant neoplasm which has an increasing incidence and represents a global public health problem. The majority of patients are diagnosed after the age of 50, and the risk of developing it over lifetime is 5%. Development of preventive, diagnostic and treatment methods has resulted in a significant reduction in mortality and other negative clinical outcomes. Precisely because of the efficient method of prevention and early detection of this disease, numerous countries, including Croatia, have organized national colorectal cancer screening and monitoring programs. However, these programs are primarily organized for the population with the usual, i.e. average risk of developing colorectal cancer. High-risk groups include persons with endoscopically detected and removed colon polyps, persons surgically treated for colon cancer, persons with a positive family history of colorectal cancer, persons with inflammatory bowel diseases, individuals and families with hereditary disorders or genetic mutations that increase the risk of this disease several fold, persons with acromegaly, and patients who have undergone ureterosigmoidostomy. Recommendations for the detection and monitoring of high-risk groups are often not defined clearly, and some of the existing ones are based mostly on scarce scientific evidence. It is commonly accepted that screening in high-risk groups should start at an earlier age, with shorter intervals between follow-ups. The basic diagnostic method for screening and monitoring in these patient groups is endoscopic monitoring, or colonoscopy. The aim of this review paper is to present the characteristics of the abovementioned risk groups and provide clear screening recommendations.",

This prospective study involved 150 patients with chronic hepatitis C awaiting interferon treatment for hepatitis C and 150 healthy subjects. All individuals enrolled in the study completed the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. The symptoms showed greater severity/score among patients with chronic hepatitis C for both depression (t=3.37; p<0.01) and anxiety (t=2.35; p<0.05). Regression analysis was used for estimating the relationship between depression and the set of predictors (domains of the SF-36 questionnaire). Three HRQoL domains (Physical Functioning, Vitality, and Mental Health) were found to have the strongest predictive contribution to the occurrence of depression. A series of Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests showed a significant difference in depression level between marital status categories (χ2(2)=7.86, p<0.05). Divorced participants had significantly higher scores compared to married participants (Z=-2.40, p<0.05) and single participants (Z=-2.75, p<0.01). Unemployment was associated with a higher degree of depression and anxiety. There was no association identified between duration of the disease, route of hepatitis C virus transmission, existence of cirrhosis, and depression or anxiety. The findings of this study can assist in developing a standard protocol for the management of chronic hepatitis C that will include psychological assessment and support.",

There were 148 MM patients treated with bortezomibbased regimens, with 15 (10.1%) of them meeting the criteria for MF-MM. Comparative analysis involved disease- and therapy-related variables and markers of bone metabolism in MF-MM and classic MM groups. Event-free survival (EFS) and median survival (MS) were analyzed. Patients in MF-MM and classic MM groups had similar mean age and sex distribution. Patients with MF-MM had advanced myeloma bone disease (MBD), significantly lower clonal plasma cell infiltration in bone marrow, and lower paraprotein level. These patients were predominantly in an early International Staging System stage, showed non-secretory and light-chain variants, and significant association with extramedullary plasmacytomas. EFS was 20 months in MF-MM group versus 13 months in classic MM group (nonsignificant difference). MS was 42 months in both MF-MM and classic MM groups. MF-MM presents with imbalance of the minimal tumor burden and massive bone involvement. Along with advanced skeletal manifestations, these patients showed features of preserved bone marrow and no end-organ damages. Following bortezomib-based therapy and radiotherapy, the EFS and MS did not differ between MF-MM and classic MM groups.",

Newly published evidence suggests that the hypothesis supporting the theory of the American origin of the disease is the valid one. Among 1500 analyzed pathographies of composers and musicians, data on ten Anglo-American composers and jazz musicians having suffered from neurosyphilis (tertiary stage of the disease) were extracted for this report. In this group of Anglo-American composers and musicians, most of them died from progressive paralysis while still in the creative phase of life. Additionally, diagnoses of eleven other famous neurosyphilitic composers, as well as basic biographic data on ten less known composers that died from neurosyphilis-progressive paralysis are also briefly mentioned. In conclusion, neurosyphilis can cause serious neurological damage, as well as permanent disability or death, preventing further work and skill improvement.",

The study included a series of 57 patients, mean age 35.46 years, who were diagnosed during their hospitalization at Clinical Department of Neurosurgery, Clinical Center of Serbia, in the period from January 2008 to March 2016. In all patients, the diagnosis was made using MDCT angiography. Two groups of patients were observed. The first group included patients who did not initially present with hemorrhage, while the second group initially presented with hemorrhage. Both groups were treated with medical therapy or a combination of medical therapy with embolization/surgery/radiotherapy. Deep venous drainage (p<0.05), combined arterial supply from different basins (p<0.05) with a length <60 mm, venous dilatation present in the drainage vein (p<0.01), and the angle of casting sup-ply arteries in the nidus (p<0.01) carry a risk of repeated bleeding. In the group of patients who had initial hemorrhage, the mean value of the casting angle size was 130°, while in the group that did not have initial bleeding the mean value of the measured angle size was 103.81° with standard deviation of 17.21° (p<0.01). In conclusion, AVMs with deep venous drainage from the carotid and vertebrobasilar basin, the length of the feeding arteries <60 mm, the angle of the casting feeding arteries in the nidus ≥130° and dilatation and/or venous aneurysm of drainage vessel are predictive for clinical presenting by hemorrhage.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate nutritional status of elderly home care patients immediately after hospital discharge and to determine factors that affect nutritional status using questionnaires based on validated tools (NRS-2002, DETERMINE checklist) and basic medical history data. The study involved 76 elderly individuals (51.3% of them older than 70) living in the City of Zagreb. The nutritional status assessment using the NRS-2002 tool showed that 57.6% of the subjects were at nutritional risk. The findings of the assessment by use of the DETERMINE tool were also unfavorable, indicating that 82.1% of persons older than 70 were categorized as being at a high nutritional risk, while 17.9% were at moderate risk. The DETERMINE checklist elements (illness; reduced intake of fruits, vegetables or dairy products; alcohol consumption; oral health problems; and weight loss) were linked to a higher NRS score. The mean number of hospital days in subjects at nutritional risk was 14.27 (the mean number in the Republic of Croatia is 8.56 days). Although the study involved a small number of subjects, the results showed a substantial presence of malnutrition among the elderly. A timely -intervention by the healthcare system and training of healthcare personnel can be a step towards achieving a better nutritional status.",

There are two peaks in its incidence, i.e., in childhood and another one in patients over 40 years of age, which increases continuously with patient age. It is a condition recognized by the World Health Organization as a set of diseases (International Classification of Diseases, ICD-10), and the International Classification of Functionality recognizes the associated extreme disablement. UI is a major health problem affecting the lives of an estimated 400 million persons worldwide. The global aging of the population will cause rise in the incidence of UI in the future. It is expected that UI itself will become a serious health and social burden for both patients and health service providers. UI can be an isolated problem, or it can be associated and/or aggravated by any associated disorder affecting the nervous system such as myelomeningoceles, Parkinson's disease or stroke. UI often affects the patient daily life, and it can have repercussions on their physical, financial, social, and emotional well-being. At last, it has a negative influence on their sexual health.",

A total of 219 patients with ACoA aneurysms were admitted to our hospital between January 2016 and December 2020, and morphological and clinical characteristics were analyzed retrospectively in 153 patients (112 ruptured and 41 unruptured). Medical records were reviewed to obtain demographic and clinical data on age, gender, presence of hemorrhage, history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease. Morphological parameters examined on 3-dimensional digital subtraction angiography included aneurysm size, neck diameter, aspect ratio, size ratio, bottleneck ratio, height/width ratio, aneurysm angle, (in)flow angle, branching angle, number of aneurysms per patient, shape of the aneurysm, aneurysm wall morphology, variation of the A1 segment, and direction of the aneurysm. Male gender, aspect ratio, height/width ratio, non-spherical and irregular shape were associated with higher odds of rupture, whilst controlled hypertension was associated with lower odds of rupture, when tested using univariate logistic regression model. In multivariate model, controlled hypertension, presence of multiple aneurysms, and larger neck diameter reduced the odds of rupture, while irregular wall morphology increased the risk of rupture. Regulated hypertension represented a significant protective factor from ACoA aneurysm rupture. We found that ACoA aneurysms in male patients and those with greater aspect ratios and height/width ratios, larger aneurysm angles, presence of daughter sacs and irregular and non-spherical shapes were at a higher risk of rupture.",

The study included 41 subjects, mean age 56±6 years. Nutritional habits were evaluated by food frequency questionnaire. Participants followed lipid lowering diet for 12 weeks. Energy intake of omega-6 and omega-3 FA was changed from 7.6% and 0.6% to 5.7% and 1.2%, respectively. Marked decrease in four FA ratios in serum phospholipids, i.e., omega-6/omega-3, arachidonic acid (AA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), AA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), AA/(EPA+DHA) and omega-3 index (EPA+DHA) was found in study subjects after lipid-lowering diet. Total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)/HDL and triacylglycerol/HDL-cholesterol ratios positively correlated with all FA ratios, and negatively correlated with total omega-3 levels in serum phospholipids and omega-3 index in erythrocytes. Total serum omega-3 levels showed strongest association with lipoprotein ratios and positive correlation with homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index. In conclusion, lipid-lowering diet resulted in decreased serum key FA ratios, increased omega-3 levels, and improved insulin sensitivity that may lead to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease in subjects with moderate hyperlipidemia.",

The study included 325 patients of ASA I-II who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In group 1, the airway was secured using endotracheal intubation (115 patients). In group 2 (103 patients), LMA Supreme was applied, whereas i-gel mask was used for airway management in group 3 (107 patients). Monitoring parameters were recorded and compared using t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey's test and χ2-test. The following parameters were monitored: insertion time, number of attempts for device placement, oropharyngeal seal pressure, etc. Insertion time was longest in group 1 (14.7±1.65 s) as compared to group 2 (15.5±1.05 s) and group 3 (14.1±1.27 s); ANOVA test yielded a statistically significant difference (p<0.01).

Comparison of oropharyngeal seal pressure between group 2 (35.95±2.92 cm H2O) and group 3 (36.47±1.43 cm H2O) yielded no statistical difference (p=0.314, t-test). Endotracheal tube, Supreme and i-gel laryngeal masks were shown to be equally efficient in airway management in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All three devices enabled efficient ventilation and oxygenation despite certain pathophysiological changes associated with laparoscopy.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY ∑ Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the thyroid has been utilized as a diagnostic method for 40 years. The main purpose of thyroid FNA is to differentiate nodules that require surgery from those that do not. The sensitivity of thyroid FNA ranges from 65% to 99%, and its specificity from 72% to 100%. Ultrasound-guided FNA of the thyroid is recommended, especially for sampling of a small, deep nodule. One to four aspirations suffice in single nodular lesions measuring less than 3 cm in diameter. Although the criteria used to establish specimen adequacy are somewhat controversial, most institutions require the presence of follicular cells. FNA diagnosis of thyroid disease is a clinicocytologic diagnosis, and correlation with clinical findings is mandatory for success. At our institution, diagnostic FNA lesions are subdivided into the following general diagnostic categories: benign, indeterminate, and malignant. Benign lesions include lesions with the diagnosis of benign thyroid nodule, nodular goiter, and thyroiditis. Indeterminate lesions include cellular follicular lesion, follicular neoplasm and Hurthle cell neoplasm. Malignant neoplasms include papillary carcinoma, high-grade follicular carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, large cell lymphoma, and metastatic carcinoma. No clinical or laboratory test is sensitive and specific enough to distinguish reliably whether a follicular neoplasm identified on FNA is benign or malignant. This position may be changed with the development of molecular approaches to the diagnosis. CD44v6 and galectin-3 seem to be most promising tumor markers for thyroid malignancies of follicular epithelial cell origin.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n Although chronic rhinosinusitis is one of the most common chronic disorders, and major advances in minimally invasive surgery and potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory conservative treatment have been accomplished in the past decade, evidence for the most effective treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis is still lacking. Randomized controlled trials, which provide the best possible evidence in terms of testing the efficacy of chronic rhinosinusitis treatment, are too few. Those that have been done so far, have proven advantages of endoscopic sinus surgery over classic radical surgery in terms of providing better health related quality of life. Case controlled studies of endoscopic sinus surgery have shown a 91% (73.0%-97.5%) improvement with a major complication rate of 1.6%. Still, at longterm follow up, improvement rate drops to 50% in revision cases and in patients with systemic disease (allergy, asthma). Further improvement in surgical failures can be achieved with longterm topical steroid and low-dose macrolide treatment. Conservative treatment, which includes aggressive longterm steroid and antibiotic therapy, with permanent nasal saline douches and short-term decongestants, has proved successful in half of the treated patients, yet with a shorter follow up. However, only few of clinical trials are randomized controlled trials, and placebo-controlled studies have not recognized significant advantage of any conservative treatment. The level of evidence for the treatment for pediatric sinusitis is satisfactory, and meta-analysis of conservative treatment has been cited in the Cochrane Library Database. Meta-analysis of surgical treatment for pediatric sinusitis yields a success rate of 88% with a mean follow up of 3.7 years and major complication rate of 0.6%.",

The aim of this research carried out on a sample of 60 examinees is to define whether Frank's sign belongs to the group of risk factors of cerebrovascular disease. The examinees with the presence of Frank's sign were assinged to group A, while the examinees without the presence of Frank's sign were assigned to group B, all of whom were subject to color Doppler examination of carotid arteries and also their carotid artery intimal wall thickness (IMT – “ intima-media thickness“ ) on a common carotid artery (ACC) was determined. The value of ACC-IMT taken as increased was the value exceeding 0.9 mm. Using a statistical analysis by performing the Pearson's Chi-square test, the value obtained was 11, 279 and p = 0, 001. By Frank's sign validity assessment in predicting increased ACC-IMT the sensitivity determined reached 73%, a specificity of 70%, a positive predictive value of 71% and a negative predictive value of 72%. The research has shown statistically significant correlation of Frank's sign and increased ACC-IMT supporting the hypothesis according to which this marker is an uncontrollable risk factor for cerebrovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to retrospectively analyze changes in the results of automated perimetry in open angle glaucoma patients, including Mean Defect (MD), Loss Variance (LV) and Corrected Loss Variance (CLV) before and after cataract surgery, and also to note how the presence of dense scotoma preoperatively could influence postoperative results. MD is mean of all local visual field defects. LV and CLV are indexes of localized field damages. Increased values of these indicators are even more specific for glaucomatous damage than MD. We investigated 18 eyes of 14 patients with open angle glaucoma who were scheduled for cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation. The diagnosis of open angle glaucoma was based on the presence of glaucomatous optic disk cupping and abnormal results on glucoma field testing. The intraocular pressure (IOP) criterion was IOP higher than 21 mm Hg. On gonioscopy, all angles of the anterior chamber were open. All patients underwent Octopus Field Analyzer dG2 testing within two months before and three months after cataract surgery. The eyes were divided into two groups based on the presence of absolute or near absolute (dense) scotomata before surgery. Dense (absolute or near absolute) scotomata noted on automated perimetry were found not to be caused by the cataract. Their existance before surgery could be explained by glucomatous visual field defects. Cataract can induce various degrees of relative scotoma, which can induce worstening of local field defects (LV and CLV) after surgery. This implies that the real size of glaucomatous damage (expressed as difference between LV and CLV before and after cataract surgery) can only be seen and properly measured after cataract extraction. Therefore, it is concluded that LV and CLV can be used as reliable indicators in distinguishing the role of coexisting cataract in glaucomatous damage, however, additional studies in the area are needed.",

The mean baseline values of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were 6.6±1.2 and 4.4±1.1 mmol/L, respectively. At month 3, the respective mean values of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were 5.1±0.9 and 2.9±1.0 mmol/L. Treatment was discontinued in 9 (3.7%) patients due to adverse events. In conclusion, treatment with the single-pill combination of atorvastatin/amlodipine was effective and well tolerated by the patients with arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and moderate to high cardiovascular risk.",

We report a case of a 62-year-old man who developed severe sepsis with renal insufficiency, paralytic ileus and polyserositis after radical prostatectomy, as a consequence of probable quinolone-resistant bacterial infection. Computed tomography of the abdomen and chest showed polyserositis with bilateral pleural and peritoneal effusions. Treatment with meropenem and other supportive measures resulted in good clinical outcome. This case suggested that severe sepsis with exudative polyserositis was probably caused by mobilization of an infective agent (bacterium) during bladder neck dissection as part of open radical prostatectomy.",

Neuropsychological testing was conducted at Zagreb University Hospital Centre, Department of Neurosurgery, from 1998 to 2012, in two time intervals: first within 11 months following surgery, and then 12 to 48 months after surgery. The obtained results showed that verbal-mechanical, verbal-logical, and visual memory deficits were present in the first testing interval. In the second testing, the verbal-logical and visual memory deficits were still present, while the tests of verbal-mechanical memory showed deficits in capacity and learning curve, but the results for short- and long-term memory were within the normal ranges. Neither the first nor the second testing showed deficits of numerical and working memory. Based on our results, we can conclude that long-term verbal-mechanical and visual short- and long-term memory had recovered to a statistically significant level, whereas other types of memory showed no significant recovery.",

Peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages are the major sources of cytokines, which regulate inflammation. Leukocytapheresis (LCAP) is a method where blood is processed by apheresis system that removes lymphocytes and plasma before being returned to the body. We report the first case in Croatia where we used LCAP in the treatment of a patient with severe steroid-dependent UC. After 12 LCAP procedures, good clinical response was obtained and there were no significant adverse side effects noticed. The patient remained in clinical remission over two years in which he underwent regular follow ups at outpatient clinic. Over a 10-year follow-up period after LCAP, the patient had only occasional clinical symptoms of disease activity. The clinical course was complicated with the development of metastatic colorectal carcinoma, which points to the importance of regular disease monitoring rather than the increased risk of malignant disease after LCAP. Patients with UC are a demanding group of patients that warrant the search for novel treatment strategies other than conventional pharmacological therapies. Although LCAP is still not a common treatment modality in our daily practice, data from recent studies suggest it to be an effective and safe procedure in the management of active UC patients.",

A distinction between consent to a medical procedure and consent to enrolment in a research protocol is strongly stressed out. Special emphasis is placed on the role of specialists in laboratory medicine and masters of medical biochemistry in the process of obtaining informed consent.

    "abstract": "Occlusion of the initial segment of internal carotid artery is the most common reason for vascular events in the brain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of one-year treatment with atorvastatin on intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid arteries as a measure of atherosclerosis in stroke patients. In this prospective interventional study, 44 patients with ischemic stroke were investigated. Patients were treated with atorvastatin 40 mg once a day for one year. IMT of carotid arteries was measured by extracranial Doppler ultrasonography in the distal part of the common carotid artery at the beginning of the study, at 6 months and one year of treatment with atorvastatin. The IMT of both right and left carotid arteries decreased after 6- and 12-month atorvastatin treatment. Based on the results of this study, long-term administration of atorvastatin was associated with reduction in carotid artery IMT in patients with ischemic stroke. Such a decrease in IMT may prevent subsequent stroke or cardiovascular events in these patients.",

    "abstract": "The generally accepted model of sensory processing of visual and auditory stimuli assumes two major parallel processing streams, ventral and dorsal, which comprise functionally and anatomically distinct but interacting processes in which the ventral stream supports stimulus identification, and the dorsal stream is involved in recognizing the stimulus spatial location and sensori-motor integration functions. However, recent studies suggest the existence of a third, very fast sensory processing pathway, a gating stream that directly links the primary auditory cortices to the executive prefrontal cortex within the first 50 milliseconds after presentation of a stimulus, bypassing hierarchical structure of the ventral and dorsal pathways. Gating stream propagates the sensory gating phenomenon, which serves as a basic protective mechanism preventing irrelevant, repeated information from recurrent sensory processing. The goal of the present paper is to introduce the novel 'three-stream' model of auditory processing, including the new fast sensory processing stream, i.e. gating stream, alongside the well-affirmed dorsal and ventral sensory processing pathways. The impairments in sensory processing along the gating stream have been found to be strongly involved in the pathophysiological sensory processing in Alzheimer's disease and could be the underlying issue in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders and diseases that are linked to the pathological sensory gating inhibition, such as schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",

A total of 145 type 1 diabetic patients (52% diagnosed in adult age) were monitored at the Department of Endocrinology, Clinical Department of Internal Medicine, Zagreb University Hospital Center from 2009 to 2014. Twenty-one patients started insulin pump therapy in adulthood (seven men and 14 women, median age 27). Five patients had chronic complications (retinopathy in two, polyneuropathy in one, and both nephropathy and retinopathy in two patients). The median HbA1c at the initiation of pump therapy was 6.95% versus 6.5% after 1 year of pump therapy. Patients were stratified according to indications for insulin pump therapy (frequent and/or severe hypoglycemia, specific lifestyle, having not reached glycemic goals despite adherence/labile diabetes, and preconception). Patients could meet more than one criterion. Initially, the occurrence of hypoglycemia was analyzed by 6-day continuous glucose monitoring, while re-evaluation was done after collecting history data at 1 year ± 3 months. Initially, all patients had a median of 5 hypoglycemias/6 days (30% nocturnal) versus 1 hypoglycemia/6 days (without nocturnal) after 1 year. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test yielded a statistically significant difference in hypoglycemic events, nocturnal hypoglycemia and HbA1c. Patients commencing insulin pump therapy due to hypoglycemia initially had median HbA1c of 6.7% with 7 hypoglycemia/6 days (50% nocturnal). After one year, median HbA1c was 6% with 1 hypoglycemia/6 days (without nocturnal). In conclusion, the main indication for insulin pump therapy in adults is the frequency of hypoglycemia, especially nocturnal ones.",

The purpose of this article is to discuss implementation of obligatory study topic with the main objective to increase the skills of scientific writing among students of Bachelor Nursing Curriculum and its relation to scientific publishing volume of Bachelor degree students from the University of Dubrovnik. By searching the local rank database called HRČAK, data were collected on publication volume of the Bachelor course students at the University of Dubrovnik from 2010 to 2014. Articles published in the Croatian medical journals in Croatian language were identified. Sixty-six students published 35 articles, alone or with co-authors. Two (6%) articles were written by a single author. Among co-authors from the nursing profession, those with associate degree in nursing (20%) predominated, followed by medical doctors and anthropologists (25%). The total number of authors was 95, and the share of papers published in Croatian language was 100%. The body of published articles increased from 2012 to 2013 by 14%, and then from 2013 to 2014 by 113%. For future investigations, closer insight into novel approaches is needed to encourage nursing students to increase their scientific productivity, especially in English language. In order to enhance international visibility of Croatian nursing authors, academic members of the Croatian scientific nursing community should find additional tools to upgrade scientific productivity of the Croatian nursing authors.",

The validated Children’s Fear Survey Schedule – Dental Subscale was used on fear assessment. Results showed that only 12.2% of children without trauma, 33.3% with one trauma and 51.7% with repeated trauma were not afraid of injection. Older children had a significantly lower fear of injections, touch of an unknown person, choking, going to the hospital and people in white uniforms. Dentist was not the cause of fear in 65.5% of patients with repeated trauma. With each repeated injury of teeth, the degree of their fear of dental treatment was lower.",

The finite element analysis on the three different plate constructs was performed, i.e. parallel, perpendicular and newly designed Y shape plate were considered. Displacements were measured on articular surface and gap point. The most visible decrease of maximum displacements in the distal part of the model was detected in the Y plate model with axial loading: in case of anterior gap 58.5% and especially at radially formed gap 60.9%. Similarly, at axial loading, displacement at the analyzed point on fracture gap most significantly decreased in Y plate model (by 49.4%) at posterior bony contact. Moreover, the latter showed displacement decrease by 68.5% at ulnar bone contact. Furthermore, if a longer radial plate than the ulnar one was used, varus stress could have been avoided.

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n Craniocervical artery dissection (CCAD) is primarily diagnosed by angiography, brain magnetic resonance (MR) or MR angiography. Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) has been underrated due to the localization of dissection, which appears to be most commonly localized intracranially. Nevertheless, dissection may manifest in various ways, enabling CDFI to present a broad spectrum of findings. The aim of this study was to analyze ultrasonographic findings in patients with clinical or ultrasonographic presentation of CCAD. Forty-three patients who presented with CCAD over a two-year period were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty-three of these patients showed clinical manifestations of CCAD, whereas in 19 patients ultrasound revealed double lumen or bifurcation stenosis with double lumen. Carotid and vertebral CDFI was performed on an Acuson 128 XP device. Color and power Doppler scans and hemodynamic spectra were analyzed. Data are presented descriptively. Data on 43 patients (28 male and 15 female, mean age 59‐11 years) were analyzed. There were 49 ultrasonographically detected dissected vessels (37 carotid, 10 vertebral and 2 subclavian arteries). A string sign was found in 5 patients (5 internal carotid arteries (ICA)), string and pearl sign in 2 patients (1 ICA and 1 vertebral artery (VA)), subintimal flow in one patient (1 ICA), double lumen in 12 patients (3 common carotid arteries (CCA), 7 ICA, 3 VA and 2 subclavian arteries); one patient presented as VA dissection and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH; ICA dissection on ultrasonography); carotid stenosis with double lumen under the plaque base was found in 17 patients (2 ACC, 13 bifurcation stenoses, and 2 ICA stenoses with dissection under the plaque base); hemodynamic spectra suggesting distal occlusion were detected in 8 patients (3 ICA, 6 VA); and multiple vessel involvement was present in 7 (16%) patients. Ultrasound can show a broad spectrum of findings in CCAD including direct evidence for intimal flap and detectable subintimal flow as well as signs of hemodynamically significant flow obstruction.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a global health problem and a leading cause of adult disability1. Out of 35 million deaths attributable to chronic non-communicable diseases that occurred worldwide in 2005, stroke was responsible for 5.7 million (16.6%) deaths and 87% of these deaths occurred in lowto middle-income countries2. Driven by increased aging of the populations across the world, together with escalating prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension, tobacco use, unhealthy diet, lack of physical inactivity and obesity, stroke is becoming a major cause of premature death and disability in developing countries3. In the western world, stroke represents the second most frequent disease; it immediately follows heart diseases (even before cancer) and accounts for 10% of all deaths4. In Europe, however, it is the third most common cause of death, ranked immediately after ischemic heart disease and before cancer. Th e burden of disease and health care costs of stroke are very high because of severe neurological consequences such as hemiplegia, cognitive defi cits and others. Slovenia, with 2 million inhabitants, is undergoing economic and demographic changes in recent years resulting in an improvement of lifestyle-related cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. We place greater and greater emphasis on population-based stroke prevention strategies. Th e reported frequency, pattern, risk factors and outcome of stroke in Slovenia are largely derived from hospital-based observations, National Health Institute and National preventive programme for prevention of chronic diseases (CINDI)5. In our country men are more susceptible to stroke than women with more severe outcomes in men. Women live longer and on average reach older age when they are fi rst hit by stroke. In 2008, vascular brain diseases together led to 10.6% of all deaths, 90.2% of them occurred in people over 64 years of age. Since 1997, around 200 admissions to the hospitals due to brain vessels diseases per 100,000 inhabitants were recorded every year. Stroke in our country is also a leading cause of life-long handicap. Framingham Heart Study found that 31% of people who have survived a stroke, after seven years still needing help with daily living tasks with 20% needing help to walk and 71% of them having diffi culties carrying out their work6. Th is paper presents data on health statistics on stroke and assessment of diff erences in mortality and morbidity from stroke, by sex and age groups in Slovenia. Shown are data of the Institute of Public Health of the Republic of Slovenia7.",

There are relatively few studies that evaluated the correlation between visual acuity and especially in young hyperopes. We examined 80 children (160 eyes) with hyperopia, divided into two groups: children that were cooperative during examination and children that could not cooperate with the examiner. Upon determination of the eye refractive state by other objective methods, the prescribed refraction was checked by following the change in VEP P100 wave amplitude and prescribed the correction for which these values were highest. The first VEP curve was recorded without any correction, then more VEP curves were recorded after increasing correction between +1.0 and +6.0 D, in the range found by retinoscopy, with 1 D step. The correction values that caused VEP curves with highest amplitude and shortest P100 wave latency were recorded. In conclusion, the VEP curve parameters were confirmed to depend on the refractive state of the eye.",

Some of the recognized E. coli virulence factors are adherence to uroepithelial cells, certain O and K serotypes, hemolysin production, and aerobactin production. One of E. coli adhesins, P-fimbriae, are known as a major virulence factor in the development of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis. The aim of this study was to determine the virulence properties of E. coli strains isolated from the urine of patients with chronic pyelonephritis, and to compare them to the properties of strains isolated from patients with acute pyelonephritis, acute cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria. For each strain, O-serogroup, adhesin type, motility, production of hemolysin, and the amount of capsular polysac- charide were examined. The strains isolated from patients with acute pyelonephritis were found to mostly express all five or four virulence markers tested, while the less virulent strains were detected in the group of patients with chronic pyelonephritis, where most strains expressed up to three viru- lence markers. The lowest virulence was observed among the strains isolated in the group of patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Expression of P-fimbriae and production of hemolysin were found to be the most important virulence factors with the highest power for discrimination between chronic and acute upper urinary tract infection (p<0.01).",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n Depression is quite common in the early stage of treatment for alcohol addiction. The patientis awareness of his difficult situation may be one of the reasons for depression. Furthermore, depression can develop as the result of depressive disorders that are primarily or secondarily associated with alcohol addiction. Antidepressive therapy is usually initiated after a two-week detoxification procedure. Only exceptionally it may start earlier in case of severe depressive disorder. The administration of sulpiride from the very beginning of treatment yields favorable results because of the wide range of its action, especially antidepressive effects. The effect of sulpiride therapy was investigated in 20 alcoholics suffering from minor to moderate depressive disorders. The patients were administered 50 mg sulpiride capsules three times a day. Control group included 20 patients who received placebo. Both the study and control group patients underwent psychotherapeutic methods usually conducted in a sociotherapeutic community. The severity of depressive disorder was measured by use of Hamiltonis and Beckis scale before, and then at 2, 4 and 6 weeks from the beginning of treatment. Also, the patients were clinically observed during the psychotherapeutic procedures and other activities performed in the therapeutic community. Study results confirmed the efficacy of sulpiride in the management of depressive alcohol addiction in alcoholics. The sulpiride dose of 150 mg/day showed a rapid antidepressive effect. Accordingly, sulpiride was confirmed to play an important role in the rational use of psychopharmacotherapy in patients with alcohol addiction in a sociotherapeutic community.",

    "abstract": "Vertebral arteries are responsible for 1/3 of the brain blood supply, supplying primarily posterior parts of the brain. About 15% of all strokes occur in posterior parts of the brain, which should be kept in mind when dealing with disorders that can cause hemodynamic changes in vertebral arteries. Vertebral artery hypoplasia (VAH) is an inborn abnormality of vertebral artery defined by smaller lumen diameter and lower blood flow velocities, and is most commonly found in healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to establish the characteristics of VAH in a Croatian population sample, and to determine differences in its presentation according to sex and affected side. Study results may prove valuable for future identification of individuals at an increased risk of cerebrovascular incidents or traumatic injuries that could lead to adverse changes of posterior circulation. Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) reports of 277 patients were analyzed. All measurements were obtained in the V2 segment of vertebral artery, between the C6-C5 vertebrae, using a linear 7, 5 MHz probe on an Aloka Prosound SSD-5500. The criteria for normal vertebral arteries were lumen diameter of 2, 5-4, 5 mm, systolic mean blood flow velocity of 0, 35-0, 70 m/s, and normal resistance pattern. Study results showed the left vertebral artery to be dominant in 57% of study subjects, VAH to be more common in women, and right vertebral artery to be more often involved by hypoplasia than the left one. The width of the wider vertebral artery was greater in the group with VAH, suggesting a way of the deficit compensation. The study demonstrated that the deficit caused by VAH cannot be fully compensated for despite larger arterial diameter.",

RESULTS - Civilians exhibited more extractions due to decay or periodontal disease (p<0, 05), which related to trauma and endodontal and periapical disease in the army (p<0, 05). Over 90% of extractions of the military population was due to dental caries. There were no significant differences between left and right side of the moth and between maxillary and mandibular teeth. CONCLUSIONS - Main causes of tooth loss in the military are negligence and lack of free time for complex therapy, (endodontic, periodontal, or prosthodontic treatment). There is the need for education of both military personnel and military dentists.",

After irradiation the samples were placed in vials with broth, and the number of CFU/ml was determined after one and two weeks. Laser beams of 3.5 W power settings sterilized only three samples in the first week. In one of them bacteria, predominantly Enterococcus faecalis, grew in the second week. In another sample pure culture of Enterococcus faecalis grew. Irradiation by the Nd:YAG laser with 2.5 W did not sterilize any sample. Nd:YAG laser with parameters used in this study did not significantly reduce the number of bacteria in root canal specimens.",

    "abstract": "Psychosomatic disoders occur quite commonly in adolescence. The aim of the study was to define the prevalence of psychosomatic disoders in the population of secondary school students in Osijek, and to compare the groups of students with psychosomatic disorders and psychosomatic reactions with the group of healthy students according to their socioeconomic, family, relational and hereditary contextual factors. A total of 508 secondary school students from Osijek (170 male and 338 female) aged 15 - 19 years were included in the study. Study subjects were divided into three groups: a) healthy students (n=272 ; 53, 54%) ; b) students with psychosomatic reactions (n=190 ; 37, 40%) ; and c) students with psychosomatic disorders (n=46 ; 9, 06%). Accordingly, 37, 40% and 9, 06% of student sample suffered from psychosomatic reactions and psychosomatic disoders, respectively. The most common psychosomatic reactions were allergies (22, 04%), dysmenorrhea (21, 01%) and acne (16%). The most common psychosomatic disoders were asthma (4, 33%) and hypertension (1, 96%). Psychosomatic reactions occured more often in female than in male students. The number of divorced parents was significantly higher in the group of students with psychosomatic disorders (52.20%) as compared with the group of healthy students (15, 10%). The rate of psychosomatic disoders was significantly lower among parents of healthy students (28, 70%) as compared with parents of students with psychosomatic reactions (47, 90%) and those with psychosomatic disorders (67, 40%). Study results pointed to a conclusion that hereditary factors (predisposition) and factors representing the source of intense fear chilhood and adolescence (e.g., parents' divorce) played a significant role in the onset of psychosomatic disoders.",

The purpose of our experiments was to compare thesurvival of different embryonic tissues transplanted at an ectopic site in vivo. Embryo proper (9.5-day-old),neural retinas (20-day-old), lensectomized eyes (14- and 18-day-old), epiglottis (17-day-old), mandible(13- and 14-day-old), lacrimal gland (17- and 20-day-old) were microsurgically isolated from rat embryosand transplanted under the renal capsule. The embryo-proper survived in transplants for at least 60 days.Fetal rat retina survived in transplants for 180 days forming rosettes. Neural and glia cells with abundantneuropil as well as plexiform layers were found by electron microscopy. The lensectomized eye survived intransplants for 66 days. Transdifferentiation of the retina to lens cells was discovered. The epiglottis, mandibleand lacrimal gland survived in transplants for at least 14 days. In the mandible, fully structured teethdeveloped. This study showed not only the early postimplantation embryo but also various more developedtissues and organs to be able to survive under the renal capsule for at least 14 days. This ectopic site hastherefore proved to be a very convenient environment for transplantation experiments.Key words: Embryo; Transplantation; Renal capsule; Survival; Differentiation",

In the case presented, the COVID-19 unit was organized by joining human and laboratory resources from five clinical departments at the Split University Hospital Centre. Sample preparation procedures and analyses were launched within the restricted time frame while simultaneously training and organizing new laboratory staff and completing equipment requirements. As a result, the process that started with 30 tests per day was constantly improved over time and reached up to 160 tests per day when MagNA Pure was added to automatize RNA extraction at the end of April. At that pace, the cumulative number of samples soon exceeded the first thousand, and by the end of May it exceeded 4000. The case presented provides an example of good practice for crisis response and organization that successfully enabled sufficient COVID-19 testing capacities within the restricted time frame, human and technical resources. Despite limited understanding of COVID-19 at that time, appropriate management, transfer of knowledge, previous experiences in related laboratory and diagnostic work, as well as interdisciplinary and interdepartmental cooperation proved appropriate to overcome the above limitations and ensure adequate healthcare response.",

Many techniques and innovations for closure of sternal osteotomy have been developed with contradictory results. In this report, we present our first experience with the nitinol-made sternal closure system in the primary, as well as secondary closure of sternal osteotomy. A small series of 20 patients had their sternotomy closed with Flexigrip clips. In one case, the Flexigrip clips were used in secondary wound closure in a patient with deep sternal wound infection after full sternotomy and coronary bypass surgery. After 6-month follow-up, all patients were doing well with their sternums clinically stable and the sternotomy wounds completely healed. In conclusion, Flexigrip clips offered a stable alternative to steel wires in primary, as well as secondary sternal closure. Moreover, in secondary sternal closure, the thermoactive clips offered safety advantages over the standard wire cerclage technique because the need for dissection of the substernal adhesions could be avoided.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to explore practical differences between visual acuity (VA) scores measured on Snellen chart versus ETDRS chart, to grade cataracts using LOCS III system, and to compare VA on both charts depending on cataract grade and type. Prospective evaluation of uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity was carried out on the eye scheduled for cataract surgery preoperatively and postoperatively on the Snellen and ETDRS charts. The study was carried out at Department of Eye Diseases, Clinical Center of Serbia, during a two-year period. Inclusion criteria were met by 540 patients who underwent testing, surgery, data collection and analysis. The mean VA score was better on ETDRS than on Snellen chart. The mean difference was 6.05 letters or 1.21 lines. VA results correlated with all types of cataract regardless of the chart used, with the highest statistical significance (p<0.0001) for subcapsular cataract. The ETDRS chart was found to be more discriminative and precise than Snellen chart, especially for poor VA.",

    "abstract": "Microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling are both effective management modalities for intracranial aneurysms, whereas recent procedures are mainly directed towards endovascular treatment because of its minimally invasive nature.However, such a treatment has been associated with a bigger risk of recurrent aneurysmal growth and re-bleeding urging a selection of optimal strategies to overcome these hazards.It seems that the most appropriate method of choice is microsurgical clipping, which is much more technically challenging due to recurrent aneurysm demanding configuration created by the initial coiling.Herein, we present an illustrative institutional case series of recurrent intracranial aneurysms following endovascular treatment, and discuss the controversies and benefits of their subsequent microsurgical management, based on our experience and on literature review.Considering the results reported in this paper, it seems that careful selective microsurgical neck clipping with/without aneurysmal sac resection and coil extraction remains the preferred management option for recurrent intracranial aneurysms, resulting in high obliteration rates, long-term occlusion stability, and low morbidity/mortality.In conclusion, to bring a satisfactory outcome, the multidisciplinary management of recurrent intracranial aneurysms after endovascular treatment should be adjusted to aneurysm morphology/size/location, and individualized according to patient needs.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding attitudes are already being formed in the years of preadolescence-adolescence, which means that the educational program should be focused on this age group. For this purpose, many authors suggest that school should be used as an established educational institution and therefore they are developing different education programs. The authors offered an educational program adapted to the cultural, sociological, legal, health, and other specificities of the community to which the students belong. A questionnaire on breastfeeding intentions and knowledge was used to measure the long-term effects of education (after 6 months) in 155 students. They were divided into two groups: experimental (n=101, Grammar School students) and control (n=54, Bjelovar High School students) groups. The experimental group underwent breastfeeding education program, while control group did not. The study was approved by the Ministry of Education and Science, and co-operation with schools was approved by the School Ethics Committees. Six months after educational intervention, students in the experimental group had significantly improved their breastfeeding intentions and knowledge compared to baseline measurement (before intervention). However, 6 months after the education, their knowledge and intentions were less positive than shortly after education, as described in a previous report. The authors suggest that a team of experts be gathered to design a structured educational program that would be interesting to secondary school students. This program should also be adapted to students' age and interest.",

Sixty women with GH, i.e. 30 women with a dipping BP profile (control group) and 30 non-dippers (study group), were included in the study. Echocardiography was performed in all subjects, as well as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) during third trimester. ABPM was repeated 6-8 weeks after delivery. Thirteen women with preterm delivery were classified as non-dippers and only four as dippers (p=0.01). The average and peak systolic and diastolic night-time BP had negative linear correlation with birth weight (p<0.0005). Total vascular resistance (p<0.0005) and mass index (p=0.014) were significantly higher as compared with women with term delivery, while ejection fraction (EF) (p=0.007) and circumferential systolic velocity (p=0.042) were significantly reduced in the preterm delivery group. Multivariate binary logistic regression identified the average night-time systolic BP, left ventricular mass index and EF as independent predictors of preterm delivery. Study results suggested a relationship of the non-dipping BP pattern in GH with preterm delivery, birth weight, and maternal clinical findings.",

We aimed to determine the prevalence of PHPT in treated BC patients with low BMD and analyze the association of SCLs with histopathologic tumor features and cancer treatment. This retrospective study included postmenopausal BC patients examined at Osteoporosis Clinic between 2013 and 2020. Clinical and BMD data were collected from patient medical records. Patients with biochemical suspicion of PHPT underwent standard parathyroid imaging procedures. Nine out of 137 (6.6%) patients were diagnosed with PHPT; 8/9 patients underwent parathyroidectomy and one patient was advised to follow-up. Among the rest of 128 non-PHPT patients, higher SCLs showed a trend of positive association with higher tumor grade and axillary lymph node involvement, and received immunotherapy, although without statistical significance. We found a higher prevalence of PHPT in treated BC patients compared to the general population. Higher SCLs show a trend of positive correlation with some more aggressive histopathologic tumor features and with immunotherapy. The results of this study suggest that assessment of SCLs should be routinely performed to rule out PHPT in treated BC patients with low BMD.",

A retrospective study was performed to examine paraneoplastic dermatoses and accompanying malignancies based on skin manifestations and appropriate diagnostic evaluations. We recorded outcomes, current conditions, and surgical/oncologic treatments. Analysis revealed paraneoplastic dermatoses in 17 patients with various skin lesions, i.e. eczematous dermatitis, vasculitis, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, pruritus, chronic urticaria/angioedema, alopecia areata, flushing, bullous pemphigoid, dermatomyositis, and localized scleroderma (morphea). They were associated with different solid and hematologic malignancies (3 gastric, 2 prostate, 2 bladder, 2 thyroid, and 2 lymphoma), along with 1 case each of the following: lung, hepatocellular, esophageal, endometrial, kidney, and multiple myeloma. The majority of skin lesions gradually regressed after malignancy treatment. To our knowledge, our three cases of paraneoplastic eczematous dermatitis are the first to be associated with gastric, prostate and endometrial cancer. Additionally, we report a case of a patient with alopecia areata of the beard associated with thyroid cancer. Early malignancy detection based on skin markers makes early introduction of surgical/oncologic therapy possible and usually leads to skin lesion regression while reducing revolving door visits to specialists and the (financial) burden on the healthcare system.",

The mean number or organs per donor was also calculated. During the 2004-2008 period, the number of donors perbrain death persons was 5/unknown, 6/10, 8/13, 11/13 and 18/20; mean age 51, 50, 39, 48 and 44; donor rate per Central Intensive Care Unit deaths 5.9%, 5.6%, 5.8%, 10.4% and 12.1%; donor rate per all hospital deaths 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.5%, 1.5% and 1.9%; and number of organs per donor 1.6, 2.4, 2.6, 3.0 and 2.7, respectively. Study results showed a steady increase in the number of donors and organs per donor at Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital during the 2004-2008 period. More intensive education should be organized at medical schools and for medical professionals to identify brain death persons and potential donors.

We performed fractional measurements of airborne dust particles. The measured particles, which can potentially be inhaled, may have a specific negative effect on human health. Measurements were conducted in laboratory research facilities that simulated hospital conditions within a casting room and the associated waiting room. Measurements within the casting room were made using two particle collector devices and one laser photometer. The measurement for the simulated waiting room was performed using the same principles and devices. The collected plaster dust particles differed in aerodynamic diameter and concentration according to the various locations observed. The highest concentration of particles of all sizes was recorded at the site of cast sawing. There was direct correlation between distance from the source and concentration of airborne particles; this concentration was lowest in the waiting room. The concentrations of plaster dust recorded were lower than the recommended minimal limit values for total and respiratory fractions in Croatia. Accordingly, it can be assumed that sawing of plaster splints has no harmful health effects on the exposed patients and health personnel.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of central nervous system tumors in patients hospitalized at the Department of Neurology, Split University Hospital Centre, during a 10-year period. The study included data on 859 patients with the diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) tumor. Diagnosis was based on the routine CNS neuroimaging methods (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging). Access to patient medical records provided demographic and clinical data, continued by collection of data on potential lethal outcome of patients at the Registrar's Office. The study was conducted at the Department of Neurology, Split University Hospital Centre, from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. There were 448 male and 411 female patients. Median age at the diagnosis was 65 (range, 18-95) years. Primary CNS tumors were diagnosed in 527 patients, including 30 primary recurrent tumors, whereas 328 patients had metastatic tumors; in 4 cases, it was impossible to determine whether the tumor was a primary one or metastasis based on CNS neuroimaging. The primary tumors proved to be more common than the metastatic ones (χ2-test, p<0.05). Multiple tumor transplants were more common than solitary (211 vs. 117; the conclusion was made at a 95% level of confidence; χ2-test, p<0.05). The majority of metastases originated from the lung (bronchus and pleura cancer; 46.41%; χ2-test, p<0.05; 95% CI). The most common localization of CNS tumors was supratentorial. Based on the double-logarithmic model, we proved with statistical significance that there was an increase in the incidence of CNS tumors (p=0.001). The most common tumors studied were supratentorially localized meningiomas.",

This prospective study included 60 female patients older than 40 with blepharospasm, divided into two groups according to clinical symptoms. For fluorescein test, the surface under the ROC curve was 1.0 with standard error (SE) 0 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.940-1.0; for Schirmer test, the surface under the ROC curve was 0.817 with SE 0.0555 and 95% CI 0.696-0.905; for lissamine green test, the surface under the ROC curve was 0.813 with SE 0.056 and 95% CI 0.691-0.902; and for TBUT test, the surface under the ROC curve was 0.772 with SE 0.061 and 95% CI 0.645-0.870. According to the results of ROC curve, which determines the sensitivity and specificity of normal values, comparison of diagnostic tests for keratoconjunctivitis sicca used in this study showed that fluorescein test had the best sensitivity and specificity. Schirmer test should be avoided in patients with blepharospasm because its results are influenced by frequent blinking and are not appropriate for study interpretation. Despite the pathologic values of TBUT test (numerically), this test is still acceptable for patients with blepharospasm because its interval takes more time than the interval between two blinks.",

Staining of ocular surface with vital dyes such as fluorescein was used to determine ocular surface defects. Fluorescein stains the corneal epithelial defects, which were statistically less pronounced in the interventional group. In conclusion, comparison of the results between the two groups of patients may implicate that advanced blepharospasm has a protective effect on ocular surface.",

For the purpose of this research, we used a sociodemographic questionnaire containing the following information: age, gender, education level, work status, marital status and residence. Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale-Revised (DAS-R) was used to measure dental anxiety. Data distribution was tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, difference between the groups by ?χ2-test and one-way analysis of variance, and correlation of variables by logistic regression. In the study population, we found positive correlation between S-allele and total result in DAS-R questionnaire.

One month earlier, sunitinib therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma was initiated. During the first cycle of therapy, after three weeks of sunitinib 50 mg daily, symptoms started and she stopped taking the drug. At admission, laboratory tests revealed elevated serum and urine amylase, C-reactive protein, urea and creatinine, and lowered platelet and leukocyte counts and hemoglobin value. Urine test showed proteinuria, erythrocyturia, leukocyturia and granulated cylinder. The patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis grade III, acute renal failure grade II, pancytopenia and urinary infection, and was hospitalized for five days. She was treated symptomatically and with antibiotic therapy because of persistently elevated C-reactive protein and pathologic urinary sediment, which led to subjective and clinical improvement. Acute pancreatitis, renal insufficiency and pancytopenia are rarely described side effects of sunitinib therapy, and clear connection between these conditions and drug activity is not yet determined. Medical specialists who prescribe and treat patients with sunitinib should be aware of the possible occurrence of these conditions and perform regular checkups of sunitinib treated patients.",

    "abstract": "- Cervical ripening can be promoted in many ways, but mechanical methods are among the oldest. Like all other methods, this one also has its pros and cons. Disadvantages compared to pharmacological methods include some maternal discomfort upon manipulation of the cervix, a theoretical increase in the risk of maternal and neonatal infection from the introduction of a foreign body, potential disruption of a low-lying placenta, and increase in the need of oxytocin induction of labor. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of using cervical ripening balloon in preinduction on the mode of delivery. This was a longitudinal, cohort, intervention, non-randomized one center study. Inclusion criteria were term pregnancies with gestational diabetes, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, gestational hypertension/preeclampsia and pregnancies after 41 weeks of pregnancy. Preinduction of labor was performed in term pregnancies at Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center. Results in the first 150 women having undergone labor preinduction with cervical ripening balloon were included. Two-sided p values <0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS Version 20.0. The study included 150 women; one woman was excluded from further analyses due to conversion of fetal presentation (head to breech). Indications for labor preinduction were as follows: gestational diabetes, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, gestational hypertension/preeclampsia and pregnancies after 41 weeks of pregnancy. Women with normal vaginal delivery (96/149) had lower rates of gestational diabetes and oligohydramnios and used epidural analgesia more frequently. Women with dystocia (32/53) had a significantly longer labor duration and higher neonatal birth weight. In multivariate analysis, multiparity, greater cervical dilatation after balloon removal and use of epidural analgesia were associated with a decreased risk of cesarean section, while the presence of gestational diabetes and oligohydramnios was associated with an increased risk of cesarean section. We found this preinduction method safe and efficient, with a potential to increase the rate of vaginal deliveries.",

A total of 169 (3.29 %) patients experienced postoperative bleeding; 69 (40.82%) of them required revision in operating room under general anesthesia. The incidence of bleeding was highest in the 20.01-30 age group. Primary bleeding (<24 h) occurred in 39 (0.76%) and secondary bleeding in 130 (2.53%) patients. The highest incidence of secondary post-tonsillectomy and post-adenotonsillectomy hemorrhage was between day 6 and day 7 of the operation. There was no statistical significance between men and women in the day when bleeding occurred. In the group of patients requiring revision in the operating room under general anesthesia, 59 (85%) patients had no additional diagnoses that may have contributed to postoperative hemorrhage. Two cases of excessive post-tonsillectomy bleeding requiring suture ligation of the external carotid artery are reported. Hemorrhage following tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy is rare and occurs mainly 6 days after surgery. A vast majority of patients do not need revision in the operating room. Male patients aged 20-30 were found to have an increased risk of postoperative hemorrhage.",

    "abstract": "Although the use of commercially manufactured hormone therapy (HT) to treat menopausal symptoms has declined during the past 12 years, the use of custom compounded HT seems to have increased. A 39-year-old woman with refractory anemia sustained premature ovarian insufficiency following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. After systemic biologic treatment (azacitidine) and corticosteroid therapy, besides extreme climacteric symptoms (Green Climacteric Scale, 59) and impaired quality of life, she also had elevated liver enzymes. Therefore, she was not a candidate for oral HT. Treatment was started with 17-beta estradiol patch 0.5 mg (Climara) together with micronized progesterone intravaginally, 2x100 mg (Utrogestan) for 3 months. She was not satisfied, so the custom compound HT started with 17-beta estradiol 0.5 mg gel 2x/day and micronized progesterone in liposomal gel 100 mg/daily. She was much better but she complained of low libido, decreased sex drive and emotional instability, so 1% testosterone gel was added. Now she was completely satisfied, Green Climacteric Scale was 8 and liver enzymes were normal. In conclusion, custom compound HT has the possibility of tailoring and adjusting therapy to the individual need, which has been the everlasting goal in menopause medicine and should be a good option for special clinical cases.",

Patients present to a wide range of clinicians including general practitioner, emergency physician, ophthalmologist, neurologist, etc. There are two main clinical presentations of optic neuritis, typical and atypical. It is of great importance to distinguish these two types of optic neuritis in order to detect the underlying etiology and plan appropriate and timely treatment. We present a young female patient (36 years) admitted to Department of Ophthalmology due to visual loss on the left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging showed demyelinating lesions in frontal and parietal lobe, periventricularly, in mesencephalon and right cerebellar hemisphere, and left optic neuritis; magnetic resonance angiography was normal. The patient's history revealed renal dysfunction, hypothyroidism, and miscarriage in the 6th month of pregnancy due to eclampsia, and Fabry disease in family (mother and two sisters). She was transferred to the Department of Neurology for further evaluation of the demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system. The patient received corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 1 g) for 5 days with regression of visual disturbances on the left eye. After this acute treatment, the question of definitive diagnosis remained, along with further treatment of the underlying cause. Considering renal dysfunction, miscarriage, arterial hypertension, positive genetic and biochemical testing for Fabry disease in close relatives (mother), we suspected that she also had Fabry disease. She was tested and the results were positive. We concluded that optic neuritis was the first sign of Fabry disease in this case, reflecting acute atypical neuroinflammatory disease.",

Patients also suffer from depression and increased anxiety. Our purpose was to assess the neurorehabilitation effectiveness in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who underwent stem cell transplantation but refused physiotherapy due to depression. Disease progression was followed using the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale bimonthly for six months pre- and then post-stem cell transplantation. Psychological traits were assessed using six standardized tests. Quantitative electroencephalogram diagnostics was performed before the first and after the last neurofeedback session, and sessions were conducted on a 3-times-a-week basis. The physiotherapy protocol included proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, electrical modalities unit applied to the lumbar spine area, and breathing, relaxation and walking exercises, among others. Increased motivation and marked decrease in the pain level was associated with the patient's willingness to complete physiotherapy, which resulted in improvements in most neuromuscular deficits and in increased respiratory capacity. During the 12 post-rehabilitation months, progression of the disease decelerated, and a positive behavioral change was noted. The study suggested that neurofeedback could be used as a neurorehabilitation component of the personalized complex rehabilitation protocol in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

In a single center prospective study, we enrolled 249 patients with atrial fibrillation over a 12-month period. The aim of our study was to evaluate vitamin K antagonist use regarding the indication and adequate dose. Data on 249 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation were collected before general availability of novel oral anticoagulants. Out of 249 patients, 160 (64.2%) had indication for oral anticoagulant therapy. Only 81 (50.6%) patients had vitamin K antagonist in therapy, 12 (14.8%) of them in adequate dose. We also analyzed 129 patients aged over 75, of which 109 (84.4%) had absolute indication for oral anticoagulant therapy. Only 34 (31.2%) patients aged over 75 had been receiving vitamin K antagonist therapy and 6 (17.6%) had the International Normalized Ratio values within the proposed therapeutic interval. We found a significantly higher rate of anticoagulant therapy introduction in patients under 75 years (p=0.03), but there were no significant differences in the adequacy of anticoagulant therapy (p=0.89) between these two populations. Our results showed clear inadequacies of vitamin K antagonist treatment with a growing need for a wider use of novel oral anticoagulants.",

    "abstract": "Improving organization and patient care quality in intensive care units is increasingly important as intensive care unit diagnostic and therapeutic procedures account for a growing proportion of hospital services.We identified the lack of comprehensive national and international registries available in the contemporary literature.This paper aims to describe and analyze cardiac intensive care unit (CICu) network at the national level in Croatia and its comparison with more developed countries.Thirty-four representatives from all Croatian acute hospitals (response rate of 100%) filled in a web based questionnaire on CICu organization and competence during September and October 2016.Organization and available technical procedures for health care in general, and especially in very expensive CICu treatment, highly depends on gross domestic product (gdP) per capita.That is why one could expect that Croatia, with the second lowest gdP among european union countries and 4.7 CICu per million inhabitants will have worse results in this field in comparison with most of these countries.results such as one nurse responsible for a mean of 2.7 CICu patients, 52% of cardiologists among physicians during working hours but 37% during night shifts, 24/7 transesophageal echocardiography in only 26.5% of CICus, one-third without therapeutic hypothermia, and 23.5% without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment are some of these results, revealing much room for improvement.This representative, nationwide sample of Croatian CICus also demonstrated considerable variation of key elements of structures with respect to hospital size, academic status and financial issues, as well as a trend towards current guidelines.This kind of investigation is very important for proposing standards, reimbursement master plan, or quality assessment of the national health system.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to determine differences in anthropometric measurements, dietary habits, serum lipid and glucose levels in relation to high blood pressure (BP) among adolescent boys and girls in Croatia. The specific aim was to determine the effect of dietary habits and lifestyle on high BP in adolescents according to sex. The study included 260 (68.2%) adolescent girls and 121 (31.8%) boys with anthropometric data obtained (without missing values) from 246 girls and 111 boys. Participants answered questions from the questionnaire and anthropometric BP and blood test values were obtained. Non-parametric tests were used in analyses of reference intervals of systolic and diastolic BP in adolescent boys and girls according to age. High BP was defined as ≥90th percentile for adolescent girls and boys, with a value of ≥135/87.5 mm Hg. Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze differences in anthropometric and laboratory values between the groups of girls and boys with high (≤90th percentile) and normal BP. Increase in systolic and diastolic BP was noted in the adolescents. In girls, BP values showed a decreasing systolic and increasing diastolic BP trend with age. Girls with high BP had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) (p=0.020), waist circumference (WC) (p=0.002), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) (p=0.016), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (p=0.043), hip circumference (HC) (p=0.015), triglyceride (TG) levels (p=0.021), higher prevalence of unhealthy diet at school breakfast (p=0.008) and lower prevalence of eating fish (p=0.02). Boys with high BP had a significantly higher BMI (p=0.045), WC (p=0.004), WHtR (p=0.017), WHR (p=0.022) and higher prevalence of eating meat products (p=0.015). Effective health interventions are needed to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and preventing age-related illness.",

    "abstract": "Aging interventions will be ineffective if we do not understand the basic principles of aging. Currently, there is no consensus on the issue whether aging is programmed or not. The hypothesis presented in this article indicates that aging (at least graying of male hairs) is programmed. This hypothesis is supported by the symmetry of the graying of male beard hairs. According to stochastic theories of aging, aging is a passive non-programmed process where random dispersion of graying hairs should result. On the contrary, programmed theories of aging would predict that there should be symmetry on the left and right parts of the face showing the same proportion, pattern and time of appearance of graying hairs.",

Therefore, we performed lumbar puncture in order to measure intracranial pressure and evaluate cerebrospinal fluid. After lumbar puncture, the patient was complaining of pain in the lumbar region. Emergency magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral (LS) region was performed to show acute subdural hematoma of up to 7.3 mm in the dorsal part of the spinal canal at the level of L1 vertebra to the inferior endplate of L4 vertebra. Repeat LS MRI after 3 hours showed unchanged finding. The patient reported gradual regression of pain in the LS region over the next few days, therefore conservative treatment was applied. Patients with a previously known blood clotting disorder and patients on anticoagulation therapy have worse outcome as compared with patients without such disorders.

Dental plaque and pharyngeal erythema were correlated with shorter disease duration (p=0.048; p=0.040), while frictional keratosis of tongue was correlated with longer disease duration (0.011). Linea alba and pain in the temporomandibular joint were associated with younger age (p=0.012; p=0.024), and tooth impression on tongue with lower degree of nutrition (p=0.030). This study showed that there was a link among oral manifestations, age, disease duration and degree of nutritional disorder, although further investigations comparing the groups of ED patients with different age, disease duration and nutritional status would give better, concrete and precise conclusions.",

Multimodal intervention for smoking cessation was used and it consisted of the \"5 A's\" model (Ask, Advice, Assess, Assist, Arrange) for behavior change, printed self-help materials for smoking cessation, and telephone counseling (one, three and six months after discharge from the hospital). The main outcome of the study was smoking status at six months. A total of 103 participants were included in this pilot project. At six-month follow-up, 49% of participants self-reported continuous non-smoking. Among the remaining participants, 20 reported smoking reduction, 19 were still smoking, and 16 participants were unable to make contact with. In the logistic regression, among all analyzed variables, only two of them were positively associated with smoking cessation after six months: participants' response that they would like to quit smoking within the next six months (B=4.688; p=0.018) and answering that they did not smoke when they were ill and bed-ridden due to illness (B=3.253; p=0.020). Satisfaction with the intervention was very high; 70% of participants rated the intervention as 'excellent'. Therefore, multimodal smoking cessation intervention can be successfully introduced at hospital setting yielding high smoking abstinence rates at six months post-discharge and high level of user satisfaction. Healthcare workers who work in hospitals should be educated so they can provide such intervention on a regular basis.",

    "abstract": "Quality assessment of provided healthcare is becoming a standard in numerous health institutions worldwide, which is beneficial for both the patient and the institution. In order to achieve this standard, it is necessary to develop quality indicators in all segments of healthcare. Postdural puncture headache is a common complication following neuraxial blocks, especially in obstetric anesthesia. If severe, it is a cause of emotional and psychological distress and must be treated by a blood patch.The aim of this study was to determine whether the number of these complications is reduced when blood patch frequency is monitored and analyzed and to assess the effect of countermeasures in order to improve the quality and safety of regional anesthesia in obstetrics.Before 2009 and during that year at the University Hospital Sveti Duh, there had been a large number of severe postdural puncture headaches after spinal anesthesia and epidural analgesia treated by a blood patch in 6.12% of cases. After noticing the rising number of blood patches, we decided to analyses data every year. We recorded all blood patches injected to obstetric patients within the period of nine year, from 2009 to 2018 and concurrently we introduced a set of measures to improve the quality of neuraxial blocks, such as the use of atraumatic 26 or 27-gauge pencil-point spinal needles and modern neuraxial blockade protocols. Data were collected from anesthesiology and gynecology protocols and analyzed with MedCalc software, version 18.1.2.The frequency of blood patch applications has been reduced from 6.12% to 0.30%, which is statistically significant. The percentage of placed epidural catheters for vaginal birth increased from 21% in 2009 to 38% in 2018. Although not statistically significant, the number of pregnant women undergoing a caesarean section is also growing, while the total number of births is falling. The proportion of cesarean sections in spinal anesthesia varies from year to year.A statistically significant decrease in the number of installed blood patches clearly indicates the positive effect of measures taken to improve quality, which could contribute to the growing interest of pregnant women in childbirth in epidural analgesia. The number of placed epidural catheters is increasing despite the decline in the total number of deliveries and the increase in the number of deliveries completed by cesarean section.Monitoring the incidence of severe post-puncture headaches treated with blood patches has shown great progress in improving the quality and safety of regional anesthesia and analgesia in our institution, so we believe that monitoring the number of blood patches could serve as an indicator of regional anesthesia and analgesia in obstetrics. Monitoring the number of blood patches shows that the frequency of post-puncture headaches does not correlate only with the type of needle or epidural catheter used for neuroaxial blocks, but is also a sensitive indicator of any deviations from the achieved standards. Furthermore, it indicates the need for careful analysis of causes in order to adopt and implement appropriate countermeasures.",

In addition to the usual combination of epidural catheter and general anesthesia as standard techniques in surgical procedures accompanied by intense postoperative pain, we want to encourage reflection on the application of various regional techniques in equally complex surgical conditions. By simply modifying the standard neuraxial technique with a higher thoracic approach, excellent abdominal surgery can be performed to awake the patient. However, placement of an epidural catheter is not always possible due to technical difficulties or patient-related conditions that contraindicate its insertion. Trunk-level fascia blocks (PVB, ESPB, RLB) are simple, safe alternative to an epidural catheter because the transverse process, which is the target of ultrasound, is easily visualized and the injection site is away from neuroaxis, pleura, and large vascular structures. In addition, extensive craniocaudal diffusion of anesthetics allows wide coverage with a single injection. It has been confirmed that PVB, ESPB, RLB blocks act on visceral and somatic pain. Therefore, their ultrasound-guided use in laparoscopic and other abdominal surgeries may be useful. With a well-designed fusion of regional techniques in operations of the upper and lower abdomen, it is possible to achieve hemodynamically and respiratory stable anesthesia in an awake patient with reduced postoperative pain.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a widespread disease with various symptoms. It is defined as an inflammation of the nasal mucosa and paranasal sinuses lasting for 12 weeks, with symptoms of nasal obstruction and/or congestion and facial pain and/or pressure as well as decreased sense of smell. Despite the widespread prevalence of the disease, the diagnosis and treatment of CRS are still not adequately developed, so many patients remain misdiagnosed. This study involved 150 patients who, according to EPOS guidelines, met the diagnosis of CRS without nasal polyposis. Each patient underwent a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses, which was evaluated according to the Lund-Mackay scoring system. Furthermore, patients completed a visual analog scale (VAS) score questionnaire which examined the severity of their symptoms. The aim of this study was to find an association between the degree of mucositis and the clinical symptoms reported by the patient. Our results showed a low positive correlation between nasal secretion and Lund-Mackay score for the bilateral ostiomeatal complex (OMC). Furthermore, a low positive correlation was found between the severity of reduced sense of smell and severity of anterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinusitis. The results demonstrated a low negative correlation between the severity of facial pain or pressure and the severity of inflammation of the anterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinus. The results of statistical testing did not show statistical differences in severity of subjective symptoms for almost all of the observed symptoms in persons with unilateral inflammation and persons without unilateral inflammation, except for cough. People who did not have unilateral inflammation had a more pronounced cough compared with people who had unilateral inflammation. However, these correlations were very mild and not clinically significant, so we cannot say that the distribution of sinusitis significantly affects the occurrence of characteristic symptoms in chronic rhinosinusitis.",

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of crystalline glucosamine sulfate (CGS) in patients with knee OA. This open-label prospective study (with a 12-month follow-up) included 111 patients of both genders suffering from knee OA, who attended the Special Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Novi Sad, Serbia during the 2011-2013 period. Patients were divided into the experimental (n=52) and the control (n=59) group. While the former was prescribed CGS 1500 mg/day, the latter was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) according to the standard protocol. The efficacy of both treatment modes was assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Lequesne index, along with the radiological findings which involved knee joint space width (JSW) measurements. One year following the initial assessment, all patients reported pain intensity reduction; however, those in the CGS group experienced significantly lower pain intensity when compared with controls. At the end of the study, no reduction in the progression of joint structure damage (p>0.5) was noted in either group. Thus, while CGS demonstrated symptomatic efficacy, it failed to delay the progression of knee OA.",

In this study, we aimed to present the main neurologic symptoms in patients who were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The study was conducted retrospectively by phoning 156 patients in Turkey diagnosed with COVID-19 through real-time polymerase chain reaction; only 100 patients could be reached. Data about their demographics, initial symptoms, neurological symptoms, and sleeping habits were collected. During the disease process, 66% had at least one neurological symptom, 55% had central nervous system symptoms, 42% had peripheral nervous system symptoms, and 64% had sleep disturbances and myalgia. Impaired consciousness, smell and taste impairments, and sleep disturbances were significantly higher in patients with positive chest computed tomography imaging (p < 0.05). Neurological symptoms were observed in COVID-19, as in other coronaviruses. Headache in particular was the most common symptom in our population. In patients with respiratory system findings, the detection of certain neurological symptoms such as smell-taste impairments, impaired consciousness, and sleep disorders were more common. We concluded that COVID-19 patients should be approached in a more holistic way, taking the nervous system into account.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to connect the possible complications of early pregnancy (miscarriage and symptomatic ectopic pregnancy) up to the 12th week of gestation with biometeorological conditions while assuming a greater number of incidents with an unfavorable biometeorological forecast. We performed a retrospective observational study using medical data of a single medical center of Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Sveti Duh University Hospital and meteorological data from the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrometeorological Service in Zagreb. We tracked the number of visits to the gynecology and obstetrics emergency unit on a daily basis during 2017. Days with five or more visits were selected and underwent further analysis, during which the number of miscarriages and symptomatic ectopic pregnancies was noted. The information from the biometeorological forecast was then extracted and added to the database. Our results did not show a statistically significant difference between the groups determined by biometeorological forecast in the number of spontaneous abortions or ectopic pregnancy. Also, statistically significant results did not follow the expected trend of the increasing number of complications related to worse biometeorological forecast, or vice versa, a decreased number of complications with better forecast. Our single-center retrospective analysis of emergency unit visits related to weather conditions did not show a connection between the complications of early pregnancy and biometeorological conditions. However, different results could emerge in future studies. Considering the large and high-quality database collected for this study, efforts in researching the connection between other gynecologic pathologies and weather conditions will be feasible.",

Potassium levels were normal. Markedly elevated serum aldosterone level and elevated serum renin confirmed the diagnosis of pseudohypoaldosteronism. Renal ultrasound showed grade III hydronephrosis on the left kidney while contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography excluded the existence of vesicoureteral reflux, which raised suspicion of obstructive uropathy at the level of vesicoureteral junction. Serum sodium normalized after several days of intravenous fluids and antibiotic therapy, after which oral supplementation of sodium was introduced. The levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol and thyroid-stimulating hormone were normal. Functional magnetic resonance urography conducted at the age of 3 months confirmed the diagnosis of primary congenital obstructive megaureter and the infant was referred to a pediatric surgeon. Although a rare occurrence, S-PHA can be a potentially life-threatening condition in infants if not recognized and treated appropriately. Therefore, serum concentrations of electrolytes should be obtained in every child diagnosed with obstructive anomaly of the urinary tract and/or acute cystopyelonephritis. On the other hand, every child diagnosed with S-PHA should be evaluated for obstructive anomaly of the urinary tract.",

The groups were compared according to intubation time, heart rate, SpO2, EtCO2, airway pressure, surgical field of view, and recovery time. Both the insertion time and recovery time were shorter in the F-LMA group than in the ETT group (16.93±4.84 s vs. 23.93±8.74 s; and 10±2 min vs. 14.5±3 min; p<0.001 both). The airway pressure measurements at 5-min intervals were significantly lower in the F-LMA group than in the ETT group (p<0.001). F-LMA may be a useful alternative to ETT for adenotonsillectomy surgery because it is safe, provides shorter induction and recovery times, reduces intraoperative airway pressure, and provides an adequate operative field of view.",

    "abstract": "We investigated concentrations and roles of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its binding protein (IGF1BP-3), growth hormone (GH), insulin, and markers of insulin resistance and inflammation in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We aimed to assess any possible association between serum GH/IGF-1 axis following AMI and short-term survival rates. A follow up study was performed in 2010. Study group consisted of 75 patients with Killip I and II class AMI. There were 30 control subjects. Blood samples were obtained within 24 hours of admission and analyzed for the aforementioned hormones. Patients were followed-up during 6 months for new cardiac events. Median GH was higher in AMI (0.96; range 0.6-2.4) than in controls (0.26; p<0.001). IGF-1 was significantly lower in AMI (123 vs. 132; p<0.05), and so was the IGF-1/GH ratio (p<0.001) and IGF1BP-3. Insulin was higher in study group, but without statistical significance. However, we found significant between-group differences in other markers of insulin resistance (HbA1c, glycemia, HOMA-IR) and inflammation. Simple linear correlation showed positive correlation between GH and C-reactive protein. All patients with new cardiac events had IGF-1 below median and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. In conclusion, IGF-1 may affect outcome of AMI. GH resistance might be a result of inflammatory/immune response and therefore it could be a useful prognostic marker.",

The position of this ‚plug‘ component may be responsible for higher incidence of chronic pain and intestinal damage. We assumed that changing the position of the connector of a bilayer patch device (PHS®) and placing it medially in Hesselbach triangle would contribute to lower incidence of chronic pain and would not result in intestinal damage, with good clinical outcome following indirect inguinal hernioplasty. This retrospective study included 73 patients with 76 indirect inguinal hernias, who underwent the procedure of modifying the position of the bilayer patch device in the 2005-2015 period. The mean age of the patients was 57 years. Three patients had early postoperative complications (3.95%), two of which had postoperative seroma and one had postoperative pain. Three patients (3.95%) had late postoperative complications. One patient (1.32%) had chronic pain. There was one recurrence (1.32%) and one patient (1.32%) needed the mesh removed due to discomfort. The ‘plug free’ position of the connector of a bilayer patch device in patients with indirect inguinal hernioplasty is a safe procedure with low rate of chronic pain, no intestinal damage, and standard low recurrence.",

A total of 66 participants were evaluated in this prospective, controlled study, including 33 asymptomatic hyperuricemic patients who presented at our outpatient clinic between January and April 2020, and 33 normouricemic subjects matched for age, gender and body mass index. Participants with systemic diseases affecting uric acid level such as chronic renal failure, psoriasis, gout, etc., participants using drugs that can affect uric acid level, and those with knee complaints were excluded from the study. Cartilage thickness measurements were taken using musculoskeletal ultrasonography from the right medial condyle, right lateral condyle, right intercondylar area, left medial condyle, left lateral condyle and left intercondylar area. Distal femoral cartilage thickness was lower in all measurement areas in the asymptomatic hyperuricemia group than in the normouricemic group (p<0.05 all). No correlation was noted between uric acid levels and cartilage thickness in all measurement areas in either the asymptomatic hyperuricemic or normouricemic group (p>0.05 all). We think that distal femoral cartilages seem to be thinner in participants with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether asymptomatic hyperuricemia will lead to knee osteoarthritis in individuals, although we believe that people with asymptomatic hyperuricemia should be informed accordingly in order to prevent development of potential knee osteoarthritis.",

W aimed to evaluate the potential association between disease severity and HRQL impairment with the perceived acute psychological distress in newly diagnosed CR/CRS patients. This single-center cross-sectional study included otherwise healthy consecutive adults with newly diagnosed CR/CRS (European position paper on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyp criteria and International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology - Allergic Rhinitis criteria or non-allergic rhinitis), who were evaluated for CR/CRS symptom severity and HRQL (Sino Nasal Outcome Test 22 [SNOT-22], visual analog scale [VAS]) and acute perceived distress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]). Principal component analysis (SNOT-22 items, VAS) identified 6 components as CR/CRS severity indicators, i.e,, poor sleep, wakes-up tired, nasopharynx, obstruction, torment and rhinorrhea, which were evaluated for association with PSS score. Of the 63 included patients (20 men, age median 38, range 19-75 years), 27 suffered from CR and 36 from CRS. Upon adjustment for age and sex, higher total SNOT-22 (geometric means ratio [GMR]=1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06), higher \"torment\" (GMR=1.13, 1.04-1.24), higher \"poor sleep\" (GMR=1.11, 1.02-1.21) and higher \"wakes-up tired\" (GMR=1.11, 1.01-1.21) scores were each associated with a higher PSS score, overall and consistently in CR and CRS patients. In conclusion, more severe CR/CRS is associated with greater perceived psychological distress already at earlier stages of the disease. Paying attention to patient level of distress and anxiety over time may enable better understanding of the connection between exacerbations, symptom severity and psychological burden of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions with quadriceps tendon (QT) grafts are gaining popularity, both in primary and revision procedures. Recently, the role of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee in improving rotational knee stability has been emphasised and concurrent ACL and ALL reconstruction is advocated. In this paper, a new technique utilising the QT and the plantaris tendon (PLT) for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is analysed. Patients that underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction using QT and PLT grafts in a 3-years period were prospectively analysed. A total of 9 patients with 6 months minimum follow-up were assessed with Lachman and Pivot shift clinical tests, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale. One patient had reconstructed ACL re-rupture at the final follow-up visit, leaving 8 patients with a mean follow-up of 19±8 months. There was a significant improvement in anteroposterior and rotational stability in all the patients. The IKDC, KOOS, and Lysholm scores improved as well. The Tegner activity scale increased postoperatively, however, it did not reach preinjury values. QT and PLT grafts are valuable alternatives for currently used grafts in combined ACL and ALL reconstructive procedures. This new technique is a reasonable option in ACL revision surgery and a good alternative in primary ACL and ALL reconstruction, especially when hamstring grafts are not advised or they are missing.",

    "abstract": "According to the International Continence Society, stress (static) urinary incontinence is defined as any involuntary loss of urine on effort or physical exertion, due to which intravesical pressure overcomes urethral pressure, with no detrusor activity. Urodynamic testing accurately assesses the function of the bladder and urethra. The urodynamic assessment includes three tests: cystometry, uroflowmetry and profilometry (determination of urethral pressure profile). Prior to urodynamic assessment, it is mandatory to rule out urinary tract infection since it is an invasive test. Urethral profilometry is a technique that measures pressure in the urethra and bladder at rest, during stressful actions, and during the act of miction. Its main purpose is to evaluate the sphincter mechanism. During the examination, a special catheter is used, which is being slowly pulled out from the bladder neck throughout the urethra, with continuous recording of intraurethral pressure. In addition to measuring urethral pressures, stress urinary incontinence is also very successfully proven by the cough test and Bonney test. If, on forced cough, the urine escapes uncontrollably, and continence is restored by finger lifting the neck of the bladder, the diagnosis of static incontinence is confirmed. At our urogynecologic clinic, urodynamic examination is being routinely performed. In the present study, we included patients previously treated for urinary stress incontinence and compared their results of urodynamic assessment to the results of Bonney test. Of the 43 subjects in whom stress incontinence was proven with Bonney test, we recorded an appropriate profilometry result in 13 cases.",

With the introduction of laser enucleation techniques in prostate surgery, previous standard surgical procedures (open retropubic or transvesical adenectomy and transurethral resection of the prostate) have become less relevant, especially in case of very large prostates. The objective of this paper is to describe the experience and results of thulium:YAG laser application in BPH treatment in our department. In the last five years, 246 patients underwent thulium:YAG laser enucleation of the prostate (ThuLEP) due to BPH or lower urinary tract symptoms following complete urologic evaluation. The mean age of our patients was 73 (range 51-95) years and mean duration of surgery was 92 minutes. The mean weight of enucleated tissue was 73 grams. A low rate of intraoperative and early postoperative complications and short length of stay proved minimal invasiveness of this procedure, which results in significant improvements in urodynamic parameters and substantially reduces the post-void residual urine volume. The most important surgical and technical characteristics (enucleation and low-power laser application) make ThuLEP a safe and efficient surgical method not limited by the prostate volume. ThuLEP has a potential to displace the current standard surgical procedures to treat BPH.",

One of the imperatives is the patient's quality of life after treatment. Inadequately treated acute postoperative pain leads to a worse treatment outcome and the development of chronic pain. The incidence of chronic pain after surgical treatment of breast cancer is high and negatively affects the quality of life of patients in the long term. Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) is a relatively new ultrasound-guided regional analgesia technique. SAPB represents an alternative to an epidural, and to paravertebral and intercostal blocks. This review aims to describe serratus anterior plane block for breast surgery and emphasize their short- and long-term benefit. For this review, we searched MEDLINE in November 2022 to identify metanalyses, randomized controlled trial systemic reviews, and reviews published in the last five years. The search for metanalyses yielded 4 results; 12 results were found for randomized controlled trials; 5 results for reviews; and 4 results for systematic reviews. When employing SAPB in patients after mastectomy, good analgesia is achieved in the early postoperative period and the incidence of chronic pain is reduced, thus improving quality of life.",

The incidence of CPOP is the highest after amputations, inguinal hernioplasty, thoracotomies, cardiac surgery and breast surgery. In addition to surgical factors, the other risk factors are: female gender, younger age, preoperative pain, psychological state and acute postoperative pain. The most common expression of CPOP is neuropathic pain after surgical trauma. The treatment of chronic postoperative neuropathic pain (CPNP) is difficult. Various methods have been recommended for its prevention, the most important being techniques that avoid nerve damage and adequate perioperative analgesia. The goal of this review was to discuss data from published studies examining the incidence, risk factors and mechanisms of CPOP, with a focus on surgery, the unique opportunity to implement pharmacological strategies for prevention of CPNP and current pharmacotherapy approaches for treatment of CPNP. Commonly used drugs to prevent and treat CPNP in the current clinical setting are: opioids, α2-adrenergic agonists, cyclooxygenase antagonists, gabapentin, pregabalin, steroids, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists and local anesthetics.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the possible association between cheilitis and allergic reactions, and to use allergy skin tests to identify the allergens that induce allergic reactions in cheilitis patients (type I and type IV). We included 50 patients with recurrent cheilitis (reversible cheilitis) who were dermatologically examined and agreed to undergo allergy skin tests, i.e., patch test and prick test. Additionally, clinical pictures and patient mental stress levels were examined using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Positive prick tests (atopy) were recorded in 84% of patients with cheilitis. The most frequently found allergens were contact allergens (54%) (cobalt chloride, nickel sulfate and thimerosal) and inhalant allergens (46%). The patch test positive subjects who used cosmetic, hygiene, and decorative products were significantly more likely to have swollen and red lips than the patch test negative subjects. Also, low stress levels were recorded less frequently in patients with confirmed allergies than in non-allergic patients. The results indicated a higher incidence of cheilitis in the people prone to allergies (atopics) and confirmed an association between cheilitis and allergies. To our knowledge, this is the first study in patients with cheilitis, which simultaneously analyzed allergies, their clinical features and PSS in the same patients.",

Recurrent BAO has been described in only a small number of cases. We present a case of repeated mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for the tip of basilar artery (BA) reocclusion within 24 hours. A previously healthy 37-year-old male presented with occipital headache, nausea, vomiting, right-sided hemiparesis, within 30 minutes from the onset and NIHSS 18. The patient was vaccinated against COVID-19 with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine seven days before the onset. On initial computed tomography (CT) scan, the pc-ASPECTS was 10 and CT angiography (CTA) showed the tip of BA thrombosis. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy was administered, followed by MT, achieving mTICI 3 and NIHSS 5 after the procedure. Within 24 hours from the first MT, there was neurological deterioration followed by coma. Urgent CT/CTA was performed and rethrombosis of BA was confirmed with pc-ASPECTS 10. MT was repeated with mTICI 2b. Stroke etiology was undetermined. After 17 days, the patient was discharged and referred to continue rehabilitation treatment. After 90 days of stroke, his NIHSS was 2 and mRS 1. We can consider that early recurrent BAO can be successfully treated with repeated MT.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to tumors in children, between 6% and 20% of all brain tumors in adults arise solitary in the posterior cranial fossa. Given their rarity in adults, as well as the importance and complexity of their treatment, this paper reviews and discusses the clinical and surgical characteristics of such tumors. In a retrospective single-institution observational study, adult patients with posterior fossa tumors treated surgically over a ten-year period were analyzed. The characteristics observed were age and gender distribution, clinical symptoms, histopathologic tumor type, tumor size, location and extent of surgical resection, tumor recurrence and postoperative complications, as well as surgical outcome. Sixty-six patients who underwent surgical treatment were diagnosed with a tumor in the posterior fossa. The mean age was 63 years, and patients were evenly distributed by gender. The most common histopathologic type was metastatic tumor (59.1%), whereas meningioma was the most common primary brain tumor (16.6%) recorded. Most patients presented with vegetative and cerebellar symptoms in general and cranial nerve palsy, especially in the occurrence of vestibular schwannoma. In conclusion, posterior fossa tumors grow in a confined space and therefore may directly threaten vital centers in their immediate vicinity. Thus, it is crucial to schedule an appropriate surgical intervention as soon as possible, as it can significantly improve treatment outcome and prognosis of the disease. If possible, meticulous total tumor resection should be the treatment of choice. In the case of hydrocephalus, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt should be considered as an alternative surgical option after tumor resection.",

Glucose and sodium concentrations of 283 patients admitted in critical condition to the Intensive Care Unit of the Department of Internal Medicine in a period from November 1, 2015 to February 28, 2017 were reviewed. The most common diagnoses in critically ill patients were acute kidney injury (26.1%) and sepsis (including septic shock, 22.3%). Significantly lower glucose concentration was observed in patients with acute kidney injury (p=0.02), whereas patients in sepsis and septic shock had a significantly higher sodium concentration (p=0.04). Higher glucose level was related to higher mortality rate (p=0.001). On the other hand, sodium level was not significantly associated with survival. Higher mortality, as well as higher glucose concentration were more common in patients older than 65 years (p<0.001). Study results showed significantly lower glucose concentrations in patients with acute kidney injury, whereas in patients older than 65, glucose concentration was significantly higher. Patients in sepsis and septic shock had significantly higher sodium concentrations. Higher concentration of glucose was connected with higher mortality in the elderly, whereas sodium concentration did not show connection with mortality.",

Cemented, uncemented and hybrid methods of implant fixation can be used with different chances for implant survival. There is no consensus on the best fixation method. The aim of the study was to compare the groups of uncemented and hybrid implants according to survival, revision risk and revision cause. Until October 2015, a total of 199 THA uncemented and hybrid (uncemented acetabulum, cemented femur) implants implanted during the 1995-2003 period that had revision or last x-ray taken at least seven years after the initial operation were included in the study. Revision rate, risk factors, revision cause and revised components were investigated. A significant difference was found in the revision rate, i.e., 48 (27.9%) in uncemented group versus 13 (48.1%) in hybrid group (p=0.032). The relative risk for revision was significantly higher (RR=1.72; 95% CI: 1.09-2.73; p=0.019) in hybrids, most often due to loosening (p=0.004). The linear wear of polyethylene was the main cause of revision in uncemented THA (p<0.001). In hybrid group, larger revision replacing the femoral component was most often performed. Uncemented THA showed a lower revision rate, lower revision risk, and required 'minor' revisions compared to the hybrid ones.",

Podocytes play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HN, thus, nephrin could be important in the early diagnosis of HN. The aim of the study was to investigate the association of urinary nephrin (u-nephrin) levels with clinical and laboratory characteristics in patients with HN and to test diagnostic relevance of u-nephrin as an early biomarker of HN. In this cross-sectional study, 114 subjects were recruited, 84 patients with chronic hypertension (CH) and 30 healthy controls. All patients with CH were classified according to the urinary microalbumin/creatinine ratio (UM/CR) and according to the chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage. Urine samples were collected to estimate the u-nephrin level by ELISA and to determine UM/CR. Blood samples were used for biochemical analyses. We found elevated u-nephrin in 78.3% of normoalbuminuric subjects with CH. The levels of u-nephrin increased gradually with the stage of CKD. ROC curve plotted for u-nephrin showed 89.7% sensitivity and 88.8% specificity, while UM/CR showed a sensitivity of 44.8% and specificity of 86.1% to detect HN in the early stage. It is concluded that u-nephrin can be useful as an early biomarker of HN.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to measure sphenoid sinus volume on the basis of computed tomography data post processing and to investigate the possible relationship with age, gender and mastoid pneumatization. Sphenoid sinus volume was measured using the semi-automatic post processing algorithm of MSCT DICOM datasets of 66 patients. There were 35 female and 31 male subjects. Median age was 54 (range 17-84) years. Datasets were selected retrospectively from computer archives of our hospital radiology department. Subjects with healthy sphenoid sinuses were included. Relationship of total sphenoid volume with age, gender and mastoid pneumatization was analyzed. Data acquisition was performed using Siemens Somatom Emotion scanner. Measurements were performed using volumetric module of Syngo 2006G software. Virtual endoscopy and three-dimensional volume rendering were also performed. Median sphenoid total volume (left and right together) was 10.12 cm3. Median volume of the right mastoid was 4.86 cm3 and 5.31 cm3 on the left side. We found a significant positive correlation between total sphenoid volume and both left and right mastoid pneumatization (Spearman ρ=0.528, p<0.001 and ρ=0.450, p<0.001, respectively). Sphenoid volume was positively correlated with age, but without statistical significance (ρ=0.186; p=0.136). Sphenoid volumes were larger in males than in females, but mastoid air cells showed no gender difference. In conclusion, volumetric measurements of paranasal sinuses may be accurately performed on the basis of MSCT data post processing. Sphenoid volume was positively correlated with mastoid pneumatization and age. Virtual endoscopy and 3D volume rendering may accurately display anatomic structures of sphenoid sinuses.",

Changes of mean blood flow velocities (MBFV) in posterior cerebral arteries during visual stimulation in a group of 51 healthy, right-handed volunteers. There were 27 males (52, 9%) and 24 females (47, 1%) aged from 20 to 59 years. Mean age of group was 36, 98 years with a standard deviation (SD) of 10, 43 years. Measurements were made with handheld 2 MHz probe using Transscan 3D EME Doppler (TCD) device. PCA was identified and insonated through temporal window using standard technique while volunteers had their eyes wide open and closed and while watching white light. In half of volunteers measurements were performed first on the right side and continued on the left side, while in the other half the procedure was reversed. Statistical analysis was made using Wilcoxons Matched-pairs Signed-rank test. MBFV mean value in left PCA was 41, 2 + 8, 6 cm/s (mean + 2SD) with eyes wide open, 27, 8 + 8, 5 cm/s with eyes closed and 42, 3 + 9, 1 cm/s while watching light.

The difference between eyes open and eyes closed in left PCA and between eyes open and white light was statistically significant (p<0, 041). The difference between eyes open and eyes closed in right PCA was statistically significant (p<0, 041) but there was no significance between eyes open and white light in right PCA (p=0, 03). The results show that simple visual stimulation has the influence on blood flow velocities in PCA that could be measured with TCD.",

    "abstract": "Two decades after the initial encouraging reports on plasmapheresis in myasthenia gravis, neurologic diseases represent the most common indication for therapeutic plasma exchange. Recent studies have not only established the therapeutic importance of plasmapheresis, but have also set new standards for the management of autoimmune neurologic disorders. Plasmapheresis has proved beneficial in autoimmune neurologic diseases such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and paraprotein-associated polyneuropathy. In some other diseases, e.g., multiple sclerosis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, plasmapheresis cannot be considered a generally accepted therapeutic option. However, in chronic autoimmune diseases such as progressive multiple sclerosis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, plasmapheresis is recommended in patients whose condition continues to worsen despite immunosuppressive drug therapies, and in those for whom it is desirable to reduce the dose of corticosteroids to avoid long-term complications. Based on the initial studies, plasmapheresis in conjunction with immunosuppressive drug therapies is now standard therapy for Eaton-Lambert syndrome.",

    "abstract": "In the pivotal clinical trials of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) therapy, a low rate of early arterial recanalization was suspected because only a few stroke patients may have had early dramatic clinical improvement. Tissue plasminogen activator activity can be enhanced with ultrasound, including 2 MHz transcranial Doppler (TCD). Transcranial Doppler identifies residual blood flow signals around thrombi, and, by delivering mechanical pressure waves, exposes more thrombus surface to circulating TPA. For the first time in clinical medicine, the international multicenter CLOTBUST trial showed that ultrasound enhances the thrombolytic activity of a drug in humans, thereby confirming multidisciplinary experimental research conducted worldwide for the past 30 years. In the CLOTBUST trial, the dramatic clinical recovery from stroke coupled with complete recanalization within 2 h after TPA bolus occurred in 25% of patients treated with TPA+TCD compared with 8% who received TPA alone (P=0.02). Complete clearance of a thrombus and dramatic recovery of brain functions during treatment are feasible goals for ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis that can lead to sustained recovery. An early boost in brain perfusion seen in the target CLOTBUST group resulted in a trend of 13% more patients achieving favorable outcome at 3 months. To further enhance the ability of TPA to break up thrombi, current ongoing clinical trials include phase II studies of 2 MHz TCD with ultrasound contrast agents or (microbubbles): TCD+TPA+Levovist; TCD+TPA+MRX nano-platform (C(3)F(8)). Intra-arterial TPA delivery can be enhanced with 1 x 7-2 x 1 MHz pulsed wave ultrasound (EKOS catheter, IMS trial). Dose escalation studies of microbubbles, ultrasound exposure, and the development of an operator-independent ultrasound device are underway.",

    "abstract": "Patients with atrial fi brillation have a 4 to 5-fold increased risk of stroke due to embolism of thrombus in the left atrium [1]. Stroke risk varies depending on the presence or absence of several risk factors for cardiovascular disease [2,3], which were also used for creating a risk stratifi cation schemes for thromboembolism. Th e risk of thromboembolism is devided into low, intermediate, and high risk strata [4]. Given the limitations of oral anticoagulation treatment with vitamin K antagonists, such risk stratifi cation allows clinicians to target patients at “high risk” for treatment with vitamin K antagonists. For the intermediate risk category, guidelines recommend treatment with vitamin K antagonists or aspirin, and aspirin is recommended for the low risk category. Schemes for stratifying the risk of stroke have been largely derived from non-anticoagulation arms of clinical trial cohorts, in which many potential thromboembolic risk factors were not recorded. In these historical trials, less than 10% of patients screened were randomised, and over the past 15-20 years the evolution of risk schemes has not improved their predictive value for patients at high risk [5].",

    "abstract": "Roe deer fibropapillomatosis is mainly a benign neoplastic disease caused by papillomaviruses. Previously, based on the gross appearance of the lesions, such skin tumors were usually classified by practitioners as fibromas and papillomas. On the other hand, a part of the literature describes these lesions as fibropapillomas. The aim of the study was to determine histologic characteristics of the lesions in roe deer in order to improve the knowledge of the appearance of papillomavirus induced neoplastic lesions in roe deer in Croatia. As part of the surveillance of wildlife diseases, three roe deer with few clearly visible skin lesions were presented to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. Gross examination was taken on the field, while samples of the lesions were alcohol fixed and submitted for histopathologic analysis (routine HE staining). Grossly, lesions were ranging in size from 1.5 to 19 cm. Some of these lesions were covered with intact skin, while in others the surface was hyperkeratotic and hyperpigmented with several ulcerations. Histopathologic analysis revealed elements that are characteristic of both fibromas and papillomas. Roe deer fibropapillomatosis is present in Croatia as an endemic disease, similarly to other European countries. It is a benign, in wild animals incurable disease, which depending on the location of the lesions can, with duration of the disease, cause severe or minor effects on the overall health and survival rate of the affected individual. From the results obtained, it is concluded that the majority of analyzed lesions contain both fibromatous and papillomatous characteristics, and therefore we find the term fibropapillomatosis suitable to describe this condition. Systematic survey and detailed examination of papillomavirus induced neoplasms is necessary for better understanding of its epidemiology.

    "abstract": "SUMMARY ∑ Fractures of the proximal femur are a substantial problem in the elderly. These fractures primarily are due to bone fragility in the elderly caused by osteoporosis. This population is burdened with numerous chronic illnesses that aggravate and complicate surgical treatment of the injured. According to latest figures, death rates among patients with these fractures are by 15% higher than in those free from these injuries, and 20% of the injured will never be able to walk independently again. According to our own experience and literature data, surgical treatment significantly reduces the mortality of the injured and improves their quality of life by providing by far better functional results than conservative treatment. Results of operative treatment for proximal femur fractures were compared between two periods of time at a 10-year interval (1988/1989 and 1998/1999). Comparison between these two time periods showed the frequency of hospital admission and operative treatment for this pathology to have increased by more than 100% in 10 years, so that at present this group of patients account for more than 45% of the capacity and operative schedule of the Division of Traumatology, Department of Surgery, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital in Zagreb. During the latter 2-year period (1998/1999), there were 372 injured in total, 78 (21%) of them male and 294 (79%) female, mean age 73 years (69 in male and 79 in female patients). The mean duration of hospitalization was 15 days with 5-day waiting for the operation. During the same time period, eight (2%) patients were treated conservatively. A 2.5% (n=9) perioperative mortality rate was recorded. Fracture of the neck of femur was found in 152 (41%) patients; 47% of them were treated by use of partial hip prosthesis, 10% with total hip prosthesis, and 42% with a 130-degree angle plate. Out of 205 pertrochanteric fractures, 130-degree angle plate was used in 50%, 95-degree angle plate in 22%, and dynamic hip screw in 28% of cases. Operative treatment combined with a well planned rehabilitation program consistent with the type of surgery and individual patient condition has evident and great advantages, and has been recognized as the treatment of choice for this pathology.",

The aim of the study was to explore the new technique of three-dimensional ultrasound for carotid stiffness evaluation. This pilot investigation was conducted in ten healthy volunteers. Measurements were performed in common carotid artery (CCA) on an Aloka 5500-SSD Prosound ultrasound platform in B and M modes. Data were collected freehandedly over 10 seconds and postprocessing analysis was performed using TomTec Imaging software. Beta indexes were mathematically computed and statistically evaluated by use of nonparametric statistics for two related samples. There were nine women and one man aged 39.3‐9.2 years. There was one borderline hypertensive subject and four subjects were active smokers. The mean body mass index was 23.85‐5.83 kg/m 2 , and mean intima-media thickness on CCA bilaterally 0.42‐0.06 mm. Statistically, comparison between conventional and three-dimensional ultrasound corroborated consistency in the left CCA (p>0.05). This investigation proved that three-dimensional ultrasound could be used as a complementary method for evaluation of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis, with a greater sensitivity in the left CCA.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n There is no doubt that treatment of hypertension has a significant role in the prevention of stroke. Recently published data from large, randomized clinical trials show that lowering of blood pressure is associated with a significant decrease in the risk of stroke. Reduction in the risk of stroke varies from approximately one quarter to approximately one third, depending on the study. Furthermore, besides blood pressure lowering it seems that the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium antagonists could provide some additional beneficial effects. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers could improve endothelial function, cardiac and vascular remodeling, thus retarding the progression of atherosclerosis. Calcium antagonists, especially the highly lipophilic ones, may have some antioxidant properties. They reduce the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and its influx into the arterial wall. Amlodipine, lacidipine or nifedipine suppress platelet production in hypertensive patients. Therefore, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium antagonists could be potential antiatherosclerotic agents. Considering all these data, it could be assumed that a wider use of these drug classes could significantly improve our ability to prevent all vascular diseases, stroke in particular. Data from recently published large randomized clinical trials shed bright light on stroke prevention in the forthcoming future.",

All major vocal fold pathology develop in this space, and a scar or edema in this space is always combined with significant vibratory and acoustic alteration. In spite of this fact, the specificities of Reinkeis space structure have not been discovered for years. In the present study, the highly specific Reinkeis space structure was demonstrated by use of horizontal serial sections through the vocal fold of human adult larynges. It was found to be composed of parallel connective fibers organized in three layers, each layer characterized by a different ratio in the number of collagenous versus elastic fibers. Only a vocal fold with such a regular and specific Reinkeis space structure can produce normal human voice.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is the most serious iatrogenic complication resulting from ovarian stimulation. Currently there is no clear evidence of absolute efficacy for most of standard preventive and curative methods. Recent studies indicate that human chorionic gonadotropin increases vascular endothelial growth factor, vascular endothelial cadherin and vascular permeability via endothelial adherence junctions. Vascular endothelial growth factor plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of the condition and therefore vascular endothelial factor antagonism has been suggested for the prevention of the syndrome. Since vascular endothelial growth factor is also a physiological regulator of folliculogenesis, progesterone secretion and endometrial angiogenesis, its complete inactivation by specific blockers could produce undesirable effects interfering with early pregnancy development and therefore they cannot be used clinically. Recently, low doses of dopamine agonists (cabergoline) have been shown to counteract vascular endothelial growth factor induced vascular hyperpermeability, reducing the incidence of the syndrome by prophylactic treatment without compromising pregnancy outcome. The absence of undesirable side effects could make cabergoline an effective and safe etiologic approach for the prevention and treatment of the syndrome. A novel approach has suggested that metformin may also be helpful in the syndrome prevention in women with or without polycystic ovary disease.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY – Although osteochondritis dissecans of the knee has been known for a long time, we still do not fully understand why it develops. Th is prompted us to present and describe an example of osteochondritis dissecans identifi ed in the Osteological Collection of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Th e case of osteochondritis dissecans described in this report was recovered from the Gluvine kuce cemetery in the Dalmatian hinterland, approximately 28 km north-east of Split. A total of 77 graves were excavated and the individual exhibiting osteochondritis dissecans was recovered from grave number 16 that belongs to the younger phase of the cemetery that lasted during the second half of the 9 th century A.D. Osteochondritis dissecans was noted in a subadult individual. Th e pathological changes consistent with osteochondritis dissecans are present on both medial femoral condyles. Th e lesion on the right femoral condyle is an oval crater-like defect with well defi ned margins and a porous fl oor of rough trabecular bone. Th e lesion on the left femoral condyle is basically, with two small provisions, identical to the one on the right side. Th e fi rst is that it is slightly smaller, while the second is that unlike its antimere, it has a well preserved bone fragment that fi ts perfectly into the ostechondritic pit. Radiographic analyses of the femoral condyles support a diagnosis of osteochondritis dissecans and show a well-demarcated radiolucent defect in the articular surfaces of both joints surrounded by a thin sclerotic repair zone. According to the classifi cation systems this degree of change corresponds to stage 3 or grade 3 osteochondritis dissecans – a detached but non-displaced fragment. Returning, for a second, to the opinion that prompted us to present this case, it is clear that during the last 1100 years there have been no signifi cant morphological or radiological changes in the characteristics of osteochondritis dissecans.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are mesenchymal neoplasms most frequently found in the stomach and presenting without symptoms or with unspecific ones such as hemorrhage and abdominal pain. The malignant potential of GIST is variable and there are several prognostic indexes for treatment and follow up. The superior diagnostic method is endoscopic ultrasound combined with fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA) immunocytochemistry. Surgery is the preferable treatment option, while recurrent or advanced disease is best managed with thyrosine kinase inhibitors. We report a case of a 20-year-old man that presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy detected a submucosal lesion and computerized tomography revealed a node near the liver. EUS-FNA immunocytochemistry found CD-117 positive cells suggestive of GIST and the patient was operated on. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology with immunostaining. Prognostic assessment was done according to tumor size and Ki-67 index with mitosis count on microscopy. Many studies have shown that tumors demonstrate an abnormal number, structure and occurrence of connexin proteins with altered connexin-mediated intercellular communication. Since a great deal of gastroenterological tumors express connexin 43, our aim was to find out whether it was present in GIST. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was positive for connexin 43, which was not previously described as typical. The early postoperative course was uneventful, free from complications. At three-year postoperative follow-up, the patient was subjectively well and without clinical signs of disease recurrence.",

Study results showed that distribution of glaucoma patients was not equal across the groups. The prevalence of POAG in all patients was 5.6%, whereas in patients with positive family history of POAG it was 14%, which was statistically significantly higher than in patients with diabetes and myopia (4% both), as well as in control group. The difference was greatest in comparison to control group. There was no statistically significant difference in glaucoma incidence between the group of patients with positive family history (14%) and patients with systemic hypertension (6%). The results obtained suggest that of all risk factors analyzed, positive family history of POAG is the most important risk factor for glaucoma development in all risk groups.",

Long-term seizures with secondary generalization can cause memory problems. Numerous studies demonstrate the connection of memory damage and lateralization in medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, the results were not always consistent with the material-specific memory model. A possible explanation for these inconsistent data is the insufficient control of psychological variables that can affect memory. In most of the previous studies in persons with epilepsy, they were not controlled for their emotional states such as anxiety and depression. We used the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) as a measure of visual memory, Beck's depression inventory as a measure of depressive symptoms, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory as a measure of anxiety in 57 consecutive participants. Our aim was to investigate whether there is difference in visual memory with respect to the left and right TLE, and whether the participants of different gender with higher anxiety and depression rates would achieve different results on visual memory. Persons with lower levels of depression achieved better scores in the Immediate and Delayed recall subtests of the RCFT. We also explored the potential gender differences. Testing differences between the persons with higher and lower anxiety levels did not reveal any significant differences in any of the measures tested.",

All patients underwent standard device interrogation followed by CRT optimization by IEGM method and by echocardiography one month after implantation. The patient mean age was 60.7±11.8 years and there were 33 (68.8%) males. After CRT implantation, the left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 28.0±7.9% to 39.1±11.0% (p<0.001). Optimal aortic flow Velocity Time Integral (aVTI) was obtained when VV was set to 20-50 ms left ventricular pre-activation. There was a strong correlation between VV values determined by echocardiography and IEGM (R=0.823, p<0.001). We found no significant difference in AV, VV and aVTI values between echocardiography and IEGM method. However, IEGM was significantly less time-consuming than echocardiography [20 (10-28) vs. 40 (35-60) minutes, p<0.001]. Manual IEGM method may be good alternative to echocardiography and automated IEGM method.

A retrospective study was conducted at Zadar General Hospital from Zadar and Dubrava University Hospital from Zagreb. Medical charts of all patients admitted to Medical Departments in two periods, before and after implementation of the ACCP9 guidelines, were analyzed. The ACCP9 guidelines were made available to all physicians through the hospital electronic information system immediately after the publication. The Hospital Drug Committees promoted implementation of the guidelines during their periodical clinical visits. Overall, 850 patients were included in the study in two periods. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of high-risk patients receiving thromboprophylaxis after the guidelines implementation in either hospital. In both periods, a signifi-cantly higher number of high-risk patients received thromboprophylaxis in Dubrava University Hos-pital in comparison with Zadar General Hospital (31.7% vs. 3.8% and 40.3% vs. 7.3%, respectively; p<0.001). This study revealed insufficient implementation of evidence-based thromboprophylaxis guidelines in clinical practice in two Croatian hospitals.",

This prospective study included 35 patients that underwent mastectomy for breast cancer, followed by 3-month treatment at daily hospice, Tuzla University Clinical Center. Control group consisted of 35 mastectomized patients that did not visit daily hospice. Depression and anxiety were estimated by use of Zung's scale. Patients were tested initially and retested at 12 weeks. On initial testing, the mean value of depression was 59.85 +/- 6.97 in the study group and 55.65 +/- 7.91 in the control group. On three-month retesting, the level of depression was lower in the study group, with a mean value of 48.57 +/- 7.06 (P<0.0001) (steam T-test and Wilcoxon's test) and higher in the control group, with a mean value of 60.45 +/- 7.47 (P=0.0001) (steam T-test and Wilcoxon's test). On initial testing, the mean value of anxiety was 54.97 +/- 6.35 and 52.20 +/- 6.03 in the study and control group, respectively. On three-month retesting, the level of anxiety was lower in the study group, with a mean value of 43.43 +/- 5.97 (P<0.0001), showing improvement from initial testing, but was higher in the control group, with a mean value of 55.68 +/- 7.47 (P=0.0002). In conclusion, daily hospice team's treatment had favorable effects on lowering the levels of depression and anxiety in patients undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer.",

NAFLD prevalence is on increase and goes in parallel with the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components. That is why Croatian guidelines have been developed, which cover the screening protocol for patients with NAFLD risk factors, and the recommended diagnostic work-up and treatment of NAFLD patients. NAFLD screening should be done in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, or persons with two or more risk factors as part of metabolic screening, and is carried out by noninvasive laboratory and imaging methods used to detect fibrosis. Patient work-up should exclude the existence of other causes of liver injury and determine the stage of fibrosis as the most important factor in disease prognosis. Patients with initial stages of fibrosis continue to be monitored at the primary healthcare level with the management of metabolic risk factors, dietary measures, and increased physical activity. Patients with advanced fibrosis should be referred to a gastroenterologist/hepatologist for further treatment, monitoring, and detection and management of complications.",

Acute hydrocephalus is extremely rare and when it occurs, it is usually difficult to diagnose, thus leading to possible complications. We present a patient who developed acute hydrocephalus due to neurosarcoidosis, for which he had to be operated on; soon after the operation, cranial infection developed that required definitive drainage system and ventriculoperitoneal shunt had to be implanted. In further complicated clinical course, after four years on corticosteroid therapy (corticosteroid dependent sarcoidosis), he had to be urgently operated on because of significant ventricular catheter adhesions, but several days after the operation he died in coma because of progressive brain edema not responding to treatment. As hydrocephalus due to neurosarcoidosis has high morbidity and mortality, early diagnosis and proper treatment are of utmost importance.",

    "abstract": "Intraventricular meningiomas are rare and make up between 0.5% and 3% of all intracranial meningiomas, representing one of the most challenging tumors in neurosurgery due to their difficult location. Being initially asymptomatic, such tumors usually attain large size before clinical presentation and diagnostic detection. Available literature concerned with their surgical management remains scarce. Herein, we present a case of microsurgical resection of incidental intraventricular meningioma in a 32-year-old female patient who was admitted to the hospital due to the sudden loss of consciousness, retrograde amnesia, and nausea following a head trauma. Routine brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed an irregular expansive formation located in the occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle showing heterogeneous contrast enhancement. The patient underwent right-side temporal osteoplastic craniotomy with total tumor microsurgical resection followed by external ventricular drainage, and recovered fully afterwards. Histopathologic analysis of tumor tissue samples confirmed the tumor as meningioma WHO grade I. Postoperative brain computed tomography confirmed complete tumor resection. In conclusion, intraventricular meningiomas are rather rare extra-axial tumors and may present with various symptoms depending on their size and difficult location. The development of most modern neuroimaging methods offers the opportunity of their precise and accurate diagnosis, better surgical planning, and favorable outcome. Microsurgical gross resection utilizing intraoperative neuromonitoring and cutting-edge neurosurgical armamentarium remains the treatment of choice for these location-challenging and surgically demanding, predominantly benign intracranial tumors.",

The average suicide rate in Serbia is around 19 per 100,000 people, which puts Serbia in the upper half on the list of European countries. The aim of this study was to define the number of suicides committed in the 2001-2015 period in the Province of Vojvodina, the male to female ratio of suicides, the most commonly used method of execution, the proportion of complex suicide, and distribution of suicides according to age groups, seasons, and days of week. This study was conducted as a descriptive retrospective study in the Center for Forensic Medicine, Toxicology and Molecular Genetics, Clinical Center of Vojvodina, by examining autopsy medical records. All suicide cases were divided according to age, gender, method of execution, season of the year, and day of the week. For statistical analysis, χ2 test included in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 was used, where the value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. During the 2001-2015 period, in the Province of Vojvodina, suicide was committed by 2241 people, 1812 men and 429 women. The highest number of suicides was recorded in the 45-54 age group in men and in the ≥75 age group in women. The most commonly used method was hanging in both genders. The proportion of complex suicides was 0.4%. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of suicides committed in different seasons. The highest number of suicides was committed on Friday. This research suggests that there is a need for intensive work on the prevention of suicides, especially among males aged 45-54 and females older than 75, especially in certain months and days when the suicide rate is higher.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic cannabinoid (locally named 'Bonzai' in Turkey) use is increasing worldwide (especially among people with low income). One of its harmful adverse effects is an increase in serum levels of muscle enzymes (i.e., creatine kinase [CK]). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Bonzai use in patients admitted with elevated CK levels and to compare the 1-month survival status of Bonzai users with that of non-Bonzai users. This retrospective study was conducted on a total of 468 patients, median (min-max) age 48±22 (18-93) years. It was found that 10.68% (n=50) of the patients presenting with elevated CK levels were using Bonzai (group 1), while the remaining 418 (89.32%) patients were non-Bonzai users (group 2). Median age was higher in group 2 as compared with group 1 (p=0.001). In group 1, the predominance of male (M) over female (F) patients was interestingly high, yielding a F:M ratio of 1/49 (χ2=110.03, p<0.001). The prevalence of Bonzai use among patients admitted to our center with elevated CK levels was 10.68%. The Bonzai group patients were younger and mostly males, and none of them died at 1 month of admission. These findings may help in the management of such clinical conditions and could be a pathfinder for further studies in this field.",

    "abstract": "The association of diabetic nephropathy with primary glomerulonephritis is rare. Several reports have shown that primary glomerulonephritis can be superimposed on diabetic nephropathy. These glomerulonephritis include idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis, IgA glomerulonephritis, Henoch-Schonlein nephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, minimal change disease, postinfectious glomerulonephritis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Because some of these disorders can alter the management and prognosis of renal disease in diabetic patients, the appearance of urinary abnormalities (hematuria, atypical nephrotic syndrome) or deterioration in renal function inconsistent with the natural history of diabetic nephropathy raises the possibility of a nondiabetic renal disease and should lead to a more detailed evaluation. We report a patient with type I diabetes that underwent a renal biopsy because of the heavy proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy showed diabetic nephropathy coexistent with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis associated with diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy, with excellent therapeutic response.",

    "abstract": "Whiplash injury is the most common injury sustained in traffic accidents. On exposure to different forces, multiple neck injuries may occur. Following the injury, many patients suffer from subjective symptoms that may even persist upon completion of medical treatment. As a result, there are serious problems in the objective evaluation of permanent consequences of the injury. The study included 40 randomly selected whiplash injury victims without previous lesions of cervical spine, and 40 equally selected patients with previously confirmed cervical degenerative changes. They all suffered from permanent whiplash injuries and applied for reimbursement for nonmaterial damage to Zagreb Insurance Company during 2001. Sixty-seven per cent of patients underwent continuous treatment for 5-6 months, however, the sequels of whiplash injury persisted in the form of decreased motility of cervical spine, arm paresthesia, vasospasm of vertebral arteries and permanently narrowed visual field. Pathological findings were verified by objective diagnostic methods: functional x-rays of the cervical part of the spinal cord, electromyoneurographic examination of arms, transcranial Doppler sonography of vertebrobasilar arteries, visual field assessment by Goldman method, and clinical examination by medical censor. The treatment of injured patients with previous degenerative changes of cervical spine took a longer time, with a higher level of head and neck motility reduction. Ultimately, in terms of reimbursement, they were conceded a lesser degree of permanent physical damage than those without previous cervical spine lesions.",

The findings obtained suggest that the changes of values of these novel analytes, beside the standard assays of cardiospecific enzymes (CK, CKMB, LDH, AST, ALT) are suitable for follow up of the disease and prediction of the outcome. That could be useful also for estimation of the severity of the oxidative stress and the illness itself. The case studied has, due to the agreement of the clinical outcome and the results of the assays used, proven credibility of the hypothesis on the involvement of systemic oxidative stress and ischemia/reperfusion type of injury (cardiac infarction). Thus, the results obtained were in agreement with the basic hypothesis of the study and the literature data, giving support to ongoing further studies on the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular diseases aimed to improve diagnosis and therapy of the patients.",

We investigated three periods: distant prewar (1982-3), immediate prewar (1989-90) and postwar period (1998-2000). Data on each patient were obtained from the computer based colorectal cancer registry established at the Department of Pathology. There was statistically significant increase of cases affecting the right colon during the postwar period (p<0.01). A shift from the age group 60-69 to 70-69 years was observed during the postwar period. There was no statistically significant difference in the age and sex distribution of the tumors. Regarding the TNM staging, the patients presented in more advanced stages during the postwar period (p<0.01). Similar difference was observed comparing Dukes' stages during all three periods p<0.01). We conclude that in our study an increasing proportion of cases affecting right colon during three investigated period was noticed. The patients presented in more advanced stages towards the end of analyzed periods. We think that these changes could be probably, at least in part, be ascribed to the effects of war.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYAlthough melanoma is less common than other types of malignant skin tumors, in- cluding basal and squamous cell cancers, it accounts for about 75% of all skin cancer deaths. Mela- noma is much more likely to metastasize to other parts of the body, which is not the case with other types of skin tumors. Metastatic spread is very common, particularly in advanced tumors of higher Clark and Breslow stage. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence and distribution of metastatic melanomas among biopsy specimens collected during the 1995-2000 period, and their relationship with primary melanoma, especially regarding Clark and Breslow staging. Metastatic mela- nomas were found in 210 of 75,390 (0.3%) surgical biopsies. There were 24 patients with 57 meta- static melanoma biopsies related to primary melanoma diagnosed at our hospital during the period of observation. The remaining 153 metastatic melanomas diagnosed at other hospitals or before the period of observation were not included in the study. Metastatic melanomas were more common in male patients (13 male and 11 female), age range 16-91 (mean age 53.0) years. In men, age range was 16-75, and in women 23-91 years. Metastatic melanomas occurred 1 month to 2 years (mean 4.9 months) after the diagnosis. They affected patients with Clark III-V and Breslow III-V. Metastases were not observed in Clark I-II patients, however, two metastases were detected in patients with Breslow thickness II. Also, a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of metastatic and pri- mary melanomas (p<0.01 both) was recorded during the period of observation.",

Selective removal of the blocking antibody by plasmapheresis or specific immunoadsorption provides important methods in the treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis. Novel immunoadsorbent columns have been developed especially for the treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis, using a specific affinity ligand (Torpedo 183-200, a synthetic peptide) to remove the blocking antibody. This immunoadsorbent produced specific removal of the blocking antibody without reducing other plasma proteins. Clinical improvement was observed in 78% of myasthenia gravis patients.

    "abstract": "SUMMARY - Acute renal failure (ARF) is currently more frequently seen as part of a more complex syndrome defined by sepsis and/or multiple organ failure. Evolution in the field of hemodialysis has led to a parallel development of new systems for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in critically ill patients. The various CRRT modalities differ in the type of vascular access, application of diffusive or convective clearance (or a combination of both), and location where the replacement fluid enters the circuit. CRRTs have certainly facilitated the management of critically ill patients with ARF combined with cardiovascular instability, severe fluid overload, hypercatabolism, cerebral edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, lactic acidosis, sepsis or other inflammatory syndromes, crush syndrome, congestive heart failure, and cardiopulmonary bypass. Continuous therapies incorporate several advantages including improved hemodynamic stability, optimal fluid balance, gradual urea removal, elimination of septic mediators, and the possibility of unlimited parenteral nutrition. Major difficulties and unsolved problems of CRRT are the ongoing necessity for continuous anticoagulation, considerable loss of amino acids, vitamins, trace elements, potassium, phosphate, and some drugs as well as immobilization of the patient. The advantages of CRRT should theoretically translate into improved outcomes of critically ill ARF patients, but the superiority of continuous modalities in terms of outcomes is still controversial, despite encouraging results in some clinical trials.",

Croatian army recruits (n=248; mean age 20.2) and male dental students (n=56; mean age 21.5) were evaluated according to DMFT and FST indices, divided according to age and place of residence, and interviewed about their dietary habits and smoking of tobacco. In the subpopulation of recruits, the median value of DMFT was 6 and of FST index 25. A statistically significant difference was recorded between DT and FST index (p<0.05) according to dietary role of carbohydrates reflected in caries development. The number of recruits with finished elementary school coming from a rural area who smoked (in total 57.66% of smokers) was significantly larger (p=0.0041). In dental students, the median value of DMFT was 5, with statistical significance in comparison with recruits (p=0.03). There was a difference in FST index (median 28) (p<0.0001). Students were mostly nonsmokers (71.43%) and had urban residence (p<0.0001). FST index was a more specific indicator in the socioeconomically heterogeneous sample of recruits (more subjects coming from rural areas and with a lower level of education) than in the sample of dental students (more subjects coming from urban areas).",

The purpose of the article is to present the prevalence of onychomycosis obtained by using direct microscopic examination (DME) and cultivation on Sabouraud media without cycloheximide. The quantitative retrospective research was conducted on 2706 patients of both sexes (mostly middle-aged to elderly) with various toenail lesions, who had undergone mycological analyses in the Mycological Laboratory of our Department of Dermatovenereology in 2013 and 2014. Analysis of the results obtained revealed that there were 35.4% of positive DME results; of these, there were 39.2% of dermatophytes, 59.1% of yeasts and 1.7% of molds. The percentage of dermatophytes (Trichophyton spp.) was twice as high in men as in women. A considerable percentage (12%) of mixed isolates was also observed. Particularly worrisome was the high percentage (one-third) of suppressed and insufficiently developed dermatophytes (a possible indicator of inappropriate preparation of patients for mycological analysis). Cultivation on culture media without cycloheximide requires frequent inspections because of the fast-growing molds while not allowing sporulation for a great number of dermatophytes. However, it has certain advantages, i.e. it offers an insight into the wide range of the present fungi. As part of the biofilm, they can be potentially pathogenic in dystrophic nails under certain circumstances because, according to our results, the percentage of dermatophytes does not change substantially with aging; however, what does change is the percentage of molds, yeasts and mixed isolates.",

Since the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in our hospital, the minimum postoperative stay was considered to be two days based on surgeons' experience. The study included 337 operations performed by 21 surgeons during 2016 in the Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Centre. Conversion to open technique and cases of acute cholecystitis were excluded, while 15 patients had insufficient postoperative data. The mean length of stay was 2.38 (range 1 to 6) postoperative days, median two postoperative days. Serious complications involving suspected drain bile leakage and postoperative hemorrhage occurred in two (0.59%) patients, both in the first 24 h following surgery. One patient required emergency laparotomy on the first postoperative day. Readmission rate was 1.2%. The postoperative minor complication rate was 42 of 337 (12.46%); these included wound infections, urinary tract infections, symptoms included in postcholecystectomy syndrome, etc. The onset of these complications was mostly after postoperative day 3. The data obtained suggest that discharge on the first postoperative day after elective uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be considered safe and can be practiced in our hospital.",

Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum creatinine (sCr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum uric acid (SUA), urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), and degree of pubertal development were determined in all participants. RI was measured using Doppler ultrasound in both groups. The T1D group had lower sCr and SUA values and higher ACR and mean RI values than the control group. Using the expectation-maximization method, 2 clusters of T1D patients were identified. Cluster 2 with higher RI values, eGFR and HDL cholesterol was more prone to albuminuria and could carry worse prognosis. In conclusion, renal RI is increased in the hyperfiltration phase of diabetic nephropathy in children with T1D.

It was determined that there was no bacterial growth in 46.7% of the chlorhexidine group, while maximum bacterial growth was recorded in the dry-keeping group. In the chlorhexidine group, timing of umbilical cord separation was significantly shorter than in other groups. Study results indicated that the most effective method was the use of chlorhexidine. Dry-keeping can be risky since it was inefficient in preventing umbilical colonization, and in cases where the cost of chlorhexidine is an issue, the use of breast milk can be recommended.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of preoperative physical education on postoperative rehabilitation in patients after total hip arthroplasty (THA). There were 60 patients divided in two equal groups. One group underwent 3-day preoperative education and the other did not. The two groups were compared according to their preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS), range of motion (ROM), Harris Hip Score (HHS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), and 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). Patient general characteristics were similar in the two groups. Patients that received preoperative training had lower VAS scores, greater ROM, higher HHS and lower WOMAC score on postoperative day 42 (p<0.05 all). These patients had no complications. There were no between-group differences in the SF-36 questionnaire. In conclusion, patients that underwent preoperative rehabilitation protocol before THA had lower pain and disability scores and better functional outcomes.",

The aim of the study was to examine the effect of a single night shift on the Work Ability Index (WAI) scores of hospital healthcare workers. A prospective survey was conducted on a convenience sample of 49 on-call residents working 12- or 16-hour night shifts and 47 nurses working 12-hour night shifts in the emergency department of an urban teaching hospital. The study included analysis of sociodemographic, occupational and medical data collected through a questionnaire during a morning shift change. The participant work capacity was assessed using the short form of the WAI Questionnaire. The mean WAI score for nurses was 40.98 before a night shift and 37.15 after a night shift, which was a statistically significant decrease (p<0.01, 95% CI: 2.39-5.27). Similarly, among residents, the mean WAI score decreased from 43.02 before a night shift to 38.76 after a night shift (p<0.0001, 95% CI: 2.95-5.58). There was a statistically significant difference in WAI scores between nurses and residents (p<0.05). Our results showed that even a single night shift negatively affected the work ability of emergency healthcare workers. We recommend scheduling shift work with fewer night shifts to preserve healthcare worker work ability.",

He was diagnosed with Ebstein anomaly at the age of 3 months during the workup for afebrile convulsions, and has been followed by a pediatric cardiologist since. Electrocardiography recorded a small Rr` pattern in V1 on a few occasions, without other abnormalities. At the age of 2.5 years, the first episode of supraventricular tachycardia was recorded and stopped with adenosine. He was started on atenolol and was asymptomatic until a year later when he presented with the second recorded supraventricular tachycardia. He was referred to our institution for an electrophysiology study with ablation. Tachycardia was entrained and all the maneuvers were in accordance with atrioventricular reentry tachycardia. Tricuspid annulus was mapped during tachycardia. The earliest atrial signals appeared in the posteroseptal region of the valve, mechanical blocking of the tachycardia was recorded in that region, and early fractionated signal was present during ventricular retrograde pacing. The pathway was successfully ablated. Basal electrocardiogram was without change after ablation and the patient did not experience recurrence of tachycardia during follow-up. This case shows the efficacy and importance of ablation in Ebstein anomaly, without x-ray or intracardiac echocardiography.",

The aim was to evaluate the levels of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression in medical students during COVID-19 lockdown, and the relationship of these constructs with various sociodemographic variables. The study was conducted online from April 20 to April 29, 2020, during the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (using sociodemographic questionnaire and DASS-21 scale), on a sample of 420 students (female 81.7%, Mage=22.53) at the University of Kragujevac. The majority of participants (55%-58%) had no self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety or stress, and the mean values were in-between the categories of 'without any symptoms' and 'with mild symptoms'. Predictors of exhibiting depression symptoms were previous psychological problems (odds ratio [OR]=3.16), family history of mental illness (OR=2.12), and relationship status (OR=0.61). For the symptoms of anxiety, predictors were female gender (OR=2.38), reported previous psychological problems (OR=3.91), and age (OR=0.92). Predictors of the symptoms of stress were female gender (OR=2.31), previous psychological problems (OR=3.18), and age (OR=0.91). The results of our study imply that certain factors influence the development of adverse mental health outcomes during this period, which should be taken into account when planning psychological interventions and services.",

Adjusting to a new way of life can be complicated, stressful and challenging for patients. With continued education from professional caregivers, the patient and/or family can avoid or mitigate adverse events and improve the quality of life of stoma carriers. The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of life of stoma patients and their relationship with health education in hospital in a qualitative way. The present study included 15 patients of both sexes older than 18 years and living with a stoma for at least one year after surgery. Patients were interviewed using a semi-structured interview, which was recorded. Transcripts were made and analyzed after the interview. A total of 6 women and 9 men aged between 40 and 86 years took part in the study. The results show that patients were very satisfied with health education they received in hospital, but their subjective experience of the quality of life was not satisfactory in all areas analyzed, such as travel and social life. Stoma has an impact on the participants' quality of life. High quality health education of patients by professionals, as well as family and social support play an important role in the lives of stoma patients. These are protective factors that improve the participants' quality of life.",

A total of 340 both inpatients and outpatients at a psychiatric hospital in Croatia were assessed about their preferences regarding psychiatrist wearing a name badge, gender, age, ways of mutual addressing, and attire. The majority of patients, inpatients significantly more often, thought that a psychiatrist should wear a name badge. Female patients preferred female psychiatrist more than male and vice versa. Inpatients also preferred female psychiatrist. Patients with affective and anxiety disorder were more likely to choose female psychiatrists, patients with addiction more often had no preferences, and patients with psychotic disorders preferred male psychiatrists. Younger patients preferred younger psychiatrists and inpatients preferred psychiatrists in the 35-50 age group. Patients with anxiety disorder more often opted for psychiatrists older than 50. Patients with anxiety disorders would rather be addressed by their first name, whereas patients with psychotic disorders more often preferred to be addressed by their title and surname. Patient attitude about how they should address the psychiatrist did not differ according to any of the variables assessed. Most patients thought that white coat was most appropriate attire for psychiatrist and psychiatrists in white coat were considered most competent, empathic, accessible, and friendly in comparison with psychiatrists wearing suits, smart attire, or casual clothing. Other than preference for white coat, patient preferences significantly differed according to their sociodemographic characteristics and diagnosis. Psychiatrists should bear that in mind to establish better rapport in doctor-patient relationship.",

    "abstract": "Psychotherapy is an independent, interdisciplinary science that encompasses psychotherapeutic directions based on scientific principles and methods. Through the psychotherapeutic process, psychotherapy aims to achieve personal growth, remove or lessen the intensity of existing psychosocial, psychosomatic and behavioral problems and suffering, as well as help develop more functional patterns of behavior and experiences of interpersonal relationships or value systems. Research has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on psychotherapy in terms of the way it is carried out, change in the environment in which it is performed, and online psychotherapy has been introduced. The aim of this study was to find information, through available literature, on the impact of the pandemic on mental health and psychotherapy, and also to spread awareness about the current identified risks connected to the greater morbidity of psychiatric disorders and diseases and the need of psychotherapeutic interventions. Previous studies have shown that the pandemic increased the incidence of psychological disorders and diseases and the need of psychological intervention. Available data have shown that in the times of strict epidemiological measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, certain modifications of the psychotherapeutic process were made in terms of the use of online psychotherapy.",

Although considered the gold standard for diagnosis of myocarditis, endomyocardial biopsy in clinical pactice is often substituted with clinical, biochemical and imaging parameters. Echocardiography with speckle tracking strain analysis is a valuable tool for diagnosis of myocarditis, estimation of regional and global systolic function showing good correlation with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). We present the case of a 19-year-old male with chest pain, elevated troponin and ST segment elevation who underwent urgent coronary angiography. Normal angiogram steered diagnosis toward myopericarditis, considering information about recent enterocolitis and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Transthoracal echocardiography with speckle tracking analysis showed longitudinal strain reduction in several segments of the left ventricle. Small pericardial effusion alongside those segments was also found supporting our diagnosis. After 3 months of treatment with antiinflammatory drugs, ACE inhibitor and beta blocker, the patient recovered and a repeated echo showed complete recovery of systolic function without pericardial effusion. We conclude that echocardiography, including global and regional longitudinal strain analysis, is a valuable diagnostic tool in patients with myopericarditis, complementary with not widely available cMRI. It can detect subtle systolic dysfunction not visible with conventional echocardiography, thus having implications on therapy and prognosis.",

Unfortunately, this can easily turn into complication and the need to alter the procedural strategy. The main points to be considered when deciding on the PCI strategy are related to both procedural safety and long-term outcomes. Provisional stenting has been recommended as the default technique for most coronary bifurcation lesions. In this paper, we describe the case of a patient scheduled for elective procedure of bifurcation lesion of LAD/D1. Our planned strategy was provisional stenting of LAD, using one stent for LAD, DCB for D1. Due to the complication that occurred, i.e., dissection of LAD after LAD stenting, we changed the strategy to two-stents technique strategy, using Culotte technique.",

According to some studies, about 12% of the elderly population initially hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke also develop type-1 acute myocardial infarction during the same hospitalization. On the other hand, about 0.9% of patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome develop acute stroke during the same hospitalization1. The therapeutic approach to such \"overlapping\" patients is challenging, especially if we also take into account a high risk of bleeding and/or active bleeding. Therefore, interdisciplinary collaboration between cardiology, neurology and interventional neuroradiology is of key importance. Timely intervention and adequate concomitant drug therapy (primarily antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy) determine treatment outcomes and long-term results.

It is more common in younger patients and women and it can cause acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in 0.1 to 4 percent of cases. We described three cases of different types of SCAD. In the first case, we described a male patient admitted due to chest pain after excessive physical activity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). SCAD of left anterior descending (LAD) was found by coronary angiography. Because of chest pain and signs of ischemia on ECHO, a stent was implanted. After procedure, the patient was pain-free and hemodynamically and rhythmically stable. In the second case, we presented a young multiparous woman with signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A coronary angiogram showed a homogeneous stenosis of proximal LAD. Optimal medical therapy (OMT) was the initial therapy of choice. After a few days due to the recurrence of chest pain and an increase in troponin level, recoronarography was performed. It showed a dissection of the left main (LM), left circumflex artery (LCx) and LAD. It was treated with the two-stent technique procedure, after which, the patient was stable and pain free. In the third case, we showed a postmenopausal patient with subclinical hypothyroidism. In this case, it is difficult to say whether the dissections of LCx, LM and LAD that occurred after the balloon dilatation of LCx and the stent implantation in the right coronary artery (RCA) were result of atherosclerotic lesions or hormonal changes that can cause SCAD.",

We attempted to remove the stent by passing an SC balloon over the stent and it was pulled under fluoroscopic guidance to the brachial artery. An effort was then made to extract the stent using ˝twisting guide wire technique˝, but without success. Finally, the stent was grasped with an EN Snare® device and removed completely through the sheath. The procedure ended with the repositioning of the guide catheter and implantation of a new stent.

Coronary artery perforation treatment includes cover stents and coil placement. A 73-year-old patient, without comorbidities, was hospitalized for acute non ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography showed subocclusion of the first diagonal branch (culprit lesion) while the other epicardial coronary arteries were without stenosis. Multiple predilatations of the target vessel were performed, and as it was a vessel with a diameter of less than 2 mm, no stent was placed. The final angiogram showed normal flow and good morphological result. Half an hour after the procedure, cardiac tamponade and cardiorespiratory arrest developed. Emergency pericardiocentesis was performed and after the return of spontaneous circulation, emergency recoronarography was performed. It showed perforation of the diagonal branch with contrast extravasation. Coronary coil was applied proximal to the perforation site. Perforation repair and hemodynamic stabilization were achieved. Coronary artery perforation is a life-threatening complication of percutaneous coronary intervention. The risk of perforation is higher in the case of small coronary arteries; it can be presented by delayed cardiac tamponade, which requires increased supervision of the patient.",

A number of individual characteristics were considered too, from eating habits, anthropometry, personality traits, psychophysical state, to the presence of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Out of 126 participants who completed the questionnaire, 99 were analyzed (female 68.7% and male 31.3%, median age 24 years).

Women were two times more likely to have high ON tendency in comparison to men (39.7% vs. 19.4%, p=0.037). Participants with high ON tendency avoided a wide variety of foods, especially sugar, processed food and gluten, and did not skip meals. There were no significant differences in orthorexic tendencies according to nutritional status, personality traits, psychophysical state, or irritable bowel symptoms.

Following the logogen model, this study investigated word processing abilities of post-stroke and post-TBI patients.

Twenty-two post-stroke and 22 post-TBI patients were tested using tasks from the Comprehensive Aphasia Test-HR (CAT-HR). Post-TBI patients outperformed post-stroke patients in naming and reading. Both groups exhibited neologisms, phonological, semantic and unrelated errors, although in different proportions. In word comprehension and naming, post-TBI patients primarily exhibited semantic errors, whereas post-stroke patients had equally distributed phonological and semantic errors. In reading, both groups predominantly produced phonological errors. Error distribution differed only in naming, with post-TBI patients exhibiting more semantic errors than post-stroke patients. Therefore, performance in naming differentiated these groups most. Although error analysis is rather insightful, one cannot expect a particular profile of language disturbances in post-stroke and post-TBI patients. The findings obtained bear concrete clinical implications, especially those related to the role and meaning of the errors produced by the patient to determine the exact location of the processing deficits.",

The 'free hand' technique is considered relatively safe and can be performed under x-ray control. Vascular injuries with misplaced screws are rare but potentially fatal complications. Injury of thoracoabdominal aorta by malpositioned screw demands a multidisciplinary approach. Injury of vessel wall might demand screw removal and vessel wall repair. Here we present a case of 72-year-old female patient who underwent long segment fixation of thoracolumbar spine. During follow up, computed tomography (CT) scan and afterwards aortography showed a lesion of the posterior aortic wall by malpositioned screw without signs of bleeding. After meticulous preparation, combined endovascular repair with stent-graft and removal of the penetrating screw were performed. Endovascular treatment was performed simultaneously with screw removal. During screw removal, the patient was in lateral decubital position. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 8. Follow up CT aortography 6 months later showed no leak or other changes in the aorta. We found combined endovascular vessel repair with simultaneous screw removal safe and sufficient for this kind of aortic injury. Although lateral decubital position bears limitations, it gives enough space for the operator. Performing intraoperative aortography provides good insight into stent position and possible bleeding after screw removal.",

They were also asked about the frequency, time elapsed until resuming sexual intercourse, and presence of dyspareunia. Time period from giving birth until resuming sexual intercourse was 8 weeks on average. Place of residence (median test: χ2(2)=3.3, p>0.05) and number of household members (median test: χ2(4)=0.87, p>0.05 for number of household members) had no effect on that time period. There was no significant difference in the frequency of sexual intercourse between women living in urban and rural area (χ2-test(1)=0.03, p>0.05).

Sexuality of women in the postpartum period is liable to social effects. Social support of family members has a greater impact on sexuality in the postpartum period than other social factors such as place of residence. Besides support of close family members, women in that period should have organized social protection and access to information.",

One of the first clinical signs in patients with COPD is reduced physical ability, which is usually attributed to reduced lung function, although a significant role is played by a disorder of the musculoskeletal system. The aim of the study was to examine differences in fitness and locomotor status between smokers and non-smokers, as well as the effect of oral administration of L-arginine on the strength of the quadriceps depending on smoking status. The study included 164 subjects, 84 non-smokers and 81 smokers not diagnosed with COPD. All subjects completed CAT and IPAQ questionnaires, and performed spirometry, 6-minute walking test and quadriceps strength testing without therapy and after oral administration of 500 mg L-arginine. The results showed that the increase in quadriceps strength after oral administration of L-arginine was not dependent on smoking status but was more pronounced in smokers who started smoking at an earlier age and who smoked more cigarettes, as well as a generally higher physical activity of non-smokers. These results could become relevant for recognizing the development of skeletal musculature hypotonus and hypotrophy in smokers who are prone to develop COPD.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) is an essential tool in diagnosing and treating traumatic brain injury (TBI). Marshall CT classification, Rotterdam and Helsinki CT scores were consecutively developed as prediction outcome scales by computing TBI CT abnormalities. None of them classifies the pathological CT findings in the same manner. We aimed to determine which one is most accurate and has the best grading discriminatory power in determining early outcome. All TBI patients treated at a single center in a one-year period having undergone a CT scan on admission were retrospectively included. After calculation of all three scores, comparison among scale performances, as well as their accuracy in predicting patient 6-month outcome by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was made. We used the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves to analyze correlation between all scales and early outcome. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) to determine the power of each system while paired samples T-test was used to determine correlation among the scales. Mann-Whitney U test was performed to determine difference in outcome groups. A total of 1006 patients were included in final analysis. The mean patient age at presentation was 55.6 (±20.1) years, overall mortality was 6.4%, mean GOS was 3.00 (±1.4), and mean Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 13.9 (±0.2). Mortality was higher among patients with lower scores (p<0.01 all). The AUCs indicated that all scoring systems had a similarly high discriminative power in predicting early unfavorable outcome (Marshall AUC 0.86 vs. Rotterdam AUC 0.82 vs. Helsinki AUC 0.84). High correlation was found between Marshall and Rotterdam grading, r = 0.78, and moderate correlation between the other two pairs (Marshall vs. Helsinki, r=0.62, and Rotterdam vs. Helsinki, r=0.51). Additionally, low GCS and high injury severity score (ISS) could be identified as strong predictors of early death and poor outcome. In conclusion, all classification systems demonstrated a similar, strong predictive power for early outcome, but even greater discrimination results could be obtained if GCS and ISS were incorporated in the calculation. Helsinki CT score was least predictable of all three, and had the lowest correlation with the other two. Although Marshall CT classification was the oldest and simplest, it had at least the same prediction power as the newer scoring scales and should remain in use. Therefore, for prognostic purposes, this study recommends using one individual scale in clinical application to get the best possible prediction for TBI.",

    "abstract": "The first carpometacarpal joint is the second most common joint affected by degenerative arthritis. The prevalence of the first carpometacarpal joint arthritis increases with age, especially in postmenopausal women. Ligamentous laxity or injury of the first carpometacarpal joint is thought to be the starting point of development of degenerative changes, accompanied with altered biomechanics of the thumb. As the disease progresses, the joint is destroyed and the thumb and hand function are deteriorating. Although many patients, in different stages of disease, experience pain relief with conservative treatment, surgery is often needed. Decision on the type of surgical procedure depends on the age of the patient, functional demands, and stage of the disease. In early stages of the disease, stabilization of the first carpometacarpal joint, extension osteotomy of the first metacarpal and arthroscopic procedures are used. These are joint-preserving procedures, and they slow down progression of the disease and reduce symptoms. In late stages of the disease, joint arthroplasty procedures and first carpometacarpal arthrodesis are performed. In recent years, late stages of the disease can also be treated arthroscopically. This paper describes different surgical methods, their advantages and drawbacks, with respect to different stages of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Giants and acromegalists have long captured attention, and they were often almost mythical creatures of great strength and power. Due to their expressive appearance, they were recorded in myths and works of art much earlier than they were of interest to medical practitioners. The first recognition was made by a Dutch physician Johannes Wier in 1567, but the first description and appellation originated by Pierre Marie in 1886. Involvement and interest from neurosurgeons followed, and in 1907, Hermann Schloffer performed the first transsphenoidal surgery in a patient with pituitary adenoma. In 1909, Harvey Cushing linked removal of the enlarged pituitary gland to regression of acromegaly and considered 'growth hormone' a pathophysiological trigger. Knowledge of acromegaly has been enhanced by the discovery of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and evidence for an association between GH hypersecretion and elevated circulating IGF-I with the clinical phenotype. After 1970, pharmacotherapy (dopamine agonists, somatostatin analogs and GH receptor blockers) was introduced. Despite advances in drug therapy and radiotherapy, surgical treatment still provides optimal results (first-line treatment) after more than a century of attempts. In this paper, we present gigantism and acromegaly over time, important turning points from its recognition to the current insights and fundamental approach reminding us of the immense prosperity of medicine and science. The development of basic sciences and clinical endocrinology will enable progress and improvement of comprehension in the pathogenesis and diagnostics, as well as curative modalities.",

Morphological measurements, knee range of motion and WOMAC questionnaire score were examined before and two years after surgery. Descriptive statistics was used for gender, age and body mass index, and inferential statistics was employed to check the correlation of recovery measured by changes in the WOMAC score and change in the range of motion results with age and body mass index. According to study results, male and female patients did not differ in body mass index (t=1.184; p>0.05). There was no statistically significant correlation of functional recovery of the patients with age (p=0.556), or between body mass index and differences in the range of motion (p=0.927) from flexion to extension. The study indicated that knee arthroplasty and thus the impact on functional recovery had an equally good effect regardless of age. In patients who had flexion contracture before surgery, the surgery improved motion amplitude.",

    "abstract": "Degenerative cervical disc disease can be surgically treated by various procedures, one of which is anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). It is used to stabilize the spine and decompress neural structures of the spinal canal. However, measuring its impact on postoperative clinical status and surgical outcome is difficult. That is the reason why patient-reported surveys are commonly used to assess clinical status and surgical outcomes. To evaluate the surgical outcomes of ACDF with an allograft with a fixed angle of inclination at one cervical level, we conducted a prospective study on 60 patients over one year. We used a structured patient-reported survey based on the visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Odom questionnaire. Most patients experienced significant reduction in pain intensity in their arms and neck after undergoing ACDF with a carbon wedged-shaped allograft with a fixed inclination angle of 7º. This improvement was equally represented across all age groups and levels of the cervical spine operated on. Most patients also experienced a decrease in postoperative disability, as measured by the ODI, regardless of their age or the level of the cervical spine operated on. The majority of them rated their outcomes as either excellent or good, which was true across all age groups and levels of the cervical spine. In conclusion, patient-reported clinical status and outcome surveys are valuable and easy-to-perform tools for evaluating the quality of life of patients suffering from degenerative cervical disc disease after ACDF with a carbon cage having a fixed inclination angle.",

The study included 106 patients diagnosed with COPD who were treated at the Special Hospital for Pulmonary Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia. The World Health Organization questionnaire for oral health in adults was used as a validated measure to assess oral health. Results were compared based on the severity of the disease according to the GOLD classification, long term oxygen therapy, and their smoking habits. Most patients (61.3%) had less than 10 teeth. Also, 82.2% of the patients had problems with their oral health in the previous year. More than half of the patients (55.7%) ranked the status of their oral cavity and teeth as average or worse, whereas 58.5% of the patients ranked their gingival status as good or better. Also, 55.7% of the patients brushed their teeth once a day or less, which was more pronounced in men. The same percentage of the patients did not know whether their toothpaste contained fluoride. Sixty-seven percent of the patients were former smokers, while the rest were active smokers. Smokers reported more frequent feeling of shame and tension because of the appearance of their teeth in relation to non-smokers. Patients with advanced stages of COPD are more likely to report problems with eating and chewing food compared to patients with less advanced stages of the disease. According to the results, further systematic education of COPD patients is crucial in promoting the importance of oral health.",

We compared ERUS findings with postoperative pathological data in 41 patients with endoscopic and pathological (PH) diagnosis of rectal cancer. These patients underwent ERUS examination to determine the extent of the disease and the findings were subsequently compared with postoperative pathological diagnosis. After ERUS examination, there were three patients in group T0, five in group T1, 12 in group T2, 17 in group T3, two in group T4, and two patients had a mucinous metastatic type of cancer. After excluding 15 patients who met the exclusion criteria, we compared ERUS findings of 26 patients with their pathological diagnosis to determine the sensitivity and accuracy of ERUS. The total sensitivity of the ERUS in preoperative staging of the tumor stage T0-T4 was 96%. Accuracy was 89%. This study showed that a surgeon can rely on the findings of ERUS performed by an experienced endoscopist before deciding of type of surgical procedure for T0-T2, and even T3 degree of rectal cancer. T3 rectal cancers are in the \"gray zone\", so both procedures, ERUS and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR), are needed to decide on the final therapeutic approach. NMR remains the gold standard for staging T4 rectal cancer.",

This paper is a continuation of our previous paper, but for a different time period. All data were collected from the official patient registry of the Zagreb Antirabies Clinic, which operates within the Reference Center for Rabies at Andrija Štampar Teaching Institute of Public Health. During this period, there were 9960 patients examined for injuries inflicted by animals, of which 98 (0.98%) were hospitalized in different departments and hospitals in Zagreb due to wound severity. All the hospitalized patients were examined to exclude the possible risk of rabies. The official patient registry of the Zagreb Antirabies Clinic is the source of the presented data, which were collected and analyzed retrospectively. We conducted a descriptive analysis. The ages of the hospitalized patients ranged from 17 days to 82 years, 55 (56.12%) were adults, and 43 (43.88%) were children; among the adults, there were 29 (29.59%) men and 26 (26.53%) women, while among the children there were 25 (25.51%) boys and 18 (18.37%) girls. The most common causes of hospitalization after an animal bite were infectious diseases (cat-scratch disease, rat-bite fever) and severity of wounds, which is comparable to the data available from other countries. There is no statistically significant difference in the frequency of hospitalization between children and adults, while dogs are statistically significantly more likely to inflict injuries that result in hospitalization than other animals. However, no specific anatomical location exhibited a statistically significant higher frequency of bites compared to others, as one might expect.",

This study was designed as a retrospective prognostic study combining standard histopathologic parameters with tumor budding and microsatellite instability. The study included 89 patients on elective treatment for stage II primary colorectal adenocarcinoma from January 2011 to December 2015. Study results indicated that the prognosis of patients with stage II CRC depended on the combination of three factors, (in the order of importance): number of lymph nodes examined; total number of buds per 0.785 mm2 (≥5.5); and positive lymphovascular invasion. There is increasing evidence that tumor biology and non-anatomic characteristics are important in the prognosis and treatment of CRC. One of them is tumor budding which is not yet an integral part of the AJCC staging system. A low number of the lymph nodes examined is associated with high-risk patients. All patients without an adequate number of lymph nodes examined (less than 8 lymph nodes) should a priori be considered a very high-risk group, with a very low survival rate, and chemotherapy should be used.",

The study included 97 consecutive patients. MACE was recorded in 20.6% of patients, more often in patients with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade flow ≤2. High thrombus burden (HTB) was detected in 44.3% of patients and it significantly contributed to the development of MACE. In conclusion, PCI on SVG is a highly challenging procedure, especially in patients with an acute coronary syndrome. In patients who have HTB recorded in SVG, the usage of thrombus aspiration and distal protection device can reduce the frequency of no-reflow phenomenon and consequential MACE.",

The sample consisted of 90 subjects and was divided into two equal groups. The first group consisted of patients with MetS but without DM, while the second group had both MetS and DM. We used the values of the peak systolic velocity (PSV) as a reference for pathology. The results showed pathological values of PSV in the right internal carotid artery (ICA) in twelve patients in the MetS + DM group. The study found that the incidence of pathological rheological parameters was higher in subjects with MetS + DM as compared to those with only MetS. Subjects with MetS + DM had higher values of maximum acceleration during systole in various carotid arteries. A subject with MetS + DM also showed total flow obstruction in the left and internal carotid artery (ICA) and a severe narrowing of the right ICA, indicating the presence of carotid artery disease. The study also found that nearly two-thirds of subjects with MetS + DM had pathological values of PSV in the right ICA and slightly fewer in the left ICA. Research on French populations has shown similar results. Eleven patients had pathological values in the left ICA. The frequency of the carotid rheological parameters' abnormalities was significantly higher in the MetS with DM patient group. The frequency of abnormalities in the rheological parameters of carotid circulation was significantly higher in patients with MetS and DM (as compared to non-diabetic patients). In our study, pathological changes were generally more susceptible to ICA. This indicates the importance of screening the rheological parameters of subjects with MetS for the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease.",

Hand hygiene (HH) has been considered the most important means of preventing HAIs but HH compliance is generally less than 50%. One of the five steps that the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines identify to be specifically implemented are poster reminders. The aim of this study was to evaluate compliance with HH by healthcare workers before and after an intervention on standardized WHO HH poster reminders. An observational one-month study was conducted in a university hospital center surgical intensive care unit. HH compliance was measured through direct observation using WHO observation tool. Intervention was done on day 15 by replacement of standard WHO posters with posters containing a message aimed to call for personal responsibility in patient outcome. A total of 1113 HH opportunities were observed. Overall, HH was performed in 15.4% of cases pre-intervention and 28.3% of cases post-intervention (p<0.001). The preferred method of HH was soap and water. Healthcare workers mostly chose to perform HH after exposure to body fluids, where compliance was 35.1% pre-intervention and 58.7% post-intervention. Gloves were used in 98% of cases of clean/aseptic procedures where HH was not performed. In conclusion, using standard posters to convey additional messages of awareness of consequences and personal responsibility may improve HH and should be considered in multimodal approaches to improve HH compliance.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of hypophosphatemia in female patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) treated parenterally with ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). Thirty-two female patients examined for IDA at the Hematology and Oncology Department of one General Hospital were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were hemoglobin <110 g/L, transferrin saturation <50%, ferritin <30 ng/mL, and ineffective oral iron therapy. The hemoglobin values were significantly increased 6 weeks after therapy in comparison with initial values. The onset of the asymptomatic hypophosphatemia was observed in 17 of 32 patients two weeks after the FCM therapy. Only one of 32 patients had severe asymptomatic hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate <0.3 mmol/L). Prolonged hypophosphatemia (6 weeks after FCM therapy) was observed in five of 32 patients, of which only one patient had initial hypophosphatemia. The difference between the phosphate values measured two weeks after the FCM therapy and the phosphate values at the first and last follow-up was statistically significant. Serum phosphate values should be routinely measured before and after parenteral FCM therapy.",

    "abstract": "Our study aimed to analyze the correlation of cancer-related parameters with tumor regression grade (TRG) and disease-free survival (DFS) by gender in 192 rectal cancer patients operated on after neoadjuvant long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT). Preoperative diagnostics revealed no significant gender differences in any clinical parameters other than obesity (p=0.031). We found that slightly overweight men had a lower incidence of distant metastases (p=0.042). The post-LCCRT pathologic finding showed that women had more positive lymph nodes (ypN, p=0.002) while no other pathologic parameter differed significantly between the genders. Overall, a poor response to therapy correlated with a shorter time to disease progression (p=0.002). Women achieved ypN0 in 50% of cases, but only 27% had a good TRG compared to 40.5% of men (p=0.073). Women had a worse DFS than men, even when complete response to therapy was achieved (p=0.003), and greater depth of residual tumor invasion (ypT, p=0.035) and higher ypN (p=0.002) correlated with shorter DFS. Positive resection margins (p<0.001), higher ypN stage (p=0.003), and poor TRG (p=0.025) correlated with shorter DFS in men. We conclude that women have a poorer response to LCCRT with the possibility that therapeutic approach to the neoadjuvant treatment of rectal cancer may be gender-specific.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic rhinometry is a non-invasive technique that requires minimal cooperation from patients compared to other diagnostic methods. This technique can be used even in children under 3 years of age, which makes it widely applicable in the practice of rhinologists. The aim of this research was to study nasal patency and nasal volume in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR) and intermittent allergic rhinitis (IAR) using acoustic rhinometry and to compare the degree of swelling of the nasal mucosa in patients with different forms of the disease. The study was conducted on the territory of the University Hospital \"Prof. Dr. St. Kirkovich\" (Stara Zagora, Bulgaria), where 139 participants (111 with allergic rhinosinusitis [AR] and 28 controls), aged 19 to 84 years, were examined. To compare the results, an acoustic rhinometry study was performed on the participants and the control group. The main indicators considered were the volume of the nasal cavity, the minimum cross-section area of the left and right halves, as well as the distance from the nasal entrance where it is located. To check the reactivity of the nasal mucosa, the same test was repeated after using a nasal decongestant. Increased nasal mucosal swelling in patients with IAR than those with PAR has been found. More manifested nasal congestion is observed in patients with IAR, probably because pollen has a stronger immunological stimulus and causes more manifested expression of symptoms than allergens provoking year-round forms of AR. A severely reduced reactive response to nasal decongestants has been demonstrated in participants with persistent AR.",

Inhibition of angiogenesis and other growth pathways that are pivotal for tumor progression lead to significant improvement of survival in patients with mRCC. The main aim of this study was to compare the effects of temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitor) and interferon alpha-2a (IFN-alpha-2a) on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with T3 stage mRCC who developed lung metastasis in the first two years after radical nephrectomy. A total of 60 patients diagnosed with T3 stage renal cancer who developed metastases in the lungs within two years after radical nephrectomy were included in a prospective study conducted at the Department for Urology, Clinical Center of Vojvodina and partially retrospective study at the Oncology Institute in Sremska Kamenica. Patients were divided into two groups consisting of 30 patients according to treatment with temsirolimus or IFN-alpha. During the first year of treatment, OS of patients treated with temsirolimus was 23.33%, whereas in patients treated with IFN-alpha it was 16.67%. Median survival in patients treated with temsirolimus was 9.3 months, whereas in patients treated with IFN-alpha it was 6.9 months, yielding a statistically significant difference (p=0.028). Patients treated with temsirolimus showed a statistically significantly longer median PFS compared to patients treated with IFN-alpha (p<0.0085). In conclusion, temsirolimus therapy had a significantly positive effect on survival in patients with mRCC. Patients treated with temsirolimus showed significantly longer median survival and median PFS compared to patients treated with IFN-alpha.",

The effect of CO 2 pneumoperitoneum on the cirrhotic liver was also discussed. Results obtained by laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 24 liver cirrhosis patients are presented. The experience acquired since the introduction of laparoscopic procedures at our unit is briefly described. The index of conversion was 4.16% (1/24) and mortality rate 0. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.9 days. The use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone disease is proposed in patients with liver cirrhosis as the first choice operative method of treatment.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY Œ Pathohistologic diagnosis plays a pivotal role in therapeutic modalities for cancer, and acts asa prognostic factor. The histologic grade is a numeric expression of tumor differentiation and is linked topatient outcome. Broders™ scoring system is still widely used in scoring squamous cell carcinomas. New datasuggest that in the most invasive parts of a malignant tumor, the morphology and biologic behavior differfrom the central and superficial areas of the same tumor. A new invasive cell grading system has beenproposed as a better prognostic factor in the multifactorial diagnostic and therapeutic approach to thepatient with malignant tumor. Numerous studies performed to date have provided sufficient evidence topropose the invasive cell grading system to be introduced instead of the ‚old™ Broders™ scoring system.Key words: Carcinoma Œ diagnosis; Carcinoma Œ pathology; Carcinoma Œ prognosis Introduction Pathohistologic diagnosis is fundamental in the studyof many diseases, tumors in particular. Therapeutic mo-dalities for cancer can often rely upon diagnostic data pro-vided by pathologists. Apart from the routine diagnosticprocedure, histologic examination of the surgical specimenyields valuable data on the biologic behavior of the tumor.On histopathologic assessment, many tumors are notgraded or scored because sufficient information is associ-ated with a specific diagnostic label. For example, cutane-ous basal cell carcinomas are not graded because the diag-nostic label and assessment of whether the lesion is excisedare the only data required for the referring clinician to treatthe patient.In the majority of malignant tumors, the relation be-tween the biologic behavior and the extent of differentia-tion is known for more than a century",

    "abstract": "Nakon zavrsene dekade mozga moždani udar je i nadalje treci uzrok smrtnosti u svijetu, a prvi uzrok smrtnosri u Republici Hrvatskoj. Moždani udarje prvi uzrok invalid-nosti u nas i u svijetu. Zadnjih godina od moždanog udara sve cesce obolijevaju i bolesnici u najprodukrivnijim godi-nama života, sto ga cini sve vecim kako zdravstvenim tako i ekonomskim problemom. Epidemioloski podaci iz zapad-nih zemalja pokazuju smanjivanje morbiditeta i mortaliteta od moždanog udara u zadnjim desetljecima prosloga sto-Ijeca, stoje izravna posljedica preventivnih aktivnosti. Na-suprot tome, podaci za Hrvatsku pokazuju porast morbidi-teta i mortaliteta od moždanog udara. Prevencija je jos uvijek najbolji pristup moždnom udaru. Cilj prevencijeje smanjiti rizik nastanka moždanog udara djelovanjem na cimbenike rizika. Najcesci cimbenici rizika ukljucuju nep-rimjerenu prehranu, konzumiranje alkohola, pusenje, smanjenu tjelesnu aktivnost, hipertenziju, secernu bolest, povisene vrijednosri kolesterola u serumu, infarkt miokar-da, atrijsku fibrilaciju i karotidnu stenozu. U dijagnostici patologije moždane cirkulacije doplerskaje sonografska' dijagnostika postala nezaobilaznom metodom. Ekstrak-ranijski obojeni dopler i transkranijski dopler omogucuju brzu procjenu cerebrovaskularnog statusa bolesnika te prikaz raznih patoloskih stanja na krvnim žilama. Pretrage su neinvazivne i mogu se ponavljari bez rizika za bolesni-ka, cime su postale glavnom dijagnostickom metodom u primarnoj prevenciji cerebrovaskularnih bolesti, a pogodne su i za primjenu uz bolesnicki krevet. Terapija ishemijskog moždanog udara zasniva se na antiagregacijskom lijecenju koje se preporuca osobama s cimbenicima rizika, nakon tranzitome ishemijske atake (TIA) ili moždanog udara, a primjenjuje se i kod akutnog ishemijskog moždanog udara, dok se anrikoagulantna terapija indicira u posebnim sluca-jevima akutnog ishemijskog moždanog udara, a u sekundarnoj prevenciji nalazi mjesto kod određenih srcanih bolesti (atrijska fibrilacija). Kod simptomatskih bolesnika sa znacajnom stenozom karotidnih arterija kirurskije zahvat terapija izbora. Unazad nekoliko godina u brojnim zapadnim zem-Ijama u lijecenju akutnog ishemijskog moždanog udara primjenjuje se tromboliza (rtPA). Lijecenje se provodi po tocno odredenom protokolu, jer svako odstupanje donosi velik rizik komplikacija. Mada je trombolizu moguce provesti samo u malobrojnih bolesnika, onaje putokaz da terapija ishemijskog moždanog udara postoji i da treba naglasavati potrebu prompme reakcije bolesnika, njegove okoline i medicinskog osoblja. Uz najnovija istraživanja usmjerena ka potpomaganju trombolize pomocu kon-tinuiranog monitoriranja transkranijskim doplerom (TCD-om) provode se brojna istraživanja koja imaju za cilj urgent-no djelovati na penumbru. Dokazano je da se zbrinjavan-jem bolesnika u pri-mjereno opremljenim odjelima (jedinice za moždani udar - stroke units) cak i bez primjene trombolize znacajno sma-njuju smrtnost i invalidnost. Stogaje neophodna reorganizacija medicinske službe kako bi se moždani udar shvatio kao hitno stanje koje zahtijeva hitan transport u primje-reno opremljenu ustanovu. Usprkos napretku u zbrinjavanju bolesnika s moždanim udarom bolesnici nakon preboljelog moždanog udara vrlo cesto imaju teska ostecenja i funkcionalna ogranicenja kret-anja i percepcije. Rehabilitacija je kljucna u zbrinjavanju bolesnika s preboljelim moždanim udarom. Rano zapocetom rehabilitacijom moguce je dodatno smanjiti invalid-nost. lako rehabilitacijski programi ne mijenjaju neuroloski deficit bolesnika, mogu znacajno pridonijeti osamostaljivanju bolesnika. Rehabilkaciju bi trebao provoditi mul-tidisciplinarni tim strucnjaka. Bolesnici i clanovi njihovih obkelji moraju biti ukljuceni u rehabilkacijski tim.

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n Nowadays, different methods for determination of thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TGA), microsomal autoantibodies (TMA) and autoantibodies to enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO) have been developed. The specificity and sensitivity of these methods depend on the purity of autoantigen preparation itself, valid standardization and type of the methodology used, e.g., agglutination of gelatine particle carriers sensitized with antigen, radioimmunoassay (RIA), immunometric assay (IRMA), enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or luminometric assay (LIA). Although variable in their sensitivity and specificity, these tests are useful parameters in clinical practice, especially for patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, patients with differentiated thyroid cancer and pregnant women. Among six different methods (A-F) that were used in this study, four methods are based on the EIA principle, and one on the LIA and agglutination methodology each. Comparison of TGA, TMA and TPO values obtained by two, three and four methods in parallel was done on 527 frozen serum samples of outpatients. The concordance of TGA results was found to be in the range from 66% to 83% for two methods and 65% for three methods. The concordance of TMA/TPO results was in the range from 42% to 100% for two methods and 48% for four methods. The results suggest that the thyroid autoantibody methods need to be standardized and we are not yet certain which one of the methods is most reliable. False negative/positive TGA and TPO autoantibodies may cause a mistake in the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease patients. Only an accurate, nonbiased TGA method can provide reliable TGA values that may interfere during thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement changing its concentration in serum of differentiated thyroid cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n Anderson-Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive glycolipid storage disease caused by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. Numerous mutations are responsible for development of the disease. Clinical manifestations include acroparesthesia from childhood, corneal dystrophy, angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, hearing loss and, with aging, development of cardiovascular and renal disease. Renal failure typically begins in the third decade of life. A young male patient presents with proteinuria and impaired urinary concentrating ability, or reaches end-stage renal disease of unknown origin without prior supervision of nephrologist. Polyuria and nicturia are the first signs of disease caused by urinary concentration defect. Proteinuria begins in the second decade of life, and is usually below the nephrotic level. Urinalysis is characterized by hematuria and lipiduria. Urinary sediment contains lipid globules and characteristic iMaltese crossesi. Enzyme replacement therapy has recently become available. Two formulations of alpha-galactosidase A have received marketing authorization. It seems possible to halt and probably even reverse the progression of Fabry disease before the irreversible organ damage has set in. Clinical trials have proved the efficacy and safety of treatment with agalsidase alpha or beta. Besides its beneficial effect on renal function, enzyme replacement therapy improves cardiac parameters and quality of life in patients with Anderson-Fabry disease. The main disadvantage of enzyme replacement therapy is the very high cost of treatment, posing a challenge even to the most industrialized countries in the world.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of postoperative hypoparathyroidism in two groups of patients who were treated for differentiated thyroid cancer.A retrospective analysis of 179 patients who were treated for differentiated thyroid cancer in our institution from January 2011 until December 2018 was performed. Only patients initially treated with total thyroidectomy and those who did not have preoperatively confirmed central compartment and lateral neck lymph node metastases were included in this study. Two main groups of patients were analysed. The patients who were treated with total thyroidectomy and elective central compartment lymph node dissection simultaneously were included in the first group. The patients who were treated only with total thyroidectomy were included in the second group. The rate of transitory and persistent postoperative hypoparathyroidism was compared between the two groups.A total of 117 patients (65.4%) underwent total thyroidectomy and elective central compartment lymph node dissection simultaneously (TT + CCLNd group). The remaining 62 patients (34.6%) underwent total thyroidectomy only (TT group). A total of 22.6% patients in the TT group developed postoperative hypoparathyroidism compared with 25.6% in the TT + CCLNd group. The rate of persistent hypoparathyroidism in the TT and TT + CCLNd groups was 3.2% and 6.0%, respectively. The difference in the rate of transient and persistent postoperative hypoparathyroidism was not statistically significant between the two groups. Within the TT + CCLNd group, 82.9% of patients underwent ipsilateral paratracheal lymph node dissection and 17.1% underwent bilateral paratracheal lymph node dissection. The rate of postoperative hypoparathyroidism was analysed in those two subgroups of patients and did not prove to be statistically significant.While its impact on the local recurrence rate is still controversial, elective central compartment lymph node dissection could be a great tool for selection of patients who could profit from adjuvant radioiodine treatment. On the other hand, central compartment lymph node dissection could potentially increase the risk of hypoparathyroidism due to involuntary injury to parathyroid glands and/or their blood supply. Our study did not find a statistically significant difference regarding postoperative hypoparathyroidism between patients who underwent central compartment lymph node dissection compared with patients who underwent total thyroidectomy only. Our data are not in accordance with some of the previously published studies.Our results demonstrated that elective central compartment lymph node dissection is a safe procedure and does not significantly increase the risk of postoperative hypoparathyroidism when it is performed simultaneously with total thyroidectomy.",

    "abstract": "Femur fractures in children can be treated with a number of operative and conservative methods.Numerous factors determine which method is optimal for a specific fracture.The aim of this research was to analyze distribution of femur fractures in children living in the urban communities of Zagreb and Zagreb County by localization, type and frequency of treatment methods used according to age and fracture mechanism.The research included 103 children aged up to 18 years, treated for femur fractures at the Zagreb University Hospital Centre and Zagreb Children's Hospital.Data were collected from these institutions and a retrospective study covered the 2010-2015 period.The cause of fracture and diagnosis were coded with the help of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems.Operative treatment was applied in 55% of cases, which is contrary to previous researches.The highest incidence of femur fractures was recorded in the 0-to 4-year age groups, accounting for 49.1% of all fractures.These fractures mostly occurred due to falls and were more often treated with non-operative methods.All other age groups were mostly treated with operative methods.Coxofemoral immobilization and traction were used as non-operative methods, whereas flexible intramedullary nailing was the most frequently used operative method.The treatment depended on age, complexity of the fracture, fracture type, fragment displacement, and associated injuries.The cause was also an important factor on choosing the treatment method.Nonoperative treatment was mostly used for fractures caused by falls (64.71% of cases due to falls) and operative treatment was mostly used for fractures caused by traffic accidents (79.4% of cases due to traffic accidents).It is a wide-known opinion that the best treatment for femur fractures in children is non-operative treatment.However, recent studies have shown that the use of operative methods in femur fracture treatment is growing.Our cohort of children treated during a five-year period (2010-2015) also underwent operative treatment more often than non-operative one.Two non-operative and eight operative methods were used.With such a large number of methods, it is clear that there is no unique method for all fractures.However, it is clear that the trend of using operative treatment is connected to the perennial trend of considerable sociodemographic and socioeconomic changes in urban settings such as Zagreb.Lifestyle changes directly affect the prevalence of femur fractures among children, as well as approach to treatment choice.General opinion is that most of fractures that occur at an early age can be treated with non-operative methods.Our research on femur fractures in children confirmed this rule.The youngest age group that had the highest incidence of fractures (49.1% of all fractures) was treated with non-operative methods in 75% of cases.Operative methods prevailed in other age groups.Similar results have been published by other authors.",

Tigecycline resistance in multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolates were analyzed using the disc diffusion test (DDT), agar gradient test (AGT), and gold standard test [broth microdilution test (BMT)]. A. baumannii isolates resistant to multiple drugs were included in the study (N=94). Using the BMT method, 89 (95%), 4 (4%) and 1 (1%) A. baumannii isolates were determined as tigecycline susceptible, intermediate and resistant isolates, respectively. Using the Food and Drug Administration criteria, the rates of major error (ME), minor error (mE) and categorical agreement (CA) for DDT were 26%, 67% and 9%, respectively. In contrast, for AGT, the rates of ME, mE and CA were 0%, 4%, 95%, respectively. Tigecycline resistance as assessed by BMT showed no increase between 2013 and 2015. Accordingly, isolates found to be resistant or intermediate by DDT should be confirmed by BMT. Due to the ease of application, AGT is a safe method of detecting susceptibility.",

TAP block has been shown to reduce postoperative pain scores and side effects of opioids after cesarean section. Generally, TAP block was introduced after cesarean section. It is assumed that delivery affects sonographic characteristics of the abdominal wall. For this reason, ultrasonographic measurement of the anatomy of the region defined for TAP block was performed before and after cesarean section. It was aimed to determine the estimated TAP block distance in the population undergoing cesarean section. Fifty patients who underwent cesarean section in the operating room were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were ASA score I-II, age 18-45 years, gestational age ≥32 weeks, and cesarean section performed by Pfannenstiel incision. Data on patient age, weight, height, body mass index, gravidity, parity, gestational age (weeks), concomitant disease and allergy were recorded. According to the results obtained in the study, ultrasound should be performed if TAP block is accessible. Before cesarean section, the external oblique muscle and internal oblique muscle are closer to surface than after cesarean section since the TAP distance after pregnancy will be deeper. Systematic data on ultrasonographic anatomy of the abdominal wall in pregnant women have not yet been published. The obstetric anesthesiologist should be aware of these changes when planning a TAP block in the context of cesarean section. There is a need for larger prospective studies.",

Our study compared breast cancer patients with and without preoperative breast MRI and their long-term oncologic outcomes are reported. A total of 1378 BCS cases with early breast cancer between 1996 and 2017 were reviewed. Patients with carcinoma in situ or neoadjuvant treatment or having breast MRI after tumor excision were excluded. Of 1378 patients, 270 (19.5%) had preoperative MRI. There were no significant differences regarding T and N stage and molecular subtypes between the groups. Surgical margins were significantly wider in the breast MRI group. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 96.9% in the MRI group and 94.3% in the control group, and this difference was not significant (p=0.11). Five-year local-regional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was not significantly different either (98.8% and 96.5%, respectively, p=0.41). When analyses were repeated only for patients with hormone receptor-negative or triple-negative breast cancer, there was still no significant difference in OS, LRFS, or disease-free survival. In conclusion, MRI does not seem necessary in all patients undergoing BCS. New prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to determine appropriate use of preoperative MRI and its effects on oncologic outcomes in early breast cancer patients.",

In short, there are five diagnostic thermographic criteria for varicocele, i.e., pattern of scrotal thermographic image indicative of varicocele, temperature at pampiniform plexus ≥34 C°, temperature difference between left and right pampiniform plexus ≥0.5 C°, enhancement of image during Valsalva maneuver, and temperature at pampiniform plexus ≥ temperature at ipsilateral thigh. Three or more positive signs are indicative of varicocele. The aim of this report is to present the use of digital thermography as a diagnostic method to evaluate the outcome of varicocele repair. We present a case of a student diagnosed with varicocele grade III, and assessed preoperatively and followed up postoperatively by scrotal thermography. According to thermographic indicators, our patient was positive for varicocele diagnosis before surgical treatment. Three months after varicocele repair, the patient did not show positive thermographic indicators of varicocele while physical examination and color Doppler ultrasound were equivocal. This case report suggests that infrared digital thermography of scrotum could be very valuable for monitoring patients in the period after surgery for varicocele, however, it should be confirmed in a larger number of patients.",

Our sample consisted of 2761 patients with warfare PTSD hospitalized during the 20-year period (1999-2018). The results confirmed a higher number of hospitalizations in the 2009-2018 period than in the 1999-2008 period for the group of PTSD patients with both mental and physical comorbidity. Furthermore, no significant difference was found in the number of hospitalizations between the two ten-year periods for the group of PTSD patients with mental comorbidity. We argued that both mental and physical comorbidities along with PTSD are needed to induce a significantly higher level of distress in patients, resulting in a higher number of hospitalizations after a longer period of time. Patients with the most severe conditions and comorbidity have a greater need to seek help from mental health professionals as their mental and physical state deteriorates to a higher degree when not in the treatment of any kind.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic therapy is indicated during acute cholecystitis. However, in the treatment of uncomplicated cholelithiasis, prophylactic use of antibiotics is controversial. Microbiological and laboratory data are the basis for the choice of antibiotic treatment. However, monitoring and updating local antibiograms is important because they ensure effective therapy in the given clinical environment. The study included 110 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, divided into the group of uncomplicated cholelithiasis (n=60) and the group of acute cholecystitis (n=50). Preoperative data included age, sex, body mass index, leukocytes, C-reactive protein, and ultrasound examination. Bile samples for bacteriological testing were obtained under aseptic conditions during the surgery. Cultures were evaluated for aerobic, anaerobic and fungal organisms using routine tests. After the surgery, gallbladder specimens were sent for histopathological examination. In the group of uncomplicated cholelithiasis, 6/60 positive samples were found, and in the group of acute cholecystitis, there were 25/50 positive microbiological findings. Citrobacter sp. and Enterococcus faecalis predominated in the group of uncomplicated cholelithiasis, and Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Citrobacter sp. in the group of acute cholecystitis. Antibiotics were administered to 49/50 patients with acute cholecystitis and to 32/60 patients with uncomplicated cholelithiasis. Cefazolin was the most frequently used antibiotic and also the most resistant antibiotic. To conclude, the administration of antibiotics in elective patients is not justified. The results of this study indicate that third-generation cephalosporin or ciprofloxacin + metronidazole should be administered in mild and moderate acute cholecystitis, and fourth-generation cephalosporin + metronidazole in severe acute cholecystitis in this local setting. The appropriate use of antibiotic agents is crucial and should be integrated into good clinical practice and standards of care.",

The study included outpatient RGPLW managed at Zagreb University Hospital Center in Zagreb, Croatia. They filled out a questionnaire that included demographic data, duration of lens wear, self-evaluation compliance grade, and 14 lens care procedures and wearing habits indicative of compliance. There were 50 patients (mean age 34.6 years, 68% female). Full compliance was found in a single patient. The mean number of non-compliant procedures was 5.48, with 32% of participants non-compliant in more than 50% of the compliance criteria. Critical procedures of the lens care process were infrequent lens case exchange (74%), using tap water for lens (70%), and improper case cleaning (68%). The mean lens case replacement time was 9.8 months (SD 6.76), with only 26% of patients replacing lens case at least once in 3 months. Excessive daily lens wear was associated with greater total number of non-compliant procedures (p<0.0008). RGPLW were aware of their inappropriate lens care only when achieved non-compliance in almost 50% of the procedures. In conclusion, lens wearers were not aware of their extremely low compliance rate in several aspects of lens and lens case maintenance. Study results indicated the key procedures the practitioners should focus on when evaluating subjective and objective compliance and reinforcing care and hygiene education of RGPLW.",

    "abstract": "All malignancies, including prostate cancer, require accurate diagnosing and staging before making a treatment decision. The introduction of targeted biopsies based on prostate MRI findings has raised prostate biopsy accuracy. Guided biopsies target the tumor itself during the biopsy instead of the most common tumor sites as is the case with a systemic biopsy. Some studies report that targeted biopsies should lower prostate cancer biopsy undergrading and overgrading.To determine the incidence of prostate cancer biopsy undergrading in patients who underwent a classic systemic biopsy compared to patients who underwent a mpMRI cognitive targeted biopsy.We identified the patients from our database who underwent a radical prostatectomy at our institution from January 1st, 2021, to June 30th, 2021.There were 112 patients identified. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the type of biopsy that confirmed prostate cancer. The mpMRI (N=50) group had a mpMRI cognitive guided transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate biopsy performed, and the non-mpMRI group (N=62) received a classic, systemic TRUS biopsy. We compared the biopsy results with the final pathological results, and searched for undergrading or overgrading in the biopsies compared to the final histological report.The undergrading was found in 17,7% (N=11) cases in the non-mpMRI group and in 12,0% (N=6) of cases in the mpMRI group (p=0,02, Mann-Whitney U test). No overgrading was found in our cohort. All cases of undergrading had Grade Group 1 in the biopsy report and Grade Group 2 in the final specimen report. The charasteristics of patients are listed in Table 1.In our cohort, the patients who underwent a mpMRI targeted biopsy had a lower undergrading incidence. During a systemic TRUS biopsy, the urologist targets the areas of the prostate where cancer is most commonly located, which is usually the peripheral zone of the prostate. Since different areas of the tumor have different areas of differentiation, only a low-grade part of the tumor is sometimes biopsied, which results in a sampling error. Once the prostate is removed, the whole tumor is analyzed, so the obtained pathological results related to the removed prostate are far more accurate than the analysis of prostate cores obtained by biopsy.",

Meningitis was confirmed by lumbar puncture and intravenous antimicrobial therapy was started. Since he had undergone radical tympanomastoidectomy 15 years before, otogenic meningitis was suspected, so the patient was referred to our department. Clinically, the patient manifested watery discharge from the right nostril. Microbiological analysis verified Staphylococcus aureus in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample acquired by lumbar puncture. Radiological work-up, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans, showed an expanding lesion of the petrous apex of the right temporal bone disrupting the posterior bony wall of the right sphenoid sinus with radiological characteristics indicating cholesteatoma. Those findings confirmed rhinogenic meningitis caused by expansion of the petrous apex congenital cholesteatoma into the sphenoid sinus, allowing nasal bacteria to enter the cranial cavity. The cholesteatoma was removed completely by the simultaneous transotic and transsphenoidal approach. Since the right labyrinth was already non-functional, there was no surgical morbidity after labyrinthectomy. The facial nerve remained preserved and intact. The transsphenoidal approach enabled removal of the sphenoid portion of the cholesteatoma and two surgeons met together at the level of the retrocarotid segment of the cholesteatoma, completely removing the lesion. This case represents an extremely rare condition in which a petrous apex congenital cholesteatoma expanded through the petrous apex to the sphenoid sinus, causing CSF rhinorrhea and rhinogenic meningitis. According to available literature, this is the first case of petrous apex congenital cholesteatoma causing rhinogenic meningitis successfully treated with the simultaneous transotic and transsphenoidal approach.",

Alongside open surgery, transoral endoscopic laser surgery (TOLS) has become widespread as a treatment method. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of transoral laser cordectomy in a group of patients with early glottic carcinoma. We retrospectively analyzed data on 131 patients who underwent TOLS in the 2017-2021 period. We divided patients into groups according to tumor stage and type of cordectomy performed, and compared outcomes between the groups. Our results revealed a higher number of patients in the group with Tis and T1a than in those with T1b and T2 who underwent type III cordectomy, and also a higher number of those for whom outpatient follow-ups were sufficient after surgery in the same group. We did not observe significant difference in outcomes according to cordectomy type except for type V (a-d), where a higher number of patients had to undergo radiotherapy. This study underlines the importance of careful patient selection for TOLS, as well as the need for close cooperation with pathology and radiology specialists to ensure optimal approach and extent of surgery for each individual patient. It also displayed TOLS as a sound therapeutic option for early stages of glottic carcinoma but also indicated the need for similar studies in a larger number of patients to elucidate the effectiveness in certain glottis areas.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma represents the most aggressive tumor of the brain with an estimated survival rate of twelve to fifteen months after the primary diagnosis. The role of neurotropic viruses in pathogenesis of the tumor has remained unclear to date. During the last two decades, many studies were conducted with the aim of confirming viral influence in the development of glioblastoma.We conducted a retrospective study in a time period of five years using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of glioblastoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed for three viruses: CMV, EBV and HSV-1, using an automated staining system.Mean age of patients in our group was 66.7±8.5 years. A slight male dominance was noted. Negative immunohistochemistry results were obtained for CMV and EBV, which were excluded from further investigation. Based on IRS score, we confirmed six HSV-1 samples which were rated as IRS score 2. Five more samples of HSV-1 were rated as IRS score 1 and were excluded from the study.According to our retrospective study and its results, we found no impact of neurotropic viruses in the survival rate of glioblastoma. Further studies should be conducted including a wider range of viral detection methods.",

OSA can be successfully treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), weight loss, positional therapy, oral appliances, hypoglossal nerve stimulation, and surgical procedures. It has been observed that untreated OSA is related to chronic disorders including hypertension, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, stroke, depression, and cognitive decline. Event-related potentials (ERPs) is the procedure that has been widely used for evaluating cognitive brain functions. Using auditory event-related potentials (P300), this study aimed to examine the effect of CPAP therapy on cognitive functions in patients with moderate and severe OSA. The results of the study showed improvement in P300 latency and amplitude after 3 months of CPAP therapy, indicating a positive effect of CPAP therapy in the prevention of cognitive decline in patients with OSA.",

Unilateral/bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion (UACP/BACP) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) remains a safe and useful procedure for circulation during management of acute aortic dissection. The aim of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of both unilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest on postoperative outcomes during management of acute aortic dissection repair at our center.Our prospective study consisted of 26 patients who underwent acute aortic dissection repair with various circulation strategy. Group A consisted of 14 (53.8%) patients who were operated on under unilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion, while group B consisted of 12 (46.2%) patients who were operated on under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest without cerebral perfusion. Postoperative outcomes included mortality, drainage, blood transfusion (free frozen plasma, erythrocyte suspension), ventilation time and revision due to bleeding.The average age of our study population was 55.2 ± 16.2 (range 33-83) years. Mortality was observed in 3 (11.5%) of our patients. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of mortality and revision due to bleeding (p ˃ 0.05). Blood transfusion (erythrocyte suspension and free frozen plasma), drainage and ventilation time were significantly lower in Group A compared with Group B (p ˃ 0.05).Both unilateral antegrade cerebral circulation and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest can be safely used during acute aortic dissection, although unilateral antegrade cerebral circulation has proved to be superior over deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with good postoperative outcomes.",

The coexistence of circulating anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-GBM disease, the so-called double-positive disease (DPD), is exceptionally rare. We report a unique case of DPD manifesting as pulmonary-renal syndrome (PRS) in a 46-year-old woman who first presented with clinical and radiological suspicion of pneumonia. Chest computed tomography scan later revealed bilateral alveolar hemorrhage. Kidney biopsy showed necrotizing crescentic (100% glomeruli) glomerulonephritis. On immunofluorescence microscopy, glomeruli were global linear positive for IgG, confirming anti-GBM disease. Double positivity was detected for circulating anti-myeloperoxidase ANCA (p-ANCA) and anti-GBM antibodies. Acute renal failure evolved rapidly. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and hemodialysis (HD) were initiated early in combination with intravenous pulse corticosteroid therapy followed by oral methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. Pulmonary hemorrhage resolved, but renal function could not be preserved. The patient remains HD dependent. This case report highlights that pulmonary symptomatology may be the leading clinical presentation of PRS, with initially normal renal function at DPD onset. Early recognition and diagnosis are therefore crucial to timely clinical intervention. The role of prompt kidney biopsy and initiation of TPE and HD in PRS must not be underestimated.",

Diabetes, as one of the earliest recorded illnesses in medical writings, has been a focus of research for almost the entire written human history. Groundbreaking discoveries during the early 20th century have resulted in type 1 diabetes mellitus becoming a treatable, chronic condition. The relationship between good glycemic control and reduced occurrence of diabetes complications was established, which has enticed further development and refinements in insulin treatment, ranging from the purification and increased quality of insulin itself, as well as various inventions in its administration. Despite great achievements in insulin therapy so far, future research aims to avoid the need for subcutaneous administration and to create non-invasive means of insulin application.",

The aims of this prospective study were to estimate the trends in physical activity (PA) level, accuracy of the Baecke's/LRC-PA questionnaires, and trends in obesity parameters (body mass index-BMI/waist-to-hip ratio-WHR) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the last two decades. We grouped 209 patients with ACS (UAP-unstable angina, STEMI-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, NSTEMI-non STEMI) by year of admission (Group 2002-05/Group 2017) and compared them by the levels of PA (Baecke's/LRC-PA questionnaires) and obesity parameters (BMI, WHR). Group 2017 had higher WHR (1.02 vs. 0.97) and leisure PA index (LI) (3.00 vs. 2.50), as well as less high and very low activity patients (P<0.05). Patients with UAP/STEMI had higher WHR in 2017 (1.02 vs. 0.96, 1.02 vs. 0.99, respectively) (P<0.05) and had lower LI in 2002-05 (2.50 vs. 3.25, 2.75 vs. 3.50, respectively) (P<0.05). In conclusion, leisure PA and WHR was increased in the study period both in patients with ACS and in the general population. We emphasize the usage of more precise methods for evaluation of PA and obesity (Baecke's/Four-point LRC-PA questionnaires, WHR), and that only increased PA with dietary changes leads to reduction of central obesity and risk of ACS.",

Several different factors could affect intracranial aneurysm (IA) rupture, such as morphological and hemodynamic factors. The aim of this study was to establish the potential association of meteorological data such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity, and the onset of clinical symptoms preceding hospital admission of patients with acute SAH due to IA rupture. This retrospective study included 130 consecutive patients admitted for non-traumatic SAH with a determinable onset of SAH symptoms. The effects of meteorological parameters of atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature, and relative air humidity on the day of acute SAH onset and 24 hours prior to the onset of symptoms were recorded and analyzed in each patient. Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to assess the risks of incident SAH on the basis of daily meteorological data. Seasonal incidence of acute SAH showed the peak incidence in winter and a trough in summer, with monthly incidence peak in January and December. The circadian rhythm analysis showed the peak incidence of SAH in the forenoon, followed by the evening. Acute SAH incidence showed moderate positive association with daily atmospheric pressure (p<0.05), while no association was found with ambient temperature and relative air humidity. Our results suggested no significant association of changes in ambient temperature and relative humidity with the risk of SAH. Increases in atmospheric pressure were weakly associated with a higher SAH risk. Additional studies are needed to establish in detail both meteorological and morphological factors important to predict IA rupture and SAH.",

We performed a nested cross-sectional analysis using data collected at baseline in a prospective cohort study conducted in 2008-2009 at a special hospital for medical rehabilitation in Croatia. The outcome was the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score. The independent variable was body weight. The focal moderators were body height and sex. The moderation analysis was adjusted for seven sociodemographic and clinical covariates. We analyzed data on 72 patients with a median (interquartile range) age of 50 (43-55) years, 36 (50%) of whom were women, treated for nonspecific, chronic LBP. The interaction of sex, body weight and height was a significant predictor of the RMDQ score after adjustments for all covariates (increase of R2=0.13; p=0.001; false discovery rate <5%). In both sexes, the correlation between body weight and the RMDQ score was significantly moderated by body height but in opposite ways. In conclusion, the effects of body weight on physical disability are moderated by body height, but this moderation effect differs between women and men.",

    "abstract": "This research was carried out to adapt the Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool for Turkish children with cancer aged 4-7 years, and to evaluate its validity and reliability. This study, which was descriptive and methodological, was conducted on 159 children receiving cancer treatments between June 2021 and December 2021. Data collection tools included a socio-demographic form and the Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool for children aged 4-7 years (mini-SSPedi). Data were analyzed using Cronbach's alpha, factor analysis, and item-total score analysis. There were 15 items on the mini-SSPedi, and it had one dimension. The results of the exploratory factor analysis indicated that total factor loading was >0.30 and that the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value was 0.831. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the fit indices were χ2/sd: 1.739 (p=0.000), GFI 0.895, CFI 0.919, TLI 0.897, RMSEA 0.068 and SRMR 0.064. Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the total scale was 0.846. The correlation between the items and total scale score ranged between 0.411 and 0.749. The mini-SSPedi was found to be a valid and reliable scale for the Turkish sample. The mini-SSPedi can contribute to determination of symptom screening in children with cancer aged 4-7 years.",

Three thousand thoracic CT scans taken consecutively because of COVID-19 suspicion, diagnosis or follow-up after admission to our hospital between March 2020 and May 2020 were studied. All CT examinations were assigned to the appropriate groups of the aferomentioned CT reporting systems and these systems were compared with each other. Thorax CT imaging did not reveal any findings indicative of infection (RSNA: 40.7%, BTSI: nonapplicable, and CO-RADS: 40.1%) in the vast majority of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (+) cases in all three reporting systems. The highest number of cases was included in the groups classified as typical/classic/CO-RADS 5 findings in all three reporting systems (RSNA: 213, BSTI: 212, and CO-RADS:101) in COVID-19 diagnosed cases with lung findings. There was no significant difference between PCR (+) and (-) cases with probable COVID-19 infection according to BSTI reporting system and CO-RADS 4 cases (30/23, p=0.381 and 22/19, p=0.245, respectively). In addition, typical thoracic CT findings were observed in RSNA: 70, BSTI: 71, CO-RADS: 71 individuals in all three classifications, but the PCR result was detected negative. When the three reporting systems were compared, we concluded that they did not show distinct advantage to each other and all three ensured that patients were properly classified with similar accuracy.",

    "abstract": "This rare prospective study investigated 10-year outcomes of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and evaluated the role of acute biomarkers and other parameters in predicting clinical severity and prognosis. We included 250 patients and analyzed their baseline (cardiovascular risk factors), laboratory (maximal CK/TnT, acute inflammatory (white blood cells (WBC), hs-CRP), and liver biomarkers (AST/LDH), glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and clinical severity parameters (length of hospital stay, in-hospital complications, coronary angiography, and echocardiography (LVEF)). After hospital discharge, 229 patients were followed-up (2011-2022) and grouped according to the presence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). In the acute phase, WBC, hs-CRP, LDH and AST positively correlated with maximal CK/cTnT and total in-hospital complications, and negatively with LVEF; WBC positively correlated with cardiogenic shock and stent diameter, hs-CRP with cardiac arrest and length of hospital stay, and LDH with stent diameter; total in-hospital complications increased the risk of in-hospital mortality and number of significantly stenosed coronary arteries, risk of heart failure, whereas the length of hospital stay negatively correlated with LVEF (p<0.05 all). During 10-year follow-up, LDH and clinical severity parameters (stenosis of LAD/ACx, multivessel CAD, proximal coronary stenosis, Gensini score, in-hospital complications) increased, while the others (normal eGFR and LVEF) reduced the risk of total MACE (p<0.05). In conclusion, acute biomarkers have a role in predicting clinical severity but they have no role in predicting long-term prognosis (except for LDH). Total in-hospital complications, more severe CAD, systolic dysfunction, and worse kidney function may lead to worse in-hospital and long-term outcomes.",

The second part included 90 women (58 healthy, 32 suffering from sterility), grouped according to their smoking status. Concentrations of total proteins in cervical mucus solutions and homogenates of cervical surface cells and their mitochondria, thiocyanate and ascorbic acid, rhodanese activity, concentrations of cytochrome P-450 (mitochondria), lipid peroxidation and the total antioxidant capacity in homogenates of cervical surface cells, concentrations of superoxide O2, reduced gluthatione (GSH), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were measured. The measurements showed higher concentrations of thiocyanate, cytochrome P-450 and lipid peroxidation values, and lower concentrations of ascorbic acid, cytochrome P-450 activity and FRAP in smokers. Higher concentrations of superoxide O2, GSH, AOPP, and lower FRAP were found among smokers and women suffering from sterility. In conclusion, changes in oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity caused by smoking indicate that the quality of cervical mucus among patients suffering from sterility is lower compared to healthy women.",

The first and biggest OMD was located in the Klanjec Public Health Center. In parallel with establishment of the maternity hospital (MH) in Zabok, all OMDs throughout today's Krapina-Zagorje County were closed. The aim of our research was to present the activities of Klanjec OMD (KOMD) and show its impact on perinatal health. Data on KOMD activities were obtained from the Birth Registry. Major obstetric procedures, including delivery by cesarean section, were not performed in KOMD. Based on the above, numerous transports of women in labor and postpartum transports were organized to maternity wards in large centers. The most common cause for transport were transports during childbirth caused by prolonged labor. In conclusion, organization of OMD in the area of today's Krapina-Zagorje County significantly improved perinatal care in the 1950s. It was followed by gradual closure of OMD which could not meet the newly set spatial, material and personnel demands, along with the establishment of maternity hospitals in general and university hospitals. The trend of perinatal and maternal mortality reduction in the Zagorje region that began with the establishment of inpatient maternity department at the Zabok Hospital continues to this day.",

The current situation in Turkey and in the world, as well as epidemiological data regarding the vector and relationship between the disease and traveling are also discussed. This retrospective study evaluated dengue fever cases identified using serological and molecular methods between January 2016 and February 2017 in the National Virology Reference Laboratory. Two patients had a travel history to Maldives, two patients to Thailand, one patient to Sri Lanka, and one patient to Guiana. Fever was present in all cases. The most common other symptoms were fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia. Increased liver enzymes (50%) and thrombocytopenia (66%) were the most commonly encountered laboratory changes. In conclusion, imported dengue fever cases are increasingly reported due to facilitation of international travels and increasing commercial activities. Before traveling to a region where dengue fever is endemic, consulting a travel medicine counseling desk or a doctor is suggested. Dengue fever should be kept in mind in a patient with travel history presenting with fever, elevated liver enzyme and thrombocytopenia.",

Recently, point-of-care tests (POCT) for rapid detection of COVID-19 antigen were presented as a cheaper, faster, and easier-to-perform option than reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. However, no study confirmed the efficacy of POCT used at a large sporting event that includes close physical contact, such as judo. An observational study was conducted that included 670 participants from 36 countries attending two consecutive judo competitions. In total, 839 RT-PCR tests and 839 POCT tests for COVID-19 were performed. There were 508 participants tested at one time point when entering the venue, while 162 were tested at two time points in order to participate in both competitions. Seven subjects had positive RT-PCR results, while 4 had positive POCT results, meaning the prevalence of COVID-19 at the competitions was 1.04% according to the RT-PCR results. The main finding of this study was that POCT testing proved to be an effective method in detecting true-negative results. However, due to sensitivity that is insufficient to detect all true-positive cases, POCT should always be used in combination with RT-PCR at large sporting events with close physical contact between competitors in order to avoid COVID-19 outbreak.",

We report the case of a 62-year-old female patient who presented with left eyelid edema, proptosis, diplopia, and lateral paralysis of the left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits showed retrobulbar mass in the left orbit with hyperintense signals within left medial rectus muscle, offsetting but not infiltrating the optic nerve. An 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) scan revealed pathological 18F-FDG uptake of expansive mass within rectus medialis muscle of the left eye (SUVmax=11.0) and similar findings in the right eye (SUVmax=7.1). It also displayed increased glucose metabolism in the thyroid gland (SUVmax=6.4). Laboratory findings showed increased thyrotropin level, while thyroid-stimulating-hormone-receptor antibodies were negative. The patient was diagnosed with HT and TAO, so levothyroxine therapy was introduced. Gradual improvement of TAO symptoms was attained a year later. Diplopia subsided and the patient regained complete eye movements. In conclusion, correction of hypothyroidism can significantly improve symptoms of TAO. Additional value of this case report lies in 18F-FDG PET/CT images displaying increased metabolic activity, which can advance clinical evaluation; however, further research is needed.",

There were three groups: the first group received a post-operative intra-articular (IA) injection containing methylprednisolone with lidocaine; the second group received the same combination periarticularly (PA); and the control group did not receive any form of injection. We measured the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score on the 3rd and 12th postoperative days, as well as six weeks after surgery. We measured knee range of motion (ROM) on the 12th postoperative day and six weeks after surgery. We calculated the Harris Hip Score (HHS) on the 3rd day and six weeks postoperatively. There were 27 patients. Preoperative Kellgren-Lawrence and VAS pain scores were similar. The IA group demonstrated the lowest VAS pain score after six weeks. ROM did not improve between groups on the 12th day and six weeks postoperatively. HHS was best in the IA group after 6 weeks. Injection of methylprednisolone with lidocaine into the knee improved postoperative rehabilitation in patients with knee osteoarthritis undergoing ipsilateral cephalomedullary fixation for a pertrochanteric fracture.",

    "abstract": "Tumor invasion of carotid arteries (CA) is found in 2%-7% of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). There are no standardized criteria to evaluate the invasion. Tumor invasion of CA is assessed by using computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. Ultrasound was also used but the method has not become daily routine. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tumor invasion on CA dynamics and to evaluate the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of invasion. The study was conducted on two groups of 22 patients each. The first group consisted of patients with confirmed HNC and CA infiltration, while the second group consisted of patients without any data of HNC. Motion of the CA wall was assessed using ultrasound from which a CA was segmented and then the amount of motion was assessed by optical flow calculation. All patients with a CT-verified CA infiltration had an altered CA motion. The research showed that tumor-infiltrated CA had an altered dynamic when viewed on ultrasound.",

A total of 600 participants were referred to dental radiography for digital orthopantomograms and asked to fill out the OIDP questionnaire. Digital orthopantomograms were analyzed and compared with OIDP results. The correlation between endodontic status and quality of life was tested. The statistical analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, non-parametric statistics, hierarchical multiple regression analysis by enter method, and correlation analysis. The results showed that quality of life was significantly affected by tooth loss (p<0.05). Endodontic treatment on canines and incisors positively correlated with higher OIDP scores, indicating an effect on quality of life (p<0.05). In conclusion, the correlations between variables describing the endodontic status and the quantitative results of the OIDP questionnaire indicate a measurable effect of endodontic disease/health on everyday functioning.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this prospective study was to determine changes in central macular thickness in the early postoperative period after uncomplicated phacoemulsification cataract surgery in diabetic patients using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Uncomplicated ultrasound phacoemulsification cataract surgery causes minimal changes of retinal layer thickness, which may result in subclinical cystoid macular edema development. This prospective study included 55 patients divided into two groups. Group 1 included diabetic patients with cataract, and group 2 included patients with cataract and without diabetes. All patients underwent uncomplicated ultrasound phacoemulsification cataract surgery at the Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Osijek in the period from November 2017 to January 2018. Patients were followed-up for one month after surgery. At each examination, OCT recording of the eye undergoing cataract surgery was performed. A statistically significant difference in central macular thickness in the diabetic group and control group (p=0.0005 both) was confirmed preoperatively and one month after cataract surgery. A statistically significant difference in central macular thickness was confirmed in diabetic group (p=0.006), as well as in the control group of patients (p=0.01) seven days and one month after cataract surgery. There was no statistically significant difference in macular thickness changes between the diabetic and control group of patients preoperatively (p=0.618), seven days (p=0.6848) or one month after cataract surgery (p=1). The effect of HbA1c on macular thickness change in diabetic patients was not statistically significant. The mean HbA1c in diabetic patients was 7.24±1.34%. There was no statistically significant difference in the effect of cumulative dissipated energy on macular thickness change in either group. This study confirmed a statistically significant correlation of the effect of fluid volume consumption on macular thickness changes in diabetic patients. There was no statistically significant effect of fluid volume consumption on macular thickness change in the control group of patients. Uncomplicated ultrasound phacoemulsification cataract surgery caused changes in cen-tral macular thickness in the early postoperative period in both patient groups. Changes in central macular thickness in the observed period were not manifested with clinically significant macular edema or by a more significant decrease in visual acuity. All patients had significant improvement in visual acuity seven days and one month after cataract surgery.",

A total of 50 eyes were diagnosed as POAG and 50 as PXG. Both groups were divided into 3 subgroups according to HAP2 criteria of visual field impairment. All eyes underwent optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). Radial peripapillary capillary (RPC) density, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness, superficial macular vessel density (SMVD), and macular thickness between the inner limiting membrane and inner plexiform layer (ILM-IPL) were compared. The overall mean measured values did not show a statistically significant difference between the groups. All measured parameters were statistically significantly lower with more extensive visual field damage within the group. The strongest positive correlation was found between the pRNFL thickness and RPC density values (p=0.893), and strongest negative correlation between the mean defect of visual field and ILM-IPL (p=-0.824). No statistically significant difference was found between POAG and PXG in all values measured on OCT-A. In conclusion, visual field loss is more strongly correlated with the loss of nerve fiber layer thickness than the superficial vessel density, which may suggest that the loss of RNFL precedes the loss of superficial vessel density.",

Digital kymography (DK) extracts high-speed images sampled at a single point along the vocal folds and enables objective quantification of the vocal fold movements. According to the literature, usage of topical anesthetic (TA) in oral cavity, oropharynx and laryngopharynx prior to examination, in order to reduce pain and discomfort level, is optional but the effect of using TA on the phonation process is not well investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of using TA during HSDI on DK parameters. We performed a prospective double-blind randomized controlled study on 58 healthy subjects. All subjects were examined on 2 consecutive days using TA and using saline solution (placebo) by the same experienced examiner. DK images, made on the middle of the vocal folds, were obtained from HSDI. Vocal folds were examined across glottal cycles and glottal width and period irregularities, left-right phase asymmetry, and the open, closed, opening and closing quotient were calculated. Our data showed that using TA during HSDI did not induce statistically significant changes of DK parameters in healthy subjects.",

Previous studies have shown that global DNA methylation could be a useful biomarker in COPD. We hypothesized that COPD patients from two different Croatian regions might have clinical characteristics, quality of life, and global DNA methylation, which could be used as a possible epigenetic marker. The study included 136 COPD patients with an average age of 70 years, of whom about 70% were men. Among them, 37% were active smokers, 58% ex-smokers, and 5% non-smokers. There were 69 patients in Osijek and 67 in Zadar. The control group consisted of 64 subjects who were not diagnosed with COPD or other respiratory diseases, 32 from each center. We analyzed risk factors, severity and type of symptoms, exacerbations, comorbidities, and numerous parameters of lung function, phenotypic characteristics, quality of life, and global DNA methylation. We found that COPD patients in Zadar had more pronounced emphysema (P<0.001), while COPD patients from Osijek had more severe symptoms of cough and expectoration (P<0.001 for both). Patients from Osijek had more cardiovascular comorbidities (P<0.001) and depression (P=0.01) than patients from Zadar. Analysis of global DNA methylation found that patients with COPD had lower values than the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant.",

The most common symptoms include headaches, palpitations, and sweating. Because of a diverse clinical presentation, pheochromocytomas pose a major diagnostic challenge and often go unidentified. These tumors can occur sporadically or as a part of hereditary syndromes. The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring plasma and 24-hour urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and functional morphological examinations are used for tumor localization. The treatment is operative and requires special preoperative patient preparation to prevent hypertensive crisis and arrhythmias. Due to the possibility of recurrence, the patient needs to be monitored. Pheochromocytoma has a high fatality rate if not recognized on time due to the effect of catecholamines on the cardiovascular system.",

Severe UTI can lead to sepsis or long-term complications such as renal scarring and hypertension. Given the rising concern of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, this research aimed to examine the epidemiology of neonatal UTI, most common antibiotic prescription patterns, as well as resistance of the causative agents in Croatia. This retrospective multicenter analysis was focused on neonates born in 2005 and 2015. Of the 103 bacterial UTI cases, 78.6% affected term neonates. Male neonates constituted 62.1% of the study population. Eutrophic neonates accounted for 87.4%, and hospital-acquired infections were prevalent in 47.6% of cases. The main causative pathogens were Escherichia coli (60.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.2%). Most commonly prescribed empirical antibiotics included ceftriaxone (31.1%) and the ampicillin-gentamicin combination (10.7%). In 2005, 72.7% of isolates were sensitive to empirical therapy. In 2015, sensitivity to empirical antibiotic therapy was observed in 75.6% of cases. In this study, Escherichia coli frequently exhibited antibiotic resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and gentamicin. For UTIs attributed to Klebsiella pneumoniae, the prevailing bacterial resistance was observed against gentamicin, ceftibuten, ampicillin, cefazolin, and piperacillin. The predominance of Escherichia coli as the most common pathogen causing UTI was consistent with global trends. Founded on continuous differences in bacterial resistance, this study can serve as a basis for comprehending local resistance patterns of pathogens causing neonatal UTI, highlighting the need of additional prospective research.",

Thirty-nine patients with SSc were enrolled in this study. ED and Warrick score were evaluated by HRCT. The relationships between Warrick score, lung function, and ED were analyzed. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the effect of individual predictors on SSc-ILD. ILD was present in 25 (64%) patients. ED >10 mm in one or more of the measured locations on HRCT was present in 25 (64%) patients and 19 (76%) of these patients had concurrent ILD. Subjects with esophageal dilatation had a higher Warrick score and lower lung function tests. The measurement of ED was able to predict the presence of ILD in 69% of patients. Results suggest that evaluation of ED during regular HRCT follow-up could be useful in patients with SSc due to the association of esophageal dilatation with worse lung function tests and a more severe form of ILD.",

    "abstract": "Acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is common in children and associated with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of respiratory viruses leading to admission of a child with the diagnosis of LRTI to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The distribution of viral pathogens was determined using viral multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in children with LRTI admitted to PICU at a tertiary-level reference pediatric hospital. The LRTI patients without a positive viral multiplex PCR finding were excluded from the study. Most patients were under 2 years of age (78.3%), and the most common viral pathogen resulting in PICU admission due to viral LRTI was RSV A/B (32.8%). Thirty three patients had an underlying disease. Ten (16.6%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 37 (61.6%) required high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT), and two patients (3.3%) progressed to pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). Underlying chronic disease presence was the highest in the IMV group with 90%, which decreased to 54% and 30.7% in the HFOT and standard oxygen treatment groups, respectively (p=0.018). The patients with IMV requirements had significantly longer hospital stay (median 8 days, range 6-13 days) compared to HFOT group (median 6 days, range 4-7.5 days] and regular oxygen treatment group (median 3 days, range 2-3.5 days) (p<0.001). The use of multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses may help in discriminating etiologic viral agents in patients admitted to PICU and estimating possible complications associated with viral-specific disease. The presence of an underlying disease in a patient with viral LRTI affects the treatment level, and treatment level affects the duration of PICU stay.",

    "abstract": "Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive condition caused by impaired lymphatic transport, leading to edema in the lower and/or upper extremities, depending on the underlying cause. The diagnosis is based on clinical examination, ultrasound findings, and imaging tests. Treatment is mostly conservative, usually long-term, and often yielding unsatisfactory results. Recently, surgical options have also become available. Lymphoscintigraphy, a non-invasive and simple nuclear medicine imaging technique, is considered the method of choice in diagnostic workup. It consists of intracutaneous or subcutaneous application of colloidal particles labelled with radioactive technetium-99m and two-dimensional or three-dimensional gamma camera imaging. Lymphoscintigraphy helps differentiate lymphedema from edema of another origin, assess disease severity, and evaluate surgery outcome. However, the procedure is not fully standardized, especially in terms of semiquantitative methods, which are additionally used in disease staging; however, their implementation varies depending on local experience and expertise.",

    "abstract": "Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common upper extremity compression neuropathy caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist. Along with motor and sensory fibers, sympathetic fibers also pass through the median nerve, playing an important role in the regulation of blood flow to the skin which interacts between the body interior and its environment. The aim of this study was to examine the preand postoperative correlation between skin temperature changes in the area innervated by compressed median nerve compared to the skin areas innervated by radial and ulnar nerve and median nerve of the unaffected hand. The study included 16 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome with an indication for open carpal tunnel decompression. Skin temperature was measured preoperatively, at 2-week, 2and 6-month follow-ups on the areas innervated by median, ulnar and radial nerve of the affected hand and median nerve of the non-affected hand. On the affected hand, median nerve innervated skin temperature showed maximum increase at 2-month follow-up before decreasing to a level higher than preoperatively. Radial nerve innervated skin temperature was lower than the preoperative value at 2-week follow-up, increasing to higher levels afterwards. Ulnar nerve temperature followed the curve of the median nerve innervated skin at all follow-ups. Unaffected median nerve innervated skin temperature increased at all follow-ups compared to the preoperative values. In conclusion, two or even five additional measurements should be made after at least one year. The results should be correlated with clinical and electromyoneurography recovery.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a newly developed cognitive function deficit after surgery. The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of POCD after anesthesia and possible risk factors. A prospective study was conducted on 90 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general (60 patients) or regional (30 patients) anesthesia. Each patient completed the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCa) test the day before and the day after surgery. Data on comorbidities, previous COVID-19 infection, demographic and anesthesia related data were also collected. The day after surgery, POCD defined according to the 2 scores rule was present in 38 (42.2%) patients. A lower level of education (p=0.023), previous COVID-19 infection (p=0.032), higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) (p=0.014), and general anesthesia (p=0.035) were identified as risk factors, whereas a statistically significant negative correlation with preoperative (p=0.001) and postoperative result (p=0.001) was proven for age. The results indicated that a significant proportion of patients after general or regional anesthesia developed POCD depending on patient education, CCI, COVID-19 infection, and type of anesthesia. It was also shown that older age correlated with poorer MoCa test result independently of anesthesia. These factors can be identified before the procedure under anesthesia, thus offering the possibility of adjusting anesthesia and postoperative care in patients at risk of developing POCD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to assess mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF) in Bosnian and Herzegovinian patients with heart failure (HF). This study included 80 patients with HF and 40 healthy controls. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) testing was used to evaluate cognitive function. Abdominal obesity was assessed by waist circumference, and hypertension was assessed by the auscultatory method. Data on other CMRF and comorbidities, such as diabetes, smoking, alcohol consumption, and atrial fibrillation (AF), were gathered with a specially designed questionnaire. Lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen were assessed with standard laboratory methods. Student, Mann-Whitney, and Chi-square tests were used to determine significant differences between groups. Associations between categorical variables and correlation coefficients were assessed by the Chi-square and Spearman test, respectively. The prevalence of MCI in patients with HF was 77.5%. We found significant associations between MCI and diabetes, hypertension, AF, and smoking in patients with HF. We found no significant associations between MCI, abdominal obesity, and alcohol consumption. A significant positive correlation between MCI and total cholesterol was observed in patients with HF. Furthermore, a lower MoCA score was associated with higher values of CRP and fibrinogen in HF patients. The present study showed a high prevalence of MCI in Bosnian and Herzegovinian HF patients as well as its association with various CMRFs. These results suggest it is necessary to begin MCI screening in HF patients, especially since data from the literature point to improvement in cognitive performance with appropriate HF and concomitant CMRF treatment.",

Baseline risk factors evaluated included age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol consuption, serum cholesterol, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and NIH stroke scale (NIHSS). Life tables were used to estimate the 1-year stroke recurrence risk, and a logistic multiple regression model to calculate relative risks and 95 percent CI one year after initial stroke. Among 94 (15 percent) patients with identified recurrence, 19 percent died within 1 year from recurrent stroke. The life table cumulative risk of recurrent stroke was 3 percent at day 30, 10 percent at 1 year, 14 percent at 2 years, and 18 percent at 3 years. The 1-year cumulative risk of recurrence did not significantly differ according to age or gender. The 1 year recurrence risk was significantly different for the baseline NIH stroke scale (NIHSS less than 3.5 percent, 3-8, 14 percent ; NIH over 8, 7 percent ; p=0.019) and CHF (yes 17 percent, no 19 percent ; p=0.041).

HE production was detected in 88% of all isolates. The O1, O2,O3 and O16 strains mostly produced a large quantity of HE, while the epidemic O11 strains pro-duced a small amount of HE. Urine and pharyngeal isolates produced the highest levels of HE.Key words:",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n A rare case of extensive spontaneous perirenal hematoma from a ruptured angiomyolipoma is described. A 55-year-old woman was admitted to our department with a complaint of acute left flank pain. The images and clinical data of the case are presented. The imaging diagnostic techniques employed were abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging, which indicated the diagnosis of a large left perirenal hematoma and showed its size and extension. No tumor was suspected preoperatively. The operation was completed with nephrectomy and definite diagnosis was made on the basis of pathology findings, which revealed a relatively small angiomyolipoma on the upper pole of the left kidney wherefrom the hemorrhage had occurred. Therapeutic approach, i.e. nephrectomy or conservative therapy, remains controversial, however, concerning the prevalence of renal neoplastic lesions, most recent reports recommend nephrectomy in case of even slight doubt of renal neoplasm. The clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of this rare disease are discussed.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY ∑ Nowadays we may be overlooking an ever more common and most likely infectious disease of uncertain etiology - prostatitis. The field of chronic prostatitis was stagnant for some three decades, however, the state of affairs has changed dramatically over the last few years. Prostatitis is the most common prostate disease in the younger population, which results in more physician visits than either benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer. Despite its high prevalence, chronic prostatitis as a disease and its etiology have been understudied. This article is concentrated on the entity of chronic prostatitis, which is the most controversial, diagnostically most imprecise, and most frustrating diagnosis in medicine in general. Also, it is the most common ailment in men worldwide. The knowledge about the disease is now progressing at a higher pace, especially concerning its etiology and pathogenesis. Along with a review of the latest findings, an update is provided of the classification, diagnosis, treatment and epidemiology of chronic prostatitis. It is emphasized that the disease should be recognized more often, or at least, epidemiologically speaking, it should be paid more attention.",

    "abstract": "∑ Hypoglycemia may occur as a component of type 1 multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Insulinomas are rare tumors that often present a diagnostic dilemma for the clinician. The presence of inappropriately high plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations at the time of symptomatic fasting hypoglycemia confirms the diagnosis of insulinoma. A. B., a 21-year-old girl, presented for evaluation of recurrent episodes of hyperhidrosis, confusion, and weakness with tremor, which was suggestive of hypoglycemia. Her body mass increased by 90 kg, with persistent symptoms of hypoglycemia. Because of her extremely excess sive body weight of 158 kg, the only diagnostic method available was upper abdomen ultrasonography, which revealed a tumor mass of 26 mm in size, located at the tail of the pancreas. Hemipancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed in one act. After the surgery, clinical symptoms disappeared but the patient developed diabetes, postoperatively, which required introduction of insulin therapy. Her body weight gradually normalized, she lost 54 kg, and postoperative magnetic resonance and computed tomography controls produced normal findings.",

Greater understanding of the degenerative aspects of MS pathogenesis is redefining treatment goals and creating new treatment strategies. The existing immunomodulation drugs (disease-modifying therapies, DMTs) used in MS treatment have shown only partial benefits in controlling disease progression, primarily by reducing the inflammation component. However, new therapies for MS have been shown to be effective in delaying disease progression by protecting against brain atrophy, which is considered the most important preindicator of future patient disability. The favorable effect on reducing brain atrophy suggests the potential neuroprotective or even neuroregenerative effects of new treatments, marking progress in the treatment of MS.",

Each group consisted of 150 patients. Data were collected between December 2013 and May 2014. Patients were evaluated for smoking habit, alcohol consumption, body mass index, blood pressure and laboratory measurement of fasting glycemia. Family physicians provided diagnosis of chronic noninfectious diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, malignant disease, depression, and alcoholism). The two groups differed according to age, income, employment status, and rate of alcoholism and hypertension. Alcoholism (OR= 4.105; 95% CI 2.012-8.374) and hypertension (OR=1.972; 95% CI 1.253-3.976) were associated with inhabitants of West Mostar, adjusted for age, employment and income status on logistic regression. In conclusion, ethnic differences between inhabitants of the two parts of the town might influence health outcomes. These are preliminary data and additional studies with larger samples and more specific questions considering nutrition and cultural issues are needed to detect the potential differences between the groups.",

    "abstract": "Thirty-two male patients, mean age 34.1±7.1, Croatian soldiers from 1991-1992 war, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosed on the basis of psychiatric examination and use of graduation scales DSM III and LASC-01, were included in the study. In order to identify possible organic disorders, the patients were submitted to neuropsychological testing, laboratory testing, hemodynamic testing of cerebral hemodynamics by the method of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD), and analysis of risk factors for cerebrovascular disease related to an unhealthy lifestyle. Neuropsychological examination showed mental deterioration which surpassed the allowable level in 21, impaired memory in 19, significant mnestic control disorders in 30 and confabulation in 15 patients, while other tests pointed to an organic basis of the mental abnormalities observed (attention, visuomotor co-ordination). Laboratory analysis pointed to the following disturbances: elevated blood glucose in 3, cholesterol in 7 and triglycerides in 10 patients; decreased HDL in 10 and increased LDL in 6 patients; increased white blood cell count in 16 and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate in 5 patients. TCD analysis revealed functional impairments of cerebral circulation in 16 patients, i.e. vasospasm in 11 and hypoperfusion in 5 patients. A significant presence of unhealthy lifestyle indicators was recorded, i.e. smoking in 30, alcoholism in 15, and physical inactivity and overweight in 10 patients each. Study results confirmed the correlation of mental and physical mechanisms in the occurrence of PTSD as well as the presence of organic indicators of the nervous system lesions, and psychosomatic and organic damage to other body systems. This small, uncontrolled pilot study suggested the need of a complex approach to patients with PTSD.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of pulsating duplex Doppler ultrasonography to the diagnosis of middle (MCA) and anterior (ACA) cerebral artery obstruction in one patient is reported. A 10year-old boy was admitted to the hospital for pulsating headaches (especially pronounced on physical training). He had no neurologic disabilities. His EEG and brain CT scan were normal, and so were his funduscopic examination, lumbar puncture, and laboratory tests. Transcranial color duplex Doppler ultrasonography showed very high velocities in both ACA and right MCA as a sign of suspected stenosis or spasm. Bilateral subtraction cerebral angiography performed after several months of recurrent headaches and unchanged Doppler ultrasonography findings produced an image of high degree stenosis of A1 segment of both ACA and right MCA, with signs of ‘steal syndrome’ through the posterior cerebral circulation. MRI performed one year later, after episodes of transient ischemic attacks, showed ischemic infarction in the right temporo-occipital region. The etiology of stenosis was supposed to include vasculopathy, i.e. early stage of moyamoya syndrome. Other vasculopathies were excluded by laboratory tests and clinical elaboration. It is concluded that transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is a very helpful method for detection and follow-up of the degree of stenosis of great cerebral arteries in children, and that it correlates well with cerebral angiography, yet it is not useful in diagnosing the etiology of stenosis.",

In this study, the immunohistochemical expression of B-Myb and DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (Topo2a) was analyzed in primary tumors to identify patients with a higher risk of disease recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy for early invasive breast cancer. We analyzed a cohort of 215 early invasive breast cancer patients having undergone surgery from 2002 to 2003 at the Zagreb University Hospital Centre, including 153 patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. All of them were followed-up prospectively for at least ten years according to routine institutional practice. Statistically significant correlations were found between B-Myb and Topo2a expression levels and particular well-established prognostic factors. B-Myb expression was lower in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors (p=0.0773), whereas larger tumors and those with positive lymphovascular invasion displayed a statistically significantly higher B-Myb expression (p=0.0409 and p=0.0196). Higher tumor grade indicated higher Topo2a values (p=0.0102 and p=0.0069). The subgroup with the expression of both proteins above the median value had an almost statistically significantly (p=0.0613) inferior prognosis compared to the rest of the cohort. Study results showed the B-Myb and Topo2a expression to have a prognostic value in breast cancer patients after adjuvant chemotherapy, which should be additionally explored in future studies in a larger patient cohort.",

The experimental study was carried out on laboratory rats of the Winzar breed using light microscopy, standard stains for micropreparations, and morphometry. Histopathologic examination of micropreparations stained by standard methods revealed pronounced dystrophic processes in hepatocytes located near the necrotic zone (albuminous and hydropic degeneration and chromatin fragmentation in the nuclei). Morphometric studies showed a significant decrease (p<0.001) in almost all indicators of the size of cells and nuclei both near necrosis and distant from it on day 28 of the experiment in the experimental group in comparison to the control group. The results obtained pointed to more intense repair processes when applying the innovation method.",

Mutations in this enzyme have been linked with idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, and nephrocalcinosis. Genetic testing for this mutation should be considered in the presence of calciuria, elevated serum calcium, elevated 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D, and suppressed parathyroid hormone. We present a previously healthy eight-month-old male infant with macrohematuria, hypercalciuria (6 mg/kg/24 h), albuminuria (54 mg/24 h) and left-sided nephrolithiasis found on urinary tract ultrasound. The values of alpha 1 microglobulin, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, serum electrolytes, amino acids, glycols, oxalates and citrates in urine, as well as coagulation tests were normal. Genetic testing excluded suspected Dent's disease but confirmed heterozygous missense variant CYP24A1 c.469C>T, p.(Arg157Trp) classified as polymorphism. He was treated with hydrochlorothiazide and potassium citrate. Children presenting with hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis should be tested because of the importance of recognition, genetic diagnosis and proper treatment of CYP24A1 mutations that can present with a wide range of phenotypic presentations, from asymptomatic to chronic renal disease.",

On 113 carotid arteries with ≥50% stenosis, we quantified the level of correlation among the three measurements, sensitivity, specificity, and differences in the estimated stenosis level. Correlation between both CTA measurements was good with Pearson's ρ between 0.87 and 0.91 (p<0.001). Correlation between CDUS and CTA measurements was only modest with Pearson's ρ between 0.2 (p=0.075) and 0.4 (p=0,007) for CDUS CTA (CSA), and between 0.23 (p=0.062) and 0.39 (p=0.008) for CDUS CTA (diameter). Differences in stenosis between CTA (CSA) and CDUS were centered around 0%, and between CTA (diameter) and CDUS around 20%. Sensitivity and specificity for CTA (CSA) method were 81% and 77%, and for CTA (diameter) 23% and 100%, respectively. A good correlation between CSA and diameter measurement just means that these are two related features of stenosis, it does not mean good agreement. CTA (CSA) method better detected surgical stenoses, whereas CTA (diameter) systematically underestimated stenosis level. The study of differences between the measurements indicated agreement better than the calculation of correlation coefficients.",

The aim of the study was to examine resistance to periprosthetic fracture of the axially loaded cross section rectangular femoral stem (Zweymüller) with respect to different degrees of anteversion, implanted in the artificial bone model, in laboratory conditions. Femoral bone models with implanted femoral stems were divided into 3 groups depending on the degree of stem anteversion (A, control group 13-17°; B, stem retroverted 0°-4°; and C, stem anteverted 26-30°). The amount of axial load leading to periprosthetic fracture (PPFx) of the artificial bone model was determined experimentally for each construct. The results showed that the load at which the PPFx occurred significantly increased with the increase of the endoprosthesis anteversion angle. In our clinical practice, we are often unable to place the acetabular component in an ideal grade of anteversion for intraoperatively determined reasons. The results of this experimental study suggested that increasing rectangular femoral (Zweymüller) stem anteversion lowered the risk of PPFx. This study was limited by experimental design (laboratory conditions, artificial bone) and should be clinically verified.",

BCVA improved from 58.4±14.9 letters at baseline to 62.4±14.5 letters at one-year evaluation (p=0.002). The mean change in BCVA was 5.2±11.1 letters. CRT decreased from 485.7±146.3 µm at baseline to 391.5±129.0 µm at one year (p<0.001). The mean change in CRT was -89.6±143.3 µm. Patients received a mean of 2.0±0.7 DEX implants. Study eyes were also divided into a group receiving DEX implant monotherapy and a group receiving DEX implant and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor (anti-VEGF) therapy. Changes in BCVA and CRT and the number of DEX implant injections were compared between the two groups. No difference in VA gain was found between the eyes receiving monotherapy and the eyes receiving combined treatment. In conclusion, DEX implant therapy was effective in gaining vision in DME patients. No additional VA gain was achieved with combined treatment.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fi brillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, aff ecting approximately six million Europeans.Th e lifetime risk of developing AF is one in four men and women after the age of 40 years. Th e prevalence of AF increases dramatically with age, ranging from 1.5% in individuals aged 50– 59 years to 23.5% in those aged 80–89 years. With an ageing population, the prevalence of AF is projected to double by 2030. Stroke is the most devastating complication of AF. Atrial fi brillation causes 15–20% of ischemic strokes and the overall risk of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF is about 5% per year. Long-term studies have consistently shown that patients with AF have a 5-fold increased risk of stroke compared with individuals without AF. One-third of patients who have atrial fi brillation and stroke were not known to have atrial fi brillation until their stroke. Stroke in patients with AF is nearly twice as likely to be fatal compared with non-AF stroke. Th is is due to the development of large thrombi in the left atrial appendage which travel to the brain causing occlusion of the major intracranial arteries. Th is results in larger infarct volumes and more severe strokes. Th e costs of caring for patients with stroke associated with AF have been shown to be 33% greater for AF-related stroke than for non-AF stroke.",

Framingham data suggest that patients with AF have a 1.5-2 fold increase in mortality rate when compared with the general population [1]. Th e overall objectives of treatment for AF include the prevention of complications, such as stroke, and maintaining the patient’s functional ability and quality of life. Since AF encourages structural, functional and electrophisiologic changes of the left atrium [2], understanding the treatments for AF is critical for achieving these important objectives. Treatment of AF is complex and depends on whether the patient is currently experiencing symptoms, how long the patient has been in AF, the overall health of the patient, co-morbidities, and the size and function of the heart’s chambers. General treatment options include pharmacological therapy, medical procedures, and lifestyle changes. Th e goals of treating AF include:",

    "abstract": "Transcranial B-mode sonography (TCS) is a non-invasive, low-cost, short-duration neuroimaging method that allows high-resolution imaging of deep brain structures in patients with movement disorders. With contemporary high-end ultrasound systems, image resolution of echogenic deep brain structures can even be higher on TCS than on MRI. On TCS, about 90% of patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) exhibit abnormal hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra (SN). Th is fi nding is already present in presymptomatic disease stages, suggesting TCS as a screening tool for populations at risk of later developing PD. Meanwhile, a number of independent TCS studies have shown that SN hyperechogenicity well discriminates PD from other Parkinsonian disorders such as multiple-system atrophy, vascular Parkinsonism and welding-related Parkinsonism. In turn, normal SN echogenicity in combination with lenticular nucleus hyperechogenicity indicates an atypical Parkinsonian syndrome rather than PD with a specifi city and positive predictive value of more than 95%. TCS detects characteristic basal ganglia changes also in other movement disorders such as lenticular nucleus hyperechogenicity in idiopathic dystonia and Wilson’s disease and caudate nucleus hyperechogenicity in Huntington’s disease. Th e TCS fi nding of reduced echogenicity of midbrain raphe is frequent in depressive disorders and was found to correlate with responsivity to serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Emerging applications of TCS are the intraand postoperative localization of deep brain stimulation electrodes in patients with movement disorders, the detection of changes of deep brain structures in multiple sclerosis patients that may have a predictive value for further disease progression, as well as the characterisation of basal ganglia alterations in children with neurobehavioral disorders.",

This view disregards the strong pulsatile component of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics that influences substance transport and mixing in the CSF. Here we will show visualizations to illustrate and quantify the complex dynamics of CSF flow. Based on subject-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, we reconstructed pulsatile CSF flow in the ventricular system and the cranial subarachnoid space using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). We used the same methodology to investigate the fluid mixing behavior in the third cerebral ventricle. Cerebrospinal fluid dynamics have two main components: Steady flow due to production and pulsatile flow due to vascular pulsation caused by cardiac action and respiratory modulation. The pulsatile component dominates the instantaneous flow field both in the ventricular as well as the subarachnoid space. Maximum velocities due to pulsation are one to two orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding steady flow velocities caused by CSF production and absorption. Mixing in the third ventricle and likely in other parts of the CSF space is driven predominantly by pulsatile flow. Our measurements and calculations demonstrate that CSF dynamics are dominated by pulsation, which affects substance transport and mixing substantially. Investigations of drug or biomarker distribution in the CSF should thus take into account transient cerebrospinal fluid flow.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 6% of the world population comprises those aged 65 years or over, ranging from 3 to 17% in diff erent world regions and countries. Over the last 100 years annual mortality rates have declined from three times and life expectancy have doubled and is reaching towards 100 years of age. Th e estimates are confi rming these trends to continue in the next decades, for example the proportion of the oldest old will double in 2040. Th e public attitude and prevailing beliefs perceive old people as a social, economic and health care burden to societies measured through money that younger people have to pay and work for in order to enable the existence of elderly. Ageing is therefor stigmatized in various domains both in health as in illness. Ageing has been defi ned as a process that starts in mature period of life and ends up with death. Th e process of ageing is usually seen as decline in function and structure of ageing body and it’s organs. Th e same view applies for ageing mind and brain. According to these urban.groleger@psih-klinika.si assumptions only decline in cognition, strengths, effi cacy, capabilities and function can be expected. However the evidence does not confi rm these assumptions in all domains of ageing as a physiological process. Th e same holds true for illnesses in the elderly, which are popularly viewed as terminal, ending up with imminent death. Dementia might serve as a prototype illness in elderly to understand attitudes, myths and beliefs concerning old age. Th e diagnosis of dementia is associated with suffering, invalidity and decline in various domains of individual’s life. Often people see dementia as incurable illness, the treatment of dementia as ineffi cient and too expensive. People with dementia are often excluded from the process of health care, and nursing care. Stigma associated with dementia might reinforce negative feelings, isolation and despair in persons with dementia as well as in their relatives. Th e above mentioned trends and attitudes will be further discussed in perspective of individual, health and society.",

    "abstract": "A several-fold increase in the incidence of lung cancer during the last 20 years hasbeen obvious in the central Dalmatia region. It has been on a constant increase in both men andwomen. A 2.4-fold increase has been recorded in male, and 4.2-fold in female population. The ma-jority of patients are long-time cigarette smokers. Thirty years ago this habit was characteristic formen, while today the number of female smokers has been on an increase (the percentage of femalepatients cigarette smokers increased from 17.8% to 47.3%). Most patients are older than 65 and to-gether with those over 60 years of age they make over 42% of lung carcinoma patients.The increasedincidence of adenocarcinoma not directly connected with cigarette smoking, on the account of adecrease in the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung has been confirmed. The highestincrease was recorded during the postwar years (by as much as 32% in 2000), which could be attrib-uted to severe psychical traumas and other hardships related to the war and life in the postwar pe-riod. The increase in the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma in women (from 17.5% to 20.4%)could probably be attributed to the increase in the number of female smokers. The decrease in theincidence of small cell anaplastic lung carcinoma was evenly distributed in both sexes (from 27% to22.6%). Comparison of data obtained for one part of Croatia (coastal region) with global data sug-gests a similar epidemiological pattern to exist in the south and southeast Europe (south Italy, Spain, Greece).",

The aim of the study was to assess the effect of 3-week inpatientcardiac rehabilitation in CHD patients older than seventy. The study included 103 consecutive CHDpatients older than 70 who underwent 3-week inpatient rehabilitation. A history of myocardial in-farction was recorded in 77% of patients, whereas 23% had previously undergone coronary arterybypass surgery. The patients who could not perform exercise test or those with congestive heart fail-ure were not included in the study. Functional capacity, lipid profile, blood glucose, body weight andbody mass index were determined before and at the end of rehabilitation. After 3-week inpatientcardiac rehabilitation, functional capacity markedly improved (p<0.0001). The levels of cholesterol(p<0.0001), triglycerides (p=0.01), LDL-cholesterol (p<0.0001) and blood glucose (p=0.004) weresignificantly lower in comparison with initial values. There were no significant differences in HDL-cholesterol, body weight and body mass index between initial values and those measured at the endof rehabilitation. Results of the study suggest that elderly patients with CHD benefit from cardiacrehabilitation and should be routinely referred to cardiac rehabilitation and encouraged to attendthese programs.Key words:",

Four groups were identified: hyperkinetic disorder and ADHD (n=35), ADHD only (n=27), hyperkinetic disorder only (n=3), and children without any symptoms according to DSM IV and ICD 10 criteria (n=344). The kappa coefficient assessing the agreement between the DSM IV ADHD and ICD 10 hyperkinetic disorder was K=0.66; percent of agreement = 78%. The χ 2 -test yielded χ 2 =250.3 (df=1; p<0.001). The prevalence of DSM IV ADHD and ICD 10 hyperkinetic disorder was 15.16% and 9.3%, respectively. DSM IV was found to identify a broader group of children, however, there was a substantial overlap between the groups formed according to these criteria.",

In this report, a 31-year-old male with a history of diffi- cult-to-control asthma is presented. It was associated with peripheral and bronchoalveolar eosino- philia, sinusitis, and high level of ANCA (perinuclear labeling pattern). Clinical manifestations ob- served at the time of relapses were palpable purpura, erythema nodosum, arthralgia, musculoskeletal complications, and episcleritis. In spite of vasculitis remission, low doses of steroids to control asthma were neccessary for 10 years. The aim of this case report is to point to the possibility of CSS in patients with severe persistent asthma and atypical allergic diathesis.",

Therapeutic neuroprotection acting towards minimization of ischemic neuronal injury in penumbral tissue in the regions of reduced cerebral blood flow seems to be an appealing concept in the treatment of acute stroke and brain trauma. The ‘ischemic cascade’, a complex mechanism of metabolic events initiated by brain ischemia, offers many pathways by which the neuroprotective agents may act. Time to treatment remains a major limiting factor for many potential neuroprotective agents. Although the exact therapeutic window is not known, evidence from many animal models and clinical research suggest that neuroprotective therapy can only be efficacious if administered very early after the onset of ischemia. Various neuroprotective agents have been tested in many clinical stroke trials during the past 20 years. Large phase III clinical trials of several classes of neuroprotectants (mainly NMDA receptor antagonists, free radical scavengers, and calcium channel blockers) have recently failed to demonstrate efficacy of neuroprotection. After initial disappointment, the active research continues and some new exciting neuroprotective models emerge on the horizon.",

    "abstract": "Our previous results have shown that human epiglottal epithelium changes during development, from single-layered squamous epithelium in the 6-weekold embryo to two-layered cuboidal epithelium in the early 8-week-old embryo; in the newborn, pseudostratified epithelium with goblet cells predominates and after the air-flow is established, stratified squamous epithelium predominates. Seven-week-old and 9-week-old embryo epiglottal epithelium was now analyzed in more detail and compared. Embryos from the celloidin collection of human embryos belonging to the Archive of the Department of Histology and Embryology were stained by HE, Azan, Masson trichrome stain, Verhoeff iron hematoxylin and PAF-Halmi. Epiglottal epithelia were investigated by light microscopy. In the 6-week-old embryo, epiglottal swelling was covered by a single layer of cuboidal cells. In the 7-week-old embryo, two-layered cuboidal epithelium was discovered. In 9-week-old fetus, epiglottal epithelium was multilayered columnar without cilia and goblet cells. It has now been confirmed that single-layered epiglottal epithelium has changed to the two-layered epithelium already in the 7-week-old embryo. Developmental studies like this one might be of importance for tissue engineering purposes.

    "abstract": "The spectrum of cutaneous pseudolymphomas (reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphocytoma cutis) is very wide and the histologic differential diagnosis is often difficult. In only a proportion of cases, the aetiology of the process can be elucidated and close clinicopathological correlation is essential to reach the diagnosis. Even with adequate clinical information and detailed microscopic examination, in a proportion of cases the diagnosis of lymphoma cannot be entirely ruled out. In this setting, ancillary techniques including molecular biology studies and further biopsy or biopsies may be necessary over time for the diagnosis to be made. Cutaneous pseudolymphomas can be divided into two categories, T cell and B cell pseudolymphomas. This distinction is artificial, since the infiltrate is frequently composed of both B and T cells. The separation is, therefore, mainly based on the overall pattern of the infiltrate rather than the type of cell that predominates. Infiltrates with a T cell pattern tend to be focal with a predominant perivascular and periadnexal distribution and involvement of the epidermis and/or adnexal structures. Infiltrates with a B cell pattern are more diffuse and nodular and tend to spare the epidermis and adnexal structures. As it will be seen during discussion, this is an oversimplification that mainly serves a didactic process.",

The study included 40 patients (80 eyes) with open angle glaucoma and intraocular pressure (IOP) above 18 mm Hg treated with topical beta blocker (timolol 0.50% twice a day). Travoprost 0.004% was added to timolol 0.5% therapy once daily in the evening. Follow up examinations were scheduled at 7 days, one month and three months. IOP lowering was achieved in all patients. Substantial lowering of 2.42 mm Hg was achieved after the first week of treatment. Further lowering and stabilization of IOP was recorded at three months, with total IOP decrease of 3.97 mm Hg; the difference was statistically significant (chi2=6.7743; p<0.01). At three months, target IOP was recorded in 64 eyes (16.4+/-0.7 mm Hg) and failed to be achieved in 16 eyes (21.1+/-2.3 mm Hg). Mild hyperemia was found in two patients and discrete hyperemia in 26 patients. Burning sensation associated with the use of travoprost 0.004% eye drops was reported by 68 patients. In conclusion, the use of travoprost 0.004% eye drops resulted in successful lowering of IOP and achievement of target IOP.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis is the most common non- traumatic neurodegenerative disease found in adults. Most of the patients have physical and mental deficits which reflect the dissemination of the lesions in the central nervous system. Th e aim of this study is to compare the quality of life of ambulatory patients suff ering from multiple sclerosis. A study was performed using ambulatory patients with a relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis (McDonald’s criteria). Th e quality of life was assessed by the use of the SF-36 questionnaire. The severity of Multiple sclerosis was evaluated using the disease duration, EDSS and MSSS values. The patients were divided into groups according to gender and disease duration. Results were also compared with the results of study performed among Croatian citizens without multiple sclerosis. All together 62 patients were included in the study (Female/Male 40/20, mean age 35, 45±9, 3, mean EDSS 2, 48±0, 89 ; mean MSSS 5, 25±1, 91 ; mean disease duration (DD) 4, 05±4, 29 years). The mean scores were as follows: physical functioning (PF) 59, 92 (all), 58, 50 (female) ; 62, 50 (male) ; 59, 63 (DD 3y), role-physical (RP) 36, 56 (all) ; 34, 17 (female) ; 40, 91 (male) ; 43, 33 (DD 3y) ; bodily pain (BP) 64, 48 (all) ; 63, 00 (female) ; 67, 16 (male) ; 62, 44 (DD 3y) , general health (GH) 48, 31 (all) ; 48, 50 (female) ; 47, 95 (male) ; 47, 50 (DD 3y) ; vitality (VT) 48, 47 (all) ; 48, 00 (female) ; 49, 32 (male) ; 48, 75 (DD 3y), social functioning (SF) 63, 91 (all) ; 64, 69 (female) ; 62, 50 (male) ; 61, 25 (DD 3y), role-emotional (RE) 18, 28 (all) ; 18, 33 (female) ; 18, 18 (male) ; 23, 33 (DD 3y), mental health (MH) 60, 39 (all) ; 59, 60 (female) ; 61, 82 (male) ; 59, 20 (DD 3y) and health transition (HT) 43, 54 (all) ; 45, 00 (female) ; 40, 91 (male) ; 40, 00 (DD 3y). Our preliminary results showed that the patients with multiple sclerosis have a lower quality of life in comparison to those Croatian citizens without multiple sclerosis. In general female patients have the lowest quality of life excluding social functioning. The quality of life was better among patients with longer disease duration (over 3 years) except when physical and emotional limitations were taken into account.",

Since children and adolescents are very diff erent in their psychological, biological and social development, each evaluation should be viewed considering the phase of development, and the relationship and infl uence of the environment which, in various phases of development, can have diff",

    "abstract": "Primary localized cutaneous nodular amyloidosis (PLCNA) is a rare form of primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis that presents as yellowish or reddish waxy nodules on the extremities, face, trunk or genitalia. It is characterized by amyloid deposits in the dermis that are produced by local plasma cells. Histologic findings are indistinguishable from those of primary systemic amyloidosis. A 75-year-old man presented to our ENT department with solitary tumor located on the right nostril. Complete excision was made and the material was referred for pathologic examination. The tumor was 1 cm in diameter, grey reddish on the cutting surface. Microscopic examination revealed deposits of eosinophilic amorphous material in the dermis. Mild infiltrate of plasma cells (CD138 positive) could be seen in the amorphous material and next to small blood vessels in the dermis. The amorphous material stained positively with Congo red and demonstrated green birefringence with polarizing microscopy. The immunohistochemical imaging revealed the cytoplasm of infiltrating plasma cells to stain with both anti-kappa and anti-lambda chains. Additional extensive clinical and laboratory workup revealed no systemic involvement. The patient’s medical history revealed no diseases and previous or current medical treatments. The patient was treated surgically. The diagnosis of PLCNA was made in February 2011, and no further information on this case can be presented. In conclusion, immunohistochemical analysis revealed polyclonality of the infiltrating plasma cells, which is generally a less common characteristic of primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis. However, extensive clinical and laboratory workup showed no systemic involment of amyloidosis nor revealed any other acute or chronic disease that could result in secondary amyloidosis. This is an even rarer case of PLCNA with plasma cell polyclonality. EX VIVO DEVELOPMENT OF SKIN IN THE RAT LIMB BUD",

    "abstract": "Th e phenomenon of adult neurogenesis (aN), i.e. the generation of new functional neurons in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, has gathered much attention in the recent years, especially since it has been shown that this process takes also place in the human brain. A large number of variables regulate aN such as learning, exercise, stress, and age. Several lines of evidence based on the structure-function relationships support the involvement of neurogenesis in memory processing in the adult brain. In particular, adult-born hippocampal neurons have been shown to be related to complex forms of spatial or associative memories. One of the most interesting question deals with the possible relation of the age-related decline in neurogenesis and age-dependent memory impairment. Another important question deals with the role of aN in the pathophyisology of psychiatric disorders. Although a plethora of animal studies indicate an involvement of aN in the pathophysiology of depression and that stimulation of aN is essential for the mechanism of action of anti-depressant therapies, this view has recently kindled considerable controversy. Appropriate studies in humans failed to conf im a role of reduced hippocampal neural stem cell proliferation in depression, but suggest a contribution to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Disturbed aN may cause erroneous temporal encoding of new memory traces, thereby contributing to cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenic patients. Th is aN-hypothesis of schizo",

With the rat Poly I:C model it was successfully attempted to mimic this association in animals. In utero exposure to maternal infection leads in the off spring to postpubertal emergence of numerous behavioural (sensorimotor gating, attention defi cit (disruption latent inhibition and rapid reversal learning), abnormal prepulse inhibition, hypersensitivity to amphetamine) and structural (enlarged ventricles, smalle r hippocampi) abnormalities associated with schizophrenia (for review see ref. 1 and 2). Th ese abnormalities were prevented when the off spring treated with neuroleptics in adolescence1. We were interested in elucidating, if the observed reduction of off spring ś hippocampal volumes might in part be due to a disturbed hippocampal neurogenesis, and if the administration of neuroleptics may be helpful in normalizing the putatively disrupted cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "In males, Leydig cells are responsible for more than 95% of androgen production. Th e aim of our study was: (a) to assess morphological features and testosterone production in situ of Leydig cells in infertile patients ; and (b) to correlate the above-mentioned Leydig cell parameters with testis volume and spermatogenesis. In total, 120 testicular biopsies were used (12 controls and 108 specimens from patients with non-obstructive azoospermia). Th e morphology of Leydig cells was assessed by semi-thin and ultrathin sections (transmission electron microscopy). Testosterone production in situ was visualized by immunohistochemistry, followed by morphometric (stereological)analysis. Testicular volume was determined by ultrasound and/or orchidometer, and the status of spermatogenesis by applying Johnsen’s scoring system. Patients with non-obstructive azoospermia exhibited statistically signifi cantly lower values of testicular volume and score. Morphological analysis indicated that some Leydig cells displayed an extensive change of the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas the number of testosterone-producing cells was signifi cantly lower in azoospermia cases. Based on our results, patients with azoospermia have signifi cant changes in the morphology of Leydig cells and their capacity to produce testosterone. Some of these patients could be candidates for premature andropause",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disease re-sulting from abnormal early brain development and/or impaired postnatal maturation of the brain. Th e complex and varying symptoms of the disease indi-cate that an interplay of multiple factors rather than one single factor triggers this illness. Both genetic and epigenetic factors have been identiﬁ ed and a hy-pothesis, the “two hit hypothesis”, has been proposed explaining the origins of the disease by at least two subsequent etiological “hits”, a genetic predisposition and an epigenetic factor. Many studies of people with schizophrenia have found subtle abnormalities in brain structure or in the way it functions caused by disturbances in cell migra-tion, neurite outgrowth, axon fasciculation, synapse formation, and adult neurogenesis. Th ese disturbances are in close relations with alterations in neurotrophic factors. It was hypothesised that imbalances in the neurotrophic system might contribute to alterations in the brain which are closely connected with schizo-phrenia. To further characterise cellular processes involved in schizophrenia we studied neurogenesis, neurotrophic factors, and eﬀ ects of neuroleptic drugs in a developmental model (Vitamin D deﬁ ciency) and a pharmacological model (subchronic treatment with the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine). Developmental models are basing on the assumption that damage at a very early stage of onto-genesis results in structural abnormalities",

    "abstract": "The aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), peroxidation product of polyunsaturated fatty acids is considered the most reliable indicator of endogenous lipid peroxidation in vivo (1). Lipid peroxidation is an autocatalytic mechanism leading to oxidative destruction of cellular membranes. Oxidative stress is epiphenomenon of hepatitis and pathogenic factor of liver cirrhosis, while HNE acts as growth regulating factor and signaling molecules (2). The aim of present study was to investigate the presence of HNE-modified proteins in human and in animal cirrhotic liver by immunohistochemistry. 30 fixed paraffin-embedded liver samples with cirrhosis were retrospectively selected for the study. There were 4 cases of cardiac liver cirrhosis in dogs, and 30 cases of various human chronic liver diseases in stage of cirrhosis. There were 15 cases of chronic hepatitis C and B, 4 cases of hemochromatosis, 4 cases of Wilson's disease and 3 cases of alcoholic cirrhosis. Slides of paraffin-embedded tumor tissue were prepared for immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies to HNE-histidine conjugate. Positive immunohistochemical reaction to HNE was analyzed semi-quantitatively. Intracellular HNE adduct localized in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes was detected respectively in 25 of 30 cases (83%).The strongest staining was noticed in cases of Wilson’s disease, hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver diseases and cardiac liver cirrhosis in dogs. Weak staining was observed in cases of chronic hepatitis C and B. The results of the study indicate that HNE can be detected in several chronic human and in animal liver diseases. Therefore, detection of lipid peroxidation could be used in predicting development of fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic liver diseases.",

Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in active population in developed countries. Epidemiological studies evaluated the incidence and describe many facets of this disease the incidence of which is being followed in most countries. The aim of this paper is to present some epidemiological data on diabetic retinopathy caused by type 1 diabetes in Croatia, to compare them with other countries, and to evaluate its importance in causing severe visual impairments and blindness. These data are considered highly relevant because they are changing constantly and require continuous monitoring in spite of all advances in understanding the distribution, causes and severity of diabetic retinopathy. It is of great importance because the increasing burden of diabetes will pose ever greater burden on the population at large and on healthcare systems providing care for these patents.",

    "abstract": "Balance is achived and maintained by complex set of sensorimotor control systems that include sensory input from several senses (vision, proprioception, vestibular system, tactile sense and hearing), integration of that sensory input, and motor output to the eyes and body muscles. The diagnostics of vertigo and balance disorders is often complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Nystagmography is a series of tests used to examine and evaluate part of the human balance system by recording, analyzing and reporting reflexive repetative eye movements called nystagmus. Electronystagmography (ENG) is the oldest, electrical method of recording nystagmus, it detects changes of periocular electrical field caused by eye movements since the eye is a dipol in which the cornea is electropositive and the retina electronegative. Videonystagmography (VNG) uses video googles with infrared cameras that provides video monitoring of the eyes supplemented by computerized recording of nystagmus. There are three main groups of tests: tests that looks for presence of abnormal eye movements ( the gaze tests, Dix- Hallpike and positional tests) , tests that investigate vestibular-oculomotor function (the bithermal caloric test), and tests used to evaluate visual-oculomotor function ( the saccade test, the tracking test and the optokinetic test). ENG/VNG is often used complementary with rotation tests, VEMP ( vestibular evoked myogenic potential) and posturography. Vestibular function tests should aid in: objectivisation of patient symptoms, determining whether a disorder is peripheral or central, localising the side of lesion, supporting the clinical diagnosis, establishing treatment , evaluating the patient progress, differentiating the symptoms of balance system impairment from psychogenic dizziness and unsteadiness. The principles of nystagmography procedures, some common forms of nystagmus and examples of findings in some peripheral and central vestibular impairments will be presented and discussed.",

    "abstract": "In spite of the fact that human papillomavirus (HPV) genital infections represent a significant der matovenereological disease, the interdisciplinary team of different medical specialists including pathologists should be involved in the comprehensive management of this complex issue. Anogenital warts (condylomata acuminata) are the most common HPV lesions presented in men, however, during the last decade other HPV associated exaggerated lesions such as condylomata plana, penile, scrotal, and anal intraepithelial neoplasias, as well as the penile, urine bladder and prostate cancer have been studied a little bit more extensively. Consistent studies are still sparse in male population. More than 35 types of HPV infect genital tract, with types 16 and 18 inducing about 70% of high-grade intraepithelial genital neoplasias, such as penile, anal, scrotal, vulvar, vaginal, etc. (thus not only cervical), whereas HPV 6 and 11 cause 90% of anogenital warts. However, the ‘banality’ of anogenital warts should not be underestimated providing that the high risk HPV DNA 16 and 18 can be isolated (PCR) from ‘benign’ HPV associated genital lesions (anogenital warts) in 10%-20% of patients, i.e. more than usually expected. On the other hand, the presence and the recalcitrant course of HPV DNA 6 and 11 associated diseases pose a significant physical and psychological problem for both men and women. A prophylactic vaccine that targets these types should thus substantially reduce the burden of HPV associated clinical diseases. Ultimately, within the spectrum of therapeutic options for condylomata, no method is superior to others; recurrences occurred in 30%-70% of cases. We definitely need the HPV vaccination pro gram to get rid of one of the oldest and up to now unsolved problems of mankind. Since HPV is transmitted by sexual intercourse, managing both partners is necessary to eliminate the virus in the population. Approaches to this include prophylactic vaccines such as quadrivalent HPV vaccine for both men and women. This should be the only way to significantly decrease the numbers of infected persons. Besides, proper dermatologic training is required as the clinical criterion is still very important and the HPV induced lesions get quite often misdiagnosed unless managed by the skilled professional. Thus, it can be concluded that the dermatovenereologists, together with the representatives of other medical specialties, should definitely be part of the HPV vaccine program team.",

    "abstract": "Small cell carcinoma (SmCC) is a poorly diff erentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma that has been reported in several sites throughout the head and neck region, including salivary glands where it is a rare primary tumor accounting for less than 1% of all salivary gland tumors. We report a case of a 55-yearold man with problems consisting of neck pain and diffi cult swallowing induced by a retromolar mass. Physical examination revealed an exophytic infi ltrative process in the right retromolar trigonum, measuring 2 centimeters in diameter. On cut surface the tumor was white and grayish. Microscopically, it was composed of sheets, ribbons and nests of mitotically active tumor cells set within a variably fi brous stroma. Th ere was a positive immunohistochemical reaction for broad spectrum keratin, EMA, synaptophysin and chromogranin. Th e combination of fi ndings was in favor of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with the probable origin from a small salivary gland. In the 2005 WHO classifi cation of head and neck tumors, SmCC of salivary glands is defi ned as a rare malignant epithelial tumor. Diff erential diagnosis includes metastatic pulmonary SmCC and cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma (Merkel cell carcinoma). Although salivary gland SmCC does not metastasize as frequently as pulmonary SmCC, locoregional metastases are present at diagnosis in as many as 50% of cases. SmCC arising in major or minor salivary glands has a better prognosis than pulmonary SmCC, but in our case the patient survived for just one month after the diagnosis. Th e autopsy confi rmed oropharynx as the primary location of the tumor. Besides multiple liver metastases, there were no signs of tumor anywhere else in the body.

An adequate venous preload normalizes global hemodynamics and avoids multiorgan failure (MOF) and death in patients with multiple injuries. Large volume resuscitation is associated with complications in minimally monitored patients. A properly guided resuscitation procedure will finally prevent MOF and patient death. Transpulmonary thermodilution technique and gastric tonometry are used in venous preload monitoring, calculating volumetric hemodynamic variables and estimating splanchnic perfusion as well. We present a 24-year-old man with multiple injuries resuscitated with large volume infusions and monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution technique and gastric tonometry. It is very important to monitor regional hemodynamics that enables clinician to maintain the required relations between global and regional hemodynamics. It prevents the development of MOF and patient death.",

We describe three pediatric patients where rFVIIa was successfully used to manage bleeding following the failure of conventional hemostatic treatments during chemotherapy for intra-abdominal tumors (hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and non-classified malignant sarcoma). Recombinant FVIIa proved effective and maintained hemostasis in two of three cases, with no evidence for toxic or adverse events in any of the treated patients.",

The syndrome is usually recognized by sporadic aniridia present at birth, often followed by the development of Wilms tumor in early childhood, but possible at any age. Genetic testing using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the method of choice to detect specific deletions. The multidisciplinary approach in medical treatment not only of the tumor, but of a large variety of clinical features and possible complications is highly demanding and challenging. We report on a boy born with aniridia, cryptorchidism and facial dysmorphism recognized as WAGR syndrome in neonatal period, subsequently confirmed by genetic testing. Wilms tumor developed at the age of one year. Surgical treatment and chemotherapy resulted in complete remission for almost six years now. However, an increased risk of late post-treatment complications and development of de novo tumor in the contralateral kidney is a permanent threat. Therefore, ongoing oncologic follow up along with ophthalmologic and neurologic treatment and psychological support are a lifelong necessity.",

    "abstract": "Aim: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive cancers with the constantly increasing incidence, whose migration, invasion and growth depends on adhesive and proteolitic mechanisms of neoplastic cells. Matrix metalloproteinase’s (MMPs) involved in degradation and remodeling of surrounding tissue play a critical role in tumor progression. Laminin and galectin-3, involved in cell adhesion, migration and growth are also substrates for MMP-2 and MMP-9. Therefore, we presumed that they might be used as potential markers of melanoma progression. Method: Protein expression pattern of MMP2, MMP9, laminin, and galectin-3 were determined by immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissue obtained from 27 nodular melanoma cases (15 female, 12 male). Obtained values were correlated using Spearman correlation rank. Results: The patient’s age median was 60 years. Median of tumor thickness was 2.3 mm and median of the Clark’s level of penetration was 3. Positive lymph nodes were exhibited in 48% of cases. All markers were expressed at higher values in melanoma cells, than in surrounding tissue. MMP2 was more prominent in zone with strong lymphocyte infiltration (P=0.018) and deeper layers of tumor penetration. MMP2 exhibited stronger correlation with laminin (P=0.035) while MMP9 correlated with galectin-3 expression (P<0.001). Laminin and galectin-3 were coexpressed in melanoma cells (P=0.044). Although not significant, decreased expressions of both markers were found in cases with positive lymph nodes. Conclusion: The study pinpointed the possible markers of melanoma progression. The higher MMP2 expression was found in deeper layers of tumor penetration. However, additional studies on larger cohort and other histological melanoma types are necessary for more precise conclusions.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyze the usefulness and side effects of treatment with interferon beta 1B (Betaferon) in patients with the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The study included 32 RRMS patients that had completed two-year therapy with interferon beta 1B or were still receiving this therapy. Every six months, patients were clinically evaluated and scored by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Two-year therapy was completed by 11 (34.3%) of 32 RRMS patients. Relapse was verified in 4 (36.36%) patients. The mean EDSS score was 2.45 +/- 1.03 at the beginning of therapy and 2.54 +/- 0.98 after two-year therapy; the difference was not statistically significant. In 2 (6.25%) patients on therapy for 18 months there was no relapse, and the mean EDSS was 1.75 +/- 0.35 (both at therapy introduction and at 18 months). Five (15.62%) patients were on therapy for one year. The mean EDSS was 1.6 +/- 1.08 at the beginning of therapy and 1.5 +/- 0.70 at one year. One patient experienced relapse. Two patients were on therapy for six months. They had no relapses with the same EDSS at six months as at therapy introduction (2.0). At the beginning of 2008, another 12 patients started therapy with interferon beta 1B. In conclusion, our experience with two-year interferon beta-1B therapy for RRMS is favorable, with a relatively low rate of relapses (36.36%) and without significant worsening on EDSS. The medication side effects were mild and transient.",

    "abstract": "Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon form of malignant neoplasm that arises within secretory glands, most commonly major and minor salivary glands of the head and neck. It is a slow-growing but aggressive tumor. Kidney metastases are very rare and here we report such a case. A 76-year-old female patient presented with hematuria and flank pain. CT scan revealed a tumor mass on the right kidney. The patient was treated with right radical nephrectomy. Macroscopically, a well-circumscribed, firm, gray mass measuring up to 7.8 cm was found on one pole of the kidney. The tumor was composed of cribriform, tubular and solid formations of atypical epithelial cells with dark compact angular nuclei and frequent mitotic figures. Tumor cells showed positive immunohistochemical reaction to CKHMW and EMA, and negative to synaptophysin, CD10, CD15, CK8 and RCC. Retrospective history data showed ACC of the lacrimal gland with metastasis to the lung, which had been surgically treated 14 years before. Based on clinical data, histologic appearance and immunohistochemical analysis, the suggested diagnosis was metastatic ACC to the kidney. In conclusion, adenoid cystic carcinoma, formerly known as cylindroma, is a relatively uncommon but highly malignant neoplasm with a remarkable capacity for recurrence. Besides salivary glands, the tumor can arise in the trachea, lacrimal gland, breast, skin and vulva. The tumor is slow-growing but aggressive; 50% metastasize, often silently to the lung or bone; recurrences are frequent and often late. To our knowledge, in the English speaking area (Pub Med), 7 cases of ACC metastatic to the kidney have been described to date. SAMPUS OR MELANOMA IN SITU IN THE SCROTAL AREA",

    "abstract": "Granulosa cell tumor is a rare and uncommon stromal cell tumor of the ovary, considered to be of low grade malignancy with an indolent clinical course. The 10-year survival is higher than 90%. These tumors are known to manifest metastatic disease years after treatment of the primary tumor. A 64-year-old female with left upper quadrant abdominal pain underwent magnetic resonance, which revealed a tumorous process of the spleen. Splenectomy was performed and the material was referred for histopathologic analysis. Pathologic examination revealed a tumor measuring up to 8 cm, with relatively sharp demarcation. The tumor was grey to brown in color, with necrotic areas and hemorrhage. Microscopically, it was composed of solid sheets, nests and papillary formations lined with atypical cells. Anastomotic vascular-like spaces were also found, lined with relatively uniform atypical cells. Mitotic rate was high (20 mitosis/10HPF). The tumor occupied almost the entire spleen. Extensive histochemical (PAS, Giemsa, Gomori) and immunohistochemical analyses (vimentin, CD31, CD34, FVIII, CD68, CK7, CK20, CD3, CD20, CD30, bcl6, Ki-67, HMB-45) were done. Tumor cells showed positive reaction to vimentin and proliferative activity defined with Ki-67 was up to 40%. Metastatic tumor was suspected. Retrospective history data revealed a granulosa cell tumor of the ovary 15 years before. Immunohistochemical analysis with inhibin and calretinin was positive. It was diagnosed as a granulosa cell tumor metastatic to the spleen. Metastases of granulosa cell tumor are extremely rare; they are usually local recurrences or foci of peritoneal spread and occur in 25%-30% of cases. To our knowledge, this is the fourth case of a metastatic granulosa cell tumor in the spleen described in the English literature.

    "abstract": "In the fi fty years since the fi rst Pula congress a lot has changed in neuropsychopharmacology. Granted, the major groups of psychoactive drugs had already been discovered: neuroleptics, antidepressants, benzodiazepine anxiolitics, psychostimulants... Neurology was using the basic antiepileptics while, for example, the treatments for vascular and immunological diseases were more expectative. At the time of the fi rst Pula congress in 1960 we had only just discovered that myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease. It is also the year when dopamine defi ciency in the brain of Parkinsonian patients was discovered, a finding which was to revolutionize understanding and treatment of this disease. Th e last fi fty years have also seen a proliferation of approaches to therapy and the success of these medical fi elds has grown considerably. During this time, more than twenty researchers have been awarded the Nobel Prize for research related to functioning of the nervous system and have or will have a signifi cant infl uence on the development of new drugs. Th e greatest breakthroughs still waiting for clinical implementation have been in the fi eld of basic research. Discoveries of excitotoxicity mediated by glutamate receptors as well as neurogenesis in adults are creating brand new hypotheses on the pathophysiology of diff erent psychiatric and neurological diseases ranging from schizophrenia and drug abuse to ALS. However, speaking subjectively, there are two developments that had the deepest and strongest impact on pharmacology. First was the discovery of endogenous opioids based on the inquiry into real function of diff erent pharmacological receptors in our organism. Th is discovery has shown that the so-called pharmacological receptors did not evolve solely for the purpose of drug-deliverance but that they also have a physiological purpose in the functioning of an organism. Th e second important event was the discovery of methodology of reverse pharmacology – instead of a classic approach, nowadays receptors are more and more often synthesized from the human genome followed by search for their endogenous ligands and possibilities of their pharmacological manipulation. Th rough this, we now have orexines (hypocretins) as key neurotransmitters of wakefulness. By reverse pharmacology we have discovered such receptors as the new opioid receptor ORL1 and its endogenous ligand, nociceptin and fi nally, after several decades of diff erent assumptions, the prolactin-stimulating factor. What is especially intriguing and motivating is the fact that there are still hundreds of G-protein receptors, nuclear receptors and synaptic receptors waiting for researchers to discover their function and useful implementation through pharmacology.",

U ispitivanom razdoblju registriran je stalni postupni porast broja hemoragickih moždanih udara uz prosjecan udjel od 15,5% svih moždanih udara. Nagli porast udjela hemoragickog moždanog udara u ukupnom broju moždanih udara zapažen je tijekom Domovinskog rata (1991-1995) sa najvisom stopom udjela od 27,6% u 1993 godini, dok je, primjerice, u prijeratnom razdoblju taj udjel bio znatno niži (9,3% u 1987 godini). Porast incidencije hemoragickog moždanog udara, osobito u ratnom razdoblju, može se vjerojatno tumaciti kao posljedica ratnog stresa i ostalih psihosocijalnih cimbenika. Broj hemoragickih udara rastao je pretežito na racun porasta broja tipicnih hipertenzivnih intracerebralnih hemoragija, ali također i na racun porasta subarahnoidalnih hemoragija (SAH). Povecana incidencija SAH od 1992 do 1994 godine, uz nagli pad broja oboljelih u 1995 godini moguce je mo`da tumaciti kao tzv. pool-depletion fenomen: osobe sa postojecim rizikom bile su sklonije ovom tipu moždanog udara u stresnim situacijama.\r\nNisu nađene razlike u mjesecnoj i sezonskoj distribuciji hemoragickog moždanog udara, a spolovi su podjednako zahva}eni.

In a total of 1175 patients, there were 709 (60.34%) stroke patients, which exceeded the percentage recorded the year before by 14.24%. Ischemic stroke was diagnosed in 570 (80.39%) and hemorrhagic stroke in 139 (19.61%) patients. The mean age in stroke patients was 66.20 years, in those with ischemic stroke 67.33 and in those with hemorrhagic stroke 61.58 years. In the cohort of stroke patients there were 360 (50.76%) women and 349 (49.24%) men. The group of patients with ischemic stroke consisted of 290 (50.88%) women and 280 (49.12%) men, and the group of those with hemorrhagic stroke of 70 (50.36%) women and 69 (49.64%) men. The mortality rate was 23.70% in the overall stroke group, and 23.86% in the ischemic stroke group. In the group of patients with hemorrhagic stroke, 23.02% of patients died at our Department, however, aditional 28.06% of patients with this type of stroke were transfered to the Hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or to the Departments of Neurosurgery in Osijek and Zagreb, so precise data on the disease outcome in these patients are missing. The number of stroke patients admitted to the Department of Neurology in Osijek has still been on an increase, with high proportion of hemorrhagitc stroke. Inadequate bed capacity, lack of neurologic ICU, inappropriate neuroimaging diagnostics, and impossibility of providing differentiated and complex cerebrovascular neurosurgical interventions are limiting factors for implementation of a modern approach to the diagnosis and treatment of stroke patients at our Hospital.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) has found ap¬ plication in the monitoring and management of patients with persistent or recurrent thyroid cancer, obviating the need to render the patient hypothyroid. rhTSH has not yet been approved in Croatia. The present study was designed 1) to show our experience in managing patients with thyroid cancer with the use of rhTSH, and 2) to simulate and compare direct cost of rhTSH procedure with the conventional 1-thyroxin withdrawal procedure in working patients. Since 2004, twelve adult patients with papillary and follicular thyroid cancer requiring ra-dioiodine whole body scanning (WBS) received rhTSH. In all of them, prior treatment procedure consisted of total thyroidectomy followed by ablative therapy with radioiodine. The patients themselves or their employer paid the full cost of rhTSH. The recommended proce¬ dure was followed: 24 h after the second intramuscular injection of rhTSH, 185 MBq (5mCi) 1-131 were ad¬ ministered, 48 h later I-131-WBS was performed, and serum TSH and Tg levels were measured. The quality of life of our patients was unchanged during rhTSH pro¬ cedure, in contrast to hypothyroidism induced by thy¬ roid hormone withdrawal. The only adverse events to rhTSH were mild nausea and headache recorded in one patient. In our group of patients, we found no abnormal WHS or increase in Tg level. RhTSH yielded a WHS similar in quality to thyroid hormone withdrawal. Ab¬ sence from work in active patients was only 5 days with rhTSH method, while in case of conventional levothyroxin withdrawal it was even 2 months. Cost compari¬ son analysis clearly showed the rhTSH procedure to be less expensive. A greater number of patients and longer period of evaluation of rhTSH procedure are needed for more reliable conclusions to make. For the time being, recommendations from the literature should be followed. The relatively high cost of rhTSH is considered the main factor hampering its use, however, eventually rhTSH is less expensive. It appears that time has come to initiate discussion with the Croatian Institute of Health Insur¬ ance to cover rhTSH procedure by insurance.",

After careful exclusion of specific systemic and local diseases, the diagnosis was based on a combination of clinical and radiological findings. Examinations were performed to exclude the presence of a malignant or other form of tumor. Subsequently, we started treatment with high-dose steroids or a combination of steroids and surgical therapy. After therapy, we analyzed visual acuity, exophthalmometry, intraocular pressure and visual fields. There was no tumor reccurence during the follow up of 1-4 years. The findings suggested the treatment with high-dose steroids or a combination of steroids and surgical therapy to be an efficient therapeutic option for granulomatous inflammation.",

    "abstract": "In order to investigate the influence of hypomethylation on the development of rat placenta at periimplantation period we used demethylating agent 5-azacytidine (5azaC). This was performed while bearing in mind that changing the proliferative ability of trophoblast cells could affect their potential role in the process of implantation. Single dose of 5azaC (5 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally in gravid female rats at days 4th and 5th of gestation. The animals were sacrificed during the 20th day of gestation, and placentas were prepared for immunohistochemical analysis using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). We have analyzed the stereological variable of volume density (Vv), using Weible's multipurpose system with 42 test points. The statistical analysis of volume density comparing study and control group was performed using the Student’ s t test (p<0.01). The application of 5azaC on the day 4th caused the failure in development of the functionally most important part of the placenta – labyrinth. The volume density of the PCNA-positive trophoblast cells was statistically significantly larger than the control (p<0.01). The same result was obtained with placentas treated on the day 5th, but volume density was higher then not only in comparison with control but also with the 4th day (p<0.01). Observed changes of proliferative trophoblast cells volume density in the placenta after application of 5-azaC are consistent with our previous results obtained using another stereological variable of numerical density (Serman et al, 2007) and are another proof of the importance of epigenetic in regulation of development.",

    "abstract": "In this study the differentiation of the rat embryonic mandibular tooth germs under the influence of the DNA demethylating drug 5-azacytidine (5azaC) was investigated. 13- and 14-days-old Fisher rat embryonic mandibles were microsurgically isolated under the dissecting microscope. Adult male rats of the same strain were anesthesized and mandibles were transferred by the braking pipette to the subcapsular kidney space. 5azaC (5mg/kg) was applied intraperitoneally during three days to the experimental group of animals while controls were treated by PBS. After two weeks, transplants were fixed for routine histology, embedded in parafin and sectioned. In both experimental and control group of animals, transplants were surviving well. Dental germs have developed to the bell stage of tooth development and, apparently, no differences were found in odontogenesis of the experimental and control group of transplants. Because it is known that 5azaC can cause changes in gene expression and disturb development, further studies are to be done to investigate whether odontogenesis in this system is really less susceptible to this DNA demethylating agent.",

    "abstract": "The ability for differentiation of various undifferentiated embryonal cells and tissues has been extensively investigated for regenerative medicine purposes that are replacement of tissues or organs damaged by trauma or disease. Altough epiglottis was used for palpebral reconstruction in human medicine, there are almost no data about early development of this organ in the rat or its ability to differentiate in a transplant. Moreover the adult rat epiglottis has not yet been subjected to TEM analysis. Fischer rat epiglottises were microsurgically isolated under the dissecting microscope from 17-days-old Fischer rat embryos and fixed or transplanted under kidney capsules of adult rats where they spent 14 days. The DNA demethylating agent 5-azacitidine (5azaC) (5mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally to the experimental group during first three days. Rat adult epiglottises were explanted from three months old rats and fixed. Classical histological and TEM analysis as well as immunohistochemical detection of the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) and quantitative sterological analysis of its expression (numerical density Nv) were performed. PCNA was expressed in almost all cells of the 17-days-old epiglottis while in transplants its expression was restricted to undifferentiated cartilage and epithelial cells. Differentiation of the cartilage and epithelia in transplants proceeded well but did not reach the stage of differentiation in adult epiglottis because they lacked elastic fibers and stratified squamous epithelium, respectively. 5azaC increased PCNA expression (Nv) in transplants. By this investigation new data about the development of the rat epiglottis were obtained.",

Postoji 5 kategorija bolesnika s karcinomom stitnjace koji su kandidati za terapiju radioaktivnim jodom. Prvu skupinu cine bolesnici s normalnim ostatnim tkivom. Lijecenjem se želi smanjiti funkcija normalnog tkiva. Drugu skupinu cine bolesnici s vrlo malom kolicinom tkiva stitnjace, sto je danas slucaj nakon kirurskog zahvata iskusnih kirurga. U nekim je slucajevima primjena I-131 dvojbena. Trecu skupinu bolesnika cine oni s metastazama u limfnim cvorovima. Cetvrtu skupinu cine bolesnici s udaljenim metastazama, a petu oni bez scintigrafskih dokaza o tkivu stitnjace, no kod kojih je povisena koncentracija seruma tireoglobulina. Postoje dva pristupa za određivanje doze kod radiojodne ablacije. Prvi je empirijski, a doza se krece između 30 i 300 mCi. Bolesnici prve i druge skupine s ostatnim tkivom primaju 30-100 mCi. Za bolesnike s lokalnim metastazama u limfnim cvorovima preporucena doza je 100-150 mCi. Preporucena doza od 100-300 mCi odnosi se na bolesnike s udaljenim metastazama i one kod kojih nema dokaza o tkivu stitnjace, ali imaju povisen tireoglobulin. Drugi pristup za određivanje doze kod radiojodne ablacije je dozimetrijski. Za doticnog bolesnika doza se izracunava prema dozimetrijskim proracunima. Terapija pomocu I-131 je sigurna i kod velikih doza. Neki bolesnici imaju anoreksiju, mucninu, a rijetko i povracanje. Radijacijski tireoiditis je neuobicajen, jer je tkivo stitnjace kirurski uklonjeno. Kod 10% bolesnika primijecen je sijaloadenitis. Radijacijski pneumonitis je primijecen kod nekih bolesnika s rasirenim plucnim metastazama. Utjecaj na krvotvorno tkivo je prolazan. Međutim, velike doze do 37 GBq (ICi) mogu prouzrociti pancitopeniju i leukemiju. Apsolutne kontraindikacije za lijecenje pomocu I-131 su: trudnoca, dojenje i niska akumulacija I-131. Rela-tivne kontraindikacije su dob i oftalmopatija.",

Histologically, atrophy of proximal tubules and diffuse cortical fibrosis is the most prominent finding. Hyperplastic arteriopathy of small and middle-sized arteries is also reported as a constant finding in EN cases. Renal artery changes are observed in high frequency in patients with renal cell carcinoma, as well as in patients with urothelial carcinoma of renal pelvis from non-endemic region. Aim of this study was to analyze renal artery changes in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary system and endemic nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "Mouse and rat experimental animals are the most common mammalian models for teratogenic investigation. In our previous work we investigated the teratogenic effect of 5-azacytidine (5azaC) on rat limb development, and discovered the protective effect of aspirin (ASA), although it is known that aspirin given in high doses also acts as a teratogen. In this work, we investigated the influence of these teratogens combination on mouse and rat foetal survival. The goal of these experiments was to determine whether there is any difference in susceptibility to these teratogens between the mouse and the rat. 5azaC was dissolved in PBS and injected intraperitonealy at a concentration of 5 mg/kg body weight to pregnant rat and mouse females on 13th and 11th day of pregnancy respectively. ASA was dissolved in PBS and administered 2 hr before 5azaC at a concentration of 75 mg/kg. Controls were treated with PBS on the same gestation days. Animals were killed the day before birth. Foetal status (survival, intrauterine death and resorption) was determined. In mouse model 5azaC caused 30% i.u. deaths, no resorptions at all while combination of 5azaC, and presumably, protection agent ASA caused almost 27% i.u. deaths and even 15% resorptions. On the other hand, in rat model neither 5azaC nor 5azaC and ASA combination caused any i.u. deaths or resorptions. Controls of both models showed 100% foetal survival. In conclusion, the mouse model seems to be more susceptible than rat to the influence of investigated teratogens.",

All patients were younger than 61 and all developed corneal problems due to interruption of the sensory afferent fiber innervating the cornea. In all patients, the follow up period was longer than 18 months. Postoperatively, the pain was reduced in study patients. In one patient, retransplantation for disease recurrence was performed two months after the first operation. After the second operation, the pain was minimized for more than 18 months.

Molekularne metode i biljezi imaju razlicite primjene u zbrinjavanju bolesnika s rakom stitnjace. Koriste se za probir (eng. screening), za postavljanje dijagnoze, za određivanje prognoze te za pracenje bolesnika nakon operacije kako bi se rano otkrio recidiv ili ostatna bolest. U svrhu probira određuju se mutacije gena RET koje su povezane s nasljednim medularnim karcinomom stitnjace. Mutacije gena RET nađene su u vise od 90 % osoba s nasljednim medularnim karcinomom stitnjace i povezane su s vrlo visokim rizikom za razvoj medularnog karcinoma. Mutacije gena RET određuju se roditeljima, braci i djeci osoba s dijagnosticiranim nasljednim medularnim karcinomom stitnjace, kako bi im se u slucaju potvrđenih mutacija mogla ponuditi profilakticna tireoidektomija ili redovite kontrole. Analiza molekularnih biljega u punktatima cvorova stitnjace mogla bi pomoci pri postavljanju predoperativne dijagnoze u slucajevima kada se citoloskom analizom punktata ne može postaviti jasna dijagnoza glede malignosti. Bolesnici s nejasnom citoloskom dijagnozom glede malignosti podvrgavaju se operaciji stitnjace u dijagnosticke svrhe iako vecina njih ima benigne promjene stitnjace. Uvođenje pouzdanih molekularnih biljega koji bi povecali tocnost predoperativne dijagnostike promjena stitnjace moglo bi postedjeti dio tih bolesnika nepotrebne operacije. Istraživalo se brojne biljege (galektin-3, CD44v6, kataliticku (reverzno-transkriptaznu) komponentu humane telomeraze (hTERT), onkofetalni fibronektin, RET/PTC genske rearanžmane, mucin-1, HMGI(Y) (high mobility group I(Y)), HBME-1 i druge) cija se ekspresija određivala imunocitokemijskim metodama i lancanom reakcijom polimerazom nakon reverzne transkripcije (RT-PCR). Određivanje ovih biljega zasad nije ukljuceno u rutinske protokole zbrinjavanja bolesnika s rakom stitnjace iako su neki od njih (npr. galektin-3 određen imunocitokemijski) pokazali obecavajuce rezultate u smislu visoke dijagnosticke tocnosti pri identifikaciji malignih promjena stitnjace. Istraživalo se i može li analiza ekspresije pojedinih biljega u uzorcima tkiva stitnjace nakon tireoidektomije ili u punktatima pomoci pri određivanju prognoze. Međutim, dosad niti jedan od istraživanih biljega nije pokazao u vecem broju studija na velikom broju uzoraka dovoljno dobre i klinicki relevantne rezultate da bi ga se uvrstilo u rutinske protokole zbrinjavanja bolesnika s rakom stitnjace. Određivanje serumskog tireoglobulina rutinski se primjenjuje u postoperativnom pracenju bolesnika s diferenciranim rakom stitnjace kao biljeg recidiva ili ostatne bolesti. Međutim, ovaj biljeg ima neke nedostatke kao sto su utjecaj cirkulirajucih antitireoglobulinskih protutijela na izmjerenu vrijednost serumskog tireoglobulina i nužnost uskracivanja tiroksina ili primjene skupog rekombinantnog humanog tireotropina (TSH) prije određivanja serumskog tireoglobulina. Kao pouzdaniji biljeg koji bi mogao zamijeniti određivanje serumskog tireoglobulina istražuje se otkrivanje cirkulirajucih stanica stitnjace metodom RT-PCR i metodom real-time RT-PCR. U vecini ovih istraživanja kao specificni biljeg prisutnosti cirkulirajucih stanica stitnjace određivala se mRNA za tireoglobulin i za receptor za tireotropin (TSHR). Rezultati razlicitih istraživanja su dali oprecne rezultate glede vrijednosti ovog biljega. Vrijednost ovog biljega najvise umanjuju pozitivni nalazi u zdravih osoba dobiveni u nekim istraživanjima.",

The expression of bcl-2 protein significantly decreases as the grade of MALT lymphoma advances. The aim of this study was to evaluate bcl-2 expression in inflammatory cells in lamina propria in gastric biopsy samples collected from two groups of patients with chronic gastritis divided on the basis of the success or failure of H. pylori eradication. Sixty-five patients with chronic gastritis were divided into two groups of 45 and 20 patients according to their therapeutic response. The gastric mucosa samples were analyzed histologically in both groups of patients before and after standard therapy (for eradicated, after one therapeutic cycle; and for non-eradicated, after three therapeutic cycles) for H. pylori density, urease activity and bcl-2 expression. In the eradicated group of patients, H. pylori eradication was accompanied by significantly lower grades of bacterial colonization and lower urease activity in the corpus and antrum. Bcl-2 expression in inflammatory cells showed no statistically significant changes in either patient group at either location. There was no between-group difference in bcl-2 expression either. In conclusion, persistent long-lasting H. pylori infection is associated with higher grades of bacterial colonization and higher urease activity but not with bcl-2 expression in inflammatory cells.",

The disease is defined as the inflammatory process of leptomeninges (visceral layer, pia mater and arachnoid membrane) and brain parenchyma with exudates in the subarachnoid space and surrounding brain structures. The aim of the study was to define the predisposing factors responsible for the occurrence of BPME, as well as the possible correlation between the presence of predisposing factors and patient demographic characteristics, etiology and outcome of the disease. This retrospective-prospective study included 90 patients with BPME confirmed by clinical, neuroradiological and laboratory findings. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to analyze the impact of the predisposing factors on the disease outcomes. Predisposing factors that were related to BPME were found in 61% of patients. Cranial trauma as the leading factor was recorded in 23.3% of patients, followed by previous neurological disease in 14.4% of patients, while 13 patients were exposed to previous chemotherapy or long-term corticosteroid therapy. Cardiovascular diseases were reported in 12.2% and diabetes in 7.8% of patients. The existence of cardiovascular diseases significantly influenced unfavorable outcome of the disease, i.e. ”deceased” in comparison to ”cured” (OR=8.418; 95% CI=1.007-76.270), independently of age and gender. None of the examined predisposing factors was significantly related to the ”recovered with sequels” outcome as compared with ”cured” outcome. Older age and presence of cardiovascular disease as a predisposing factor significantly increased the odds of the BPME unfavorable outcome ”deceased” as compared to ”cured” outcome.",

The aim of the registry was to continuously provide data on the number of hospital-managed MS patients, patterns of disease progression, predictors of disability progression, changes in lifespan and long-term outcomes. Relevant medical data included age and gender of MS patients, family history of MS, data on previous immunization, disease course, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion load quantification, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Lifestyle habits in MS patients including smoking and alcohol consumption were also analyzed. All data were obtained from primary medical records between January 1, 2014 and January 1, 2015, and entered into the database. Data were evaluated retrospectively according to age and gender differences. Results showed that the majority of patients enrolled in the registry had the remitting relapsing course of disease, with low EDSS score indicating no disability or minimal disability. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed that oligoclonal bands were present in the majority of MS patients, with affected blood-brain-barrier permeability. According to the remitting relapsing course of the disease, cerebral MRI quantitative analysis demonstrated a significant lesion load in the majority of patients. When stratified by lifestyle habits, smokers and alcohol consumers were more prevalent among male patients. Our hospital-based registry might be considered as a prototype for the national MS registry and should be improved for reliable statistical analysis.",

Femoral head ossification delay and the proximal femur varus deformity i.e. coxa vara (CV) are the major features of SEDc. The accepted treatment is a valgus femoral osteotomy. The data on hip surgery in SEDc are scarce. In our database from 2006 to 2020, there were 6 SEDc patients. Four patients had surgery on 8 hips. Surgical treatment was indicated due to progressive CV deformity i.e. a decreasing neck-shaft angle (NSA), pain, limited hip abduction, and gait disturbances. In three patients, a novel surgical treatment was applied - a greater trochanter apo-physiodesis using \"Eight-plate\". The patients were evaluated clinically and radiologically. The median age at first surgery was 6.3 years (range, 3.2 to 9.5 y) and the median follow-up period was 7 years (range, 5.6 to 14 y). The postoperative NSA was significantly improved with a mean increase of 13 degrees (P<0.001). Additional surgeries were needed in two patients. Overall, our results showed improved clinical and radiological parameters. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a method using an \"Eight- plate\" applied early to greater trochanter apophysis in SEDc patients with bilateral CV could reduce the need for more aggressive surgery in near future.",

The study included 52 patients, median age 34 (interquartile range 21-56) years. There was no statistically significant difference between male and female gender. The severity of diabetic ketoacidosis was moderate in the majority of cases (65.4%; p=0.005). The most common precipitating factor was infection (61.7%). In patients with moderate diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory infections were more common, while gastrointestinal infections were more common in severe diabetic ketoacidosis (33% and 25%, respectively; p=0.03). Nausea (median age 32 years; p=0.004) and vomiting (median age 31 years; p=0.01) were more common in younger age groups, while altered mental status was more common in the older age group (median age 61 years; p=0.001).

Due to FNA finding suspect of PTC, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection. Histopathologic finding revealed PTC of the left thyroid lobe and small solitary lymph node PTC metastasis in the central neck region. Postoperative evaluation with neck ultrasound (US) revealed two enlarged suspected lymph nodes in cervical regions III and IV on the left side of the neck and the patient underwent FNA with measurement of thyroglobulin (Tg) in the aspirates. The FNA finding of the cervical lymph node in the region III revealed PTC metastasis with high Tg value in the aspirate, while FNA finding of the cervical lymph node in the region IV revealed NET metastasis with low Tg value in the aspirate. Postoperative serum Tg value was 17.75 µg/L and the patient underwent 5550 MBq iodine-131 (I-131) therapy. A year after I-131 therapy, follow-up neck US demonstrated complete cure of PTC cervical lymph node metastasis in the region III and stable in size NET cervical lymph node metastasis in the region IV.

Numerous guidelines and a wide array of devices constitute the anesthesiologist's armamentarium for managing the airway. When the use of individual devices fails, the use of combination techniques is advised. We present a case of difficult intubation in a 50-year-old male patient scheduled for aortic valve replacement. He had no prior history of difficult airway management, and no abnormalities were detected on preoperative airway assessment. Body mass index was 29 kg/m2. After the separate use of direct laryngoscopy, videolaryngoscopy and a BONFILS intubation endoscope (BIE) had failed, we resorted to a combination technique, combining videolaryngoscopy and BIE. While the videolaryngoscope provided the space needed for BIE and visual guidance through copious secretions, the BIE served as a stylet for endotracheal tube guidance, leading to successful intubation. Since the technique requires costly equipment, experience in handling it and at least two operators, it is more appropriate as a rescue measure than an elective procedure. Given the potentially disastrous outcomes of failed intubation, mastering advanced airway management techniques remains of vital importance, and the combination technique is one of them.",

However, we consider the beginning of orthopaedics in Croatia to be the year 1908 when Božidar Špišić (1879 - 1957) founded the first Orthopaedic Institute in Zagreb. In 1917, the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb was founded, and when the first students were in their fifth year of studies, the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery was established on December 15, 1922, and Božidar Špišić became an Assistant Professor. From that date until today, Orthopaedics has been an independent department within the School of Medicine. The Department of Orthopaedic Surgery was primarily established for the education of medical students. Another important activity of the Department was the training of orthopaedic surgeons and specialists in overlapping fields with orthopaedics. In 1973, the department made a program of postgraduate studies in orthopaedics. The department also participated in postgraduate studies of other professions overlapping with orthopaedics and held numerous post-graduate courses and continuous medical education for doctors. Also, the department organised both domestic and international meetings, symposia, and congresses. Within the scientific post-graduate and doctoral studies, the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery members are lecturers in many courses. This article presents the work and development of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery in the first 100 years of orthopaedics education at the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb and clinical work as a part of the University Hospital Centre Zagreb. It is a presentation of time periods under nine heads of the department, starting from Professor Božidar Špišić all to the current head Professor Domagoj Delimar.",

    "abstract": "Patella alta, also called the high-riding patella, is a condition in which the patella lies superior to the trochlear groove of the femur.It is often found as one of the four major factors in patellofemoral joint instability.Along with trochlear dysplasia, excessive TT-TG, and patellar tilt, it can contribute to subluxation and dislocation of the patella 1 .Patella alta is also frequently found in ambulatory patients with cerebral palsy, with a reported prevalence of 61-93% in these patients 2,3 .It is often associated with crouch gait, i.e. the pattern of walking in cerebral palsy patients where a knee flexion contracture is present during the stance phase of walking.It is considered that subsequent overloading of the knee extensors combined with spasticity of the rectus femoris muscle leads to overstretching of the patellar tendon fibres causing development of patella alta 4 .Due to patella alta, contact areas between the patella and the femoral trochlea are reduced, therefore patellofemoral joint pressure stress is increased.This leads to patellofemoral dysfunction, weakness of extensor mechanism of the knee and eventual development of articular cartilage degeneration and anterior knee pain 5 .",

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease worldwide is 13.4%. The management of localized PC in these patients is challenging due to immunosuppressive therapy and pelvic graft localization. High graft and recipient survival rates have resulted in higher numbers of these patients in our everyday practice. A retrospective analysis of male patients who had undergone kidney transplantation at our center between 2002 and 2022 and were diagnosed and treated for PC was performed. We analyzed the incidence, treatment methods, and follow-up of PC patients in this population. A total of 1079 male patients were transplanted. PC was diagnosed in 12 patients (8 after and 4 before transplantation). The incidence of PC was 1.11%. Radical prostatectomy was performed in 11 patients, and one patient was treated with radical radiotherapy. Eleven patients had stable graft function; 1 graftectomy was performed, unrelated to PC. Three patients were indicated for salvage radiotherapy, one is in process for prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA PET CT), and 7 patients are in follow-up and without recurrence. Radical prostatectomy is a safe treatment method for localized PC in kidney transplant recipients, which does not impair graft function and survival.",

Development of the procedure began in 1976 with publication of the first reports, while turning point came in 1985 when the first 250 cases were described. Subsequently, PCNL has become standard in the treatment of kidney stones instead of open surgery. Numerous modifications of the procedure have been developed with advancement of modern technology. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity for clearer understanding of differences and circumstances of choice among different techniques. There are significant differences in the instruments used for the procedure, so we distinguish standard PCNL (working channel of 24-30 Fr), mini PCNL (working channel of 11-18 Fr), ultra-mini PCNL (working channel <15 Fr), and micro PCNL (working channel <6 Fr). With the development of flexible ureteroscopy (FURS), a combined method is also being developed, i.e., Endoscopic Combined IntraRenal Surgery (ECIRS, PCNL + FURS). Furthermore, each procedure can be performed in prone or supine position. The aim of this paper is to point out the similarities and differences, the advantages and disadvantages of different techniques, with an additional aim to present our experience and current standard practice in kidney stone treatment.",

    "abstract": "Higher turnaround of urologic patients in the tertiary clinical center can lead to more accompanying complications, ranging from 1% to 55% for various procedures, with the incidence of vascular injuries varying from 0.43% up to 9.5%. In patients with impaired renal function, it is imperative to prevent the loss of normal kidney function and potential hemodialysis. Being minimally invasive, endovascular procedures such as renal artery embolization (RAE) can treat major and life-threatening complications, but good and prompt communication between urologists and interventional radiologist is necessary for fast and effective treatment. Absolute contraindications for RAE are the presence of acute infection and previously known anaphylactic reaction to the iodine contrast media, while previous mild or moderate allergic reactions to iodine contrast media are not contraindications for RAE. Currently used embolic agents can be divided into temporary and permanent embolization agents. While the temporary embolization agent available is a gelatin sponge that could be used as complementary material or stand-alone, for permanent embolization interventional radiologists use microparticles, microspheres, liquid embolic agents, coils, and microcoils. RAE procedures are considered to be safe with a low incidence of complications, with non-target embolization being the most serious one. Postembolization syndrome is considered to be the most common adverse effect and it involves around 90% of patients. The overall results show that RAE is a safe, minimally invasive procedure that can effectively treat significant complications caused by other urologic procedures, with the reported success rates of 87%-100%.",

It is most common amongst the elderly. It is characterized by joint stiffness, pain and disability. The aim of this study was to examine the analgesic and functional impact of ultrasound-guided TGNB in patients with chronic knee OA and to evaluate the efficacy of local anesthetics and corticosteroids. The study included 20 patients. Pain was assessed according to the numerical pain scale (NRS), and improvement of the functional capacity was assessed according to the WOMAC Index (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index). SLGN, SMGN and IMGN were identified, and 3 mL of a mixture of local anesthetic (ropivacaine 0.75%) and corticosteroid (triamcinolone 40 mg) were applied to each nerve. The average NRS value before TGNB was 5.1, and the WOMAC score was 58.55. After the TGNB was performed, NRS was 2.4 (47% decrease in pain intensity) and WOMAC was 30.1 (51% decrease in the intensity of ailment). TGNB is effective and not harmful in treating pain and enhances the functional capacity in patients with knee OA. The clinical benefits of corticosteroid administration suggest that it may be an appropriate adjuvant in TGNB for knee OA.",

Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted. The study included 60 participants; 30 of whom were physicians who worked in the respiratory ICU and 30 who did not work in the respiratory ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were obtained using a questionnaire to classify participants as being without burnout symptoms, in the initial phase of burnout, or having a high degree of burnout. Based on the results, we found that 53% of all physicians presented with burnout syndrome, and the majority of them were anesthesiologists (30%). Furthermore, 37% of anesthesiologists were in the group with an initial phase of burnout and 20% in the group with a high burnout. Among female anesthesiologists, the syndrome was observed in 58% of all cases. In the group of anesthesiologists older than 35 years, 59% of the cases of burnout syndrome were present, where as burnout syndrome was present in 54% of younger anesthesiologists (younger than 35 years old). There was a higher proportion of burnout syndrome among the participants than in previous studies. The anesthesiologists who worked with seriously ill COVID patients during the pandemic were predominant among the physicians with a higher proportion of burnout syndrome.

A personalized approach to pain is based on the prediction and continuous assessment of pain. In critically ill patients, this approach includes the knowledge of the underlying cause of pain related to the primary diagnosis, the causes of procedural pain and previous chronic pain conditions of the patient, in order to apply a specific therapeutic approach. Available treatment recommendations emphasize the use of adaptive or dynamic analgesia, with titration of analgesics according to changes in the clinical state of patients. They indicate the necessity of pain assessment with tools for pain intensity assessment and therapy evaluation, as well as the need for assessment at regular time intervals. Despite treatment guidelines, clinical practice shows significant deviations from evidence-based recommendations. The reasons are primarily the non-recognition of pain, insufficient knowledge of analgesics (type and dose), lack of regular assessment and inadequacy of the applied tools for pain assessment. In terms of personalization, there is a need to develop objective pain assessment methods, such as sensitive and pain-specific tools that do not rely on the patient's ability to communicate and are independent of assessors, disease characteristics and pharmacological interventions in critically ill patients.",

    "abstract": "The coccyx, the last segment of the spine, joins the sacrum at the base. It has three to five vertebrae, which are typically fused. In front of the sacrococcygeal junction is the ganglion impar, the only unpaired autonomic ganglion. The two sympathetic chains come to a close there. The impar ganglion is traversed by sympathetic nerves carrying pain fibers from the perineum, distal sections of the rectum, the vagina and the urethra. The painful disorder known as coccygodynia, which affects the tail end of the spine, is frequently brought on by birth trauma or is caused by an unidentified factor. Even though the pain may go away on its own or with therapy, it may also linger and worsen over time. Due to increased stress from the female pelvis on the coccyx, it affects women five times more frequently than it does men. Conservative, invasive or surgical treatment options are available for coccygodynia (partial or total coccygectomy). Rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) or COX-2 inhibitors, acupuncture, coccyx cushions, physical therapy, manual therapy and invasive therapy, which involves ganglion impar block with injections of local anesthetic and corticosteroid under fluoroscopy, followed by radiofrequency ablation, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) or peripheral nerve stimulation, are examples of conservative treatments. Coccygectomy is recommended in refractory situations.",

    "abstract": "The hyperactive \"baby boom\" generation is gradually aging, and chronic hip pain has become an increasingly common problem. Most patients with hip pain experience symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain. They can control the pain with conservative measures, but it inevitably progresses, causing a gradual decline in the quality of life. Conservative therapeutic approaches to hip pain include paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics and a variety of physical therapies. Total hip arthroplasty surgery is the only option for patients who experience a gradual decrease in mobility over time and whose pain is unaffected by a conservative approach. For most patients, surgical treatment is a good way to restore quality of life and reduce pain levels, However, this aggressive surgery is not possible in some patients. Many comorbidities in old age limit access to total arthroplasty, while the younger population is at an age where they want to delay surgical treatment. In both of these groups, it is desirable to consider other treatment options and techniques. Minimally invasive percutaneous partial sensory denervation of the hip joint has today become an option that can achieve significant success in providing the desired pain relief without the employment of a surgical knife. Today, there are different modalities for performing this procedure, ranging from diagnostic-pharmacological, radiofrequency (thermal, pulsating and cooled) and cryoablative modes. There is currently broad evidence that suggests that the use of fluoroscopically guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of the periarticular branches of the hip joint can provide pain relief for as long as 12-18 months.",

    "abstract": "The most common causes of lumbar radicular pain are pathological changes in the intervertebral disc. Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is the most common cause of lumbosacral radicular syndrome. It affects 1-2% of the general population, burdening health services and the economy worldwide. Excessive scar tissue after lumbar microdiscectomy can increase postoperative pain. Postoperative fibrosis is one of the most important causes of failed back surgery syndrome after lumbar disc surgery. Percutaneous laser disc decompression (PLDD) is a minimally invasive procedure in which thermal energy produced by a LASER probe is used to reduce the intervertebral disc herniation located within the annulus fibrosus. Evaporation of a small volume in a closed hydraulic space (nucleus pulposus) leads to decreased intradiscal pressure. It causes a thermal \"shrinkage effect\" with the retreat of the herniated disc and the decompression of the nerve root, which reduces lumbar radicular pain. Previous research has shown effective reduction of pain after PLDD and only a small number of complications of the procedure itself. PLDD is a safe and effective procedure in well-selected patients. Unfortunately, there is still a need for extensive, randomized prospective studies on PLDD in lumbar radicular pain in order to confirm or dispute the results obtained so far.",

Invasive treatment of cancer pain should not be the last resort but should be an integrative part in the treatment of cancer pain in combination with opioid therapy as a part of multimodal therapy. For visceral pain, interventional techniques represent a minimally invasive and reliable option for many diagnoses where active treatment options have been exhausted. There is evidence for the effectiveness of the celiac plexus block in pain treatment for pancreatic cancer and some upper abdominal cancers. According to research, the hypogastric neurolytic block is an option for pelvic visceral pain treatment and has proven to be more effective than oral opioid pain treatment. Recently, progress has been made with intrathecal and epidural analgesia as safe and effective therapeutic options with a positive risk-benefit ratio for cancer pain treatment over a long period of time and in home settings. Invasive procedures are a safe and effective option for cancer pain therapy, thus significantly affecting the quality of life.",

The aim of this study was to compare pain intensity, disability and neuropatic pain depending on the method of treatment (epidural steroid injection or percutaneous laser disc decompression) in the treatment of lumbar radicular pain caused by intervertebral disc herniation with or without discoradicular contact. Data were collected from 28 patients at 3 measurement points (before the procedure and at examinations on the 15th and 30th day after the procedure) using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Oswestry Disabilitiy Indeks (ODI) and Pain Detect. The reduction of the pain after the procedure was statistically significant only in the group of patients with discoradicular contact in whom PLDD was performed (P=0.04). From the obtained results, it can be concluded that percutaneous laser disc decompression (PLDD) led to a greater reduction in disability (P=0.009) in patients with discorradicular contact, whereas lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection (ESI TF) led to greater reduction in patients without discorradicular contact (P=0.02). The results indicate that there was a significant (P=0.01) reduction in neuropathic pain in patients without discorradicular contact who were treated with ESI TF and in patients with discoradicular contact who were treated with PLDD (P=0.04).",

    "abstract": "Migraine treatment can be aimed at the acute treatment of pain attacks and accompanying symptoms and at preventing the recurrence of headaches. The choice of drug depends on clinical effectiveness based on scientific evidence. If general analgesics are not appropriate for the acute treatment of migraines, the first choice are specific drug agonists of serotonin receptors class 1B and 1D triptans. Since triptans are contraindicated in patients with vascular diseases due to their vasoconstrictor effects, lasmiditan, a class 1 F agonist that does not have such an effect, was developed. A revolution in the treatment of migraine was achieved through the use of antagonist molecules against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its receptor. There are two types of such molecules: large molecules of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) that are exclusively used as prophylaxis for migraines, and small molecules called gepants that can be used in acute treatment as well as for prophylaxis in migraines. Due to the pharmacological profile of Mabs, they are suitable for treatment in the parenteral form at longer application intervals (4 weeks / 1 month, or 3 months). They have an excellent clinical effect on reducing the frequency of frequent episodic and chronic migraines, which ca be achieved in a few weeks with good tolerability, in contrast to non-specific prophylactics that have lower effectiveness and tolerability. According to the latest European guidelines, CGRP Mabs may be given as the first choice in migraine prophylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Isolated abducens nerve palsy following lumbar puncture is a rare complication. In scientific literature, it has been mostly described after performing spinal anesthesia in anesthesiology literature rather than in neurological literature. Isolated abducens nerve palsy usually occurs from one to three weeks after performing lumbar puncture and it is important to connect it with this procedure and exclude other possible etiologies. The actual incidence of this complication is unknown. We describe a 32-year-old male patient who presented with unspecific headache attributed to cavernous malformation and two developmental venous anomalies. While searching for headache etiology, lumbar puncture was performed. Two days after lumbar puncture, the patient presented with isolated abducens palsy of the right eye. Our planned diagnostic evaluation included measuring intracranial pressure by noninvasive optic sheath nerve sonography and repeating brain magnetic resonance imaging. We also planned to treat the patient with epidural blood patch, which is usually successful when performed as soon as the diagnosis is established. Unfortunately, our patient refused diagnostic and therapeutic proposal, so it was impossible to know final outcome. In conclusion, we want to highlight these complications, especially to young doctors and specialists who might see it rarely.",

This is the first study researching the effect of early hypoxemic stage COVID-19 infection on development of PH. As a result, it was specified that COVID-19 infection had no effects on mPAD, whereas it had a positive effect on AAD and thus led to a decrease in the mPAD/AAD ratio.

Closely related to sexuality is the sex drive (libido), which is the basis of human sexual activity. An important aspect of sexuality in both sexes is also the experience of orgasm. Feelings of shame, guilt, fear, and despair contribute to the development of a disorder in the orgasmic experience. The aim of this paper is to present the factors that influence the frequency of orgasmic experiences in women and to determine their sexual satisfaction. We used the online original questionnaire. The target population were adult women. The survey was conducted from June to July 2021. Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 statistical software. A total of 1409 questionnaires were completed. Most participants were between 21 and 30 years old and had a high school education, more than half experienced orgasm most often during masturbation, and most experienced it every time during masturbation. More than half experienced clitoral orgasm most often. The factors that bother the respondents most in their sex life were too little foreplay, too little passion, and too short sex. Sexual satisfaction is experienced by people very individually and depends on many factors, such as the quality, frequency, and pleasure attributed to sexual activities, but also on general health and well-being.",

We aimed to find differences in peripheral blood count, liver enzymes and degradation products between HCV infected and healthy controls, and their impact on detection of the disease and discrimination of the diseased from non-diseased subjects. We performed laboratory testing for peripheral blood count, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) and bilirubin in 40 HCV patients and 40 healthy controls. There were statistically significant differences in leukocytes (p=0.001), ALT (p<0.0001), AST (p<0.0001), ALP (p<0.0001), γ-GT (p<0.0001), total bilirubin (p<0.018) and indirect bilirubin (p<0.030) between the HCV infected and control groups. On multiple regression, the independent variables of HCV titer (p=0.5091), granulocytes (p=0.7061) and total bilirubin (p=0.2022) showed no impact on liver lesion estimated by a dependent variable of γ-GT. On logistic regression, only AST [p=0.0112, odds ratio (OR)1.2161, area under the curve (AUC) 0.887] and γ-GT (p=0.0283, OR 1.1041, AUC 0.815) showed a statistically significantly positive predicting value when discriminating healthy subjects and diseased patients. In conclusion, HCV titer, granulocytes and total bilirubin did not show a statistically significant impact on hepatic lesion expressed by γ-GT, whereas only AST and γ-GT showed a statistically significant positive predicting value to discriminate infected patients from healthy controls. Each unit increase in AST and γ-GT resulted in 21.6% and 10.4% higher possibility of HCV infection, respectively.",

We aimed to assess the predictive role of serum leptin in MICS in maintenance HD patients. This prospective study included 93 HD patients who were distributed in three groups according to serum leptin levels (low-normal-high). Nutritional and inflammatory parameters of MICS, as well as malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS), were determined at baseline and after 12 months. In all subjects, the median serum leptin levels were above the relevant reference range at both the baseline (10 ng/mL; interquartile range (IQR) 4.2-29.9 ng/mL) and at the 12-month follow-up (13 ng/mL; IQR 3.5-39.5 ng/mL). Patients with decreased serum leptin levels had elements of MICS present. Leptin exhibited good sensitivity (0.89), while its specificity was similar to that of other nutritional and inflammatory parameters (0.45 for leptin vs. 0.65 for body mass index, 0.46 for MIS, 0.63 for C-reactive protein, 0.44 for albumins, 0.47 for ferritin and 0.50 for transferrin). The ROC curve analysis identified leptin levels of ≤3.4 ng/mL in men and ≤11.4 ng/mL in women to have the best predictive value for MICS. In conclusion, leptin appears to be a reliable marker of MICS.",

Eight out of these 32 patients died from COVID-19 (CFR 25%). The cause of death was sepsis in 7 patients and pulmonary embolism in one patient. Results of univariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that older age, EDSS higher than 6.0, progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) forms, cardiovascular comorbidities, and longer duration of hospital stay statistically significantly increased the risk of COVID-19-related death in MS patients. Treatment with ocrelizumab was associated with more than 2-fold increased death risk (p=0.408). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that progressive forms of MS (p=0.044) and longer hospitalization (p=0.006) significantly increased the risk of death in our MS cohort. In our study, older age, presence of comorbidities, and progressive disease course were independent predictors of increased lethality of COVID-19 in PwMS.

Initial workup other than hypercholesterolemia and mild proteinuria was normal with no signs of other target organ damage. Further evaluation was aimed at determining the possible cause of secondary hypertension. High normal plasma renin with elevated plasma aldosterone led to a suspicion of renovascular hypertension. Magnetic resonance angiography and later computed tomography angiography showed two non-stenotic right renal arteries. Another diagnostic workup was normal. A satisfactory blood pressure control was eventually achieved with combination therapy including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. We conclude that although non-stenotic, an accessory renal artery should be considered as a possible cause of renovascular hypertension in children and adolescents even in the absence of hyperreninemia.",

The purpose of our study was to detect predictors of IOHTA in patients undergoing neck surgery. This single center retrospective study included 880 adult patients who underwent neck surgery under general anesthesia. The impact of gender, age, comorbidity, difficult tracheal intubation, anesthesia duration, and induced hypotension on IOHTA was studied. IOHTA was present in 57 (6.7%) patients. The highest incidence of IOHTA was recorded in patients with ASA 4 status and those with Cormack-Lehane grade 4,: (22.2% and 21.4%, respectively). Significantly more patients with hypertension, hyperlipoproteinemia and ventricular extrasystoles had IOHTA compared with patients without these comorbidities. Statistically significant predictors of IOHTA were age (OR 1.438; 95% CI 1.144-1.808; p=0.002), cardiac arrhythmia (OR 1.702; 95% CI 1.129-2.566; p=0.011), Cormack-Lehane grade (OR 1.407; 95% CI 1.054-1.878; p=0.020), and duration of anesthesia (OR 1.005; 95% CI 1.001-1.008; p=0.005). The risk of IOHTA occurrence was lower in patients with induced hypotension (OR 0.024; 95% CI 0.003-0.185; p=0.000). During neck surgery, special attention is needed in patients of older age, those with cardiac arrhythmia, difficult intubation, and longer anesthesia duration because they are at risk of IOHTA.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of insufficient serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in a sample of neurological patients and to compare it to the estimate in the general Croatian population. The secondary aim was to test for the possible significant differences in vitamin D2 insufficiency between the groups of patients according to gender, season, region, vitamin D3 supplementation, and diagnosis of autoimmune disease. This retrospective study involved 371 neurological patients in one-year period. The data collected included gender, age at the time of admission, region, season at the time of admission, main neurological diagnosis at discharge, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level at the time of hospitalization, and use of vitamin D3 substitutes prior to hospitalization. The proportion of neurological patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency (<75 nmol/L) was estimated at 74.66% (95% confidence interval, p<0.0001), which is slightly lower than in the Croatian general population. There were no significant differences in 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency according to gender, season and region. Significant differences in 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency were found according to vitamin D3 supplementation and diagnosis of autoimmune disease.",

    "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke has an important place among emergency department admissions. After a rapid diagnosis of the patient admitted with a preliminary diagnosis of stroke, the necessary examination and first intervention should be performed, then diagnostic evaluation should be made. The aim of this study was to investigate whether paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) enzyme activity, measured in patients whose stroke onset is known, is a diagnostic biomarker for stroke by evaluating the relationship between stroke diagnosis, ischemic area volume, and stroke onset. The study included 100 patients over age 18 admitted to the emergency department with acute stroke symptoms, with known stroke onset and diagnosed as acute occlusive cerebrovascular disease within 24 hours, and 100 healthy control subjects. After initial evaluation, computed tomography of the brain and magnetic resonance imaging, PON-1 activity was measured by colorimetric method in patient serum. Comparison of PON-1 levels between the two groups yielded a statistically significant difference. There was a significant decrease in serum PON-1 values in patient group as compared with control group (p<0.001). According to these results, no significant relationship was found between the affected ischemic area of the brain, PON-1, and ischemic volume values. The possible relationship between PON-1 values and stroke onset was compared and no statistically significant difference was found (p=0.311). The relationship between PON-1 enzyme activity and diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke was found to be significant. PON-1 was found to be lower in stroke patients but no correlation was found with ischemic area volume.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease that most commonly affects the young, working, female population. Musculoskeletal manifestations are one of the most prevalent and presenting features in SLE. Arthralgia, myalgia, non-erosive arthritis, myositis but also tenosynovitis and enthesitis are present in more than 90% of SLE patients. Although not considered very severe SLE manifestations, they significantly affect the patient's quality of life and daily functioning. Clinical assessment of joints, tendons, entheses, and muscles is still the gold diagnostic standard. There are many radiological imaging methods, i.e., classic radiograms, ultrasound, bone scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging that provide morphological information regarding damage and activity of musculoskeletal diseases in SLE and other rheumatic diseases. Musculoskeletal ultrasound stands out as an accessible and affordable method. Recognizing musculoskeletal manifestations may help establish an early diagnosis of SLE and assess disease activity, thus leading to early initiation of treatment and preventing chronic and irreversible changes with a beneficial effect on the quality of life.",

The percentage of re-bleeding within the first 30 days of hospital admission, as well as the need of blood transfusions, are also reported. Statistical data were collected on 2198 patients who were treated in our emergency department due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in the form of melena or hematemesis. Upper endoscopy performed within 24 hours of arrival revealed that 796 (36.2%) patients had a peptic ulcer, while the diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal tumor bleeding (UGITB) was verified in 61 (2.8%) patients. During the five-year study, it was shown that men had a higher prevalence of bleeding compared to women (PUB 62.3% vs. UGITB 52.5%). The cumulative incidence of UGIB was 126/100,000. It was found that the largest number of bleeding tumors were located in the stomach (n=58, 95%), with most of them being malignant tumors (n=55, 90%), specifically adenocarcinomas (n=48, 87.3%). The percentage of re-bleeding was lower (9.7% vs. 19.7%, p<0.01) and blood transfusions were less often required (49.5% vs. 75.4%, p<0.01) in PUB. Due to uncontrolled bleeding (5.9% vs. 3.3%, p<0.01), surgical treatment was more often required in cases of PUB, as well as larger volumes of blood transfusion. Patients with PUB had a lower rate of re-bleeding, required surgical intervention more often, and required red blood cell transfusions less frequently.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of preoperative anxiety, depression and pain on the quality of postoperative recovery and acute postoperative pain after radical prostatectomy. One hundred and sixty patients scheduled for open or laparoscopic radical prostatectomy were enrolled in a prospective observational study. Psychological distress was assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S and STAI-T) and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Postoperative recovery was assessed on postoperative days 1-3 using the Quality of Recovery-40 score (QoR-40). Numeric rating scale 0-10 was used to assess the intensity of postoperative pain at rest and on movement at 1, 6 and 24 hours post-surgery. In linear regression models, STAI-S was predictor of QoR-40 on postoperative days 1-3 (ß=-17.32; p<0,001, ß=-0.345; p=0.004, and ß=-0.326; p=0.002, respectively), and preoperative pain was predictor of pain at rest (ß=0.666; p=0.008) and on movement (ß=0.691; p=0.006). In logistic regression models, preoperative pain was predictor of clinically significant pain at rest (OR, 2.86; 95% CI 1.11-7.36) and STAI-S of clinically significant pain on movement (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.08-4.52). In conclusion, state anxiety had negative impact on QoR and acute pain after radical prostatectomy. Preoperative pain was associated with acute postoperative pain.",

The aim of this report is to present clinical and ultrasonographic features of tumors in six patients (5 females; mean age 53.2 years) treated for parathyroid carcinoma at the Department of Nuclear Medicine during 20 years. Most patients presented with hypercalcemia, and one of them had a previous history of long-term secondary hyperparathyroidism and was treated with hemodialysis. All patients had significantly reduced bone density, and two of them presented with typical 'brown' tumors involving long bones of lower extremities. After initial treatment, all patients except for the youngest female patient were in long-term remission with normal serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. Preoperative imaging procedures such as ultrasound with targeted fine needle-aspiration biopsy and Tc99m-sestamibi scan helped determine the location and extent of the disease, but definitive diagnosis was made after the surgery. Parathyroid cancer is a rare form of malignant tumor that is difficult to diagnose preoperatively due to similar clinical features with benign causes of hyperparathyroidism such as hyperplasia and adenomas, especially atypical ones that require regular follow-up. Complete surgical resection provides the best chance of cure, although metastatic disease is possible.",

The effect of COVID-19, which has involved the whole world in the last two years, on thyroid function is currently unknown. With the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic, 69,000 patients who presented to our hospital in the last 18 months and had the COVID-19 test were screened. Thyroid function tests of 500 patients with positive COVID-19 test and 1133 patients with negative COVID-19 test were compared. Hormone levels were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The levels recorded in COVID-19 positive patients (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 2.54±14.54 µIU/mL, free triiodothyronine (fT3) 0.84±1.49 pg/mL, free thyroxine (fT4) 0.99±0.42 ng/dL, antithyroid peroxidase antibody (anti TPO) 140.04±276.55 IU/mL, and antithyroglobulin antibody (anti TG) 16.31±22.99 IU/mL) were compared with those measured in COVID-19 negative patients (TSH 1.90±8.22 µIU/mL, fT3 0.78±1.60 pg/mL, fT4 0.99±0.42 ng/dL, anti TPO 122.55±263.39 IU/mL, and anti TG 56.25±185.64 IU/mL). There was no significant difference between COVID-19 positive patients and COVID-19 negative cases in terms of thyroid function (TSH, p=0.66; fT3, p=0.24; fT4, p=0.93; anti TPO, p=0.52; and anti TG, p=0.39). For now, it may be some consolation for us that the coronavirus disease, which affects almost all body systems, does not seem to affect thyroid function.",

Between 2005-2007, 13 patients [age 52± 16 years, 9F/4M, histotype: papillary carcinoma (n=6), Hűrthle cell/follicular (n=2), MTC (n=5)] with biochemically suspicious recurrence, previously treated by total thyroidectomy and 131I ablation, underwent PET scan (Siemens ECAT-EXACT 47/GE Advance NXi, 3D-mode/30-35 min.) 45 min. following iv. administration of 296-444 MBq 18-FDG under TSH suppression ; all lesions were evaluated by SUVmax. Two TgAb-positive patients showed undetectable serum Tg levels off LT4 ; one developed recurrence during follow-up. PET showed hypermetabolic lesions in 8/13 patients (5/8 DTC, 3/5 MTC ; 3 pT2-4N1-1b, 2 pT3N0, 3 pT1-1bN0-1b) and changed intended management in 37% of them, while it was presumably false-negative in 4 (2 DTC/2 MTC ; 3 pT1-2bN0, 1 pT2N1 ; non-progressive disease), and true negative in 1 DTC patient (TgAb-positive, pT1N1) ; the involved regions were: head-neck (5/8), mediastinum (7/8), lungs (2/8), liver (2/8) and spleen (1/8). In all patients, 131I-WB-scan, CT-MRI, 111In-octreotide, 99mTc-DMSA(V), SESTAMIBI and ultrasound were initially negative or showed less number of lesions. Two patients with lymph node involvement underwent extensive surgery with histologically confirmed metastases. PET is an efficient tool to locate recurrent/metastatic disease in high-risk, I-131 non-avid DTC with increased Tg and MTC with elevated calcitonin. Superior sensitivity, provision of anatomic guidance for biopsy/surgical procedures and impact on management/prognostication are major advantages in carefully selected patients ; however, different pre-test probabilities, acquisition protocols and TSH-stimulation may yield different diagnostic efficiency.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n The aim of the study was to determine the possible bone marrow involvement in patients with early stages of classic Hodgkinis disease mixed cellularity variant diagnosed by lymph node biopsy at initial presentation not responding to radiotherapy alone. The study cohort consisted of 20 patients (18 displaying B-cell genotype and two T-cell genotype) with stages I-II Hodgkinis disease according to Ann Arbor classification treated with radiotherapy alone, seven of them not responding to therapy. Southern blot hybridization using a specific EBV Bam H1W fragment probe showed the presence of EBV genomes in two patients. All 20 patients underwent iliac crest trephine biopsy and a panel of antibodies including CD45, CD20, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD56, CD30, ALK-1, CD-15, EMA, CD61, and CD68 was performed. A statistically significant predominance of CD45, CD45RO and CD4 positive stromal cells was found in seven patients that failed to respond to therapy (c 2 -test: p=0.021, p=0.019 and p=0.015, respectively). The predominance of CD4 positive cells in the bone marrow stroma might be suggestive of involvement by Hodgkinis disease in the early stage (I-II) patients (indicating upstaging) who fail to show remission on radiotherapy alone, and could explain the abnormal cytokine production, which may contribute to diminished T-cell immunity and inefficient antitumor responses despite a vast majority of infiltrating reactive immune cells.",

    "abstract": "Incidence of malignant melanoma is constantly rising throughout the world during the last decade. The aim of our study was to analyze primary melanomas among the biopsy specimens in two hospitals during the 6-year period (1999 to 2004) ; one in Zagreb presenting the Continental part and another in Zadar presenting the Costal part of the country. We compared clinical parameters (sex, age distribution) and histological parameters (type, Clark and Breslow level of invasion) of primary melanomas between the two regions with different climatic characteristics. At the Ljudevit Jurak University Department of Pathology, University Hospital Sestre milosrdnice, Zagreb we used the computerized tumor registry Thanatos and at the Department of Pathology, General Hospital Zadar we used the tumor Registry to obtain relevant bioptic and clinical data of all patients with primary melanoma of the skin. In the above-mentioned period primary skin melanomas were found in 240 patients in Zagreb and in 101 cases in Zadar. F/M ratio was 1.16 amongst Zagreb patients, while the ratio was 0.94 amongst Zadar patients. The vast majority of primary skin melanomas were diagnosed on the trunk, followed by extremities and head & neck region. Nodular histological type was more frequent in Zadar patients, while superficial spreading type was the most common histological type among Zagreb patients. In both hospitals the average age was 58 years, age distribution was between 15 and 90 years in Zagreb University Hospital and between 10 and 91 years in the Zadar General Hospital. There is still a slight (10% more patients) predominance with advanced Clark stages among patients from Zadar. In our study distribution of analyzed clinical and histological parameters of primary skin melanomas among the biopsy specimens in continental and coastal region were similar",

    "abstract": "Moraxella catarrhalis a commensal of the nasopharynx has been recognized with increasing frequency as a potential pathogen in respiratory tract infections. The beta-lactamase production in M. catarrhalis first described in 1977 has been reported with increasing frequency in many countries of the world. However, there were no reports from Croatia so far. The aim of this study was to investigate antibiotic susceptibilities and beta-lactamase production in M. catarrhalis isolates from Croatia. Fifty M. catarrhalis strains were collected in University Children's Hospital Zagreb during 1990-1992 from various clinical specimens. Antibiotic susceptibilities to wide range of antibiotics were determined by broth microdilution method according to NCCLS. Beta-lactamases were detected by disk chromogenic substrate (nitrocephin) test in all strains. Prevalence of beta-lactamase positive strains in the study period was 100%. No resistance to amoxycillin/clavulanate, cephalexin, ceftibuten, tetracycline, erythromycine, azitromycine and chloramphenicol was observed. The activity of amoxycillin was strongly enhanced in the presence of clavulanic acid in all strains. Older cephalosporins were equally active but third generation cephalosporin ceftibuten displayed significantly lower MICs compared to older compounds. Among non beta-lactam antibiotics tetracycline and eritromycine showed similar activity. Azithromycine had markedly stronger inhibitory activity on comparison with erythromycine and tetracycline. According to our results amoxycillin combined with clavulanic acid should be the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of infections caused with beta-lactamase positive isolates of M. catarrhalis. Oral cephalosporins, tetracycline, macrolides or azithromycine could be an option too.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n The aim of the study was to analyze age distribution in patients undergoing early diagnosis procedures within the scope of the prostate cancer program, and to compare diagnostic accuracy of total prostate specific antigen (tPSA) test and age specific PSA range test in differentiating prostate cancer from benign prostate hyperplasia in order to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. Age distribution was analyzed in 394 patients with negative digitorectal examination, and diagnostic accuracy was analyzed in 80 patients with negative digitorectal and tPSA of 4.0-9.9 ng/mL. All 80 patients underwent prostate biopsy under transrectal ultrasound guidance obtaining at least six cores. Statistical analysis included t-test, MannWhitney rank sum test, specificity and sensitivity, positive and negative predictive value, and detection rate. The patient mean age was 67.0 years. Only 22% were self referred to the early diagnosis program seeking PSA and urologist consultation while being free from any other urologic difficulties. This population was significantly younger in comparison with patients referred to urologist by general practitioner for their micturition difficulties (Mann-Whitney test, p<0.001). Total PSA differentiated significantly prostate cancer from benign prostate hyperplasia (p=0.007, t-test). Positive predictive value for tPSA and age specific PSA range test did not differ significantly (16.2 vs. 17.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of age specific PSA range test was 92.3% and 16.41%, respectively. It is concluded that there is the need of additional public health education about prostate cancer since only 22% of the respective population seek urology consultation and PSA testing, being aware of the benefits of the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Up to 38% of patients included in the early diagnosis program are beyond target population since no curable treatment could be offered to them even if the diagnosis of prostate cancer was established. Although age specific PSA range test reduces the rate of biopsies by 16.4%, 7.6% of prostate cancers are thus missing, whereas false positive results account for as many as 83.58% of cases, clearly calling for search for the potentially better ways of reducing the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies.",

ABPM helps in the evaluation of the prescribed therapy effects, hypotension, autonomic dysfunction, hypertension in pregnancy, in the elderly and type 1 diabetics, as well as in elucidation of syncopal states and accidental hypertension. With appropriate use of ABPM the optimal therapeutic effect can be achieved and the risk of arterial hypertension sequels assessed.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: To evaluate the utility and to asses the accuracy of intraoperative imprint cytology (IIC) of sentinel lymph nodes(SLNs) in patients with melanoma and to establish this diagnostic procedure in Croatia. METHODS: Seventy two sentninel lymph nodes from patients with melanoma were identified by techentium-labelled sulphur colloid and blue dye. SLNs were evaluated intraoperatively by slicing them into 3 mmsections. Imprints were made of each cut surface and stained with Hemacolor quick method and examined bya cytologist. Permanent cytological imprints were stained with Pappenheim and immunocytochemical staining for S-100 and HMB-45 proteins. Intraoperative imprint cytology results were compared with final histological ones. RESULTS: A total of 72 SLNs were excised from 47 patients with malignant melanoma(1, 6 SLNs per patient). Metastases were identified in 13 patients (27, 5%). The sensitivity of IIC for SSLN was 75%(12/16) per sentinel node and 69%(9/13) per patient basis. All 4 false-negative SLNs by IIC were detected in patients with isolated cellsof melanoma in permanent histopathological sections. No false-positive results were identified(specificity 100%). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative imprint cytology of sentinel lymph nodes of metastatic melanoma is reliable and accurate intraoperative technique. It could be used as an alternative to frozen section especially because it is rapid, cost-effective and conserves tissue.",

During a two-year period (2001-2003), 50 patients with acute ankle injury (osseous injury excluded by conventional radiography) underwent MRI evaluation within 7 days of injury infliction. The following injuries were confirmed: joint effusion, joint capsule extension, lateral collateral ligament injury, fibular malleolus infraction, flexor hallucis longus tendon injury, brevis and longus peroneus tendon injury, infraction of talus, and injury of tibiofibular syndesmosis. Study results pointed to a great variety of capsule-ligament and osseous structure injuries as well as to the existence of injuries undetectable by clinical examination and conventional radiography, where MRI proved highly useful in identifying selected patients sustaining ankle injury.",

    "abstract": "Destruction of joint is a dramatic point in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). By definition, RA is an inflammatory disease and it seems obvious to consider immune inflammation responsible for destruction, as suggested by a large body of facts, e.g., in RA neutrophils are apparent in the synovial fluid. Several authors see the effectors of joint destruction in the proteases of these neutrophils. As early as 1965, Bywaters and Ansell 1 emphasized that neutrophils did not occur in the synovial tissue in RA. This is consistent with our observations over years, yet, according to our experience, there also are frequent bacterial superinfections that manifest as infiltration by neutrophils. The quantity of proteases turned into the synovial fluid in RA is, however, rather low as they have been paralyzed and neutralized by the inhibitors TIMP and macroglobulin. In the course of bacterial arthritis, however, the proteases of such masses of neutrophils exceed the capacity of the inhibitors and thus the articular cartilage will be destroyed. The content of T and B lymphocytes in the synovial membrane in RA has led to the assumption that this cell infiltration may play a decisive role in joint destruction. For years, publications on the hypothetic role of lymphocytes predominated in the literature and rheumatologic congress reports. Yet, the real mechanism of destruction still remains to be clarified. Only the studies by Dingle et al. 2 have shed some more light on the issue. With the discovery of catabolin, later IL-1, a substance has been identified through which chondrocytes are able to induce secretion of proteases, and thus degrade the surrounding matrix. This concept of chondrocytic chondrolysis was quite enthusiastically accepted 3 . However, the minimal damages in the microscopic field failed to provide any explanation for joint destruction. Over time, a wide array of cytokines have been discovered, TNF alpha being most prominent of them. A whole spectrum of effects have been ascribed to cytokines, however, almost exclusively based on the results of in vitro experiments. These results are interesting indeed, yet offering no explanation for the mechanism of joint destruction either. The pathogenetic research has gained a new impulse through the discovery of apoptosis as programmed cell imminent death, whereas apoptosis disturbances have offered a welcome explanation for the multiplication of cells in the synovial membrane, based on the idea that pathologic accumulation of cells is achieved through different kinds of disturbances of regular apoptosis in the synovial membrane (Fig. 1) 4 .",

The difference between preoperative and postoperative staging was not statistically significant. In order to be as precise as possible on preoperative bronchial carcinima staging, all diagnostic methods available should be used to distinguish resectable from nonresectable tumors. The extent of diagnostic work-up should be coordinated with therapeutic consequences.",

    "abstract": "Department of Gastroenterology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital, Zagreb, CroatiaSUMMARY Œ Hemangiopericytoma is a rare malignant vascular tumor deriving from pericytes. It usuallyoccurs in the extremities and retroperitoneum, and extremely rarely in the gastrointestinal tract. A case ofhemangiopericytoma in the gastroesophageal region is reported. A 56-year-old man was treated with H2-receptor antagonist for dyspeptic symptoms that had occurred three months before. Therapy failed toprove successful and gastroendoscopy was performed in March 2001 to reveal slightly reddish ventricularmucosa with normal rugal folds and a sessile, polypoid, grayish mass of rough surface located at the gastroe-sophageal junction. Histopathologic examination of polypoid mass samples revealed a vascular tumor cov-ered with squamous epithelium. The hallmarks of the tumor were numerous branching, slit-like capillarychannels with ‚staghorn™ appearance, and large gaping sinusoidal spaces enclosed within nests of ovoid cells.Vascular invasion, mitotic activity, giant cells and necrosis were not found. Immunohistochemical analysisshowed diffuse and strong reactivity for vimentin and focal, low or moderate reactivity for actin, S-100 andsmooth muscle actin. Proliferation index measured by PCNA and Ki-67 ranged from 2% to 13% (median11.2%) and from 5% to 18% (median 7.6%), respectively. A diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma with lowmalignant potential was made. Almost two years of the intervention, the patient is alive and free from anysigns of tumor spread.Key words: Esophageal neoplasms Œ pathology; Hemangiopericytoma Œ pathology; Hemangiopericytoma Œ immunochem-istry",

    "abstract": "Moždani udar u velikoj mjeri prate kognitivna ostecenja koja nerijetko ostaju trajna, te su uz motorne deficite uzrokom onesposobljenja osobe. Cilj naseg rada je bio analizirati ucestalost i znacajke spoznajnih ostecenja nakon moždanog udara. Uzorak je cinilo 50 bolesnika lijecenih na klinici za neurologiju KB Osijek s preboljelim moždanim udarom od kojega je proslo najmanje 6 mjeseci. Spoznajno je funkcioniranje procijenjneno Ravenovim progresivnim matricama (RPM, RCPM, neverbalni test intelektualnih sposobnosti), te ljestvicom MMS (Mini Mental State). Analizirali smo znacajke deficita s obzirom na spol, lateralizaciju mozgovnog ostecenja i tip đmoždanog udara. Kod vecine obrađenih bolesnika zabilježeni su kognitivni deficiti. Nije bilo razlika prema spolu i tipu moždanog udara, ali su zabilježene razlike u deficitima ostecenja s obzirom na lateralizaciju lezije. Rezultati potvrđuju prisutnost trajnih spoznajnih ostecenja nakon moždanog udara te ponovo isticu njihivo znacenje u procesu rehabilitacije bolesnika.",

    "abstract": "Epidemioloski podaci pokazuju da u nasoj zemlji MU predstavlja vodeci medicinski i javnozdravstveni problem. Iako nedostaju opsežnije populacijske epidemioloske studije, analize provedene na bolnickom materijalu u zadnjih petnaestak godina, ipak daju određenu sliku aktualnog stanja i ukazuju na nepovoljne trendove u obolijevanju i umiranju od ove bolesti. Postojeci sustav zbrinjavanja bolesnika sa MU-om ne zadovoljava potrebe i nije u skladu sa suvremenim trendovima u Europi i svijetu. Postoji realna potreba reorganizacije toga sustava. Jedna od mogucih opcija je priprema i provođenja Nacionalnog projekta prevencije i lijecenja moždanog udara, po uzoru na druge tranzicijske zemlje u Europi, koje imaju slicne probleme i epidemioloske pokazatelje. Strateske tocke toga projekta trebaju biti: a) analiza epidemiologije MU-a u Hrvatskoj sa osvrtom na regionalne razlike (populacijske studije, bolnicke studije, bolnicki registri MU-a), b) snižavanje incidencije MU-a boljom primarnom i sekundarnom prevencijom, c) snižavanje letaliteta, invaliditeta i mortaliteta od ove bolesti organizacijom jedinica za lijecenje MU-a i unaprijeđenjem sustava rehabilitacije bolesnika. U međuvremenu treba slijediti suvremene principe u dijagnostici, lijecenju i prevenciji MU-a, koji su prihvaceni u zapadnoeuropskim zemljama (12) i SAD, te koristiti pozitivna iskustva vodecih domacih neuroloskih strucnjaka koji se bave ovom problematikom. Pored toga, za lijecnike klinicare, od velikog su znacenja i pomoci “ Smjernice za lijecenje i prevenciju moždanog udara” koje izdaje Hrvatsko drustvo za neurovaskularne poremecaje.",

Patients who suffer a whiplash injury may have sprain and partial rupture of cervical musculature, sprain of the esophagus and larynx, lesions of temporomandibular joints, or injury of proprioception receptors located in the neck. The aim of the study was to estimate whether subjects who had suffered a whiplash injury experienced loss of proprioception, which was defined as the ability of repetitive predetermined head positioning. The study included 60 patients (age range 20-50 years) with whiplash injury and 60 asymptomatic age- and sex-matched control subjects. The patient ability to accomplish a defined head position during rightward and leftward cervical spine rotation at 30° angle was assessed by repeat measurements using Cervical Measurement System three months after medical treatment. The study showed the patients who had sustained a whiplash injury to have statistically significantly poorer results as compared with control subjects (p>0.001). Results of the study support the hypothesis that subjects with whiplash injury have worse perception of the head position, which may pose a disturbing problem in their daily activities.",

Dosadasnja istraživanja ukazuju na to da sum i vrtoglavica mogu biti prvi simptomi cerebrovaskularne bolesti, te da mogu nastati ostecenjem na bilo kojoj razini slusnog i vestibularnog puta. Vodeci rizicni cimbenici za cerebrovaskularne bolesti prisutni su i u bolesnika sa sumom/vrtoglavicom. Brza i usmjerena topodijagnosticka obrada bolesnika sa sumom i/ili vrtoglavicom omogucava pravodobno terapijsko djelovanje, a djelovanjem na utvrđene rizicne cimbenike smanjuje se rizik od napredovanja cerebrovaskularne bolesti. Studija na životinjama ukazuje na povoljan utjecaj betahistina na krvni protok u labirintu. Cilj ovoga rada bio je ispitati utjecaj betahistina na receptorni sum i sredisnju vrtoglavicu. Ispitali smo 20 osoba s receptornim sumom i sredisnjom vrtoglavicom u dobi od 30 do 60 godina. Ucinjena je cjelovita audioneuroloska obrada ukljucujuci doplerovu dijagnostiku karotidnog i vertebrobazilarnog sliva, te elektronistagmografija. Bolesnici su nakon dijagnosticke obrade uzimali betahistin oralno 3x16 mg kroz dva mjeseca. Desetero bolesnika je istodobno pohađalo funkcijsku terapiju suma u nasoj ustanovi. Rezultati pokazuju da se bolesnici na dijagnostiku obradu u prosjeku javljaju 8, 5 mjeseci od pocetka smetnja. Veci broj rizicnih cimbenika za cerebrovaskularnu bolest povecava vjerojatnost nastanka suma i vrtoglavice. Povoljno djelovanje betahistina ocituje se znacajnim ucinkom na nestanak vrtoglavice (u 14 od 20 bolesnika), te na ublažavanje suma, ali samo kod bolesnika ukljucenih u funkcijsku terapiju suma (u 6 od 10 bolesnika). Znacajnim cimbenikom za terapijski ucinak pokazalo se je i trajanje suma, jer se je kod dvoje bolesnika sa sumom kracim od mjesec dana postiglo uspjesno rjesavanje ove tegobe.",

    "abstract": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an adult-onset autosomal dominant disease with a worldwide distribution. It usually presents in the sixth decade with progressive dysphagia, ptosis and proximal limb weakness. Unique nuclear filament inclusions in skeletal muscle fibres are its pathologic hallmark. It is caused by stable (GCG)8-13 expansions in exon 1 of poly(A)-binding protein 2 gene (PABP2). (GCG)6 represents normal repeat length while (GCG)7 is a polymorphism that acts as a modifier of the disease severity or as a recessive mutation. More severe phenotypes were observed in compound heterozygotes for the (GCG)9 mutation and (GCG)7 allele that is found in 2% of the population. We report on the histological study in a 56-year old woman who had progressive eyelid dropping from the age of 48. She had mild dysphagia, hardly noticed opthalmoplegia and severe proximal limb girdle weakness that had started around the age of 56 when she had been hospitalized and found to have a myogenic pattern of EMG, high serum level of creatine kinase and stenocardia. Muscle biopsy was performed. The biopsy specimen was examined by light and electron microscopy. Tissue samples for light microscopy were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Electron microscopy samples were prepared according to standard procedure. Light microscopy showed normal arrangement and different thickness of muscle fibers. Examination of semi-thin sections showed the presence of a clear zone in some muscle fiber nuclei (intranuclear inclusions). On electron microscopy these inclusions were made of tubular filaments arranged in tangles or palisades. The filaments were seen in muscle fibers but not in the cytoplasm or other cells found in the samples. The muscle fibers had otherwise normal ultrastructure. The intranuclear inclusions are specific for oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. Several years later, DNA analysis confirmed the diagnosis of OPMD, finding her to be a compound heterozygote for (GCG)8 mutation and (GCG)7 allele of PABP2 gene. Until the identification of PABP2 gene mutations, definitive diagnosis relied on electron microscopy observation of intranuclear inclusions. Noninvasive DNA testing from peripheral blood has now replaced this approach. The test is reliable, can be done in Zagreb and permits accurate genetic counselling",

    "abstract": "The aim was to analyse regulation of growth and tissue differentiation in a unique in vitro model of gastrulating mammalian embryo by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) during two weeks. They both play a crucial role during embryogenesis and purpose of current study was to test their possible synergistic influence in the period when mammalian embryos are extremly sensitive on external factors. We cultivated 9, 5-days-old rat embryos on a metal grid supported lens paper, at air-liquid interface in culture medium (Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) with 50% of homologuos serum) with addition of FGF, NGF and combination of FGF and NGF in time frame of 9 days. Other 3 groups of embryos were 24 hours pretreated with 5-azacytidine (5-azaC), agent which can activate repressed genes. Parallel group of non-treated control embryos were cultivated with every experimental group. During 14 days of culture embryos grown in teratoma-like explants, and growth rate was evaluated by measuring average size of explants using an eyepiece micrometer on a few particular days (5, 7, 11, 14), after addition of growth factors. Differences between respected groups were estimated by Student's t-test.Differentiated tissues were estimated on serial histological sections. Chi-square test or Fischer exact test were used to compare the proportion of tissues between respected groups. In embryo derived teratomas NGF, and FGF/NGF combination used in time frame of 9 days did not stimulate differentiation of any kind of tissues, moreover FGF/NGF inhibited maturation of epidermis, while FGF stimulated differentiation of neural tissue, haemopoiesis and myotubes. We did not observe any kind of stimulative coooperative action of FGF and NGF in differentiation process. So it seems that NGF hinders the stimulating effect of FGF. NGF alone impaired growth of explants, but in combination with FGF acted synergistically, thus improving growth rate of cultivated embryos. Additional activation of gene with 5-azaC had no effect on possible NGF influence on neural tissue differentiation , but it resulted in improved myotubes differentiation. Activation of genes with FGF/5azaC signal as well as 5azaC/FGF/NGF combination improved the proportion of neural tissue and myotubes as well as haemopoieses. Obviously, these results confirm the role of FGF as neural inducer and mesoderm inducer. Anyway, FGF or NGF induced differentiation at least partially depend on status of gene methylation.",

Methods: study comprised 130 patients, with mean age of 67.33 years, who were treated in two hospitals: Department of neurology, University hospital Osijek and Department of neurology, General hospital Slavonski Brod. Diagnosis was established with brain computed tomography and other appropriate methods. Complications of disease and functional outcome, measured with modified Rankin scale, were analysed. Results: The most common complications of disease were urinar infection, especially in group of cardioembolic strokes and intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) (41.67% and 30.77%, respectively) and consciousness disturbances (33.33% and 69.23%, respectively). Functional deficit in 30-day period was the worst in patients with ICH and the best in patients with small vessel strokes (SVS). Functional improvement within 30-day period was the best in patients with SVS, and case-fatality was highest in ICH group (37.05%) . Conclusions: The comparison of outcome of different stroke subtypes in Eastern Croatia gave interesting and specific findings which are usefull for clinical prognosis and planing of the medical treatment and prevention of stroke.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate occurence of hyperlipidemia in patients (pts) with different types of stroke and to compare this occurrence in different parts of Croatia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study comprised 709 pts with stroke treated in three neurological centres in Croatia.We classified the pts in: ischemic stroke (IS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) groups. The level of cholesterol >6.5mmol/L and of triglycerides >2.00 mmol/L is classified as hyperlipidemia. RESULTS: Increased cholesterol was found in 41.2% of stroke pts in Osijek, 13.3% pts in Split and 31.5% pts in Zagreb. The difference between Osijek and Split was statistically significant ( x2=40.1, p<0.005). At the same time, increased triglycerides were found in 33.3% stroke pts in Osijek, 8.9% pts in Split and 13.9% pts in Zagreb. In group of IS subtype the highest level of cholesterol was found in Osijek (42.5%), lower in Zagreb (25.2%) and the lowest in Split (13.6%). Differences between Osijek and Split (x2=34.9, p<0.005) were statistically significant. At the same time, the highest level of trigycerides was found in Osijek (34.2%), lower in Zagreb (14.8%) and the lowest in Split (9.0%). In ICH group hypercholesterolemia was found in higher percentage in Zagreb (46.5%) and Osijek (37.9%) than in Split (7.4%). We found statistically significant difference between Osijek and Split (x2=5.7, p<0.005) .At the same time, hypertriglycidemia was the most frequent in Osijek (27.6%), followed by Zagreb (11.6%) and Split (3.7%). CONCLUSION: Our study showed significant regional differences in occurence of hyperlipidemia in Republic of Croatia, especially between continental part (Osijek, Zagreb) and coastal part (Split) of the country.",

This condition was first described in children, however, studies performed on adults have shown condition that is similar in many aspects. A case is presented of a 41-year-old female diabetic patient with abnormal liver tests and hepatomegaly. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed liver enlargement without any signs of fatty liver. Liver biopsy revealed a picture compatible with glycogenosis. As excessive hepatic glycogen deposition occured at an adult age and without a related family history, while the patient presented with normal mental and motor development, the diagnoses of Mauriac syndrome and hereditary glycogenoses were ruled out. The condition was attributed to insulin hyperdosage. The patinett was recommended improved glycemic control, more appropriate diet and physical exercise. On follow-up visit, 3 months of discharge from the hospital, significant hepatomegaly regression was demonstrated by palpation and ultrasonography, and was accompanied by normalization of serum aminotransferases, blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin. Elevated serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase with hepatomegaly as a consequence of hepatocellular glycogen accumulation can occur in diabetic patients of any age who are treated with high doses of insulin, and should therefore be included in the differential diagnosis.",

The study included 225 midwives; during the period from December 2015 to February 2016, they completed a 16-item web-based survey using the SurveyMonkey software available on the Croatian Midwives Chamber site. In total 277 participants started to fill out the survey and 225 participants responded to all 16 questions. Demographic, educational and professional characteristics of the participants in this survey are provided. Distri-bution of participant responses to questions regarding basic reproductive endocrinology, unplanned pregnancies and emergency contraception clearly revealed important gaps in the group knowledge. There was evident gap in the knowledge about emergency contraception in the study group of Croa-tian midwives. Having in mind the study group grounds in gynecology and obstetrics, and their public health relevance, targeted educational activities both during midwife formal education and on-job are required to improve the group knowledge about emergency contraception. National guidelines on oral emergency contraception are an at hand learning tool and the most appropriate local source of information on emergency contraception. Various initiatives should be considered for this document to become an integral part of formal midwife education and regular part of their on-job trainings.",

Visual evoked potentials showed prechiasmal dysfunction of the left optic nerve.Genetical testing for Fabry disease was positive (two heterozygous mutations), with decreased alpha galactosidase activity values and increased Lyso GB3 values.Th e patient received corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone) 1 g for 5 days, which led to regression of visual disturbances on the left eye.After this acute treatment, there was a question of defi nitive diagnosis and further treatment of the underlying cause.Considering renal dysfunction, miscarriage, arterial hypertension, positive genetic and biochemical testing for Fabry disease, as well as MRI fi ndings showing lesions in posterior circulation, we concluded that the patient probably had Fabry disease with autoinfl ammatory changes in the CNS and should be treated with enzyme replacement therapy.Still, there was a question of optic neuritis on the left eye and positive oligoclonal bands favoring the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.Th erefore, further clinical and neuroradiological follow up was needed to distinguish multiple sclerosis and Fabry disease in this patient.",

Data were used to produce time series for two vectors of the phase space and spatial axis: X (left-right), Y (up-down) and Z (ventral-dorsal). Time series were evaluated by calculating fractal dimension by the R/S algorithm. Movement of the electric field along the Y-axis showed changes (up-down) extracted in the first and second quarter of the measurement (p=0.02 and p=0.03, respectively). These changes were not specific for gender but showed dependence on subject age and fitness. The fractal dimension values by the R/S algorithm were larger in female subjects. Results suggested the electric field changes during EBV in the up-down direction to contain information on muscular performance and fatigue, not dependent on gender, but on the age and degree of overall physical fitness.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the duration of exposure to solar radiation (expressed in years) on the incidence of positive cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) finding in conjunctival tissue in two groups of patients. Group 1 consisted of 68 patients with primary pterygium having undergone conjunctival autograft transplantation. Group 2 consisted of 43 patients with morphologically unchanged conjunctivae that were harvested during cataract surgery. All 111 specimens were submitted to immunohistochemical staining for monoclonal COX-2 antibody (1:100; M361701 MO A-HU, Dako, Santa Clara, California, USA). The immunostaining intensity in the surface epithelium was scored using the following grading system: 0 no immunostaining; + weak immunostaining (few cells being positive focally or scattered); ++ medium immunostaining; and +++ strong immunostaining (diffuse staining throughout the tissue). The analysis of COX-2 activity yielded 29 (42.6%) positive findings in group 1 and 27 (62.8%) positive findings in group 2. Group 2 consisted of statistically significantly older individuals with a history of considerably longer sun exposure. Statistical analysis proved the duration of exposure to solar radiation to be the most important factor in positive COX-2 findings.",

The most common orbital tumors were lipomas, meningiomas and lymphomas, with a peak incidence in the seventh decade of life. Most orbital tumors of childhood are distinguished from those occurring in adults. Most pediatric orbital tumors are benign (developmental cysts, capillary hemangioma, hamartoma), with a peak incidence in the first decade of life. Orbital tumors show a bimodal age distribution. Benign orbital tumors are more common than the malignant ones. Rhabdomyosarcoma (embryonal type) is the most common orbital malignancy in childhood, and lymphoma in adults. Orbital pseudotumors is a term that has been widely accepted to describe inflammatory lesions of the orbital tissue with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with a varying grade of fibrosis. Histologic classification of orbital pseudotumors is presented. Orbital pseudotumors occur predominantly in older individuals and are infrequent in children and young individuals. These imply a nonspecific inflammatory process of unknown etiology, and have been included as part of the differential diagnosis of orbital tumors.",

There are two major endoscopic treatments of gastroesophageal varices: endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). EIS and EVL alone are equally effective in controlling acute variceal bleeding, however, EVL is superior to EIS because it achieves variceal obliteration faster and with a lower rate of complications and rebleeding. Considering combined technique of EVL and EIS, it appears that initial EVL followed by long-term EIS on later sessions, when banded varices have become smaller, probably is a wiser approach for safe and longlasting variceal eradication. Histoacryl as a tissue glue is the only endoscopic treatment that has been proved to be effective for gastric varices. The use of endoscopic clips alone in the treatment of varices remains uncommon. The role of endoscopic ultrasound increases in the evaluation of portal hypertension, and it may gain a role in choosing an optimal treatment approach for individual patients.",

The aim of thestudy was to present the main characteristics and to highlight the problems encountered in metastatic bonetumor biopsy. Data from the Thanatos database for the period from January 1, 1998 till December 31, 2001,were used. Pathohistologic analysis was done on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and hematoxylin-eosinstained tissue. Decalcification was done with nitric acid. There were 78 patients with metastatic bonetumors, 47 (60.3%) male and 31 (39.7%) female. The most common site of metastases was vertebral col-umn (74.4%). Based on the history data, pathohistologic analysis and immunohistochemical staining, theorigin of metastatic tumor was identified in 73 (93.6%) cases. The most common origins were cancers of thebreast, kidney, lungs and prostate. The main characteristics of metastatic tumors were as expected andconsistent with literature data, whereas inadequate cooperation between clinicians and pathologists wasidentified as the most obvious problem.Key words: Bone neoplasms, diagnosis; Bone neoplasms, pathology; Neoplasm metastasis, diagnosis; Bone neoplasms, sec-ondary; Biopsy",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY Œ The ultimate goal of successful rehabilitation of the knee joint is to achieve normal move-ment of the knee joint and to re-establish active muscle control in the shortest time possible. The kneejoint movement during rehabilitation can be objectively measured by using a goniometer. The recovery offemoral muscles after a knee joint injury can be accurately and precisely monitored by ultrasonic measure-ment of the muscular volume. The aim of this longitudinal study was to standardize and evaluate themethod of ultrasonographic measurement of muscular volume itself, and practical applicability of the meth-od, in order to reach a general conclusion on the femoral muscle rehabilitation. The measurements wereperformed at equal intervals in 30 subjects with a history of knee joint injury, and in 30 asymptomaticsubjects as a control group. The results showed that the ultrasound method could precisely and accuratelymonitor the process of muscular atrophy that develops during immobilization, as well as the course ofmuscular restitution during physical therapy. Full recovery of the rectus femoris muscle was achieved inmore than a half of the patients, i.e. 54.4 per cent of women and 53.8 per cent of men. Vastus intermediusmuscle responded less readily to physical therapy. Full recovery was achieved in 22.2 per cent of female and28.6 per cent of male patients. Within the same intervals, no muscular mass changes were recorded in thecontrol group. Prior to implementation, it is necessary to precisely determine the reproducibility of themethod and measurement errors. The ultrasound method has good reproducibility because the error doesnot exceed 2 per cent of the measurement value. However, practical application of ultrasonic measurementis not simple, because it requires experience and procedure standardization.Key words: Muscles, diagnosis; Muscles, ultrasonography; Wounds and injuries, diagnosis; Knee, physiology",

    "abstract": "This year, the whole world is celebrating the musicalgenius of Giuseppe Verdi, probably the greatest operacomposer in the history of music.Giuseppe Verdi was born in 1813 to a country inn-keeper, by coincidence in the very same year as RichardWagner, the greatest German opera composer. His fatherwas not able to provide Verdi the education he aspired for.So he turned to his benefactor Barezzi, who had greatunderstanding for his musical talent. Verdi marriedMargherita, Barezzi’s daughter. Margherita later diedfrom meningitis and both their children died from infan-tile enteric diseases typical for the time, which Verdi tookto his heart very much.Local organist Cavaletti gave him his first instrument,a small spinet which was renovated especially for him.Slowly he realized that his native town, Busetto, inhib-ited him, so he moved to Milan where he was not admit-ted to the conservatory.His first opera AObertoA was performed in 1839, whenhe was 26 years old, and his first real success was ANabuccoAin 1842, which made him a favorite of the whole Italy. Verdipreferred secluded rather than pompous life, as he neededpeace and quiet for his creativity. He settled down in thebeautiful place of Sant’Agata. There he stayed for almosthalf of his life with his friend and wife-to-be, GiuseppinaStreponi. In 1847, he composed AMacbethA. Around 1850,his three romantic masterpieces, ARigolettoA, AIl TrovatoreAand ALa TraviattaA, were performed. They finally broughthim lasting international recognition of his work, follow-ing his first national success. Later operas were not sosuccesful, still including ADon CarlosA and AMasqueradeA.Nearing his sixties, Verdi gave the world his masterpieceAAidaA, a spectacular opera including many of his most lyricinspirations. In 1874, after the death of the writer Manzoni,whom Verdi deeply respected, he composed one of his rarenonopera works, ARequiemA. When after AAidaA his workseemed to be completed, he started to cooperate withformer Wagner’s follower Boito, who was an excellent li-brettist and composer himself. So he got two outstandinglibrettos and composed his final pearls, AOthelloA at the ageof 75, and finally AFalstaffA at the age of 80. He spent hiseighties all alone after death of his wife.Giuseppe Verdi was rather introverted but it only cov-ered his real ambitions and self-esteem. He was a ratheruncoventional, independent and quarrelsome person, oftenfull of rage. He had a strong character but also frequentnoncreative periods. As a person, he was mostly healthy andcalm, somewhat depressive. He was of asthenic and thinappearance, and pox-marked · the reason why he alwayshad his beard. During his life, he had few long periods ofheadache and frequently sore throat. He suffered from ner-vous gastric troubles and rheumatic pains, which worsenedwith time in his limbs and spine. In 1877, he asked formedical help in Monte Carlo because of chronic bronchi-tis. He started to have frequent short episodes of dizziness.Just before he performed AFalstaffA, he almost died frominfluenza. After his second wife had died, he was desper-ately lonely, spending most of the time in spa. He did some",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important imaging technique for evaluation of cerebral ischemic changes. Using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), both large and medium sized intracranial arteries and veins can be visualized by selecting appropriate imaging parameters. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate our own results in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases with MRI and MRA, and to compare them with literature data. Data on 278 patients with cerebrovascular symptomatology (158 female and 120 male, mean age 45.54 years), examined between April 2001 and November 2002, were analyzed. MRA was performed in all 278, and both MRA and MRI in 231 patients. On MRA, 90 pathologic alterations of intracranial arteries (69 aneurysms and 21 vascular malformations), 13 intracranial arterial occlusions, 19 intracranial arterial stenoses, and 14 cases of intracranial arteriosclerotic changes were identified. On MRI, 114 strokes (73 brain infarctions, 22 cerebral hemorrhages and 19 subarachnoid hemorrhages), 14 vascular malformations and 14 cases of small vessel disease were detected. MRI was found to be a powerful tool to detect ischemic lesions immediately upon stroke onset. MRA is highly sensitive for the detection of occlusive disease in large intracranial arteries. For cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis, MRI and MRA are first line studies. MRA of extracranial and intracranial vessels alone or in combination with transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCD) as well as computed tomography angiography (CTA) may eliminate the need of intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in most patients studied for occlusive cerebrovascular disease. DSA may be reserved for those patients in whom there is a disagreement among the results obtained by use of noninvasive techniques, and for the diagnosis of arteriovenous malformations, whereas MRA can prove useful on follow-up examinations.",

A total of 50 patients with symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction caused by smaller benign prostates (estimated weight 30 g or less) were assigned to TUIP. Bilateral incision at i5 and 7i oiclock position was performed in all patients. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation included total urinary symptom score (I-PSS), uroflowmetry, patient overall assessment of surgery outcome, and sexual function questionnaire. The mean follow-up time was 66 months (6 to 108 months). Improvements in the mean urinary peak flow rates were observed in all cases. Postoperative total as well as irritation and obstructive symptom scores decreased significantly. All of 28 patients who had been sexually active before surgery retained their sexual activity after surgery, and only one (3.6%) of these had retrograde ejaculation. In comparison to other studies, where patients with bladder outlet obstruction caused by small prostate underwent classic transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), TUIP appeared to be faster, technically easier, and associated with lower morbidity. The results of this study clearly demonstrated TUIP to be an effective treatment for bladder outlet obstruction caused by small prostates in all patients, especially younger men, those with normal sexual activity, and patients at high operative risk. The method showed comparably good longterm outcome as TURP, but with less complications.",

The aim of the study was to compare some colorectal cancer features (age and sex distribution, anatomic localization, and survival) during fourteen years, in order to assess the possible changing trends of these disease during the observed period and to compare observed data with our previous study published in 1985 as well as with similar colorectal cancer features reported worldwide. The mean age of patients with right-sided carcinomas was slightly higher than in patients with left-sided colorectal carcinomas (65.9 vs. 65.2). Sex distribution showed male predominance (57.3% vs. 42.7%). Males and females had similar anatomic distribution. Recto-sigmoid was the most common site (77.9%) followed by transverse colon cancers (6.8%), ascending colon cancers (6.5%), cancers in cecum (6.2%) and descending colon cancers (2.6%). In the last four years of the observed period (1999 to 2002) the incidence of right-sided cancers was increased compared to the previous period. Our study showed a continuing trend of the increased incidence of rightsided carcinomas that is similar with reports from western European countries and North America.

Patients whose tumors show overexpression of HER-2/neu have shortened disease-free and overall survival. The aim of this study was to determinate immunohistochemistry HER-2/neu overexpression in 121 cases of primary breast cancer. In addition HER-2/neu status was correlated with hormone receptor status, grades and pTNM stage. The both groups of HER-2/neu negative and HER-2/neu positive patients were average ages of about 60 years. In all the HER-2/neu groups (negative, 1+, 2+ and 3+) estrogen and progesterone receptor were highly positive in a high percentage of cases. Also in both groups of HER-2/neu negative and HER-2/neu positive invasive ductal carcinoma the most common grades were 2, but in HER-2/neu 3+ group, there were also 30.0% of cases having grade 3. Our results show that there might be a correlation between HER2/neu overexpression and higher grade of breast cancer. The two most common pTNM stages were T1N0MX and T2N1MX. HER-2/neu receptor is important therapeutic target and testing for HER-2/neu status is now recommended as a part of routine breast cancer diagnosis.

    "abstract": "SUMMARY • A majority of growth hormone secreting pituitary adenomas respond well to soma-tostatin and somatostatin analogues. The acute action of octreotide, a synthetic somatostatin ana-logue, on growth hormone secretion was assessed in 42 patients with clinically and laboratory veri-fied acromegaly. Octreotide was administered subcutaneously in a dose of 50 µg. Blood samplingwas performed at 1-hour intervals during 6 hours of testing. The mean basal values of growth hor-mone (χ±SE) was 26.3±4.5 ng/ml (range 6.1-66.6 ng/ml), and of IGF-I 2940±171.7 IU/l (range2350-4856 IU/l). Reduction in growth hormone values below 5 ng/ml was recorded in 31 (73.8%),suppression by more than 50% in 5 (11.9%) and by more than 45% in 3 (7.1%) patients. Maximalsuppression was noticed in the first two hours of testing. In 3 (7.1%) patients, resistance to octreotidewith no change in growth hormone values was observed. In conclusion, octreotide reduces growthhormone values in most acromegalic patients. A small proportion of acromegalic patients do notrespond well to octreotide, probably due to the lack of somatostatin receptors on tumor cells. Weconsider the acute octreotide test as a very useful tool in triage of acromegalic patients eligible formedicamentous treatment.Key words:",

There are numerous states and diseases associ- ated with osteoporosis. The aim of the study was to assess the presumed association between hypercortisolism and osteoporosis. Some recent studies provided evidence for association between previous history of MDD and marked osteoporosis. In MDD, there are two well documented bio- chemical abnormalities, hypercortisolism and its resistance to dexamethasone suppression. The present study included 31 MDD patients (19 male and 12 female), mean age 37±1.3, age range 29-41 years, and 17 healthy male volunteers, mean age 39±1.6, age range 34-45 years. The levels of free cortisol in 24-h urine, serum cortisol at 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., and cortisol in dexamethasone suppression test as well as bone mineral density were measured in all study subjects. The results obtained were analyzed by use of Spearman's nonparametric rank correlation, rho=-0.805, with a statistical significance level of p<0.01 (2-tailed). Study results suggested that patients with a long-term history of depression may develop a severe form of osteoporosis. Also, a severe form of osteoporosis has been known to develop in patients with untreated Cushing's syndrome.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY ∑ Amenorrhea is one of the most common symptoms in the woman’s health pathology. It can be caused by anatomical defects of the outflow tract (uterus, cervix, vagina), thus being in the gynecologist’s domain, or can be observed in gonadal dysgenesis (Turner’s syndrome), hypopituitarism (Sheehan’s syndrome), prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors, Cushing’s syndrome, hyperthyroidism, stress, anorexia nervosa, polycystic ovaries, and in women upon discontinuation of oral contraceptives, especially if they have a history of prior menstrual irregularities. Endocrine abnormalities may also be due to changes in target tissue responses to hormones. These disorders can occur by a variety of mechanisms. Endocrine glands may be injured or destroyed by neoplasia, infections, hemorrhage, autoimmune disorders, and many other causes. Menopause, pregnancy and lactation are the most common causes of ammenorrhea. Hypothalamic lesions resulting in impaired secretion of releasing hormones may manifest themselves by pituitary dysfunction, which in turn leads to functional abnormalities of its various target organs. Extraglandular disorders can result in hormone deficiency and become manifest with amenorrhea as one of the symptoms. Assessment of the patient’s endocrine status relies on the findings from the history, physical examination and laboratory testing. The latter can include measurement of hormone levels of their metabolites in plasma or urine either in basal state or in response to provocative testing. For endocrine deficiency syndromes, hormones are generally administered to counteract the deficiency. In hormone excess syndromes, a variety of approaches have been used. Hyperfunctioning tumors are removed when possible, and sometimes hyperplastic glands are extirpated. In other cases, drugs are given to block hormone production. Menopause related osteoporosis is the leading health problem associated with amenorrhea and should be treated as early as possible, i.e. from the beginning of the period of menses disappearance.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n The aim of the study was to investigate the attitude towards alcoholism and patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, and to assess the knowledge of pathophysiology and treatment of ascites in liver cirrhosis in the physicians from hospitals in Atlanta and Zagreb. Internists and internal medicine residents were asked to fill-out a questionnaire containing 14 questions on the attitude towards alcoholism and patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, and on the knowledge of ascites pathophysiology and treatment. The study was conducted at University Departments of Medicine at Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital and Zagreb University Hospital Center from Zagreb, Croatia (n=40), and Emory School of Medicine from Atlanta, Georgia, USA (n=30). In the Zagreb group, there were significantly more internists (p=0.025) with significantly more years of specialist service (p=0.006). Significant difference between the two groups was recorded in their answers to questions on alcoholism (p=0.006), correct concept of pathophysiology of ascites formation (p<0.001), cardiac output in liver cirrhosis (p<0.001), plasma aldosterone concentration on upright posture test in preascitic liver cirrhosis (p=0.030), atrial natriuretic peptide (p<0.001), therapeutic impact of spironolactone (p=0.005), and paracentesis (p=0.009), as well as in the frequency of correct answers to questions on alcoholism (p=0.002), cardiac output in liver cirrhosis (p=0.001) and plasma aldosterone concentration on upright posture test in preascitic liver cirrhosis (p=0.005), with the Zagreb group scoring worse and, according to sex, also in the knowledge of the century of Leonardo da Vinciis birth (p=0.018). Negative attitude towards alcoholism and alcoholic cirrhosis in the Zagreb respondents, and the lack of knowledge about the basic pathophysiologic mechanism of ascites formation and new treatment algorithms in liver cirrhosis were recorded in both groups. The attitude and knowledge influence treatment decisions. The cliniciansi knowledge about the effectiveness of a novel or established treatment protocol including modification in the indications or method and its timing is indispensable.",

    "abstract": "Although nonsustained ventricular tachycardia after myocardial infarction may be associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death, there are no clear guidelines as to which is the most effective management of this arrhythmia. In this paper, we present our experience in the treatment of patients with asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, prior myocardial infarction, and left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, based on electropharmacological testing performed in 130 patients. Eighty-two of them had noninducible, and 48 inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Patients with noninducible ventricular tachycardia were randomized to treatment with no antiarrhythmogenic drugs (n=46) or beta-blockers (n=36). Among patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia, 23 were treated with electropharmacologically guided drug therapy, and 25 with drugs slowing inducible ventricular tachycardia. During a mean follow-up period of 24 months, seven patients died suddenly, five survived cardiac arrest, and 12 suffered nonsudden death. The overall incidence of sudden cardiac death and total mortality were significantly higher in patients with inducible than in those with noninducible ventricular tachycardia. The incidence of sudden cardiac death at 2 years was 33% in patients with inducible and nonsuppressible ventricular tachycardia, 7% in patients with inducible and electropharmacologically guided therapy, 9% in patients with noninducible ventricular tachycardia treated without drugs, and 8% in patients with noninducible ventricular tachycardia treated with beta-blockers. In conclusion, patients with asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, prior myocardial infarction, ejection fraction <40%, and excluded active ischemia should be submitted to electropharmacological testing. Patients with noninducible ventricular tachycardia may be followed with no drugs. Patients with inducible and suppressible ventricular tachycardia may be treated by effective drug if their ejection fraction is higher than that recorded in the Multicenter UnSustained Tachycardia Trial population. Patients with inducible and nonsuppressible ventricular tachycardia are candidates for cardioverter-defibrillator implantation, because they are at a high risk of sudden cardiac death.",

The six-month study included 20 patients of which 19 completed the study (one patient was excluded due to allergic drug reaction). All patients had previously received local antiglaucoma therapy. Because of local undesired side effects and inadequate control of intraocular pressure they were switched to treatment with 1.0% brinzolamide as monotherapy. Intraocular pressure was measured on the day of therapy introduction, and then at 15 days, one month, three months and six months of therapy. Nineteen patients successfully completed the sixmonth study. A clinically significant decrease in the intraocular pressure was recorded. The difference in intraocular pressure between the baseline (23.8 ‐ 2.4), and 15-day (18.2 ‐ 2.8), one-month (18.2 ‐ 2.7), three-month (18.5 ‐ 2.9) and six-month (18.8 ‐ 3.2) levels was statistically significant (p<0.001). Deviation from the mean values of intraocular pressure was considered as standard deviation. Local side effects such as scratching and pricking were recorded in three patients, however, there were no systemic or other side effects. Results of the study suggested monotherapy with 1.0% brinzolamide ( b.i.d.) to be successful in the regulation of intraocular pressure in patients with primary or secondary glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n Chronic venous insufficiency is a major health and socioeconomic issue throughout the world. Some 2%-5% of the adult population suffer from chronic venous insufficiency, while about 1% of the European population have chronic leg ulceration. The role of retrograde blood flow through incompetent perforating veins has an important role in the development of chronic venous insufficiency. Duplex ultrasound imaging is the preferred diagnostic tool, which is used to confirm the presence of bidirectional flow through the perforators adjacent to the areas of lipodermatosclerosis, healed ulcers and open ulcerations, i.e. in patients with chronic venous insufficiency CEAP class 4, 5 and 6. Subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery (SEPS) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure, which is the treatment of choice in these patients. The endoscope and surgical instruments are introduced through skin incisions that are distant from the areas of skin changes. The perforating veins are excellently visualized, while clipping and dividing the perforators interrupt retrograde blood flow. In patients with insufficiency of the superficial venous system, ligation and stripping of the superficial veins are usually performed at the same time. The lesser saphenous vein can be occluded with SEPS itself. The healing time with SEPS is substantially decreased when compared with conventional treatment and carries low complication and recurrence rates. However, SEPS should be offered to selected patients, i.e. to those with chronic venous insufficiency CEAP class 4, 5 and 6.",

    "abstract": "∑ Interstitial lung diseases and related difficulties that a clinician encounters in daily practice are presented. The disease may be of known origin, such as postirradiation pneumonitis, pneumoconioses, allergic alveolitis, etc., or of unascertainable origin, such as sarcoidosis and systemic diseases with multiple organ involvement, e.g., Goodpasture’s syndrome. In the article, particular reference is made to sarcoidosis and cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis. Interstitial diseases are still classified and referred to as (abbrev.) UIP, NSIP, DIP, LIP, BOOP and AIP. Both AIP and UIP are considered to have poor prognosis. This is a modification of Liebow’s classification. The World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders has proposed guidelines for the follow-up of patients with these diseases. The recommended methods include bronchoalveolar lavage, angiotensin-converting enzyme determination, gallium scan (of the whole body or of the lungs), and high-resolution computed tomography. These parameters, along with clinical evaluation, and immunologic and functional tests, should prove adequate in most cases, while the rest of unresolved cases should be considered for either bronchoscopic transbronchial or surgical (thoracoscopic or open lung) biopsy. Most of our patients were treated with steroids, and only some 25% of them improved without this therapy. The patients treated with steroids responded to treatment without major side effects, with the exception of two patients who failed to respond favorably to this therapy. One of these two patients, however, had to be treated with low-dose steroids for more than ten years. New methods such as high-resolution computed tomography, along with the established ones such as gallium scan, help in the diagnosis of early stages of interstitial involvement, so that steroid therapy can be initiated on time, which is of crucial importance for prevention of the disease progression to the irreversible fibrotic stage. Prospective trials are needed to find new diagnostic and therapeutic methods based on novel concepts on the disease etiology.",

Computed tomography (CT) scan at admission indicated cerebral edema and subdural hematoma. Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 5, and his pupils were 4 mm in diameter without response. Decompression craniotomy with evacuation of hematoma was performed, and a ventricular catheter was introduced for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. After the operation, there was no change in the neurologic status. ICP/CPP and jugular vein oxygen saturation (SvjO2) were continuously monitored and data were collected in hour-to-hour manner. Therapeutic goal was to optimize ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in accordance with the Guidelines for the Management of Severe Head Injury. Mannitol and barbiturates were not used in therapeutic procedures. Normocapnic values of PCO2 were maintained. During the first six hours postoperatively, the patient was stabilized hematologically and hemodynamically. At 24 hours postoperatively, there was no improvement in the neurologic status in spite of optimal values of ICP/CPP and SvjO2: GCS 5, pupils 4 mm with no response. The reason for this was detected on 24-hour CT scan, which revealed thalamic and pontine hemorrhage (mesencephalon lesion) with ischemia in the occipital region.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY ∑ The aim of the study was to determine the possible association between the duration of diabetes mellitus and prevalence of ischemic stroke. Also, the effect of hyperglycemia in the acute phase of ischemic stroke on short-term outcome of stroke was studied. Study group consisted of 429 patients hospitalized at our department for ischemic stroke during 12 consecutive months. The diagnosis and type of diabetes were established on the basis of pre-stroke history data and confirmed by consultant diabetologist (glucose monitoring by repeated blood tests). The diagnosis and outcome of brain infarction were assessed on the basis of clinical and neuroimaging criteria. Hyperglycemia was recorded in 95 patients with ischemic stroke (22.1% of all cases); 72 of them had the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus established prior to stroke (type 1 in nine, and type 2 in 63 patients). There were 63 females and 42 males, mean age 68.6±7.8 years. Hypertension was an additional risk factor for stroke in 87.4%, while elevated blood cholesterol was found in only 31.1% of patients. Brain imaging showed territorial infarction in 46 cases of ischemic stroke, followed by 21 cases of lacunar infarction, and hemodynamic stroke in two cases. Diabetes of ♢6 years of duration was associated with a higher rate of ischemic stroke than the shorter diabetes duration of up to 5 years (50 vs 22 patients). Further analysis revealed a significant difference in stroke prevalence between the patients with type 2 diabetes duration of 6-10 and ♢11 years (p<0.01); in the group of patients with longest diabetes duration, the presence of this disease facilitated the occurrence of stroke. The functional outcome of stroke as assessed by the Modified Rankin Scale showed a more severe functional deficit in the group of patients with hyperglycemia (Rankin 0 and 1 in 7.4%, Rankin 2 and 3 in 28.7%, and Rankin 4 and 5 in 35.2% of all cases) than in the group of ischemic stroke patients without hyperglycemia (Rankin 0 and 1 in 24.2%, Rankin 2 and 3 in 27.4%, and Rankin 4 and 5 in 26.2% of all cases). The case fatality rate was higher in the former than in the latter group of patients (28.7% vs 22.2% of all cases). Diabetes was found to be an important risk factor for ischemic stroke. Prolonged duration of diabetes had greater impact on the occurrence of stroke than shorter duration of the disease. The presence of hyperglycemia in the acute phase of stroke aggravates the final outcome of ischemic stroke. Thus, early detection and management of hyperglycemia should be considered important measures for the prevention of stroke.",

The following laboratory parameters were monitored: leukocyte count, erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, thrombin time, and fibrinolysis. Data were statistically analyzed by Student’s t-test for dependent and independent samples, and by simple correlation. The results showed prothrombin time to be statistically significantly reduced postoperatively in both patient groups, while fibrinolysis was statistically significantly accelerated in the group of patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. Accordingly, in patients administered blood transfusion during the surgery, fibrinolysis was statistically significantly accelerated in comparison with their preoperative values. In the group of patients who did not receive intraoperative blood transfusion, fibrinolysis remained within the physiological range.",

The patient presented with a rapidly enlarging mass in the left thyroid lobe. Cytologic analysis suggested a poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Total thyroidectomy was performed. On gross examination, a poorly circumscribed, gray-white tumor measuring up to 5.5 cm in the largest diameter was found. Light microscopy showed atypical, large epithelial cells forming solid islands and nests with variable, focal production of mucin and up to 5 mitotic figures per 10 highpower fields. Squamous cell foci without keratinization were also observed. Tumor cells were immunohistochemically negative for thyroglobulin and calcitonin, and positive for cytokeratin. Electron microscopy showed squamous cells with intracytoplasmic aggregates of tonofilaments, well-developed desmosomal attachments and mucous cells characterized by numerous mucin granules. Six months after the initial treatment, ipsilateral radical neck dissection revealed 25 positive out of 44 lymph nodes. Computed tomography performed a month later revealed a large tumor located behind the larynx, compressing the trachea, with retrosternal spread into the mediastinum. The patient underwent radiotherapy for a widespread metastatic disease. We think that primary thyroid mucoepidermoid carcinoma may show an aggressive clinical course.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY ∑ Stroke is known to be most common in the elderly. Rheologic factors play an important role in the cerebral flow regulation and distinctly correlate with the atherosclerotic process. The aim of this study was to assess the degree to which rheologic changes were related to the age of patients with acute cerebral ischemia. The study included 26 patients and 12 control subjects. Patients were divided into two age groups: ♢70 (n=11, mean age 77.8) and ≤60 (n=15, mean age 52.3) years. The following hemorheologic parameters were observed: blood viscosity (BV), plasma viscosity (PV), hematocrit (Htc), red cell deformability (RCD), internal erythrocyte viscosity (IEV), red cell aggregation (RCA), and fibrinogen concentration. Hemorheologic factors were estimated during the first 48 hours and after 3 weeks of disease onset. BV, PV, RCA, IEV and fibrinogen were significantly elevated, whereas Htc and RCD were significantly decreased in the ♢70-year group as compared with control subjects. Relative to the ≤60-year group, patients from the ♢70-year group showed significantly higher values of BV, PV, IEV and RCA, and significantly lower values of RCD and Htc. The hemorheologic profile at 3 weeks from stroke onset was similar to that recorded in the acute phase. Results of the study indicated that hemorheologic changes in patients with cerebral ischemia were clearly dependent on the patient age.",

It can help to minimize the number of invasive angiograms and facilitate fast diagnostic work-up of stroke patients. Clinical recovery in tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) treated patients is associated with early complete recanalization. Dramatic clinical recovery during TPA infusion was seen in 20% of patients when TPA was combined with continuous TCD monitoring of the occlusion site. Ultrasonic energy transmission by TCD monitoring may expose more clot surface to residual blood flow and thus facilitate thrombolysis.",

The data of 91 patients with symptomatic carotid disease, who underwent ultrasound first, followed by DSA were evaluated. Color Doppler criteria were previously set for four categories of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis: mild, moderate, severe and occlusion. DSA categorised the ICA stenosis in the same categories. Spearman's Rank Correaltion Coefficient was calculated. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient between ultrasound and angiography in detecting various degree of carotid stenosis was 0.86. Ultrasonographic criteria for severe ICA stenosis detection showed sensitivity 75%, specificity 98%, false positive ratio 20%, false negative ratio 25%, positive predictive value 95%, negative predictive value 85% and accurate diagnosis 88%. Ultrasonographic criteria for ICA occlusion showed sensitivity 82%, specificity 98%, false positive ratio 10%, false negative ratio 18%, positive predictive value 94%, negative predictive value 95% and accurate diagnosis 95%. Our combination of various ultrasonographic parameters was sensitive for detection of various degrees of carotid stenosis, with a very high specificity, enabling high positive predictive values for such classification. A lower sensitivity was obtained due to lower sensitivity of angiography in detecting minimal flow in near-occluded ICA's.",

This prospective longitudinal study included 77 patients who were selected from the initial cohort evaluated in 2007 and 2008. We examined reversibility of lipoatrophy measured by ultrasound over at least five-year period and factors related to its reversibility. All 46 patients who used stavudine switched from stavudine to another combination. Of 58 patients on zidovudine, 16 (28%) were on a zidovudine based regimen at the second follow up. There was evidence for subcutaneous fat increase in the malar area (p<0.001) and no increase in the brachial and crural areas. Patients who were smokers and had poor adherence to the Mediterranean diet had a thinner malar area at the follow up measurement (p=0.030) and smaller increase in subcutaneous malar fat compared to others (p=0.040). Our study suggested that modest increase of subcutaneous fat in malar area coincided with stopping stavudine and fewer usage of zidovudine. Lifestyle with non-adherence to the Mediterranean diet and smoking were associated with a smaller increase in subcutaneous malar fat.",

Several prognostic factors have been shown to correlate with lymph node metastasis, including depth of myometrial invasion, cervical infiltration, histologic grade of the tumor, tumor diameter, histology type, lymphovascular invasion, and positive peritoneal cytology. The aim of the study was to identify the histopathologic parameters that would indicate with greater certainty the possibility of metastases into lymph nodes, which would serve as a basis to assess whether patients should undergo lymphadenectomy or not. This retrospective study included patients with endometrial cancer having undergone surgery at the Oncology Institute of Vojvodina during the 2012-2018 period. The study included 120 patients having undergone hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Among patients who had lymph node metastases, there were statistically significantly more patients (p<0.01) with endometrial cancer histologic type 2, depth of myometrial invasion greater than 50%, cervical stroma infiltration, lymphovascular invasion, and positive peritoneal cytology. In conclusion, histopathologic parameters such as type 2 endometrial cancer, myometrial invasion depth greater than 50%, cervical stroma infiltration, lymphovascular invasion and positive peritoneal cytology increased the likelihood of lymph node metastases. Tumor size (>2 cm), as well as histologic grade did not correlate with a higher incidence of lymph node metastases. In this study, both parametrial infiltration and the number of lymph nodes removed were found to have clinical relevance but not statistical significance.",

In recent years, regional anesthesia for spinal surgery has gained a great popularity, where neuraxial blocks are the first choice. Regional anesthesia seems to have benefits against general anesthesia due to lower rate of perioperative and postoperative complications, lower cost and length of stay. This is more evident in elderly population or patients with comorbidities. On the other hand, difficult airway is the life threatening condition and requires increased attention. There are many methods and tools for managing difficult airways, but there are few supporters of regional anesthesia as an option or solution in these cases. Of course, special attention is required during regional anesthesia in a patient with difficult airway, the decision must be correct, and an anesthesiologist must have a preformulated strategy for airway management. However, does not the same happen even when we apply general anesthesia?",

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF- β) is a promotor in advanced stages of prostate cancer. Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), the endopeptidase that degrades extracellular matrix is considered to be overexpressed in prostatic carcinoma related to its growth and aggressiveness. Therefore, the aim was to analyze the expression of proteins TGF- β and MMP2 between both epithelium and stroma of prostatic adenocarcinoma and adjacent unaffected parenchyma. The intensity of TGF- β and MMP2 expression in epithelium, tumorous stroma and adjacent unaffected parenchyma was analyzed in 62 specimens of prostatic adenocarcinoma by microarray-based immunohistochemistry. TGF- β was more expressed in tumorous than in prostate stroma (p =0.000), while no statistical significance in case of MMP2 (p = 0.097) was found. MMP2 was more expressed in tumorous than in prostate epithelium (p =0.000), while no statistical significance in case of TGF- β (p = 0.096) was observed. The study results indicate that both tumorous stroma and epithelium have a role in tumor progression and support potential role of TGF- β and MMP2 in prostatic adenocarcinoma progression.",

    "abstract": "Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has become widely used as a standard radiation therapy technique for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. The transition from conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT) to a more complex IMRT technique triggered the need for more thorough verification of the accuracy in the dose delivery. In this work we present the clinical workflow and the results of patient specific quality assurance (PSQA) procedures for 40 prostate cancer patients who have been treated with step and shot IMRT ever since its implementation in our routine clinical practice. PSQA procedures include dosimetric verification of each treatment plan with dedicated rotational phantom and high-resolution matrix detector system Octavius 4D (PTW Freiburg) that allows three-dimensional comparison of the calculated and delivered radiation dose distribution. Our results proved the compliance with the universal tolerance limits recommended for those procedures (1), assuring the safety of the treatment and providing the possibility for the adoption of more stringent constraints in the future.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to show clinical outcome in 56 patients with tympanic membrane perforation operated on by total endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty. Out of the total of 74 patients operated on exclusively endoscopically, we identified 56 patients in whom tympanoplasty type I (myringoplasty) was performed. In 43 patients (45 ears), myringoplasty was performed in a standard transcanal fashion with lifting of the tympanomeatal flap, and in 13 patient butterfly myringoplasty was performed. The size and position of perforation, surgery duration, hearing status and closure of the perforation were evaluated. Perforation closure was obtained in 50 of 58 ears (86.21%). The mean surgery duration was 62.69±22.56 minutes in both groups. Hearing improved significantly, with the preoperative mean air-bone gap of 20.41±9.29 dB improving to the postoperative mean air-bone gap of 9.05±7.77 dB. No major complications were recorded. Our results of graft success rate and hearing outcomes are comparable with those of microscopic myringoplasties but without the need for external incisions and with reduced surgical morbidity. Hence, we recommend total endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty as the method of choice for tympanic membrane perforation regardless of its size and location.",

They can be classified based on hemodynamics as low- or high-flow fistulas, and anatomically as direct or indirect fistulas. Anatomy of the shunt somewhat dictates the selection of endovascular treatment, meaning the venous or arterial approach and selection of embolizing materials. Although there is general agreement as to when to access CCF transvenously or transarterialy, which depends on the shunt being direct or indirect, there is no uniform agreement on which occlusion method should be used. Herein, we report a case of an 80-year-old woman treated for indirect CCF using detachable coils. We also provide a brief review of the literature, including recent advances in treatment of said entities. In conclusion, selection of both the approach and material used depends on the operator's experience and preference.",

There are limited data regarding the estimated glomerular filtration rate in children and young adults with hemophilia. The aim of this study was to determine the difference between three commonly used estimated glomerular filtration rate equations in the pediatric population in a cohort of patients with hemophilia. Our prospective study included 36 pediatric patients with moderate or severe hemophilia. eGFR was calculated for each patient using the original creatinine-based \"bedside Schwartz\" equation, the cystatin C-based equation and the creatinine-cystatin C-based equation. The difference between the equations, calculated using the one-way repeated ANOVA test, was statistically significant (p <0.001), and post hoc analysis found differences between each method. Correlation analysis showed the strongest positive correlation between the bedside Schwartz equation and creatinine-cystatin C-based equation (r=0.866) among the three methods examined. A correlation between the three eGFR methods was present, but with significant differences between them. Due to the observed differences between eGFR in pediatric patients with hemophilia, further research is needed to find the optimal measurement method for eGFR. Nevertheless, we recommend implementing eGFR equations in routine clinical monitoring of pediatric patients with hemophilia.",

A 56-year-old woman presented with a complaint of progressive hearing loss and tinnitus in the left ear without dizziness. A successful left-sided stapedotomy was performed, confirming the diagnosis of otosclerosis and closing the air-bone gap to less than 10 dB. Seven days after the stapedotomy, the patient reported dizziness, usually when turning to her left side in the bed. An electrophysiological assessment was performed to investigate vestibular function. Dix Hallpike maneuver showed a typical response, about 5 seconds after repositioning the head, and geotropic, torsional rotary nystagmus of about 30 seconds was registered. Vitamin D deficiency in serum was found. Complete symptom remission was achieved after 7-day-treatment with Epley's maneuver. As a postoperative vertigo complication, BPPV often remains unrecognized after stapes surgery. Canalith repositioning maneuver is treatment for BPPV. Determining serum levels of total calcium and vitamin D may play a significant role in monitoring and reducing the recurrence of dizziness.",

The BMI of all patients with thyroid cancer was 27.1 ± 4.2. Significantly more patients with obesity class I had cancer size less than 2 cm (p = 0.02). There is a significant association between BMI and extrathyroid invasion (p = 0.03; OR, 1.18), but not with lymphovascular invasion, tumor size, and multifocality. We can conclude that although obesity is a risk factor for the development of thyroid cancer, higher BMI is only partially associated with more aggressive pathohistological features of thyroid cancer.",

Unfortunately, the optimal treatment approach is still uncertain. However, many studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of several medications in the treatment of COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) + favipiravir (FAV) treatment regimen and HCQ alone by comparing the patient's clinical response and laboratory results on the fifth day of treatment in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection.This retrospective cohort study was conducted in Malatya Training and Research Hospital between March 2020 and July 2020. The study included 69 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with pneumonia. The patients were divided into 2 groups, those receiving HCQ alone and those receiving the HCQ + FAV combination.A total of 69 patients were included in the study, and the mean age was 60.09±15.56 years. A statistically significant decrease was observed in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, at the end of the fifth day, in patients who received HCQ + FAV treatment (p=0.002), whereas there was no decrease in CRP levels in patients who received HCQ treatment alone. In addition, an increase in lymphocyte count and a better fever response was observed at the end of the fifth day in patients who received HCQ + FAV (p=0.008). However, there was no statistical difference between both treatment regimens in terms of hospital stay and treatment results (p=0.008, p=0.744, p=0.517).Although the combination of HCQ + FAV treatment was observed to be effective on CRP levels and fever response in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, there was no difference in terms of hospital stay and discharge.",

Fifty-five pregnant women with manifest moderate (mild) preeclampsia (PE) and fifty healthy women as a control group were included in this prospective study. Laboratory tests including lipid panel, C-reactive protein (CRP), and homocysteine levels as biohumoral markers of atherogenesis, as well as ergometry and the main cardiovascular risk factor markers were performed in all women during pregnancy and six months after delivery. In our study, cholesterol and LDL levels in the PE group did not differ from those in the control group. Triglyceride levels in the PE group were higher than the corresponding values found in normal pregnancies, while HDL levels were significantly lower in the PE group than in the normal pregnancy group (p<0.001). The values of total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides in the PE group were higher compared to those in the same group six months after delivery (p<0.001). The effect of PE as an inflammatory disease could be confirmed to a certain extent by elevated CRP levels (p<0.001). A very high percentage of negative exercise stress tests indicated a good cardiovascular response to the current PE in the otherwise healthy pregestational women. It could be concluded that the development of possible cardiovascular comorbidities in preeclamptic pregnant women is a long process, but also due to etiologic factors of coexistent metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia, as well as elevated inflammatory markers and homocysteine, PE can be considered even an early predictor of cardiovascular disease.",

COVID-19 intensive care patients that presented to our department between April 2020 and May 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were divided into two main groups, i.e., before and after the vaccination period. Patients were evaluated retrospectively for the following parameters: gender, age, side of pneumothorax, mortality, discharge, comorbidity, and additional pleural complications. The total number of patients was 87, i.e., 66 patients before vaccination and 21 patients after vaccination. When patients in the pre- and post-vaccination period were compared, there was a significant difference in the incidence of pneumothorax between the two groups (p<0.05). Pneumothorax was less common after vaccination. When patients with pneumothorax and tube thoracostomy were evaluated according to pre- and post-vaccination mortality, mortality was significantly higher (89%) in the pre-vaccination period (p<0.05). We consider that COVID-19 vaccines used in patients aged over 65 reduced the incidence of pleural complications, especially pneumothorax. We think that mortality due to pneumothorax in patients over 65 years of age was lower during the vaccination period. In addition, we think that bilateral pneumothorax was more common in the non-vaccinated period. As a result, we think that life-threatening pneumothorax and similar complications could be reduced by increasing the number of vaccines made in the COVID-19 pandemic and spreading it around the world.",

There was a correlation between infertility, associated treatment, and sexuality. Infertility and involvement in treatment procedures increased the risk of sexual dysfunction. The risk factors identified in our study could help facilitate detection and timely treatment of sexual dysfunction, which would help maintain healthy sexuality in couples participating in in vitro fertilization procedures.",

    "abstract": "Celiac disease is more common than previously thought and a high index of suspicion is important in its diagnosis. Typically, cases of celiac disease present at the age of5-24 months with the symptoms of intestinal malabsorption, growth retardation, abnormal stools, abdominal distension, muscle wasting, hypotonia, poor appetite and low spirit. In adults, the symptoms of celiac disease may be highly variabile. The incidence of malignancies is also increased. Most of these are small bowel lymphomas and carcinomas of the esophagus and colon. ln some patients, the disease is associated with clinical dysfunction of the nervous system, manifesting variably as encephalopathy, cerebellar abnormalities, seizures, cerebral atrophy and dementia, brain stem encephalitis, cerebral vasculitis, myopathy, quadriparesis (metabolic), myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and psychiatric disorders. Presentation is made of a 47-year-old woman with misdiagnosed celiac disease, who first developed pain in the back which was treated with spinal support. She also complained of very severe bone pains. Finally, she was admitted to the hospital with a history of increasing difficulty on walking, weakness in her legs, urine incontinence, and 5-kg weight loss in four months. Celiac disease should therefore be considered in differential diagnosis in patients presenting with unexplained neurologic symptoms.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY • Dependence of the incidence of pulmonary/pleural asbestosis on the mineralogiccharacteristics of asbestos, and sensitivity of chest roentgenogram and high-resolution computedtomography on analyzing this pathology are presented. This retrospective/prospective study wasconducted in 109 patients, workers of Plobest Ltd Asbestos Industry in PloŁe (group 1, predomi-nantly inhaling chrysotile asbestos) and 216 workers of Salonit Ltd from Vranjic near Split and SplitShipyard (group 2, predominantly inhaling crocidolite asbestos) with the diagnosis of pulmonary/pleural asbestosis. Statistical analysis was done by Kappa test, χ 2 -test, and analysis of variance. Testresults are shown in diagrams and table. Pulmonary asbestosis was confirmed in 38 (35%), pulmo-nary and pleural asbestosis in 49 (45%), and pleural asbestosis in 22 (20%) group 1 patients (exposedto chrysotile). In group 2 patients (exposed to crocidolite asbestos), pulmonary asbestosis was con-firmed in only 9 (4%), pleural asbestosis in 117 (54%), and pleural and pulmonary asbestosis in 90(42%) patients. In 35 (32.1%) group 1 patients with normal chest roentgenograms (InternationalLabour Organisation (ILO) perfusion categories 0/0 and 0/1), high-resoluton computed tomogra-phy revealed initial or moderate stage of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Interpretation of chest roent-genograms showed good, almost excellent agreement between the results obtained by three observerson ILO profusion categories 0/0, 0/1 and 1/0, and OnormalO agreement for profusion category ≥1/1.For pleural asbestosis, two readers had excellent agreement (Kappa test = 79%) in group 1 and goodagreement in group 2. It was concluded that the incidence of pulmonary and pleural asbestosis wasmuch higher in persons exposed to the inhalation of chrysotile and crocidolite, respectively. It is rec-ommended that in radiologic diagnosis, high-resolution computed tomography should always be usedin addition to ILO classification, particularly in the initial stages of the lung and pleural disease.",

Dynamic, gadolinium postcontrast studies as well tissue-specific contrast media highly improve the characterization of liver lesions. Multisection breath-hold techniques enable imaging of the entire region of interest in a single suspended respiration. MR-cholangiopancreatography allows for simultaneous analysis of biliary tree and pancreatic duct. The ability of various MR pulse sequences to display differences between normal and pathologic tissues is the basis of detection and characterization of focal and diffuse liver changes.",

This retrospective study was carried out between 1998-2000. Eighteen patients had a vitrectomy and lensectomy done for posterior dislocation of lens fragments. The median age of the patients was 71. The median timing of the surgery was 13 days. One patient had a vitrectomy performed at the time of cataract surgery (day 0). Uveitis was present in 14 (78%) patients, corneal edema in 9 (50%) and ocular hypertension in 10 (55,5%) patients. After vitrectomy visual acuity was 0,5 or better in 9 patients (50%), 4 patients (22%) had intraocular hypertension, 2 patients (11%) had corneal edema, and 4 patients (22%) had uveitis. Visual acuity improved in most (17) our patients after vitrectomy. There was no statistically significant difference in final visual outcome considering timing of the vitrectomy-lensectomy. Vitrectomy significantly reduces ocular hypertension, uveitis and corneal edema.",

The goal of this study was to assess the frequency of this side-effect in our population of cardiology patients treated with amiodarone. We also wanted to assess the consequences on eye sight. The study was conducted as a collaboration between the divisions of ophthalmology and cardiology of Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital, Zagreb and it included patients receiving amiodarone for longer than 6 months (100-800 mg/ day). Changes on the cornea were objectively evaluated using a biomicroscope and have been classified into three stages. Clinical changes on the cornea have been observed in 92% of the patients. Changes in eye sight were not observed. Amiodarone keratopathy is related to dosage and duration of treatment. This keratopathy progresses even with reduced dosage; however, complete regression occurs once administration of medication is discontinued. Taking this study into account, as well as the available published data, we are of the opinion that amiodarone therapy should not be discontinued due to changes in the eye-sight and if the amiodarone therapy is of critical importance to the welfare of the patient.",

    "abstract": "∑ We retrospectively analyzed the results of treatment of lower limb ischemia in 63 diabetic patients (27 female and 36 male, mean age 73.5 years) who were identified in a group of 138 randomly seleced patients among those who had undergone lower limb arteriography during hospitalization at the Department of Vascular Medicine, Department of Radiology, Clinical Centre Ljubljana, in the year 1998. The reason for lower limb arteriography was claudication in 18 (29%), chronic critical ischemia in 42 (66%), and acute ischemia in three (5%) patients. After arteriography, the procedure of a revascularization was performed in 32 (51%) patients, among whom three patients with acute ischemia had successful embolectomy, 24 were treated endovascularly, and five patients surgically. Thirty (47%) patients were treated conservatively, and one patient with primary amputation. The patient status was reassessed after an average of 24 months, range 19 to 33 months. Among the 18 patients with claudication, two patients died, one from stroke and the other due to worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with respiratory failure, however, all patients retained their limb during the survival or follow-up, 15 after revascularization procedure and 18 with conservative treatment. Nine (21%) patients had amputation, four below and five above the knee. One amputation was primary, 2 amputations followed endovascular treatment, and 6 were performed after conservative treatment. During the followup period, 13 (31%) patients with chronic critical ischemia died, five from stroke, three from acute myocardial infarction, and five due to unknown causes. Our results have confirmed that lower limb ischemia can be treated relatively successfully in diabetic patients, but that mortality remains high, especially in patients with chronic critical ischemia.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven levator specimens were taken from 6 patients, undergoing anterior levator repair due to aponeurotic ptosis. The control group consisted of 12 levator aponeurosis specimens harvested from both lids of 6 cadavers, during autopsy. Congo red was used to detect amyloid and Orcein stain for elastic fibers. Immunohistochemistry was applied as a final marker for amyloid. RESULTS: In 2 out of 6 (33, 3%) aponeurotic patients we demonstrated amyloid. Orbital and systemic involvement was excluded. The levator aponeurosis was attenuated, stretched and grayish in all patients, but still attached to the tarsus. Collagen bundles were thinned with fatty and elastotic degeneration of different grade in all samples. Control group was negative for amyloid. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated amyloid in 33, 3% of patients with aponeurotic ptosis, without systemic amyloidosis, which may open a new perspective in aponeurotic ptosis etiology explanation.",

The aim of the study was to determine hemodynamic changes in cerebral arteries in diabetic patients, and to analyze the effect of duration and type of diabetes on cerebrovascular disease. The rate of transcranial Doppler sonography abnormalities was statistically significantly higher in diabetic patients than in control subjects (55% vs. 11%, χ 2 =, p<0.05). The duration and type of diabetes were found to have an impact on the development of pathologic cerebrovascular changes. Hemodynamic impairments were more common in type 1 than in type 2 diabetes patients (72.5% vs. 43.3%). The study suggested the duration of diabetes to predict for the development of atherosclerotic processes in cerebral vessels. Atherosclerotic changes were found in 34.0% and 71.4% of patients suffering from diabetes for <5 and ♢5 years, respectively. In all diabetic patients, signs of cerebral microangiopathy were significantly more commonly recorded than those of cerebral macroangiopathy.",

The study included 52 relatives from 12 families with family history of POAG through 3 generations. The examination consisted of complete ophthalmologic status, automated perimetry and optic nerve photography. A detailed anamnesis and family trees were taken. Individuals were diagnosed with POAG if they fulfilled two or three of the criteria for making a diagnosis: the level of intraocular pressure visual field loss or characteristic disc appearance. Subjects were considered isuspected POAGi if they fulfilled only one of the preceding three criteria. All three parameters had to be normal for an individual to be considered unaffected. Seven relatives (l2%) were diagnosed with P0AG, fifteen (29%) relatives were classified as glaucoma suspects. Siblings of POAG patients had the highest risk of POAG developing compared with children or other blood relatives. The study presented results of investigation the frequency of POAG among other glaucoma diseases and 16% patients had a family history of POAG at least in 3 generations. Detailed anamnesis confirms familial appearance of POAG and examination of all available members enables the discovery of new cases (12%).",

The hypothesis that plasma levels of blood lipids predict the echolucency of carotid atherosclerotic plaques on B-mode imaging was tested. A total of 237 outpatients, mean age 62.9±10.2 years, were enrolled in the study. There were 189 symptomatic and 48 asymptomatic patients. All of them underwent duplex sonography of carotid arteries and lipidogram in the last year, and had plaques in common or internal carotid arteries. Other risk factors, i.e. arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, aging and gender, were also evaluated. In the model of logistic regression, the type of plaque (hypoechogenic, echogenic) was introduced as a dependent variable, with LDL, HDL and triglycerides as independent variables. The model fitted the data moderately well (r 2 =0.19, p<0.001). LDL and HDL appeared to be significant predictors (p<0.01). The association of plaque type with arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, aging and gender was tested by logistic regression. The model fitted the data moderately well (r 2 =0.24, p<0.001). Arterial hypertension and age were significant (p<0.01) predictors for echogenic plaques, whereas cigarette smoking was indicative of hypoechogenic plaques (p=0.01). In conclusion, LDL and HDL appeared to be associated with hypoechogenic plaques. LDL showed positive, and HDL negative association. Among other risk factors, aging and arterial hypertension showed positive association with echogenic plaques, whereas cigarette smoking showed positive association with hypoechogenic plaques.",

Concerning the small area of induced ventricular injury, a high degree success is expected in patients with idiopathic VT and in patients with bundle branch reentrant VT. The long-term success rate of radiofrequency ablation in the cure of idiopathic VT and bundle branch reentrant VT is about 90% and 100%, respectively. Radiofrequency ablation of VT in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) can be effective in patients with localized disease and single VT origin. In patients with more extensive ARVD and/or pleomorphic VT, other therapeutic options should be considered. In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, radiofrequency ablation is not curative but may be used as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the frequency and severity of VT. By using the new mapping systems, the application of radiofrequency ablation is expanded to the treatment of VTs requiring chamber compartmentalization or resulting in hemodynamic instability.",

They are divided into hyperplastic, glandular cystic and adenomatous polyps. Adenomatous polyp is a true neoplastic polyp, and hyperplastic polyp carries a risk of malignant alteration. Based on the present knowledge, an algorithm for the clinical management of benign epithelial gastric polyps is proposed.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY n PURPOSE: In this study we evaluated a nonfiltering glaucoma technique viscocanalostomy alone or in combination with small incision phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 1999 to February 2001 we performed viscocanalostomy in 18 patients with medically uncontrolled primary open angle glaucoma. In 10 patients with cataract and primary open angle glaucoma we performed a combined operation of phacoemulsification and viscocanalostomy. RESULTS: The mean IOP reduction remained statistically significant after 6 months in both groups (P<0,01). There was also a significant decrease in the antiglaucoma medications in both groups postoperatively. CONCLUSION: We achieved good hypotensive effect and had very low complications rate. Such a low complication rate makes this operation particularly attractive to surgeons who perform an increasing number of operations in outpatientis bases.",

BP is not a life threatening condition but it has a potential cosmetic mutilatory effect, and there is also a possibility of serious ophthalmologic complications (corneal ulcers). Recurrent paralyses are noted in 7-8% of BP cases. Only two patients with four BP episodes out of 1700 patients, and only one patient with more than four BP episodes out of 2414 BP cases have been reported in the literature. The highest number of BP recurrences found in the available literature is nine. A brief review of the epidemiology and etiopathogenesis of BP is presented, a case of unusual recurrent BP is reported, and the immune pathomechamisms are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Cilj rada bio je utvrditi osjetljivost pojedinih radiologijskih i funkcijskih pretraga te njihovih odnosa kod ove bolesti. U radu je sudjelovalo 180 ispitanika oba spola. U svih su ispitanika ucinjene standardne i kose snimke prsnog kosa tzv. tvrdom tehnikom snimanja. Kod 60 ispitanika ucinjena je i visoko-rezolucijska kompjutorizirana tomografija. Od funkcijskih pretraga mjeren je vitalni kapacitet i difuzijski kapacitet za ugljicni monoksid. Pleuralni plakovi su cesci znak azbestoze pleure. U nasem je istraživanju od 60 ispitanika rendgenogram prsiju ukazao na pleuralne plakove u 25 (41, 6%), a visoko-rezolucijska kompjutorizirana tomografija u 51 (85%) ispitanika. Od 60 ispitanika s urednim nalazom rendenograma prsiju (ILO 0/0 i o/1) pocetna fibroza plucnog parenhima otkrivena je uz pomoc visoko-rezolucijske kompjutorizirane tomografije u 11 (18, 4%) ispitanika. Zbog nepodudarnosti nalaza radiologa na konvencionalnoj radiografiji, u 28 od 60 ispitanika nije se mogla sa sigurnoscu postaviti dijagnoza azbestoze. Visoko-rezolucijska kompjutorizirana tomografija je kod 22 (36, 6%) ispitanika ukazala na pocetnu, a kod (10%) na umjerenu fibrozu. kod pocetnih oblika azbestoze vrijednosti vitalnog kapaciteta i difuzijskog kapaciteta za ugljicni monoksid su u granicama normalnih vrijednosti. Tek veca prožetost sjena plucnoga parenhima i veca zahvacenost zadebljanja pleure dovode do pada vitalnog kapaciteta.",

A 58-year-old man suffered acute visual impairment associated with acute transient right upper limb paresis and paresthesia. Ultrasound examination of the neck arteries, TCD and digital subtraction angiography showed stenosis of the siphon of the left internal carotid artery. The patient was administered aspirin as antiplatelet therapy for 40 days, followed by anticoagulant therapy. Subsequently, he experienced many recurrent cerebral ischemic events. TCD monitoring performed on 4 occasions revealed microembolic signals (MES) in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery. Aspirin was added to anticoagulant therapy. Once the combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy had been introduced, no recurrent events were recorded anymore and no MES were detected. In this case, the detected MES proved to be in close relationship with recurrent cerebral ischemia, and were eliminated by combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy.",

There were 20 (60.6%) men and 13 (39.4%) women aged 60-80 years. In most patients (57.6%), brain CT revealed lesions in other areas beside the one in the territory of PCA. Lesions to the right and left posterior cerebral artery were more common men (36.4%) and women (24.3%), respectively. Spinal tap showed increased protein CSF levels in 41 % of patients. Concerning the presence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, a combination of the two was most frequently found in both sexes, however, it was a more prominent finding in men (42.4%). Carotid CDFI showed significant internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis in 19.4% and ICA occlusion in 16.1% of patients. The rest of patients had incipient or moderate stenosis of ICA. TCD showed the presence of hypoperfusion ipsilaterally to CT lesion in 56.3% of patients. This type of ischemic disease was found to have a relatively abrupt onset, accompanied by hemianopia in 45% and sudden confusion in 27.3% (n=9) of patients. In conclusion, we point to the CT-verified infarction of the superficial PCA territory as a specific cerebrovascular clinical entity.",

    "abstract": "The Chinese discovered acupuncture more than 5000 years ago. Acupuncture is gentle insertion of very thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate the flow of one's Qi or natural healing energy. Chinese science had a very different way of thinking from the Western world. It emphasized holistic patterns, relationships, cycles, and processes, in contrast to the western way of thinking, which emphasizes linear thinking, causality and reductionist explanations. The Chinese medical doctors look at identifying the health and dysfunction, and the status of Qi, blood, phlegm, moisture. They make diagnosis upon physical characteristics of pulse on radial artery, which id entities the twelve acupuncture meridians, and also the patient's tongue, overall physical stature, face, skin, nails, eyes are important. So, the Eastern medical doctors would diagnose the status of Qi either as weak, stagnant, or congestive, and they also examine for the five external influences, i.e. heat, cold, dampness, dryness, and wind. Another Eastern concept is Yin and Yang. Yin implies feminine qualities of the universe (night, winter, western, north, external, cold, water, darkness, moon, blood), and Yang represents masculine qualities of the universe (day, spring, summer, east, south, warm, internal, heat, sun, energy). The principle of Chinese medicine is balance and harmony between Jin and Yang. Qi is vital energy of any living organism and source of all movement and change in the universe. Chinese medicine describes invisible Qi circulating along a system of conduits, meridians or channels. There are twelve principal bilateral meridians of Qi, which are connected, with one of the viscerals of the body and each manifests its own characteristic of Qi. The Chinese explain acupuncture as Qi or energy traveling through channels in the body. Any obstruction of the movement of this energy is like a dam, which backs up the flow in one part of the body and restricts the flow in other parts. The obstruction or blockade or deficiency of energy (Qi) would lead to dysfunction, and ultimately to disease and death. Acupuncture can unblock the obstruction of the dams within the meridian circulation releasing the regular flow of Qi, blood and fluid, moisture through these meridians. Modern science explains the function of acupuncture as stimulation of the nervous system to release neuroproteins and neuroinformation packages in the muscle, spinal cord and brain, particularly endorphin, enkephalins and dynorphins. These chemicals modulate the perception of pain and physiological function of the neural-endocrine-hormonal system. In modern science, cellular health is the movement of electrons. Only a radical change in the cellular structure and cellular electrical magnetic forces is called a disease. Until 1976, the evidence of acupuncture anesthesia was mainly anecdotal in the Western world. Since then, the situation has changed dramatically, and now acupuncture is a method used to improve health generally as well as to promote healing and to reduce side effects of many drugs. Acupuncture has found application in the areas where conventional medicine usually comes up short, such as chronic disease, pain control, and stress reduction. Several controlled clinical trials in chronic pain patients comparing true acupuncture to sham acupuncture have also shown that acupuncture really works better than placebo. In 1979, the World Health Organization, United Nations, published a list of conditions that could be successfully treated by acupuncture. In the medical field of neurology, the following diseases can be treated by acupuncture: migraines, headaches, postoperative pain, pain in general, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Acupuncture has recently shown efficacy in improving clinical outcome after cerebrovascular accident. Acupuncture therapy can be used in the subacute stage of stroke and in the treatment of spasticity, the most common symptom in stroke patients. It is also possible to treat different pains that are usually caused by spasticity and contractures in stroke patients. Many patients with vertebrobasilar insufficiency have painful neck with tension of paravertebral muscle. In this case, acupuncture is very helpful. Study results have shown that stroke patients in the subacute stage who received acupuncture during rehabilitation program had better motor function improvement and have better adjusted to daily life activities. Spasticity is a common symptom in stroke patients, and its management is a major rehabilitation problem. Acupuncture has been used with moderate effect. Some clinical experience has been acquired, however, there is little objective evidence to support its use. Acupuncture as the treatment for spastic hemiparesis in stroke patients was studied by evaluation of the increased spinal motor neuron excitability in spasticity. The results provided evidence for the increased spinal motor neuron excitability in paretic limbs. In conclusion, acupuncture is a useful therapeutic method in the management of stroke patients, and it has proved very helpful during the procedure of rehabilitation",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease characterized by deposits of lipid substances, cholesterol, cellular breakdown products, calcium and fibrin in the inner arterial wall. These deposits are known as plaques. Arterial wall involvement with the atherosclerotic process underlies a majority of stroke cases. There are numerous risk factors for the onset and development of atherosclerosis. Beside classical risk factors such as elevated blood pressure, high plasma lipids, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption, inflammation has recently been mentioned as an important factor in the genesis of atherosclerosis. The concept of association between inflammation and atherosclerosis is not a new one, as it was first proposed by William Osler in 1908. Although not accepted then, the role of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis has recently aroused interest. The current model of response to injury admits that endothelial damage may be initiated and perpetuated by inflammatory process. In this revival of the inflammatory theory of atherosclerosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae is the agent most frequently discussed, followed by cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. The causative pathogen might exert a direct local inflammatory action on the arterial wall, including endothelial cell damage and/or dysfunction and smooth muscle cell proliferation. 'There may also be some indirect effects caused by chronic infection, circulating endotoxins, activation of inflammatory mediators, autoantibody production, or modifications of risk factors such as lipids, lipoproteins, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and other coagulation proteins. Chiamydia pneumoniae is a gram-negative, intracellular bacterium that causes respiratory infections such as sinusitis, pharyngitis and pneu monia. Chlamydia pneumoniae infection usually is subclinical and has a benign course. Epidemics due to Chlamydia pneumoniae occur every 5-7 years on an average, and particular individuals are certainly infected on several occasions, so that 50%-70% of adult population are seropositive for Chlamydia. The association between Chlamydia and atherosclerosis is supported by the association of elevated IgG and IgA antibody titers in patients with myocardial infarction and coronary disease. Antibodies to Chlamydia lipopolysaccharide were found in 68% of patients having suffered myocardial infarction versus only 3% in the control group. Chlamydia pneumoniae and its parts were detected by PCR techruque and immunohistochemical staining in aortic and coronary artery atheromas, but not in normal arteries. Circulating immunocomplexes contairung specific IgG antibodies to Chlamydia were more frequently found in patients with coronary disease and myocardial infarction than in the control group. Patients with carotid atherosclerosis and stroke are frequently seropositive to Chlamydia. Various authors report on positive Chlamydia findings in 17% to 79% samples of the material obtained on carotid endarterectomy. The association of Chlamydia and atherosclerotic lesions has also been confirmed on animal models. The animals infected with Chlamydia had significantly more atherosclerotic lesions. Indirect evidence on the association of Chlamydia and atherosclerosis has been provided by several published studies (in a small number of patients, though) of the effectiveness of macrolide antibiotics in secondary prevention of vascular accidents. Studies on the correlation between Chlamydia pneumoniae eradication with macrolide antibiotics and prevalence of atherosclerotic vascular accidents have just been in course. The causative relationship of inflammation due to Chlamydia pneumoniae cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus and atherosclerotic process has not yet been definitely demonstrated. These intracellular microorganisms may simply coincide with the process of atherosclerosis, which also includes an inflammatory reaction induced by arterial wall lesion.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and it is associated with a significantly increased risk of stroke and systemic embolism. To reduce this risk it is important to start these patients on life-term oral anticoagulation. Many patients with atrial fibrillation also have some degree of renal insufficiency, which further increases the risk of stroke and\r\nthromboembolism, as well as the risk of bleeding. Therefore it is crucial to carefully choose a type of anticoagulant medication that is effective and safe for patients suffering from atrial fibrillation and renal insufficiency. There are two types of oral anticoagulants, vitamin K antagonists and new oral anticoagulants (NOAC). Warfarin is the most commonly used vitamin K antagonist, while NOACs include dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. Considering NOACs are mostly renally excreted, only patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency were included in the original clinical trials, but these trials showed that NOACs are as effective or superior to warfarin and are now the treatment of choice for patients with atrial fibrillation and mild or moderate renal insufficiency. Few NOAC pharmacokinetic studies were performed and found doses of these drugs that produce stable plasma levels in patients with severe renal insufficiency and could be effective in preventing thromboembolism. The results of studies that included warfarin treatment in these patients are heterogeneous, showing it could produce a satisfactory anticoagulant effect or it could even increase the stroke risk. Major bleeding also seems to be less frequent in patients with severe renal insufficiency treated with NOACs then in those treated with warfarin. Besides bleeding, an important factor of safety to keep in mind while treating patients with renal insufficiency is the progression of their kidney disease and the development of acute kidney injury. A specific type of kidney injury known as\r\nanticoagulant related nephropathy is a severe adverse effect of oral anticoagulant therapy, related mostly to warfarin use. It can occur even in patients with mild renal insufficiency or normal kidney function, often leading to life-long hemodialysis. Considering their superior safety profile as well as the possibility of achieving stable plasma levels even in severe kidney\r\ndisease, NOACs seem to be a better option for anticoagulant treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation and renal insufficiency.",

We used standardized and complementary functional classification systems for cerebral palsy to create a functional profile. Research included 44 children with CP in the age range of 4 to 18 years. The results showed that the majority of children had bilateral spastic CP (63.6%), followed by unilateral spastic (22.7%) while the representation of dyskinetic CP was 9.09% and ataxic CP 4.55%. Based on the classification of gross and fine motor skills, 43.2% of children had the ability to walk, 11% of children could walk with assistive mobility devices, while 45.4% of children had a low functional level. The study also analyzed the associated impairments where higher classification score of motor impairment correlated with the severity of impairment. The results showed that children with dyskinetic CP and severe motor impairment could have mild cognitive impairment.

    "abstract": "Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs) are benign neoplasms classified in the category of glioneuronal tumors. The estimated incidence of DNETs is 0.03 per 100,000 person per year with the age peak in a range between 10 and 14 years, and decreasing dramatically with increasing age. They are seldom diagnosed in persons above 20 years of age, being a cause of tumor-related intractable epilepsy that begins in childhood or adolescence. They have been proven to be the second most common type of epileptogenic tumors in pediatric population. These rare tumors cause chronic drug-resistant partial complex seizures with or without secondary generalization. Herein, we provide institutional case series of six adult patients with temporal lobe DNET presenting with complex partial seizures. Lesionectomy was performed with tumor resection in toto in three patients. In another three, partial resection was performed, whereas tumor remnant was left intact to avoid possible basal ganglia damage. All patients were seizure free postoperatively. Lesionectomy alone in temporal lobe epilepsy was associated with less favorable outcome than anterior temporal lobectomy. Total tumor removal is considered a major prognostic factor in most studies.",

Now, a great number of manufacturers offer their serologic tests on the market. When interpretating the results, the rate of seroprevalence should be taken in consideration because it may influence the positive predictive value, as well as cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses in case of assays with poorly designed antigens. We present results of 11 patients with different clinical background and tested with two different serologic tests, DIAPRO (ELISA; Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) and VIDAS (ELFA; BioMerieux, Marcy I'Etoile, France). The results obtained by the former test showed ten of these patients to be IgG positive and one patient was IgG weakly positive with different confidence index. The latter test discriminated positive results with medium confidence index on the former test as negative. The results obtained with two serology tests were concordant with the observation that the results with medium confidence index may indicate cross-reactivity.",

Thirty-two male patients, Croatian soldiers serving in the war in Croatia in 1991-1992, mean age 34.1ą7.1 years, with a diagnosis of PTSD made by psychiatric examination and use of DSM-III and LASC-01 assessment scales, were included in the study. The patients underwent neuropsychologic and laboratory examinations to determine the possible organic lesions. Multi-dimensional neuropsychologic testing was performed to as-sess their cognitive function and possible presence of an orga-nic factor. Mental retardation exceeding the level of tolerance was found in as many as 21 patients, impaired memory in 19, considerably disturbed mnestic control in 30, and a tendency to confabulation in 15 patients. Other tests also pointed to the organic basis of the recorded mental abnormalities (attention, visuomotor coordination). Laboratory tests revealed the following disturbances: increa-sed blood glucose in three, increased cholesterol in seven, incre-ased triglycerides in den, decreased HDL in ten, increased LDL in six, increased leukocytes in 16, increased erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate in five and increased thrombin time in 18 pa-tients. Other laboratory abnormalities were also recorded. The following psychosomatic disorders were diagnosed: duodenal ulcer in two, gastritis in two, diabetes in three and arterial hypertension in 2 patients. Determination of cerebral circulation by the method of tran-scranial Doppler sonography showed functional disorders of cerebral hemodynamics in 16, spasms in 11 and hypoperfusion in fivee patients.A considerable proportion of unhealthy style of life was re-corded, including smoking in 30, alcohol abuse in 15, and ina-dequate exercise and overweight in ten patients. The study confirmed the relationship between psychic and physical mechanisms in the development of PTSD, and the presence of organic parameters of a damage to the nervous system, as well as of psychosomatic and organic damage to other body systems. This preliminary study pointed to the need of complex approach to a PTSD patient.",

The results of studies on circulating lymphocytes ability to undergo blast transformation with polyclonal mitogens in vitro are different. On the other side, the hepatocyte growth factor is a multifunctional cytokine, the most potent mitogen for hepatocytes, but also for multipotent hemopoietic cells. HGF levels usually increase during liver regeneration. The aim of the study was to determine whether the ability of blast transformation and HGF levels change in liver cirrhosis. Blast transformation of lymphocytes was measured with polyclonal mitogens and HGF levels by the ELISA method in 33 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and in a group of 42 healthy volunteers. Blast transformation of lymphocytes with Pha, ConA and PWM was diminished in 72.7%, 78.8%, and 66.7% patients, respectively. In healthy volunteers blast transformation was within the normal range. HGF levels were higher in cirrhotics than in healthy volunteers (0.98*0.38 vs. 0.2*0.06 ng/ml, p<0.001). These preliminary results suggested that alcohol consumption reduced the ability of blast stimulation and at the same time increased the HGF levels. Further studies of the relationship between HGF and in vitro blast transformation of lymphocytes in liver cirrhosis are required.",

Contrasts between the rich and the poor in each individual society and contrast; between the rich and poor nations in particular, will also intensify in this field.\r\nControversies between the technologically induced advance and human community capacities to control them and use them for the benefit of an individual and entire human community, in keeping with the ecologic needs of the present and future generations, should also be expected.

    "abstract": "Results derived from neuropathologic findings in Lewis rats with developed subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis SDE indicated the existence of three developmental stages of the disease, that mutually differ according to the virus-infected cell count, inflammatory cell count, grade of myelin damage and functionaly viable PLP mRNA cell count. The first stage of SDE was found to be characterized by extensive viral infection of the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, accompanied by inflammatory reaction. There were no sings of myelin and tissue damage, but the synthesis of myelin was reduced already at this stage, expressed as a decrease in the PLP mRNA cell count. In the second stage of the disease, sharply delineated demyelination areas, accompanied by strong inflammatory reaction, were observed. Beside the loss of a great number of oligodendrocytes, a loss of astrocytes was also recorded. There was pronounced gliosos on lesion margins. The number of virus-infected cells that remained in the area close to the lesion decreased. A great proportion of cells showed signs of degeneration, necrosis or apoptosis. At this stage of development, even some areas of remyelination occured at an interesting and unusual localization, i.e. in the center of the demyelinating lesion. In the third stage of the disease, the virus almost disappeared. The tissue was severely damaged, occasionally nacrotic. Active demyelination and massive macrophage infiltration could still be observed. A large proportion of cells showed signs of apoptosis. Among the cells that exhibited the signs of apoptosis, T-lymphocytes and oligodendrocytes were most frequently isolated in all the three developmental stages of the disease. Among oligodendrocytes, the virus-infected cells underwent necrosis, whereas noninfected cells showed the signs of apoptosis. Like in autoimmune encephalomyelitis, in coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis the inflammatory cells, T-lymphocytes, are also cleared from CNS by the process of apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Sorbitol je intermedijarni produkt metabolizma poliola, koji pretvara glukozu u fruktozu. Intracelularno nakupljanje sorbitola, izgleda, ima udjela u etiologiji kronicnih komplikacija secerne bolesti. U ovom radu mjeren je sadržaj sorbitola u eritrocitima, određena razina glukoze u plazmi i izracunat omjer sorbitol-glukoza u 13 bolesnika od secerne bolesti ovisne o inzulinu (IDDM), 10 bolesnika od secerne bolesti neovisne o inzulinu (NIDDM) i 8 zdravih osoba, podjednake starosne dobi. Desetero dijabeticara imalo je neuropatiju, a sedmero neuropatiju i retinopatiju. Razina eritrocitnog sorbitola bila je znacajno visa u dijabeticara negu u kontrolnoj skupini. Nije ustanovljena signifikantna razlika omjera sorbitol-glukoza između tih dviju skupina, ali su ti omjeri bili znacajno niži u dijabeticara s komplikacijama. Zakljucujemo da razina sorbitola u eritrocitima raste u svezi s raznom glukoze u plazmi, ali da se uzrok dijabeticke mikroangiopatije ne može objasniti samo pojacanom metabolickom pregradnjom poliola potaknutom hiperglikemijom, vec se vjerojatno radi o međureakciji jos nepoznatih multiplih metabolickih faktora.",
