    "abstract": "Assessment of the immune response to tumors is growing in importance as the prognostic implications of this response are increasingly recognized, and as immunotherapies are evaluated and implemented in different tumor types. However, many different approaches can be used to assess and describe the immune response, which limits efforts at implementation as a routine clinical biomarker. In part 1 of this review, we have proposed a standardized methodology to assess tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in solid tumors, based on the International Immuno-Oncology Biomarkers Working Group guidelines for invasive breast carcinoma. In part 2 of this review, we discuss the available evidence for the prognostic and predictive value of TILs in common solid tumors, including carcinomas of the lung, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary system, gynecologic system, and head and neck, as well as primary brain tumors, mesothelioma and melanoma. The particularities and different emphases in TIL assessment in different tumor types are discussed. The standardized methodology we propose can be adapted to different tumor types and may be used as a standard against which other approaches can be compared. Standardization of TIL assessment will help clinicians, researchers and pathologists to conclusively evaluate the utility of this simple biomarker in the current era of immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in histopathologic specimens can provide important prognostic information in diverse solid tumor types, and may also be of value in predicting response to treatments. However, implementation as a routine clinical biomarker has not yet been achieved. As successful use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy become a clinical reality, the need for widely applicable, accessible, and reliable immunooncology biomarkers is clear. In part 1 of this review we briefly discuss the host immune response to tumors and different approaches to TIL assessment. We propose a standardized methodology to assess TILs in solid tumors on hematoxylin and eosin sections, in both primary and metastatic settings, based on the International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working Group guidelines for TIL assessment in invasive breast carcinoma. A review of the literature regarding the value of TIL assessment in different solid tumor types follows in part 2. The method we propose is reproducible, affordable, easily applied, and has demonstrated prognostic and predictive significance in invasive breast carcinoma. This standardized methodology may be used as a reference against which other methods are compared, and should be evaluated for clinical validity and utility. Standardization of TIL assessment will help to improve consistency and reproducibility in this field, enrich both the quality and quantity of comparable evidence, and help to thoroughly evaluate the utility of TILs assessment in this era of immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian serous carcinomas have been graded using various systems. Recently, a 2-tier system in which tumors are subdivided into low grade and high grade has been proposed. This approach is simplistic, reproducible, and based on biologic evidence indicating that both tumors develop via different pathways. Low-grade serous carcinomas exhibit low-grade nuclei with infrequent mitotic figures. They evolve from adenofibromas or borderline tumors, have frequent mutations of the KRAS, BRAF, or ERBB2 genes, and lack TP53 mutations (Type I pathway). The progression to invasive carcinoma is a slow step-wise process. Low-grade tumors are indolent and have better outcome than high-grade tumors. In contrast, high-grade serous carcinomas have high-grade nuclei and numerous mitotic figures. Identification of a precursor lesion in the ovary has been elusive and therefore the origin of ovarian carcinoma has been described as de novo. More recently, studies have suggested that a proportion seem to originate from intraepithelial carcinoma in the fallopian tube. The development of these tumors is rapid (Type II pathway). Most are characterized by TP53 mutations and lack mutations of KRAS, BRAF, or ERBB2. Although both types of serous carcinomas evolve along different pathways, rare high-grade serous carcinomas seem to arise through the Type I pathway. Immunohistochemical stains for p53, p16, and Ki-67 for distinction of low-grade from high-grade tumors are of limited value but can be helpful in selected instances. This review provides an update on the pathogenesis and clinicopathologic features of these 2 types of serous carcinomas and addresses some of the diagnostic problems that are encountered in routine practice.",

    "abstract": "In Brief An elevated serum titer of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), the least common (3% to 6%) of the 4 subclasses of IgG, is a surrogate marker for the recently characterized IgG4-related sclerosing disease. The syndrome affects predominantly middle-aged and elderly patients, with male predominance. The patients present with symptoms referable to the involvement of 1 or more sites, usually in the form of mass lesions. The prototype is IgG4-related sclerosing pancreatitis (also known as autoimmune pancreatitis), most commonly presenting as painless obstructive jaundice with or without a pancreatic mass. Other common sites of involvement are the hepatobiliary tract, salivary gland, orbit, and lymph node, but practically any organ-site can be affected, such as retroperitoneum, aorta, mediastinum, soft tissue, skin, central nervous system, breast, kidney, prostate, upper aerodigestive tract, and lung. The patients usually have a good general condition, with no fever or constitutional symptoms. Common laboratory findings include raised serum globulin, IgG, IgG4, and IgE, whereas lactate dehydrogenase is usually not raised. Some patients have low titers of autoantibodies (such as antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor). The disease often shows excellent response to steroid therapy. The natural history is characterized by the development of multiple sites of involvement with time, sometimes after many years. However, the disease can remain localized to 1 site in occasional patients. The main pathologic findings in various extranodal sites include lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, lymphoid follicle formation, sclerosis and obliterative phlebitis, accompanied by atrophy and loss of the specialized structures of the involved tissue (such as secretory acini in pancreas, salivary gland, or lacrimal gland). The relative predominance of the lymphoplasmacytic and sclerotic components results in 3 histologic patterns: pseudolymphomatous, mixed, and sclerosing. Immunostaining shows increased IgG4+ cells in the involved tissues (>50 per high-power field, with IgG4/IgG ratio >40%). The lymph nodes show multicentric Castleman disease-like features, reactive follicular hyperplasia, interfollicular expansion, or progressive transformation of germinal centers, with the unifying feature being an increase in IgG4+ plasma cells on immunostaining. The nature and pathogenesis of IgG4-related sclerosing disease are still elusive. Occasionally, the disease can be complicated by the development of malignant lymphoma and possibly carcinoma.

    "abstract": "Soft tissue tumors are a relatively rare and diagnostically challenging group of neoplasms that can have varying lines of differentiation. Accurate diagnosis is important for appropriate treatment and prognostication. In the 8 years since the publication of the 4th Edition of World Health Organization (WHO) classification of soft tissue tumors, significant advances have been made in our understanding of soft tissue tumor molecular biology and diagnostic criteria. The 5th Edition of the 2020 WHO classification of tumors of soft tissue and bone incorporated these changes. Classification of tumors, in general, but particularly in soft tissue tumors, is increasingly based on the molecular characteristics of tumor types. Understanding tumor molecular genetics improves diagnostic accuracy for tumors that have been difficult to classify on the basis of morphology alone, or that have overlapping morphologic features. In many large hospitals in the United States and Europe, molecular tests on soft tissue tumors are a routine part of diagnosis. Therefore, surgical pathologists should be familiar with newly emerging molecular genetic techniques in clinical settings. In the near future, molecular tests, particularly in soft tissue tumor diagnosis, will become as routine during diagnosis as immunohistochemistry is currently. This new edition provides an updated classification scheme and essential diagnostic criteria for soft tissue tumors. Newly recognized entities and subtypes of existing tumor types, several reclassified tumors, and newly defined molecular and genetic data have been incorporated. Herein, we summarize the updates in the WHO 5th Edition, focusing on major changes in each category of soft tissue tumor, and the newly described tumor entities and subtypes.",

These less common subtypes of Castleman disease are less familiar, and may be under-recognized. Also of practical importance, current authors are restructuring the classification of multicentric Castleman disease to accommodate the emerging pathogenic role of human herpes virus-8 and its association with the recently described plasmablastic variant. In addition to an increased risk of lymphoma, patients with Castleman disease also are at increased risk for other related neoplasms, including Kaposi sarcoma and follicular dendritic cell tumors, which are of prognostic and therapeutic relevance.

This review outlines the historical development of classification of childhood RMS and the challenges that have been associated with it, particularly problems with the diagnosis of \"solid variant\" ARMS and its distinction from ERMS. In addition to differences in clinical presentation and outcome, a number of genetic features underpin separation of ERMS from ARMS. Genetic differences associated with RMS subclassification include the presence of reciprocal translocations and their associated fusions in ARMS, amplification of genes in ARMS and its fusion subsets, chromosomal losses and gains that mostly occur in ERMS, and allelic losses and mutations usually associated with ERMS. Chimeric proteins encoded in most ARMS from the fusion of PAX3 or PAX7 with FOXO1 are expressed, result in a distinct pattern of downstream protein expression, and appear to be the proximate cause of the bad outcome associated with this subtype. A sizeable minority of ARMS lacks these fusions and shares the clinical and biological features of ERMS. A battery of immunohistochemical tests may prove useful in separating ERMS from ARMS and fusion-positive ARMS from fusion-negative ARMS. Because of limitation of predicting outcome solely based on histologic classification, treatment protocols will begin to utilize fusion testing for stratification of affected patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups.",

    "abstract": "The concept that the pattern of metastatic spread of cancer is not random and that cancer cells exhibit preferences when metastasizing to organs, dates back to 1889 when Steven Paget published his “seed and soil” hypothesis. He proposed that the spread of tumor cells is governed by interaction and cooperation between the cancer cells (seed) and the host organ (soil). Extensive studies during the last several decades have provided a better understanding of the process of metastatic spread of cancer and several stages such as intravasation, extravasation, tumor latency, and development of micrometastasis and macrometastasis have been defined. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the target organs may be prepared for metastatic deposits by the development of premetastatic niches. This specialized microenvironment is involved in promoting tumor cell homing, colonization, and subsequent growth at the target organ. The premetastatic niche consists of accumulation of aberrant immune cells and extracellular matrix proteins in target organs. The primary tumor plays a key role in the development of premetastatic niches by producing tumor-derived soluble factors which mobilize bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells to the premetastatic niche. Exosomes-derived from the primary tumor also contribute to cancer-favorable microenvironment in the premetastatic niches. These changes prime the initially healthy organ microenvironment and render it amenable for subsequent metastatic cell colonization.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models are forms of artificial intelligence that use deep learning algorithms to decipher large amounts of text and exhibit strong capabilities like question answering and translation. Recently, an influx of Large Language Models has emerged in the medical and academic discussion, given their potential widespread application to improve patient care and provider workflow. One application that has gained notable recognition in the literature is ChatGPT, which is a natural language processing “chatbot” technology developed by the artificial intelligence development software company OpenAI. It learns from large amounts of text data to generate automated responses to inquiries in seconds. In health care and academia, chatbot systems like ChatGPT have gained much recognition recently, given their potential to become functional, reliable virtual assistants. However, much research is required to determine the accuracy, validity, and ethical concerns of the integration of ChatGPT and other chatbots into everyday practice. One such field where little information and research on the matter currently exists is pathology. Herein, we present a literature review of pertinent articles regarding the current status and understanding of ChatGPT and its potential application in routine diagnostic pathology. In this review, we address the promises, possible pitfalls, and future potential of this application. We provide examples of actual conversations conducted with the chatbot technology that mimic hypothetical but practical diagnostic pathology scenarios that may be encountered in routine clinical practice. On the basis of this experience, we observe that ChatGPT and other chatbots already have a remarkable ability to distill and summarize, within seconds, vast amounts of publicly available data and information to assist in laying a foundation of knowledge on a specific topic. We emphasize that, at this time, any use of such knowledge at the patient care level in clinical medicine must be carefully vetted through established sources of medical information and expertise. We suggest and anticipate that with the ever-expanding knowledge base required to reliably practice personalized, precision anatomic pathology, improved technologies like future versions of ChatGPT (and other chatbots) enabled by expanded access to reliable, diverse data, might serve as a key ally to the diagnostician. Such technology has real potential to further empower the time-honored paradigm of histopathologic diagnoses based on the integrative cognitive assessment of clinical, gross, and microscopic findings and ancillary immunohistochemical and molecular studies at a time of exploding biomedical knowledge.",

As a group, they are relatively common in the craniofacial complex, especially the jaws. Although the general concept of BFOL is relatively well known, specific diagnostic interpretation of individual cases is often challenging. New concepts and controversies have arisen over the past 10 to 15 years regarding classification and diagnostic criteria. However, among the new theories and contentions, there is now essential agreement that the osseous dysplasias represent a single disease process, while the so-called “juvenile active ossifying fibroma” and other “aggressive,” “active,” “psammomatoid” ossifying/cementifying fibromas remain controversial. This review is presented to update the surgical pathologist on the various entities comprising the spectrum of BFOL and to examine the criteria for their diagnosis.",

In order to alleviate the dismal prognosis associated with this disease, it is imperative that pancreatic cancer be recognized and treated prior to invasion. Understanding the morphology and biology of precursor lesions of invasive pancreatic cancer has therefore become an issue of paramount importance. In the last decade, significant progress has been in the recognition and appropriate classification of these precursor lesions, and the current review will focus on our state-of-the-art knowledge on this topic. Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) encompass the three known morphologically distinct precursors to invasive pancreatic cancer. In addition to discussion of the \"classic\" precursor entities, this review will also address some of the recent diagnostic controversies for these lesions, in particular features that distinguish IPMNs from PanIN lesions. Finally, the potential clinical impact of recognizing these precursor lesions in the context of early detection of pancreatic cancer will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "This review considers the pathologic features of endometrioid carcinoma of the uterine corpus, which accounts for approximately 80% of endometrial adenocarcinomas, with an emphasis on its histologic features, recent advances, and problematic aspects. In addition to typical endometrioid carcinoma, the variants of endometrioid carcinoma covered include secretory carcinoma, villoglandular endometrioid carcinoma, endometrioid carcinoma with small nonvillous papillae, endometrioid carcinomas with microglandular and sertoliform patterns, and endometrioid carcinomas with metaplastic changes. These changes include a variety of different appearances of squamous epithelia (ranging from mature and keratinizing to immature with only subtle evidence of a squamous nature), clear cells, surface changes resembling syncytial metaplasia or microglandular hyperplasia, ciliated cells, oxyphilic cells, and spindled epithelial cells (sarcomatoid carcinoma). The last is one of several variants that may cause a biphasic appearance, all of which should be distinguished from the malignant müllerian mixed tumor. Rare findings in endometrioid carcinomas include hyalinization, psammoma bodies, and foci of stromal metaplasia such as osteoid. Unusual growth patterns of endometrioid carcinomas include involvement of adenomyosis, the \"diffusely\" infiltrating pattern of myoinvasion, and a previously unemphasized pattern of myoinvasion with \"pinched off\" glands that may be cystic or have a pseudovascular appearance, often with a myxoid stromal reaction. Other aspects of endometrioid carcinoma discussed are its immunoprofile, grading, cervical involvement (including a hitherto undescribed \"burrowing\" pattern of extension within the cervix that can result in underdiagnosis of stage IIB disease), carcinoma arising in the lower uterine segment, carcinoma arising in polyps and adenomyomas, carcinoma in young women, tamoxifen-related carcinoma, associated ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, and peritoneal keratin granulomas. Finally, the differential diagnosis of endometrioid carcinoma is briefly considered with a section on benign mimics, including curettage-related changes, menstrual changes, adenomyosis-related problems, metaplastic changes, atypical polypoid adenomyoma, radiation atypia, and papillary proliferations, and a section on metastatic colonic carcinoma.",

Noncentral nervous system extragonadal GCTs are found in a variety of anatomic locations, but most commonly affect the mediastinum and sacrococcygeal region. Predicting behavior in these tumors can be confusing because it is based on a combination of varying factors including patient age, histologic subtype, anatomic site, and clinical stage. This review attempts to dissect these issues by separating the discussion into 3 age groups: neonatal (congenital), children (prepubertal), and adult (postpubertal). Within each individual age group, we cover the significance of anatomic site, morphology, and staging parameters. In addition, we discuss the spectrum of associated secondary malignancies and their impact on patient outcome.

    "abstract": "p16 is a cyclin-dependent kinase-4 inhibitor that is expressed in a limited range of normal tissues and tumors. In recent years, immunohistochemistry with p16 antibodies has been used as a diagnostic aid in various scenarios in gynecologic pathology. Diffuse (as opposed to focal) positivity with p16 in the cervix can be regarded as a surrogate marker of the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). In cervical squamous lesions, p16 is positive in most high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and in some cases of low-grade CIN, usually those associated with high-risk HPV. p16 may be useful to identify small focal high-grade CIN lesions, to distinguish some cases of CIN involving immature metaplastic squamous epithelium from immature metaplastic squamous epithelium not involved by CIN and to distinguish high-grade CIN from benign mimics. Most cervical carcinomas of squamous, glandular, and small cell type are p16-positive. In cervical glandular lesions, p16 is useful, as part of a panel, in the distinction between adenocarcinoma in situ (diffusely positive) and benign mimics, including tuboendometrial metaplasia and endometriosis, which are usually p16-negative or focally positive. p16 may be used, in combination with other markers, to distinguish between a cervical adenocarcinoma (diffuse positivity) and an endometrioid-type endometrial adenocarcinoma (negative or focally positive). Some uterine serous carcinomas are diffusely positive. In the vulva, p16 is positive in HPV-associated vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) but negative in VIN not associated with HPV. Similarly, HPV-associated invasive squamous carcinomas are p16-positive, whereas the more common non-HPV-associated neoplasms are largely negative or focally positive. In the uterus, p16 positivity is more common and widespread in leiomyosarcomas than leiomyomas, and this may be a useful aid to diagnosis, although problematic uterine smooth muscle neoplasms have not been extensively studied. Metastatic cervical adenocarcinomas in the ovary are usually diffusely p16-positive, and because these may closely mimic a primary ovarian endometrioid or mucinous adenocarcinoma, this may be a valuable diagnostic aid, although p16 expression in primary ovarian adenocarcinomas of these morphologic subtypes has not been widely investigated. Some ovarian serous carcinomas, similar to their uterine counterparts, are p16-positive.",

RET functions as a multicompetent receptor complex that includes αGFRs and RET. Somatic rearrangements of RET designated as RET/PTC (from papillary thyroid carcinoma) were identified in papillary thyroid carcinoma before RET was recognized as the susceptibility gene for MEN2. There are now at least at least 15 types of RET/PTC rearrangements involving RET and 10 different genes. RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 are by far the most common rearrangements. All of the rearrangements are due to DNA damage and result in the fusion of the RET tyrosine-kinase (RET-TK) domain to the 5`-terminal region of heterologous genes. RET/PTC rearrangements are very common in radiation-induced tumors but have been detected in variable proportions of sporadic (i.e., non–radiation associated) papillary carcinomas. It is estimated that up to approximately half the papillary thyroid carcinomas in the United States and Canada harbor RET/PTC rearrangements, most commonly RET/PTC-1, followed by RET/PTC-3 and occasionally RET/PTC-2. The cause of these rearrangements in sporadic papillary carcinomas is not known, but the close association between their presence and the papillary carcinoma phenotype indicates that they play a causative role in tumor development. The proposed mechanisms of RET/PTC-induced tumorigenesis and the clinical and pathologic implications of RET/PTC activation are discussed.",

MEC is usually subclassified as low, intermediate, or high grade on the basis of its histologic features, including the presence of cystic spaces, cellular differentiation, proportion of mucous cells, growth pattern, type of invasion, and cytologic atypia. Because even low-grade neoplasms may metastasize, the term mucoepidermoid tumor is inappropriate. The 3-level grading approach to tumor classification has found general acceptance among pathologists; differences in biologic behavior can be demonstrated even though clinical stage has become a better prognosticator. However, in the case of MEC, no universal agreement exists regarding which histologic grading criteria are most the useful, and grading has varied. These issues have led to the investigation of more subjective systems. We describe these new schemes, the histologic variants of MEC, and the ancillary methods that allow for further stratification of patients with MEC, especially for patients with grade 2 tumors, which have a variable and unpredictable clinical course.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Endometrial stromal tumors are reviewed with emphasis on their wide morphologic spectrum and problems in differential diagnosis, highlighting issues that have received particular attention in the recent literature. These neoplasms are divided into two major categories—endometrial stromal nodules and endometrial stromal sarcomas—a distinction made on the basis of the lack of significant infiltration at the periphery of the former. The division of endometrial stromal sarcomas into low-grade and high-grade categories has fallen out of favor and the designation endometrial stromal sarcoma is now considered best restricted to neoplasms that were formally referred to as \"low-grade\" stromal sarcoma. Endometrial sarcomas without recognizable evidence of a definite endometrial stromal phenotype, designated poorly differentiated \"endometrial sarcomas,\" are almost invariably high grade and often resemble the mesenchymal component of a malignant mullerian mixed tumor. Two features of endometrial stromal tumors that may cause confusion are smooth muscle differentiation and epithelial patterns. Cases in the former category often have a characteristic \"starburst\" pattern of collagen formation. The most common epithelial patterns resemble those seen in ovarian sex-cord stromal tumors. Much less common is endometrioid gland differentiation. Some endometrial stromal tumors have a prominent fibrous or myxoid appearance and the myxoid tumors should be distinguished from myxoid leiomyosarcoma. Other unusual features of endometrial stromal tumors are also discussed. Lesions in the differential diagnosis of uterine endometrial stromal neoplasms include highly cellular leiomyoma, cellular intravenous leiomyomatosis, adenomyosis with sparse glands, metastatic carcinoma, and lymphoma. Endometrial stromal sarcomas at extrauterine sites may be primary or metastatic from a uterine tumor, the latter sometimes being occult and difficult to definitively establish, particularly if there is a history of a remote hysterectomy for \"leiomyomas.\" Endometrial stromal sarcomas of the ovary, whether primary or metastatic, may be difficult to distinguish from ovarian sex-cord stromal tumors. Extragenital endometrial stromal sarcomas may be confused with diverse lesions such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, hemangiopericytoma, lymphangiomyomatosis, or mesenchymal cystic hamartoma of the lung. Immunohistochemistry may play a role in evaluating these tumors and in some instances establishing the diagnosis although conventional light microscopic analysis suffices in the majority of cases. The unusual tumor, the \"uterine tumor resembling an ovarian sex-cord tumor,\" is also considered in this review as it is almost certainly of endometrial stromal derivation in many cases. These neoplasms may have a striking resemblance to granulosa cell tumors or Sertoli cell tumors, including those with a retiform pattern, and have recently been shown to be frequently inhibin positive.",

These lesions can occur in virtually any location. Benign GCTs are not uncommon, but malignant ones are rare and at times difficult to diagnose. The main morphologic feature is the granularity of the cytoplasm which is caused by a massive accumulation of lysosomes. Early suggestions that GCT may have a myoblastic origin have been discounted and use of the term granular cell myoblastoma as a designation for this tumor is discouraged. Although most investigators currently favor a Schwann cell derivation based on immunohistochemical and electron microscopic findings and advocate the designation of granular cell schwannoma, some differences exist between schwannomas and GCTs in their ultrastructural characteristics and the expression of some immunohistochemical markers. Other investigators believe that GCT is not a specific entity but rather a degenerative change that can occur not only in Schwann cells but also in a variety of other normal and neoplastic cells. Until more information becomes available, particularly that derived from cytogenetic studies, this lesion should be considered a separate entity and the descriptive designation of granular cell tumor continues to be appropriate.",

    "abstract": "Uterine smooth muscle tumors are classified according to their morphologic features that include architecture, growth pattern, cellular characteristics and constituents of the intercellular stroma. While terminologies used for the pathologic diagnosis of various subtypes may be eloquent and histologically accurate, some of these are confusing for the clinician and may also be open to interpretation by different pathologists: the labeling of atypical leiomyomas epitomizes this intricate system. Clinically, it is probably more useful to classify them as either tumors with or tumors without recurrent and/or metastatic potential. The term \"atypical leiomyoma\" has been used to label tumors that have a low risk of recurrence and is synonymous with benign tumors. The latter are known variously as leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei, symplastic leiomyoma, or pleomorphic leiomyoma. Variants of benign uterine smooth muscle tumors, such as mitotically active leiomyoma, cellular and highly cellular leiomyoma, epithelioid leiomyoma, and myxoid leiomyoma each have distinctive hallmarks that enable subclassification. Nevertheless, they may occasionally possess one or more unusual features that are cause for alarm. Tumors that have a dissecting growth pattern, with or without extrauterine extension, may mimic malignancy both grossly and microscopically. The current review discusses the pathologic diagnosis of and terminology applied to selected variants of uterine smooth muscle tumors other than the ordinary leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas with emphasis on unusual reported features that may indicate malignancy. This includes an update on uterine smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP), intravenous leiomyomatosis, benign metastasizing leiomyoma, and diffuse leiomyomatosis. Their clinicopathologic features, differential diagnoses, and management options based on findings in the previously reported cases will also be reviewed.",

    "abstract": "The Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) comprises morphologically heterogeneous tumors that are characterized by nonrandom chromosomal translocations involving the EWS gene and one of several members of the ETS family of transcription factors. The translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) is the most common and leads to the formation of the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, which contributes to ESFT pathogenesis by modulating the expression of target genes. Tumors may be composed of small uniform cells with minimal morphologic evidence of differentiation, or they may be composed of larger, less uniform cells with varying degrees of neuroectodermal differentiation. CD99 expression is identified in nearly all ESFT and constitutes a useful positive marker when used as part of a panel of immunostains that can help rule out other differential diagnostic considerations. Molecular diagnostic tests commonly used to detect the presence of ESFT-specific translocations include RT-PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Current therapy for patients with ESFT includes chemotherapy and surgery with or without radiation therapy. At present, the most significant prognostic factor for patients with ESFT is whether the disease is localized or metastatic.",

    "abstract": "This review considers historical aspects of metastatic tumors to the ovary, general principles that aid in their evaluation, and metastatic mucinous tumors, including the Krukenberg tumor. The historical timeline on the Krukenberg tumor dates back to the legendary Sir James Paget and the story is followed through the well-known, albeit flawed, contribution of Friedrich Krukenberg and others who have contributed important papers over the years, including the overlooked contribution of the French investigator Gauthier-Villars. Knowledge of metastatic colorectal carcinoma is traced back to the famed British surgeon Sir John Bland-Sutton and followed through to more recent contributions, including the important one of Lash and Hart. Contributions on mucinous tumors conclude the historical perspective, note being made of the recent evidence suggesting that the long held contention of Dr Robert E. Scully that ovarian mucinous tumors in patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei usually originate from the appendix is correct. The section on general principles highlights the many clinical, gross, microscopic, and special techniques such as immunohistochemistry that may aid in determining that an ovarian tumor is metastatic with emphasis on the first 3 mentioned aspects. Problematic features such as a tendency for metastatic tumors to be cystic, even when the primary tumors are not, and for many metastatic tumors to mature in the ovary (so-called maturation phenomenon), are emphasized. Of the many helpful findings that resolve the problem, the characteristic features of surface implants are highlighted. The contribution on the Krukenberg tumor reviews the varied microscopy of this tumor pointing out that the well-known pattern of signet-ring cells in a cellular stroma, albeit characteristic, is often not striking and frequently overshadowed by other microscopic features. The latter include, in many cases, a rather unique microcystic pattern. The final portion of the essay reviews mucinous tumors of non-Krukenberg type, beginning with those that originate from the appendix. The appendiceal neoplasms have distinctive features in most cases being particularly well differentiated, and this is also seen in their ovarian metastases. Other mucinous tumors that commonly simulate closely metastatic neoplasms, include those from the pancreas in particular, but also diverse other sites, are then reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) have perplexed pathologists for decades, undergoing multiple adjustments in nomenclature as their lineage and functions have been characterized. Although PDCs account for less than 0.1% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, they serve as a principal source of interferon-alpha and are also known as interferon-I producing cells (IPCs). Upon activation in vitro, they can differentiate into dendritic cells, and recent studies have substantiated a potential role in antigen presentation. Thus, PDCs may act as a link between innate and adaptive immunity. Normally found in small quantities in primary and secondary lymphoid organs, PDCs accumulate in a variety of inflammatory conditions, including Kikuchi-Fujimoto lymphadenopathy, hyaline-vascular Castleman disease, and autoimmune diseases, and in certain malignancies such as classical Hodgkin lymphoma and carcinomas. Demonstrating potential for neoplastic transformation reflective of varying stages of maturation, clonal proliferations range from PDC nodules most commonly associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia to the rare but highly aggressive malignancy now known as blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). Formerly called blastic natural killer cell lymphoma or CD4/CD56 hematodermic neoplasm, BPDCN, unlike natural killer cell lymphomas, is not associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection and is generally not curable with treatment regimens for non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In fact, this entity is no longer considered to be a lymphoma and instead represents a unique precursor hematopoietic neoplasm. Acute leukemia therapy regimens may lead to sustained clinical remission of BPDCN, with bone marrow transplantation in first complete remission potentially curative in adult patients.",

    "abstract": "This is the second of a two-part consideration of metastatic tumors to the ovary. Here, the matter is considered in 16 categories, largely site-specific. The first tumor discussed is gastric carcinoma of intestinal-type whose ovarian manifestations have been the subject of a recent paper which emphasized its differences from the Krukenberg tumor. Coverage of intestinal adenocarcinoma emphasizes the landmark 1987 paper of RH Lash and WR Hart. The section on pancreatic neoplasms reemphasizes the problems caused by metastatic ductal carcinoma, considered primarily in Part I, and discusses less common issues such as spread of neuroendocrine and acinar cell carcinomas. The limited information on spread of tumors of the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts is then reviewed before more detailed consideration of hepatic neoplasms, prompted by recent contributions on hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the latter based on significant experience with this problem in Thailand. The section on appendiceal neoplasms highlights ovarian spread of diverse tumors ranging from typical intestinal-type adenocarcinoma to signet-ring cell carcinomas with various patterns which in the ovary may prompt diagnoses such as a goblet cell (mucinous) carcinoid tumor, but whose ovarian features place them in the category of a Krukenberg tumor. The diverse problems in differential diagnosis of carcinoid tumor (provoked by nested, acinar, and other patterns, including folliclelike spaces) are then reviewed. The section on breast cancer emphasizes that, although usually a manifestation of late stage disease and often not bulky in the ovaries, metastatic breast cancer may form large masses which can represent the clinical presentation. That patients with breast cancer have an increased risk of primary ovarian cancer and that the latter is more common than secondary spread of breast cancer is noted. The section on lung tumors largely reflects information in a recent paper that small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are the lung cancers that spread to the ovary most commonly. The extremely broad differential diagnosis posed by metastatic malignant melanoma ranging from that of an oxyphilic tumor, to a small cell tumor, to a follicle-forming neoplasm, is then considered. The sections on renal cell carcinoma and other urinary tract neoplasms emphasize the differential diagnosis of metastatic clear cell carcinoma and primary clear cell carcinoma, an issue usually resolvable by an awareness of the various features of the ovarian variant, rarely or never seen in the renal variant. The section on metastatic sarcomas discusses endometrial stromal sarcomas, gastrointestinal stromal neoplasms, and miscellaneous other sarcomas. The endometrial stromal tumors are problematic largely because the history of a primary tumor may be remote, in the ovaries the typical growth and vascular pattern of endometrial stromal neoplasms is not always conspicuous, and some endometrial stromal sarcomas in the ovary show sex cordlike patterns of growth. Recent information has indicated that gastrointestinal stromal tumors may rarely have significant ovarian manifestations and if the primary neoplasm is overlooked, the ovarian tumor may be misdiagnosed, usually as an ovarian fibromatous tumor, but potentially as another primary neoplasm. The sections on ovarian spread of uterine carcinomas emphasize the problems owing to cervical adenocarcinomas, which have a greater tendency to involve the ovaries than squamous cell carcinomas and can simulate primary mucinous or endometrioid cancers. The final neoplasms considered are malignant mesothelioma and the desmoplastic small round cell tumor. The microscopic features of malignant mesothelioma are so different from those of primary ovarian carcinoma in most instances that the diagnosis should be readily established on routine microscopic evaluation. The differential diagnosis of the desmoplastic small round cell tumor is more complex because of the greater overlap with the many other small cell malignant tumors that may involve the ovaries primarily or secondarily. Nonetheless, differences exist in most cases and awareness of the entity should lead to consideration of the desmoplastic neoplasm, particularly in a young female. In this area, as in a number of others considered in the review, immunohistochemistry may play a significant, sometimes crucial, role. However, as pointed out in brief concluding remarks, despite the aid of that modality, as in surgical pathology overall, careful consideration of the clinical background, distribution of disease, gross characteristics and spectrum of routine microscopic findings, will lead to the correct diagnosis in the majority of cases and at the very least lead to formulation of a considered differential diagnosis such that use of special techniques may be judicious and those results placed in context of the time-honored clinical and pathologic features.",

    "abstract": "Molecular therapies targeting HER2 are part of the established drug armamentarium in breast carcinoma. Now the ToGA trial, an international multicenter phase III clinical study, involving 24 countries globally, has shown that the anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab is effective in prolonging survival in HER2-positive carcinoma of the stomach and the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Similarly to breast carcinoma, >20% of gastric cancers show HER2 overexpression and/or amplification, and this percentage increases to 33% in GEJ tumors. Thus, as in breast carcinoma, pathologists are now asked to evaluate HER2 status in gastric carcinoma samples. As validated in the ToGA trial, the HER2 testing criteria that must be used in evaluating both gastric carcinoma biopsies and surgical specimens significantly differ from those routinely applied in breast carcinoma. The main variations with regard to the pattern of reactivity in HER2-expressing cells are as follows: the completeness of membrane staining is not a \"conditio sine qua non\" and the number of stained cells necessary to consider a case as positive is different. We must also take note of the much more frequent heterogeneity of HER2 positivity in gastric cancer compared with breast carcinoma and the less stringent correlation between HER2 amplification and protein overexpression that is observed in gastric carcinoma, where more than 20% of cases may carry HER2 amplification, although of low level, without HER2 expression. In these patients, in the ToGA trial, there was no apparent benefit from adding Trastuzumab to chemotherapy: for this reason the European Medicines Agency, while approving usage of Trastuzumab for metastatic adenocarcinoma treatment, indicated HER2 testing by immunohistochemistry as first evaluation assay, followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 2+ equivocal cases. HER2 testing in gastric carcinoma is a new field, opening several opportunities: for patients with gastric cancer, this is a new promising therapeutic option; for pathologists, strengthening our role in therapy selection and emphasizing our duty of providing accurate and reproducible HER2 testing results; for all interested in understanding the biology of gastric and GEJ cancer and in discovering new possible molecular therapy targets.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial stromal tumors are rare uterine mesenchymal neoplasms that have intrigued pathologists for years, not only because they commonly pose diagnostic dilemmas, but also because the classification and pathogenesis of these tumors has been widely debated. The current World Health Organization recognizes 4 categories of endometrial stromal tumor: endometrial stromal nodule (ESN), low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LG-ESS), high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (HG-ESS), and undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (UUS). uterine sarcoma. These categories are defined by the presence of distinct translocations as well as tumor morphology and prognosis. Specifically, the JAZF1-SUZ12 (formerly JAZF1-JJAZ1) fusion identifies a large proportion of ESN and LG-ESSs, whereas the YWHAE-FAM22 translocation identifies HG-ESSs. The latter tumors appear to have a prognosis intermediate between LG-ESS and UUS, which exhibits no specific translocation pattern. This review (1) presents the clinicopathologic features of endometrial stromal tumors; (2) discusses their immunophenotype; and (3) highlights the recent advances in molecular genetics which explain their pathogenesis and lend support for a new classification system.",

    "abstract": "Long considered to be ectopic breast tissue representing the caudal remnants of the milk ridges, anogenital mammary-like glands are nowadays thought to represent a normal constituent of the anogenital area. Lesions involving these glands, benign or malignant, epithelial or stromal manifest a striking similarity to their mammary counterparts. This review addresses the recent literature on lesions of anogenital mammary-like glands and our personal experience with various lesions related to these structures. Discussed are the normal anatomy and histology of these glands as well as the clinical presentation, histopathological and immunohistochemical features, molecular biological aspects, and differential diagnosis of various lesions involving anogenital mammary-like glands, including lactating adenoma, hidradenoma papilliferum, hidradenocarcinoma papilliferum, fibroadenomas, phyllodes tumor, pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia, extramammary Paget disease, and other carcinomas. In addition, \"nonspecific\" epithelial or stromal changes some of which can be likened to similar changes occurring in a range of benign breast disease, including sclerosing adenosis, columnar cell lesions, ductal lesions and various metaplastic changes affecting epithelium and myoepithelium are discussed. Although lesions of anogenital mammary-like glands are often discussed in many dermatopathology textbooks in the context of cutaneous adnexal neoplasms we advocate that the best approach to the diagnosis of these lesions is to relate them to analogous well recognized lesions occurring in the breast, that is, through the eyes of a breast pathologist. This will enable their recognition, precise classification and should introduce greater uniformity in how they are reported in the literature so that more meaningful clinicopathological comparisons and correlations may be made.",

Although a majority of SMARCB1-deficient neoplasms arise de novo, the origin of SMARCB1-deficient neoplasia in the background of a phenotypically or genetically definable differentiated SMARCB1-intact \"parent neoplasm\" has been convincingly demonstrated, highlighting the rare occurrence of rhabdoid tumors as \"double-hit neoplasia.\" As a group, SMARCB1-deficient neoplasms occur over a wide age range (0 to 80 y), may be devoid of rhabdoid cells or display uniform rhabdoid morphology, and follow a clinical course that varies from benign to highly aggressive causing death within a few months irrespective of aggressive multimodality therapy. Generally applicable criteria that would permit easy recognition of these uncommon neoplasms do not exist.

    "abstract": "A variety of benign and malignant endocervical glandular lesions exhibiting gastric differentiation has been described in the past decade that has resulted in the concept of an important category of cervical adenocarcinoma which is unrelated to human papillomavirus (HPV). Both minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA), also known as adenoma malignum, and the benign lesion lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), have been known for some time to exhibit a gastric phenotype and immunophenotype (HIK1083 and/or MUC6 positive). Accumulated evidence suggests that a subset of LEGH (atypical LEGH) exhibits a degree of cytologic and/or architectural atypia which, in some cases, may be associated with and be a precursor of adenocarcinomas exhibiting gastric differentiation, including MDA. Gastric-type adenocarcinoma (GAS), a recently described subtype of cervical adenocarcinoma, is an emerging clinicopathologic entity. These neoplasms exhibit a spectrum of differentiation, including MDA as its very well-differentiated form, are unrelated to HPV, and exhibit aggressive clinical behavior. It is proposed that a LEGH-GAS sequence exists and, from a practical point of view, the development of optimal biomarkers is awaited to assist in early detection of GAS and atypical LEGH, as current HPV-targeted screening generally does not detect these lesions and strategies employing HPV vaccination will not prevent their occurrence. Pathologists should be familiar with the morphologic spectrum of these benign, premalignant, and malignant cervical glandular lesions exhibiting gastric differentiation. They are occasionally associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome or are a component of \"synchronous mucinous metaplasia and neoplasia of the female genital tract.\"",

    "abstract": "Mullerian adenosarcoma is an uncommon, but not rare, mixed tumor containing a neoplastic but benign or mildly atypical epithelial element and a sarcomatous, usually low-grade, stromal component. The most common site is the uterine corpus but adenosarcoma also occurs in the cervix and ovary and more rarely in the vagina, fallopian tube, arising from peritoneal surfaces, or outside the female genital tract, for example in the intestine. Most uterine cases have a polypoid gross appearance, sometimes resulting in the formation of multiple polyps. Characteristic histologic features include a low power \"phyllodes-like\" architecture with leaf-like projections lined by a variety of benign Mullerian type epithelia, sometimes with squamous metaplasia. Intraglandular stromal protrusions are a characteristic feature. The stroma may be uniformly cellular but there is typically increased cellularity around the epithelial elements, resulting in the formation of a cambium layer. Using the World Health Organization definition, stromal mitotic activity of 2 or more per 10 high-power fields is required for a diagnosis of adenosarcoma but in practice the diagnosis is made with stromal mitotic activity less than this if the characteristic architecture and cambium layer is present. The stromal component is usually morphologically \"low-grade\" and of endometrial stromal or fibroblastic type (hormone receptor and CD10 positive). Sometimes it is high grade, resembling undifferentiated sarcoma. Additional features sometimes present include heterologous stromal elements or sex cord-like differentiation. Uterine adenosarcomas are, in general, low-grade neoplasms capable of local recurrence after polypectomy or hysterectomy and much less commonly distant metastasis. The 2 most important adverse prognostic factors, which sometimes coexist, are deep myometrial invasion and sarcomatous overgrowth; the latter is usually associated with morphologically \"high-grade\" stromal elements with loss of expression of hormone receptors and CD10. Adenosarcoma may be confused with a variety of lesions and one of the main differential diagnoses is adenofibroma in which the stromal component is, by definition, morphologically benign. However, occasional adenofibromas recur or even metastasize. As such, it has been suggested that all adenofibromas should be classified as adenosarcomas, albeit with low-malignant potential. Ovarian adenosarcomas are much more likely to exhibit malignant behavior than their uterine counterparts, probably due to the lack of an anatomic barrier to peritoneal dissemination.",

    "abstract": "Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome attributable to deleterious germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The syndrome is typified by early-onset, frequently right-sided colorectal cancers (CRCs) with characteristic histologic features and tendency for multiplicity and an increased risk for extracolonic tumors at particular sites; it accounts for 1% to 5% of CRC. Deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) function manifests as immunohistochemically detectable absence of one or more MMR proteins and microsatellite instability (MSI). Approximately 15% of sporadic, noninherited CRC are characterized by high-level MSI, nearly always owing to transcriptional silencing of MLH1; these sporadic and LS cases exhibit considerable phenotypic overlap. Identification of CRC with dMMR is desirable to identify LS and because MSI status is prognostic and potentially predictive. This review will discuss the history of LS, the principles of MMR and MSI, the clinicopathologic features of LS-associated and sporadic high-level MSI CRC, the fundamentals of clinical testing for dMMR CRC, and the results of the Columbus-area Lynch syndrome study. We conclude with our approach to population-based LS screening based on institutional experience with nearly 2000 cases.",

    "abstract": "Papillary thyroid carcinomas are the most common endocrine cancer and are usually associated with good survival. However, some variants of papillary thyroid carcinomas may behave more aggressively than classic papillary thyroid carcinomas. The tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common aggressive variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The aggressive behavior has been ascribed to the histologic subtype and/or to the clinicopathologic features, an issue that remains controversial. The columnar variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma can be aggressive, particularly in older patients, with larger tumors showing a diffusely infiltrative growth pattern and extrathyroidal extension. A papillary thyroid carcinoma is designated as solid/trabecular variant when all or nearly all of a tumor not belonging to any of the other variants has a solid, trabecular, or nested (insular) appearance. This tumor must be distinguished from poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma which has the same growth pattern but lacks nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma and may show tumor necrosis and high mitotic activity. New to the fourth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumours of Endocrine Organs , the hobnail variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma is a moderately differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma variant with aggressive clinical behavior and significant mortality. All of these variants are histologically unique and important to recognize due to their aggressive behavior.",

They share several clinical and morphologic features including their blue tinctorial properties, the presence of a dermal proliferation of spindle, fusiform or ovoid cells, associated melanin pigment (both within the melanocytic tumor cells and also within macrophages) and stromal sclerosis and, at least focal positivity for HMB-45 (Gp100). Some variants, such as deep penetrating nevus, often show considerable variation in nuclear size and shape, and, as a consequence, are at risk of being misdiagnosed as melanoma by those unfamiliar with their characteristic morphologic features. The so-called malignant blue nevus is a controversial term denoting melanomas arising in association with or exhibiting some morphologic similarities to blue nevus. There are also lesions that are probably related to blue nevi, such as the recently described pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma and the neurocristic hamartomas, whose nature, biologic behavior, and relationship to the better established entities remains to be clearly established. This review aims to present a brief overview of these lesions, highlighting their pathologic characteristics, distinguishing features and potential diagnostic pitfalls, with particular emphasis on recently described entities, molecular findings, controversial areas, and approaches to diagnosis.",

Papillary renal cell carcinoma is usually divided histologically into 2 types namely, type 1 and type 2. This classification, however, is unsatisfactory as many of papillary carcinoma are unclassifiable by the existing criteria. In recent years there has been a remarkable progress in our understanding of the molecular basis of PRCC. These studies have revealed that type 2 PRCCs represent a heterogenous group which may be subdivided into additional subtypes based on the genetic and molecular make up of these tumors and reflecting different clinical course and prognosis. Some of the molecular features such a hypermethylation of CPG islands in the promotor regions of genes and over expression of the antioxidant pathways within tumor cells have been recognized as markers of poor prognosis. Targeted therapies for papillary carcinoma in the past have been unsuccessful because of lack of clear understanding of the molecular basis of these tumors. It is hoped that recent progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis of various subtypes of PRCC, effective targeted therapies will eventually emerge in due course.",

MYC rearrangement is a recurring genetic abnormality in several aggressive B-cell lymphomas including: Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma; rare de novo acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, transformed follicular lymphoma, and plasmablastic lymphoma. Important distinctions in the role of MYC in these tumors likely reflect whether it is a primary or secondary genetic event. The presence of a MYC rearrangement in these diseases has diagnostic and prognostic implications and it is important for the practicing anatomic pathologist to be familiar with these issues when diagnosing aggressive B-cell lymphomas. This review provides a brief overview of MYC biology; shows the clinical and pathologic features of the aggressive B-cell lymphomas that harbor recurrent MYC rearrangements; explores the diagnostic and clinical implications of MYC rearrangements in these diseases; and outlines the techniques available to the anatomic pathologist to detect MYC deregulation.",

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the histologic subtype for which grading is most prognostically and therapeutically relevant. This tumor is graded using standard schemes in a 3-tier manner with the intermediate-grade category shows the most variability between grading systems and thus the most controversy in management. The t(11;19)(q21; p13) MECT1-MAML2 translocation may be an objective marker that can help to further stratify difficult cases. Adenoid cystic carcinomas are graded based on pattern with solid areas correlating with a worse prognosis. Occasionally, adenoid cystic carcinomas may undergo transformation to highly aggressive pleomorphic high-grade carcinomas with frequent nodal metastases. Comparative genomic hybridization has revealed several chromosomal regions (such as 1p32-p36, 6q23-q27) of prognostic interest in adenoid cystic carcinoma. Carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma is actually a category of tumors rather than a single tumor type with both aggressive and indolent versions. These tumors should be further qualified as to type/grade of carcinoma and extent, as intracapsular and minimally invasive tumors behave favorably. Acinic cell carcinomas, although generally considered low grade, can recur, metastasize, or even prove lethal in a significant number of cases suggesting amenability to a grading scheme to separate these biologic groups. Although aggressive histologic parameters (anaplasia, necrosis, and mitoses) are predictive of poor outcome, a standard grading scheme does not yet exists. Acinic cell carcinomas can also undergo high-grade transformation.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophils, a constitutive component of the columnar-lined gastrointestinal tract, play an essential role in allergic responses and parasitic infections. The tissue density of these cells also increases in a variety of conditions of uncertain etiology. With the exception of the esophageal squamous epithelium, in which no eosinophils are normally present, the population of normal eosinophils in the remainder of the luminal gut is poorly defined. Therefore, histopathologists must rely on their subjective judgment to determine when a diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis, enteritis, or colitis should be rendered. Eosinophilic esophagitis is currently the best defined and most studied eosinophilic condition of the digestive tract; therefore, the confidence in accurate diagnosis is increasing. In contrast, the characteristic clinicopathologic features of eosinophilic conditions affecting other parts of the digestive tract remain somewhat elusive. This review was designed to present pathologists with simple and practical information for the biopsy-based histopathologic diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis, gastritis, enteritis, and colitis. It was prepared by critically reviewing more than 200 articles on the topic, along with incorporating evidence accumulated through our own collective experience. We anticipate that by increasing pathologists' confidence in reporting these abnormal but often nameless eosinophilic infiltrates, we can help better define and characterize their significance.",

Prognostic models here also include models to predict treatment outcomes or responses; in the cancer literature often referred to as predictive models. Clinical prediction models have become abundant. Pathology measurement or results are frequently included as predictors in such prediction models, certainly in the cancer domain. Only when full information on all aspects of a prediction modeling study are clearly reported, risk of bias and potential usefulness of the prediction model can be adequately assessed. Many reviews have illustrated that the quality of reports on the development, validation, and/or adjusting (updating) of prediction models, is very poor. Hence, the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) initiative has developed a comprehensive and user-friendly checklist for the reporting of studies on, both diagnostic and prognostic, prediction models.

These are aggressive neoplasms with particularly poor prognosis after regional or distant metastatic disease, for which surgical resection is still the mainstay of treatment, and options for patients with metastatic disease remain undefined. There are 2 distinct variants: classic ES, which typically presents as a subcutaneous or deep dermal mass in the distal extremities of young adults and comprises nodular distributions of relatively uniform epithelioid cells with central necrosis, and the proximal variant, which has a predilection for proximal limbs and limb girdles and the midline of the trunk, which is composed of sheets of larger, more atypical cells with variable rhabdoid morphology. Both classic and proximal-type ESs are associated with the loss of SMARCB1/INI1 protein expression, but appear otherwise molecularly relatively heterogeneous.

This review gives an overview of the current knowledge of molecular mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and the role of molecular testing in the management of CRC. The majority of CRCs arise from precursor lesions such as adenoma, transforming to adenocarcinoma. Three molecular carcinogenesis pathways have been identified; (1) chromosomal instability, (2) microsatellite instability (MSI), and (3) CpG island methylator phenotype, each account for ~85%, 15%, and 17%, respectively. Evaluation of MSI status, extended RAS mutation analysis, and BRAF mutation analysis are recommended by the guideline published by joint effort from professional societies. MSI testing is important for identification of Lynch syndrome patients and prognostic and predictive markers. Extended RAS testing is an important predictive marker for antiepidermal growth factor receptor therapy. BRAF p.V600 mutation status can be used as prognostic marker, but not predictive marker for antiepidermal growth factor receptor therapies. Emerging technologies utilizing high throughput sequencing have introduced novel biomarkers and testing strategies. Tumor mutation burden predicts immunotherapy response in addition to MSI status. Liquid biopsy can be utilized when adequate tissue sample is not available or for monitoring therapy response. However, assay standardization and guidelines and recommendations for utilization of these assay will be needed. The advancement in CRC research and technologies will allow better prognostication and therapy stratification for the management of patients with CRCs.",

    "abstract": "The neuroendocrine epithelial neoplasms (NENs) include well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WDNETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PDNECs). Whereas PDNECs are highly lethal, with localized Merkel cell carcinoma somewhat of an exception, WDNETs exhibit a range of \"indolent\" biologic potentials-from benign to widely metastatic and eventually fatal. Within each of these 2 groups there is substantial morphologic overlap. In the metastatic setting, the site of origin of a WDNET has significant prognostic and therapeutic implications. In the skin, Merkel cell carcinoma must be distinguished from spread of a visceral PDNEC. This review intends to prove the thesis that determining the site of origin of a NEN is clinically vital and that diagnostic immunohistochemistry is well suited to the task. It will begin by reviewing current World Health Organization terminology for the NENs, as well as an embryologic and histologic pattern-based classification. It will present population-based data on the relative frequency and biology of WDNETs arising at various anatomic sites, including the frequency of metastases of unknown primary, and comment on limitations of contemporary imaging techniques, as a means of defining the scope of the problem. It will go on to discuss the therapeutic significance of site of origin. The heart of this review is a synthesis of data compiled from >100 manuscripts on the expression of individual markers in WDNETs and PDNECs, as regards site of origin. These include proteins that are considered \"key markers\" and others that are either useful \"secondary markers,\" potentially very useful markers that need to be further vetted, or ones that are widely applied despite a lack of efficacy. It will conclude with my approach to the metastatic NEN of unknown origin.",

ERONs include clear cell carcinoma, endometrioid carcinoma, and seromucinous borderline tumor. A growing body of evidence from both clinicopathologic and molecular studies suggests that most, if not all, ERONs develop from endometriotic cyst epithelium through different stages of tumor progression. The endometriotic cyst contains abundant iron-induced reactive oxygen species that are thought to be mutagenic, and chronic exposure of cystic epithelium to this microenvironment facilitates the accumulation of somatic mutations that ultimately result in tumor development. Molecular analyses of ERONs, including genome-wide screens, have identified several molecular genetic alterations that lead to aberrant activation or inactivation of pathways involving ARID1A, PI3K, Wnt, and PP2A. Among all molecular genetic changes identified to date, inactivating mutations of the ARID1A tumor suppressor gene are the most common in ERON.

    "abstract": "We reviewed the world literature on solitary fibrous tumors of the central nervous system from August 1996 to July 2011, focusing on both clinicopathological features and diagnostic findings. The anatomical distribution of the 220 cases reported so far reveals that most are intracranial and just over one-fifth are intraspinal. In decreasing frequency, intracranial tumors involve the supratentorial and infratentorial compartments, the pontocerebellar angle, the sellar and parasellar regions, and the cranial nerves. Intraspinal tumors are mainly located in the thoracic and cervical segments. Although most solitary fibrous tumors of the central nervous system are dural based, a small subset presents as subpial, intraparenchymal, intraventricular, or as tumors involving the nerve rootlets with no dural connection. Preoperative imaging and intraoperative findings suggest meningioma, schwannoma or neurofibroma, hemangiopericytoma, or pituitary tumors. Immunohistochemistry is critical to establish a definitive histopathological diagnosis. Vimentin, CD34, BCL2, and CD99 are the most consistently positive markers. The usual histologic type generally behaves in a benign manner if complete removal is achieved. Recurrence is anticipated when resection is subtotal or when the tumor exhibits atypical histology. The proliferative index as assessed by MIB1 labeling is of prognostic significance. Occasionally, tumors featuring conventional morphology may recur, perhaps because of minimal residual disease left behind during surgical extirpation. Rare extracranial metastases and tumor-related deaths are on record. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Stereotactic and external beam radiation therapy may be indicated for postsurgical tumor remnants and for unresectable recurrences. Long-term active surveillance of the patients is mandatory.",

    "abstract": "Digital pathology systems offer pathologists an alternate, emerging mechanism to manage and interpret information. They offer increasingly fast and scalable hardware platforms for slide scanning and software that facilitates remote viewing, slide conferencing, archiving, and image analysis. Deployed initially and validated largely within the research and biopharmaceutical industries, WSI is increasingly being implemented for direct patient care. Improvements in image quality, scan times, and imageviewing browsers will hopefully allow pathologists to more seamlessly convert to digital pathology, much like our radiology colleagues have done before us. However, WSI creates both opportunities and challenges. Although niche applications of WSI technology for clinical, educational, and research purposes are clearly successful, it is evident that several areas still require attention and careful consideration before more widespread clinical adoption of WSI takes place. These include regulatory issues, development of standards of practice and validation guidelines, workflow modifications, as well as defining situations where WSI technology will really improve practice in a cost-effective way. Current progress on these and other issues, along with improving technology, will no doubt pave the way for increased adoption over the next decade, allowing the pathology community as a whole to harness the true potential of WSI for patient care. The digital decade will likely redefine how pathology is practiced and the role of the pathologist.",

ALK-positive ALCLs consistently have chromosomal rearrangements involving the ALK gene with varied gene partners, and generally have a favorable prognosis. ALK-negative ALCLs lack ALK rearrangements and their genetic and clinical features are more variable. A subset of ALK-negative ALCLs has rearrangements in or near the DUSP22 gene and has a favorable prognosis similar to that of ALK-positive ALCL. DUSP22 rearrangements also are seen in a subset of pcALCLs. In this review, we discuss the clinical, morphologic, phenotypic, genetic, and biological features of ALCLs.",

More recently, 2 additional SGT, namely hyalinizing clear cell carcinoma and salivary duct-like carcinoma were recognized as primary lung tumors expanding the spectrum of SGT that have been described to originate in the tracheobronchial system. Primary pulmonary SGT must be clinically excluded from metastatic salivary gland neoplasms as their morphology is indistinguishable from that of their salivary gland counterparts. Little is known about the clinical behavior and best treatment approach for these unusual tumors.

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) afflicting humans has been recognized as a disease for &gt;3000 years. However, very little was known about its etiology and pathogenesis until about a century ago when increasing knowledge about anatomy and physiology of the human body gradually led to our understanding that the hormone insulin produced by the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas plays a crucial role in the metabolism of glucose and maintaining the blood sugar level within a normal range. DM is caused by inadequate insulin production (type 1) or insulin resistance (type 2). For thousands of years, DM has been considered as a disease of the kidney; however, with the understanding of the pathogenesis of DM, it became clear that diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a complication and not a cause of DM. DKD is associated with increased matrix expansion that manifests morphologically as a diffuse or nodular expansion of the mesangium and diffuse thickening of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes. Hyperglycemia plays a crucial role in the development of pathologic changes within the kidney. Once established, DKD usually undergoes a slow but relentless progression to end-stage renal disease. However, recent studies have shown that its progression can be slowed or even reversed by strict control of hyperglycemia. Morphologically, DKD may resemble several other glomerular diseases that must be ruled out before a definitive diagnosis. Patients with DM may also develop nondiabetic glomerular or interstitial diseases with or without DKD. The findings in nephrectomy specimens and the differential diagnoses are presented in detail.",

    "abstract": "The classification \"gastrointestinal stromal tumor\" (GIST) became commonplace in the 1990s and since that time various advances have characterized the GIST lineage of origin, tyrosine kinase mutations, and mechanisms of response and resistance to targeted therapies. In addition to tyrosine kinase mutations and their constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways, GISTs acquire a sequence of chromosomal aberrations. These include deletions of chromosomes 14q, 22q, 1p, and 15q, which harbor putative tumor suppressor genes required for stepwise progression from microscopic, preclinical forms of GIST (microGIST) to clinically relevant tumors with malignant potential. Recent advances extend our understanding of GIST biology beyond that of the oncogenic KIT/PDGFRA tyrosine kinases and beyond mechanisms of KIT/PDGFRA-inhibitor treatment response and resistance. These advances have characterized ETV1 as an essential interstitial cell of Cajal-GIST transcription factor in oncogenic KIT signaling pathways, and have characterized the biologically distinct subgroup of succinate dehydrogenase deficient GIST, which are particularly common in young adults. Also, recent discoveries of MAX and dystrophin genomic inactivation have expanded our understanding of GIST development and progression, showing that MAX inactivation is an early event fostering cell cycle activity, whereas dystrophin inactivation promotes invasion and metastasis.",

This new classification algorithm aims to improve the prediction of clinical outcomes and survival and help clinicians select better therapeutic strategies for patient care and management. In addition, these neuroendocrine neoplasms are capable of producing large quantity of hormones leading to clinical hormone hypersecretion syndromes. These functioning tumors include, insulinomas, glucagonomas, somatostatinomas, gastrinomas, VIPomas, serotonin-producing tumors, and ACTH-producing tumors. Although most panNENs arise as sporadic diseases, a subset of these heterogeneous tumors present as parts on inherited genetic syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, von Hippel-Lindau, neurofibromatosis type 1, tuberous sclerosis, and glucagon cell hyperplasia and neoplasia syndromes. Characteristic clinical and morphologic findings for certain functioning and syndromic panNENs should alert both pathologists and clinicians as appropriate patient management and possible genetic counseling may be necessary.",

With this principle in mind, The Paris System (TPS) Working Group, composed of cytopathologists, surgical pathologists, and urologists, has proposed and published a standardized reporting system that includes specific diagnostic categories and cytomorphologic criteria for the reliable diagnosis of high-grade urothelial carcinoma. This paper outlines the essential elements of TPS and the process that led to the formation and rationale of the reporting system. TPS Working Group, organized at the 2013 International Congress of Cytology, conceived a standardized platform on which to base cytologic interpretation of urine samples. The widespread dissemination of this approach to cytologic examination and reporting of urologic samples and the scheme’s universal acceptance by pathologists and urologists is critical for its success. For urologists, understanding the diagnostic criteria, their clinical implications, and limitations of TPS is essential if they are to utilize urine cytology and noninvasive ancillary tests in a thoughtful and practical manner. This is the first international/inclusive attempt at standardizing urinary cytology. The success of TPS will depend on the pathology and urology communities working collectively to improve this seminal paradigm shift, and optimize the impact on patient care.",

High-grade (HG) transformed tumors are composed of a conventional low-grade component characterized by specific microscopic and immunohistochemical features for the given entity, intermingled with or juxtaposed to areas of HG morphology. This is usually either poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, carcinoma not otherwise specified, or undifferentiated carcinoma, in which the original line of differentiation is lost. The HG component is composed of solid nests of anaplastic cells with large vesicular pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm. Frequent mitoses and extensive necrosis may be present. The Ki-67 labeling index is consistently higher in the HG component. The molecular genetic mechanisms responsible for HGT of salivary gland carcinomas are largely unknown, though p53 inactivation and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression and/or gene amplification have been demonstrated in the HG component in a few examples, the frequency varies for each histologic type. Salivary gland carcinomas with HGT are more aggressive than conventional carcinomas, with a higher local recurrence rate and a poorer prognosis. They have a high propensity for cervical lymph node metastasis suggesting a need for a wider resection and neck dissection. HGT of salivary gland carcinoma can occur either at initial presentation or less commonly at the time of recurrence, sometimes following postoperative radiotherapy. The potential for HGT in almost any type of salivary gland carcinoma warrants a thorough sampling of all salivary gland malignancies to prevent oversight of a HG component.",

One of the major milestones is the Food and Drug Administration approval of Paige prostate AI for a second review of prostate cancer diagnosed using core needle biopsies. However, implementation of these AI tools for routine prostate cancer diagnostics is still lacking. Some of the limiting factors include costly digital pathology workflow, lack of regulatory guidelines for deployment of AI, and lack of prospective studies demonstrating the actual benefits of AI algorithms.

    "abstract": "Summary: The histopathologic status of excisional margins of malignant neoplasms has long been used as a potential indicator for recurrences and prognosis. The predictive ability of the margin, however, is far from satisfactory. Perhaps nowhere else in oncologic pathology has the significance of these margins been as intensively studied as in squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tracts. This review is, in part, a critique of current applications and the clinical implications of surgical margins for the removal of squamous cell carcinomas in these tracts. Specific points addressed in this article are: 1) postremoval (artifactual) changes in measurements; 2) the impact of margin status, as currently assessed, on recurrence and patient outcome; 3) margins and conservation surgery of the larynx; 4) margins and bone (mandible) invasion; and 5) molecular (p53 and eIF4E) margins.",

    "abstract": "Invasive micropapillary carcinoma has been recently recognized as a rare but distinctive variant of carcinoma in various anatomic sites, including breast, urinary bladder, lung, and major salivary glands. Morphologically, it is characterized by small tight clusters of neoplastic cells floating in clear spaces resembling lymphatic channels. Most often this growth pattern is mixed with a variable component of conventional carcinoma or other variants. In addition to a unique morphology, tumors with invasive micropapillary growth share a high propensity for lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metastases. Patients have typically high-stage disease at presentation and a poor clinical outcome compared with that of patients with conventional carcinoma arising in the same organ site. In this article the author reviews the available literature on tumors displaying a micropapillary component.",

Approximately 50 cases have been described, with the largest series to date reports 12 cases. Based on the literature experience certain key characteristics regarding this tumor emerge, including predilection for younger age, epicenter in renal medulla, high grade nuclear features with desmoplasia and mucin production, and aggressive clinical course. Origin from the collecting duct is based on the observation of dysplastic changes in the adjacent collecting ducts as well as immunohistoehemical reactivity for Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 lectin, peanut lectin agglutinin and high molecular weight cytokeratin. Recently there is evidence that the histologic spectrum of collecting duct carcinoma may be wider than that published. In this article we review the clinical and pathologic features of collecting duct carcinoma based on the reported cases and place them into perspective with the putative widening histologic spectrum.",

The authors recently developed the tissue microarray technology that makes it possible to sample up to 1,000 tumors on one glass slide, which then can be analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, RNA in situ hybridization, or immunohistochemistry. The tissue microarray technology has the potential to significantly accelerate molecular studies that seek associations between molecular changes and clinicopathologic features of the cancer. Examples of potential applications for tissue microarrays include testing and optimization of probes and antibodies, the organization of large tissue repositories, and the facilitation of multicenter studies. Further, tissue microarrays can be used for educational purposes as well as to improve quality control and standardization of staining methods and interpretation. Tissue microarrays have become one of the most promising tools for the molecular and anatomic pathologist and will have many applications in cancer research, as well as in other fields of pathology.

It is of interest for clinicians as potential immunotherapeutic target and it is relevant for pathologists as a novel diagnostic marker, since two antibodies (A 103 and M2-7C10) have become available to study Melan-A/MART-1 expression on archival material. Both antibodies are useful in the differential diagnosis of melanocytic tumors, especially metastatic tumors, since they are more sensitive than HMB-45. Both antibodies are also of diagnostic value in the recognition of perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (angiomyolipoma, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and clear cell tumor). Since A103 has the unique property of staining many steroid hormone producing cells, this antibody is also of value for the recognition of tumors derived from these cells, such as adrenocortical carcinomas. Both antibodies are likely to be included in the routine diagnostic armamentarium of many immunohistochemical laboratories in the near future.",

Moreover, the unique pathology of TIC has shifted attention from the more exuberant proliferations mentioned in prior studies to a spectrum of neoplastic atypias that can be morphologically subtle. This review addresses a multitude of epithelial changes; benign, malignant, and an intriguing third group, which we term \"p53 signatures,\" is found in benign, nonciliated epithelium and stain intensely positive for p53. Understanding all 3 is important for the proper management of women undergoing prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy and possibly formulating an integrated model for the pathogenesis of serous carcinoma in the reproductive tract.

    "abstract": "Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare tumor that is responsible for <1% of cases of hyperparathyroidism in most parts of the world. An increased incidence of this tumor has been reported in patients with the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome, but the etiology of most other cases is unknown. Parathyroid carcinomas tend to occur a decade earlier than adenomas, and the sex ratio approaches unity in contrast to the female preponderance of adenomas. Most patients with carcinomas present with marked hypercalcemia and are more likely to have associated bone and renal disease than those with adenomas. Although fibrosis and mitotic activity are common in carcinomas, these features are not specific for malignancy. The diagnosis of carcinoma should be restricted to those tumors that show invasion of blood vessels, perineural spaces, soft tissues, thyroid gland, or other adjacent structures or to tumors with documented metastases. Mutations of the HRPT2 gene (1q21-q32), which are responsible for the HPT-JT syndrome, have been implicated in the development of a high proportion of parathyroid carcinomas. A subset of patients with mutation-positive carcinomas have germline mutations of the HRPT2 gene. This finding suggests that some patients with apparent sporadic parathyroid carcinomas may have the HPT-JT syndrome or a variant of this syndrome. Because of the high frequency of local recurrence following incomplete excision, an en bloc resection is the preferred surgical approach for treatment of parathyroid carcinomas.",

    "abstract": "Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is an uncommon, highly aggressive, and clinicopathologically distinctive carcinoma of uncertain histogenesis. SNUC typically presents as a rapidly enlarging tumor mass involving multiple (sinonasal tract) sites, often with evidence of extension beyond the anatomic confines of the sinonasal tract. The light microscopic features include the presence of a hypercellular proliferation with varied growth patterns, including trabecular, sheet-like, ribbon, lobular, and organoid patterns. The tumor cells are medium to large sized and round to oval and have pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei, inconspicuous to prominent nucleoli, varying amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, marked increase in mitotic activity frequently with atypical mitoses, tumor necrosis, and apoptosis. Adjunct analyses (eg, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and molecular biologic studies) are often required in the diagnosis of SNUC and in differentiating it from other undifferentiated malignant neoplasms. The treatment of SNUC includes aggressive multimodality therapy, including surgical resection and adjuvant therapy (ie, radiotherapy, chemotherapy). The prognosis associated with SNUC is poor, and death due to disease often occurs within short periods following the diagnosis. We believe that the histologic definition of SNUC can be expanded to include tumors with limited differentiated foci (ie, squamous cell differentiation) predicated on the caveats that the clinical parameters (ie, rapidly enlarging and destructive sinonasal lesions) and the majority of the histologic findings (ie, undifferentiated pleomorphic cell population) match those features that have heretofore defined SNUC. The presence of squamous cell differentiation would correlate to origin in the Schneiderian epithelium, thereby conferring an ectodermal derivation to these tumors. Irrespective of its cell of origin and perhaps even in the face of differentiated foci in limited parts of the tumor, given its rather unique clinicopathologic characteristics, this tumor should be identified and classified as SNUC, thereby differentiating it from the other specific types of sinonasal carcinomas and nonepithelial malignant tumors.",

The unique morphology, the strong predilection for male adolescents, and the uncertainty about its etiology contributes to significant confusion regarding the classification of NA, which still has not been solved today. Based on immunohistochemical and electron microscopic examinations, we demonstrate in detail the various unusual vascular architectural features of NA. They represent discontinuous vascular basal laminae, focal lack of pericytes, and pronounced irregularity of the smooth muscle layers. In thick smooth muscle layers and pads, the orientation of muscle cells is frequently disturbed, and the individual cells differ in size and shape. Occasionally, the muscle layers disperse peripherally into individual cells, creating the impression of vessel-independent smooth muscle cells within the stroma. The summation of all morphological irregularities demonstrated in this paper allows the conclusion that NA represent vascular malformations.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerves consist of 3 layers with differing characteristics: the endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium. The perineurium represents a continuum with the pia-arachnoid from the central nervous system and extends distally with the sheath of capsular cells of peripheral sensorial organs and propioceptive receptors. It is made of layers of flattened cells surrounded by a basement membrane and collagen fibers, forming concentrically laminated structures around single nerve fascicles. Functionally, the perineurium modulates external stretching forces (that could be potentially harmful for nerve fibers), and along with endoneurial vessels, forms the blood-nerve barrier. Multiple pathologic conditions associated with the perineurium have been described. Perineurial invasion is considered an important prognostic factor in several malignant neoplasms. Perineuriomas are true benign infrequent perineurial cell neoplasms that have been divided in 2 categories: those with intraneural localization and a more common extraneural (soft tissue) group, including sclerosing and reticular variants. Sporadic cases of malignant perineuromas have been reported. Interestingly, neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors may also display perineurial cell differentiation. The histologic appearance of perineuriomas may overlap with other soft tissue spindle cell neoplasms. Immunohistochemistry is imperative for the diagnosis, although in certain cases ultrastructural studies may be needed. Typical perineuriomas are positive for epithelial membrane antigen, glucose transporter-1-1, and claudin-1, and negative for S-100 protein and neurofilaments. Perineuriomas have mostly simple karyotypes, with one or few chromosomal rearrangements or numerical changes and it seems that specific cytogenetic aberrations may correlate with perineurioma subtype.",

In addition to having prognostic value, ER is the most important biologic marker of therapeutic response in breast cancer. Some level of measurable ER protein is expressed in 70-80% of human breast. Immunohistochemistry is the current method of choice for ER assessment, and its predictive value has been shown to be superior to that of biochemically based assays. Although accurate ER protein assessment is critical for optimal treatment of patients with breast cancer, studies have demonstrated inter-laboratory variability in ER detection. False-negative results for tumors with low ER protein levels have been a subject of recent concern. Lack of standardization for immunohistochemistry between laboratories is thought to be the major reason for testing errors, although variability in scoring methods and reporting practices, which can affect results, also plays a role. In this article, we review studies addressing interlaboratory variability and recommend optimal testing techniques and reporting procedures for ER testing, with the goal of increasing interlaboratory standardization for ER analysis by immunohistochemistry. We additionally highlight recent biologic, molecular, and gene expression profiling data related to ER in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Epithelioid sarcoma was named in 1970 in a classic paper by Enzinger, who expanded the observations in a larger series in 1985. He defined a sarcoma with a peak incidence in young adult males and a predilection for extremities, involving subcutis or deeper tissue and extending along tendon sheaths or aponeuroses. The tumor forms nodules with central necrosis surrounded by bland polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and peripheral spindling. Fibromalike, angiomatoid, and proximal aggressive variants (with larger cells, prominent nuceloi, and rhabdoid change) have since been described. Epithelioid sarcomas regularly express vimentin, cytokeratins, and epithelial membrane antigen, and about half are positive for CD34, but a wide range of other antigens can be expressed. S100 protein, desmin, and FLI-1 are usually negative. The ultrastructure displays epithelial and mesenchymal features including myofibroblastic differentiation. There are no specific genetic findings but several cases display chromosomal abnormalities in the 22q region. The tumor has no normal cellular counterpart and differs from both synovial sarcoma and carcinoma. There is a wide differential diagnosis from numerous benign and malignant conditions, including granuloma annulare, melanoma, and epithelioid vascular neoplasms. Epithelioid sarcoma has a high recurrence rate, which can be reduced by adequate surgery, and up to 40% metastasize, to regional lymph nodes, to lung, and other locations including scalp. Adverse prognostic factors include large size, male sex, older age, necrosis, vascular invasion, rhabdoid cytomorphology, and inadequate excision. Thirty-six years after Enzinger's original account, epithelioid sarcoma remains a clinically and pathologically distinct, indolent but aggressive sarcoma of indeterminate lineage.",

FLCs occur principally in children and young adults and are not associated with chronic liver disease. Their etiology is unknown. The tumor is made up of large polygonal cells containing abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, large vesiculated nuclei, and large nucleoli, with tumor cells that are embedded in lamellar bands of fibrosis. Although rare, the most common variant of FLC shows areas of glandular type differentiation with mucin production. The uniqueness of FLC extends to their molecular findings, as they show no evidence for involvement by many of the major pathways and genes that are dysregulated in typical hepatocellular carcinoma, including alpha-fetoprotein, TP53 mutations, and beta catenin mutations. FLCs are not indolent tumors, but have an overall better prognosis than hepatocellular carcinomas of the usual sort because of the younger age at presentation and lack of cirrhosis. The most important prognostic feature is resectability. Although their morphologic appearance on routine stains is well defined, their etiology is still unknown and much of their molecular biology remains poorly described and awaits future investigation.",

TNBCs currently lack effective targeted therapies and are frequently resistant to standard chemotherapeutic regimens. These tumors tend to occur in premenopausal women and members of specific ethnic groups and a subset are associated with heritable BRCA1 mutations. For patients with sporadic TNBCs and BP tumors, BRCA1 dysfunction seems to play a major role in the development and progression of disease. The pathologist's role in the diagnosis and characterization of TNBCs and BP tumors is currently being defined as we are acquiring knowledge of the biologic and genetic underpinnings that drive this heterogeneous group of diseases. This review will provide a historical prospective on TNBCs and tumors that express basal cytokeratins and myoepithelial makers. Additionally, we will discuss the molecular biologic, genetic and pathologic aspects of these tumors. Guidelines will be provided on how to best approach the diagnosis of these cases and on what input pathologists should provide clinicians to help develop optimal therapeutic and preventative strategies against this aggressive group of breast cancers.",

    "abstract": "Papillary lesions comprise a wide spectrum of lesions in terms of their clinical presentation, morphologic appearance, malignant potential, and clinical behavior. Their defining feature is that of a fibrovascular stromal core lined by epithelial and myoepithelial cells, attached to the wall of the duct and extending into the duct lumen. Papillary lesions are often diagnostically challenging both on core biopsy and in excision specimens. Much of the difficulty arises from the many different terminologies that are used to describe the various entities that are included under the umbrella term of papillary lesions. Separation of papillary lesions into categories with a meaningful clinical outcome is most appropriate; however, there is a relative paucity of well-designed outcome studies with substantial cohort numbers to provide information in this regard. We use a pragmatic approach to the classification of papillary lesions in our practice, as we will outline in this review. We will also discuss controversies surrounding papillary lesions and focus on management of these lesions on core biopsy and in excision specimens.",

    "abstract": "Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a fibrosing variant of spindle cell melanoma. It most often presents as an indurated lesion in chronically sun-damaged skin. Due to the lack of characteristic clinical features, early detection is uncommon. At the time of excision, the tumors usually extend into the reticular dermis or deeper. DM is prone to misdiagnosis. It may simulate histologically sclerosing melanocytic nevi as well as various benign and malignant nonmelanocytic lesions. There is significant morphologic variability among tumors classified as DM. Desmoplasia may be prominent throughout the entire tumor (“pure” DM) or represent a portion of an otherwise nondesmoplastic melanoma (“combined” DM). Some tumors show neuroma-like features with prominent nerve involvement, in which case the term “desmoplastic neurotropic melanoma” is used. Immunophenotypically, DMs are usually strongly and homogeneously positive for S-100 protein but are often negative or only focally positive for melanocyte differentiation antigens such as tyrosinase, gp100, Melan-A, and microphthalmia transcription factor. DM differs from conventional melanoma in its clinical course. It is associated with a higher tendency for local recurrence, but metastases to regional lymph nodes are less common. Evidence is also emerging that for patients with thick melanomas, the presence of a paucicellular fibrosing tumor histology (pure DM) is a favorable prognostic factor for survival.",

    "abstract": "This review considers the clinical and pathologic features of the various histologic subtypes of endometrial carcinoma excluding those of pure endometrioid type, as the latter tumors were the subject of a previous contribution in the Journal (Vol. 9, No. 2). Non-endometrioid carcinomas, which account for about 10% of endometrial carcinomas, may pose a great array of problems in differential diagnosis, including their distinction not only from benign lesions but also endometrioid carcinoma and various tumors that may secondarily involve the uterine corpus. The most common subtypes are serous, mucinous, and undifferentiated. Rarer tumors are clear cell, squamous, transitional cell carcinomas, and a variety of poorly differentiated carcinomas with unusual forms of differentiation, such as hepatoid carcinoma, carcinomas with trophoblastic elements, and giant cell carcinoma. Mixed carcinomas, which are common, are also discussed, including those with a component of endometrioid carcinoma. The final section deals with endometrial involvement by metastatic tumors, lesions that, albeit rare, are sometimes neglected in the differential diagnosis of endometrial carcinomas. Important aspects emphasized are: (1) The potential for serous carcinoma to be mimicked by various forms of papillary endometrioid carcinoma. (2) The rarity of clear cell carcinoma and the greater frequency of clear cells in endometrioid carcinoma. (3) The frequency of mucinous epithelium in tumors of mixed cell type. (4) The frequency with which neoplastic mucinous epithelium originates from the endometrium. (5) The striking degree of differentiation of some squamous cell carcinomas. (6) The occasional predominance of non-endometrioid carcinomas (especially serous or undifferentiated carcinoma) within malignant mullerian mixed tumors. (7) The spectrum of reactive epithelial changes and other non-neoplastic abnormalities that may mimic serous or clear cell carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is a malignant neuroectodermal tumor that typically occurs in the superior nasal cavity. It is a distinct entity with features that include nesting, low-grade stippled nuclei, and neurofibrillary stroma with formation of pseudorosettes. It has a distinctive immunoprofile that includes keratin negativity, neuroendocrine marker positivity, and S100 positive sustentacular cells, which surround the nests of tumor in a supportive manner. Although the typical clinicopathologic features leave little room for misinterpretation, the wide variability in this tumor may cause diagnostic difficulty. This includes immunophenotypic diversity or patchy staining with immunomarkers, wide spectrum of grade and histology, posttreatment changes, and occasional divergent differentiation. In addition, problems in sampling, preservation, and clinical localization may make the diagnosis more challenging. A large group of tumors may show morphologic overlap with ONB, with some mimicking low-grade tumors, whereas others mimic high-grade tumors. This differential diagnosis has important treatment and prognostic implications. Further complicating the issue is that many of the mimics themselves may show great morphologic and immunophenotypic variability. This manuscript will review the typical clinical and pathologic features of ONB, address the great variability of ONB in our experience, will focus on the differential diagnosis and report on recent findings in these tumors including molecular genetics where applicable.",

    "abstract": "The Gleason system for prostate cancer was based on a study of 270 patients from the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Hospital in 1966-1967. In 1974, Gleason and the Veterans Administrative Cooperative Urological Research Group expanded this study to 1032 men. These studies formed the basis of the Gleason grading system, which is now endorsed as the primary grading system for prostate cancer by the World Health Organization, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Fascicle on prostate cancer, the Association of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology, and the College of American Pathologists. In the nearly 40 years since its inception, several aspects about prostate cancer and its management have changed, most notably serum prostate-specific antigen, transrectal ultrasonography, 18-gauge needle biopsy sampling, immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of cancer, and radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy as primary treatment modalities. Several aspects of the disease, and consequently the reporting needs, have changed such as reporting cancer on multiple cases in needle biopsies, multiple nodules in prostatectomy, tertiary patterns, variants and variations in prostate cancer. The application of the Gleason system, therefore, has varied considerably in contemporary surgical pathology practice. An International Consensus Conference attended by 80 urologic pathologists from 20 countries was convened to discuss clarifications and modifications to the Gleason system. This article serves as a brief overview and summary of the proceedings that have been published in detail in recent literature.",

The UroVysion assay works by detecting urinary cells that have chromosomal abnormalities consistent with a diagnosis of bladder cancer. Studies have shown that UroVysion is more sensitive than urine cytology for the detection of all stages and grades of bladder cancer. UroVysion is Food and Drug Administration-approved for the detection of recurrent bladder cancer in voided urine specimens from patients with a history of bladder cancer and for the detection of bladder cancer in voided urine specimens from patients with gross or microscopic hematuria, but no previous history of bladder cancer. Recent studies also suggest that UroVysion may be useful for assessing superficial bladder cancer patients' response to bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy and in detecting upper tract urothelial carcinoma.",

MCC tends to show classic histologic features of a neuroendocrine carcinoma and is often positive for CK20, but nonclassic cytologic findings and unusual immunophenotypes may be observed and can lead to a diagnostic confusion. MCC needs to be distinguished from other primary cutaneous tumors with a small cell appearance and metastatic tumors.

    "abstract": "Tumors of the renal pelvis account for approximately 7% to 8% of all renal malignancies, greater than 90% of these are of urothelial (transitional cell) origin. These tumors more typically occur in the sixth to eight decade with a slight male preponderance. Varying risk factors for urothelial carcinomas of the upper tract are recognized including environmental and occupational hazards, chemotherapeutic exposure, and previous history of urinary bladder or ureteral carcinomas. Tumor multifocality is frequent and additional tumors may arise in the ureter, bladder, or on the contralateral side. The histopathologic nuances presented by urothelial carcinoma in this region are generally similar to those in the urinary bladder. Though the World Health Organization 2004/International Society of Urological Pathology system used in the bladder is customarily also employed for grading of urothelial tumors of this region, its prognostic significance at this site is not entirely clear as most tumors are treated with nephroureterectomy irrespective of the grade of the tumor. Histologic grade may be an independent prognostic factor in papillary pT1 tumors; however, most pT2 and higher stage tumors tend to be nonpapillary and of higher grade. Despite advances in treatment modalities with sophisticated endoscopic techniques, tumor stage remains the most important prognostic factor. There are several confounding issues related to staging such as the variable presence and thickness of subepithelial connective tissue and muscularis in the renal calyces, renal pelvis, and the ureter; intratubular pagetoid cancer spread (pTis vs. pT3); and assessing invasion in papillary neoplasms with endophytic or inverted growth. Careful gross examination with adequate sampling and understanding the microanatomy of the pelvicalyceal wall are crucial for accurate stage assignment. Poor fixation of large friable tumors and processing artifacts may compound difficulties in accurate staging. This review focuses on urothelial carcinoma of the upper tract highlighting issues related to its diagnosis, staging, and reporting.",

Approximately 20% of patients present with metastatic disease, and an additional 30% to 40% develop metastasis during the course of their disease. Patients with metastatic colon cancer have a 5-year survival rate of only 11%. Although surgery is the mainstay of treatment for early stage colon cancer, adjuvant treatment is usually used in patients advanced stage disease. In particular, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor therapies have emerged as effective treatments in a subset of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Two anti-EGFR biologics, cetuximab and panitumumab, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administrations for the treatment of refractory metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Mounting evidence has shown that these therapies are ineffective in tumors with mutations of codons 12 and 13 of exon 2 of the KRAS gene. Because of this compelling data, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology have recommended determination of KRAS mutation status in all patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who are candidates for anti-EGFR therapy. Anatomic pathologists play an integral role in coordinating the testing for KRAS mutations, as this assay is performed on tissue samples selected by the pathologist. Herein, the authors present an up-to-date review of the biologic, clinical, and laboratory aspects of KRAS mutation testing in colorectal cancer.",

Published reports on 41 previously reported uterine PEComas are reviewed in this report. Of these 41 cases, 31 originating in the corpus and for which there was adequate follow-up information (or clinical malignancy) were categorized into 2 groups: (1) a malignant group that was comprised of cases associated with patient death of disease and/or clinical malignancy as evidenced by local and/or distant extension outside of the uterus (n=13, group 1) and (2) a \"nonmalignant\" group of cases in which neither of the above features were present (n=18, group 2). Groups 1 and 2 did not significantly differ regarding duration of follow-up (25 mo vs. 24.3 mo, respectively, P=0.9) or patient age (45.61 y vs. 43.46 y, respectively, P=0.7). Five of the group 1 patients experienced distant (extra-abdominal) metastases. The group 1 tumors were significantly larger than the group 2 tumors (averages 9.6 cm vs. 4.67 cm respectively, P=0.04); however, there were no size thresholds that, in of themselves, reliably classified 75% or more of the cases in both groups. Coagulative necrosis was highly associated with group 1, being present in 82% of cases as compared with only 11.8% of group 2 cases (P=0.0002). Eighty-eight percent of the group 2 cases had a mitotic rate of <or=1/10 high power fields (HPF) as compared with 40% of group 1 cases (P=0.01). However, the absence of mitotic activity did not rule out malignancy, as 2 of the group 1 cases lacked mitotic activity and displayed metastases. Twenty-five percent, 49%, 56%, 73%, and 100% of tested cases displayed immunoreactivity for CD10, desmin, vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and caldesmon, respectively. PEComas are tumors of uncertain histogenesis and malignant potential that seem to display some morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap with smooth muscle neoplasia. A mitotic count of >1/10 HPF and/or coagulative necrosis are features that, if present, raise the definite potential for aggressive behavior.",

    "abstract": "Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a robust and sustained antiproliferative response brought about by oncogenic signaling resulting from an activating mutation of an oncogene, or the inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene. The pathways mediating OIS are complex and incompletely elucidated but, the proliferative arrest involves activation of both the RB and p53 pathways. In addition, whereas there are indications that at least in some situations, negative feedback loops abolish the increased mitogenic signaling resulting from the oncogenic mutations, also an unexpected contribution of interleukin-mediated signaling has recently been found. OIS brings about cessation of growth of some benign tumors, including melanocytic nevi and several other lesions, including pituitary and thyroid adenomas. It protects against progression to cancer, and in this way complements oncogene-induced apoptosis. Perhaps, OIS has evolved as an alternative to apoptosis especially regarding long-lived cell types that are not replaceable in large numbers. Contrary to the earlier belief, OIS is not entirely irreversible, at least in some well documented in vitro systems. This means that its induction does not entirely eliminate the oncogenic threat resulting from the mutated cell. It also means that OIS, or related phenomena that may affect a proportion of the tumor cells of some cancers, may have an influence on responsiveness to cytotoxic cancer therapies, because OIS is associated with an antiapoptosis phenotype.",

This review, directed at practicing pathologists, portrays the normal resident lymphocyte population in the mucosa of each segment of the digestive tract and discusses the different situations that may result in quantitative or qualitative alterations of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Esophageal lymphocytosis has not been fully characterized and its clinical significance, if any, awaits definition. Thus, this diagnosis is presently discouraged. In the stomach, it is particularly important to exclude Helicobacter pylori infection and celiac sprue before diagnosing lymphocytic gastritis. Duodenal lymphocytic infiltrates, inextricably tied with alterations of the villous architecture of the mucosa, are often caused by gluten sensitivity. However, similar morphologic changes may be caused by a vast array of other conditions that must be carefully considered and excluded. Lymphocytic and collagenous colitis are most often unexplained, but their frequent association with autoimmune conditions or certain medications deserve a thorough investigation in each case. Using a combination of histologic and clinical clues, a cause for the intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration can be identified in many instances. As some of the associated conditions are amenable to effective treatment, the importance of diligently seeking such associations before resorting to a diagnosis of primary lymphocytosis is emphasized.",

HT is an autoimmune disease in which a breakdown of immune tolerance is caused by interplay of a variety of immunologic, genetic, and environmental factors. Thyrocyte injury resulting from environmental factors results in expression of new or hidden epitopes that leads to proliferation of autoreactive T and B cells. Infiltration of thyroid by these cells results in HT. In addition to the usual type of HT, several variants such as the fibrous type and Riedal thyroiditis are also recognized. The most recently recognized variant is immunoglobulin G4+ HT, which may occur as isolated thyroid limited disease or as part of a generalized Ig4-related sclerosing disease. The relationship between HT and Riedel thyroiditis remains unclear; however, recent evidence seems to suggest that it may also be part of the spectrum of Ig4-related sclerosing disease. HT is frequently associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma and may indeed be a risk factor for developing this type of cancer. The relationship between thyroid lymphoma and HT on the other hand appears well established.",

In some tissues, GPC3 acts as a tumor suppressor gene, whereas in others, it acts as an oncofetal protein. Studies have shown that GPC3 is a reliable marker for hepatocellular carcinoma. The sensitivity and specificity exceeds both alpha-fetoprotein and hepatocyte-paraffin1. GPC3 immunohistochemistry can aid in the differentiation of testicular germ cell tumors, being expressed in all yolk sac tumors but not in seminomas. GPC3 expression has also been identified in some squamous cell carcinomas of the lung and clear cell carcinomas of the ovary. The role of GPC3 in melanomas is still controversial. This article reviews the current information on the application of GPC3 immunostaining in surgical pathology and cytology.",

MTC is frequently diagnosed at a locally advanced or metastatic stage, and 10-year survival rates in these cases are <20%. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid gland is an accurate method to diagnose MTC, having a high sensitivity and specificity. The cytologic features of MTC are characteristic and the cytologic diagnosis of classic MTC is often straightforward, especially when combined with immunocytochemistry. However, because of its morphologic heterogeneity and overlap with other tumors, the differential diagnosis of MTC on cytology and on histology is broad with several potential pitfalls. Significant advances have been made over the last decade in understanding MTC. This concerns mainly the early detection of MTC, especially in familial forms (eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2), and the identification of key molecular pathways and alterations which now offer promising targets for specific therapies in progressive MTC cases. Genetic testing (eg, RET mutation) has allowed for early detection in asymptomatic carriers and high-risk patients, with prophylactic thyroidectomy often being curative. Targeted therapies with multityrosine-kinase inhibitors (eg, vandetanib or cabozantinib) have emerged as promising new treatments for recurrent or metastatic MTC. In this review article, we discuss the cytologic features of MTC and its variants, its differential diagnosis, the role of ancillary studies, and the salient molecular features of MTC.",

The anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies panitumumab and cetuximab are approved in the United States for treatment of mCRC refractory to chemotherapy but are not recommended for use in patients with mutations in KRAS codons 12 or 13.

It is clear that KRAS mutational analysis will become an important aspect of disease management in patients with mCRC. Consequently, it will be important for pathologists and oncologists to develop and agree on standardized KRAS testing and reporting procedures to ensure optimum patient care. Pathologists will be central to this process because of their crucial role in selecting appropriate tumor specimens for testing, choosing the molecular diagnostic laboratory to be used, assisting in the selection of a suitable KRAS test, and interpreting the results of KRAS mutational analysis. Guidelines for KRAS testing that address these and other important points of consideration have recently been proposed in the United States and the European Union.",

Patients with ER-positive breast cancers have variable clinical outcomes and responses to endocrine therapy and chemotherapy. With the advent of microarray-based gene expression profiling, unsupervised analysis methods have resulted in a classification of ER-positive disease into subtypes with different outcomes (ie, luminal A and luminal B); subsequent studies have demonstrated that these subtypes have different patterns of genetic aberrations and outcome. Studies based on supervised methods of microarray analysis have led to the development of prognostic gene signatures that identify a subgroup of ER-positive breast cancer patients with excellent outcome, who could forego chemotherapy. Despite the excitement with these approaches, several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the subclassification of ER-positive cancers and the prognostic value of gene signatures is largely driven by the expression levels of proliferation-related genes and that proliferation markers, such as Ki67, may provide equivalent prognostic information to that provided by gene signatures. In this review, we discuss the contribution of gene expression profiling to the classification of ER-positive breast cancer, the role of prognostic and predictive signatures, and the potential stratification of ER-positive disease according to their dependency on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway.",

    "abstract": "Primary lung lymphoma (PLL) is a rare disease that comprises <0.5% of all primary lung tumors. It is defined as lymphoma confined to the lung with or without hilar lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis or up to 3 months thereafter. Patients with PLL may be asymptomatic or manifest nonspecific clinical symptoms, for example, cough, chest pain, and dyspnea. Some individuals may be immunosupressed or have an autoimmune disorder. Radiologically, PLL can mimic pneumonia, lung carcinoma, or metastasis, and therefore, histologic confirmation is mandatory for definitive diagnosis. Primary lung marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type comprises 70% to 80% of cases. Less common B-cell lymphomas include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LyG), plasmacytoma, and other small lymphocytic lymphomas. PLLs of T-cell origin, largely represented by anaplastic large cell lymphoma, are extremely rare. LyG is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven B-cell lymphoid neoplastic proliferation rich in T cells that produces vasculitis. The disease may present at different stages of progression. Differential diagnosis of PLL varies according to the lymphoma subtype: pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma should be distinguished from reactive inflammatory conditions, whereas high-grade lymphomas may resemble poorly differentiated lung carcinoma, metastatic disease, and other lymphomas. LyG can resemble inflammatory, infectious, and other lymphoid neoplastic processes. A panel of immunohistochemical markers, flow cytometry, and molecular methods are necessary to confirm the diagnosis in the majority of cases. In this article we review the clinical, radiologic, pathologic, and molecular characteristics of several B-cell and T-cell PLLs with exception of Hodgkin lymphoma and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.",

    "abstract": "Since the publication of the World Health Organization \"blue book\" in 2004, several recent studies have provided new insights on the pathologic aspects of urachal neoplasms. The proposed updates include modified criteria for the diagnosis of urachal carcinoma. A uniform nomenclature for cystic tumors was lacking, and it is recommended that urachal mucinous cystic tumors should be separated and classified in a manner similar to ovarian mucinous neoplasms. The spectrum includes mucinous cystadenoma, mucinous cystic tumor of low malignant potential, mucinous cystic tumor of low malignant potential with intraepithelial carcinoma, and microscopically or frankly invasive mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, with 65% of cystic tumors classified as mucinous cystic tumor of low malignant potential. Most importantly, it has been shown that progression-free survival of noninvasive mucinous cystic tumors is significantly better than noncystic invasive adenocarcinoma. This development, along with prior descriptions of urachal villous adenoma, has also reaffirmed the occurrence of benign tumors of urachal epithelial origin. For noncystic (usual) invasive adenocarcinomas, the traditionally described histologic subtypes of enteric, mucinous, signet ring cell, not otherwise specified, and mixed remain appropriate, with 50% of tumors classified as mucinous subtype. Although this subtyping is helpful in diagnosis and differential diagnosis, the clinical significance of subtyping adenocarcinoma is still uncertain. Rare nonglandular morphologies such as urothelial, squamous, and neuroendocrine carcinoma in urachal carcinomas have been described in detail with proposals for their own set of diagnostic criteria. These criteria are based on unique features of urachal nonglandular carcinomas. Among the immunomarkers studied, only β-catenin and CK7 may be of help in the distinction of urachal from colorectal adenocarcinoma. Awareness of the expression profile of immunomarkers such as CDX2, P504S (racemase), PSMA, claudin-18, and REG IV in urachal tumors and in tumors in the differential diagnosis is important to avoid overreliance of these markers in the diagnosis. Limited studies have identified KRAS mutations interestingly only in mucinous adenocarcinoma and exclusive of MSI loss, and mutations in BRAF are not present. Several alternative tumor staging approaches (eg, Mayo, Ontario, TNM systems) different from the traditional staging proposed by Sheldon are used that provide better tumor distribution across stages; however, the prognostic utility of the stage substratification has yet to be validated in large prospective studies. Evidence though suggests that staging urachal cancer is most pertinent when dichotomized to tumors that have spread outside versus within the perivesical tissue. Only high tumor stage and residual tumor after surgery have been shown to be independent predictors of outcome. This review updates the contemporary classification of urachal epithelial tumors, which has informed the upcoming 2016 classification of World Health Organization tumors. We provide modified criteria for diagnosing urachal adenocarcinomas, which remains a clinico-pathologic exercise. The role of ancillary diagnostic methodology and issues pertaining to staging and prognostication are presented.",

LGG in pediatric and adult age groups are currently classified by morphologic criteria. Recent years have heralded a molecular revolution in understanding brain tumors, including LGG. Next-generation sequencing has definitively demonstrated that pediatric and adult LGG fundamentally differ in their underlying molecular characteristics, despite being histologically similar. Pediatric LGG show alterations in FGFR1 and BRAF in pilocytic astrocytomas and FGFR1 alterations in diffuse astrocytomas, each converging on the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Adult LGG are characterized by IDH1/2 mutations and ATRX mutations in astrocytic tumors and IDH1/2 mutations and 1p/19q codeletions in oligodendroglial tumors. TERT promoter mutations are also noted in LGG and are mainly associated with oligodendrogliomas. These findings have considerably refined approaches to classifying these tumors. Moreover, many of the molecular alterations identified in LGG directly impact on prognosis, tumor biology, and the development of novel therapies.",

It is an embryologic tumor that histologically mimics renal embryogenesis and is composed of a variable mixture of stromal, blastemal, and epithelial elements. Nephrogenic rests, generally considered to be precursor lesions of the WT, are foci of the embryonic metanephric tissue that persist after the completion of renal embryogenesis. These are classified as perilobar and intralobar based on their location and maybe present as single or multiple foci. Intralobar and perilobar rests and the tumors arising from these rests differ morphologically and are characterized by 2 different sets of genetic abnormalities involving 2 adjacent foci, WT1 and WT2, on the short arm of chromosome 11. WTs arising in the intralobar rests tend to be stromal predominant and have a mutation or deletion of WT1. Germline mutation in WT1 may be associated with syndromic conditions such as WAGR and Denys-Drash syndromes. Perilobar rests and their corresponding tumors usually have loss of imprinting/loss of heterozygosity involving WT2, which contains several parentally imprinted genes. Loss of function of these genes, if present constitutionally, may be associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or may result in isolated hypertrophy. Abnormalities in several other genes may also be seen in WT. These include WTX, (on chromosome X), CTNNB1 (chromosome 3), and TP53 (chromosome 17) among others. WT with loss of heterozygosity at 1p and 16q may have poor prognosis, requiring aggressive therapy. Treatment modalities for WT have evolved over many decades, primarily through the efforts of Dr J Bruce Beckwith at National WT study. This work is now being carried out by Children Oncology Group in North America and International Society of Pediatric Oncology in Europe. Although their therapeutic approaches are somewhat different, both have reported excellent results with equally high cure rates.",

    "abstract": "Pleomorphic neoplasms are typically associated with high-grade malignant behavior, but this does not readily apply to primary cutaneous tumors. Despite morphologic features suggestive of malignancy, atypical fibroxanthoma, the classic example of a pleomorphic dermal neoplasm, is characterized by indolent clinical behavior. Atypical fibroxanthoma is a distinctive clinicopathologic disease affecting sun-damaged skin of elderly males. Histologically, it is often ulcerated and dermal based with pushing growth, characterized by a sheet-like and fascicular growth of pleomorphic epithelioid, spindled, and multinucleated tumor cells with brisk and atypical mitotic activity. However, no positive discriminatory histologic or immunohistochemical features exist. Its diagnosis is one exclusion with a wide differential diagnosis, mainly including other mesenchymal, melanocytic, and epithelial neoplasms. Particular considerations are pleomorphic dermal sarcoma, invasive melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, metaplastic carcinoma, poorly differentiated cutaneous angiosarcoma, cutaneous leiomyosarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, variants of fibrous histiocytoma (FH), pleomorphic fibroma, and non-neural granular cell tumor. The behavior of these tumors is varied and ranges from outright malignant to entirely benign, requiring confident diagnosis to reliably predict behavior and guide treatment. Although challenging, because of significant clinical and pathologic overlap, it is usually possible to establish a definitive diagnosis when attention is paid to the often subtle differentiating features. This requires careful tumor sampling, recognition of the subtle distinguishing morphologic features, judicious use and analysis of immunohistochemistry, and interpretation of the findings in the appropriate clinical setting.",

The most common form of DHL has translocations involving MYC and BCL2, also known as MYC/BCL2 DHL. In recent years, a number of case series of MYC/BCL2 DHL have been published. Most cases of MYC/BCL2 DHL morphologically resemble diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma. These tumors are of B-cell lineage, have a germinal center B-cell immunophenotype with a high proliferation rate, and a complex karyotype. Patients with these tumors have an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis despite high-intensity chemotherapy. More recently, studies have suggested expanding the spectrum of MYC/BCL2 DHL to include cases that have concurrent MYC and BCL2 cytogenetic abnormalities, but not necessarily translocations. In addition, overexpression of MYC and BCL2 has been shown in an appreciable subset of DLBCL tumors. These tumors show overlap with MYC/BCL2 DHL, but are not equivalent. In this review, we discuss the clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and prognostic features of MYC/BCL2 DHL.",

Diffuse gliomas are currently classified by the World Health Organization as astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, or oligoastrocytomas and range in grade from II to IV. Glioblastoma (GBM), World Health Organization grade IV, is the highest grade and most common form of astrocytoma. In the past, the diagnosis of gliomas was almost exclusively based on histopathologic features. More recently, improved understanding of molecular genetic underpinnings has led to ancillary molecular studies becoming standard for classification, prognostication, and predicting therapy response. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations are frequent in grade II and III infiltrating gliomas and secondary GBMs. Infiltrating astrocytomas and secondary GBMs are characterized by IDH, TP53, and ATRX mutations, whereas oligodendrogliomas demonstrate 1p/19q codeletion and mutations in IDH, CIC, FUBP1, and the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter. Primary GBMs typically lack IDH mutations and are instead characterized by EGFR, PTEN, TP53, PDGFRA, NF1, and CDKN2A/B alterations and TERT promoter mutations. Pediatric GBMs differ from those in adults and frequently have mutations in H3F3A, ATRX, and DAXX, but not IDH. In contrast, circumscribed, low-grade gliomas of childhood, such as pilocytic astrocytoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, and ganglioglioma, often harbor mutations or activating gene rearrangements in BRAF. Neuropathologic assessment of gliomas increasingly relies on ancillary testing of molecular alterations for proper classification and patient management.",

    "abstract": "Heterozygous hotspot mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) IDH1 or IDH2 are frequently observed in specific types of cartilaginous tumors, gliomas, and leukemias. Mutant IDH enzyme loses its normal activity to convert isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and instead acquires the ability to reduce αKG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate. Through direct competition with αKG, accumulation of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate in IDH mutated tumors results in inhibition of αKG-dependent dioxygenases involved in DNA and histone demethylation. Apart from epigenetic alterations, perturbations in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (depletion of intermediates) and activation of the intricately linked hypoxia signaling pathway are apparent in IDH mutated cells. As molecular details are being unraveled, the emerging concept is that IDH mutations result in tumor formation by epigenetic alterations that affect gene expression and result in inhibition of cellular differentiation. Activation of hypoxic stress signaling reprograms cellular energy metabolism and promotes anabolic processes and angiogenesis, thus, providing an advantage to promote neoplastic growth.",

    "abstract": "Gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma (GAS) is a recently described diagnostic entity originally characterized as a tumor with (1) voluminous cytoplasm that is (2) clear or pale eosinophilic, and (3) cells showing distinct cell borders. Since the initial tumor description there has been accumulating experience that the neoplasm, in addition to classic features, may show a wide spectrum of morphologic appearances. This paper describes and illustrates cases of GAS with focal or diffuse findings that include: densely eosinophilic cytoplasm, foamy cytoplasm, goblet cells, glands with elongated, stratified nuclei, glands with small cuboidal cells, glands with flattened cells, papillary growth, single cell infiltration and infiltration with microcystic elongated and fragmented pattern. All these patterns may bring up a differential diagnosis with other cervical malignancies such as usual, intestinal, endometrioid, clear cell, serous, and mesonephric adenocarcinoma. The paper describes the patterns of immunostaining of respective lesions that may aid in the diagnostic process and summarizes the main points of the differential diagnosis. GAS is associated with somatic and germline STK11 mutations and TP53 mutations but is invariably negative for human papilloma virus when tumor only is tested. It shows variation in incidence between countries. Awareness of the spectrum of morphologic appearances in GAS is important for accurate and confident diagnosis. Correct identification of GAS is important due to its propensity for ovarian and other distant metastases, markedly worse prognosis as compared with usual endocervical adenocarcinoma, and its relative resistance to chemotherapy.",

Over the past several decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Although neutrophils contain a multitude of granular proteins, clinically significant autoantibodies are only recognized against myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3, both of which are present in the azurophilic granules. The propensity to develop these antibodies depends on a variety of predisposing factors such as microbial infection, genetic factors, environmental agents, and therapeutic drugs among others. These factors are usually associated with production of proinflammatory cytokines with capacity to prime the neutrophils. As a result a high proportion of neutrophils in circulation may be primed resulting in exposure of cytoplasmic proteins including myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3 on the surface of the neutrophils. Primed neutrophils are activated by interaction with ANCA in circulation. Activated neutrophils attach to and transmigrate through endothelium and accumulate within the vessel wall. These neutrophils degranulate and produce reactive oxygen radicals and ultimately die, causing tissue injury. Endothelial injury results in leakage of serum proteins and coagulation factors causing fibrinoid necrosis. B cells produce ANCAs, as well as neutrophil abnormalities and imbalances in different T-cell subtypes with excess of Th17, which perpetuate the inflammatory process.",

    "abstract": "Pathologists are adopting whole slide images (WSIs) for diagnosis, thanks to recent FDA approval of WSI systems as class II medical devices. In response to new market forces and recent technology advances outside of pathology, a new field of computational pathology has emerged that applies artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to WSIs. Computational pathology has great potential for augmenting pathologists’ accuracy and efficiency, but there are important concerns regarding trust of AI due to the opaque, black-box nature of most AI algorithms. In addition, there is a lack of consensus on how pathologists should incorporate computational pathology systems into their workflow. To address these concerns, building computational pathology systems with explainable AI (xAI) mechanisms is a powerful and transparent alternative to black-box AI models. xAI can reveal underlying causes for its decisions; this is intended to promote safety and reliability of AI for critical tasks such as pathology diagnosis. This article outlines xAI enabled applications in anatomic pathology workflow that improves efficiency and accuracy of the practice. In addition, we describe HistoMapr-Breast, an initial xAI enabled software application for breast core biopsies. HistoMapr-Breast automatically previews breast core WSIs and recognizes the regions of interest to rapidly present the key diagnostic areas in an interactive and explainable manner. We anticipate xAI will ultimately serve pathologists as an interactive computational guide for computer-assisted primary diagnosis.",

The discovery of recurrent genomic alterations in many benign and malignant mesenchymal neoplasms has added important biologic insights and expanded the spectrum of some diagnostic subgroups. Some tumors are defined by unique genomic alterations, whereas others share abnormalities that are not tumor-specific and can be observed in a sometimes broad range of biologically unrelated neoplasms. We herein focus on novel immunohistochemical markers, based on molecular genetic alterations, which are particularly useful in the diagnostic workup of selected groups of soft tissue and bone tumors, including recently described entities, specifically round cell sarcomas (Ewing sarcoma, CIC-rearranged sarcoma, and BCOR-rearranged sarcoma), vascular tumors (epithelioid hemangioma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma), SMARCB1-deficient neoplasms, adipocytic tumors (spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma, atypical spindle cell lipomatous tumor, and conventional atypical lipomatous tumor), giant cell-rich bone tumors (giant cell tumor of bone and chondroblastoma), and biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma. Given the complex nature of sarcoma classification, and the rarity of many mesenchymal tumor types, careful integration of clinical presentation, imaging features, histology, immunophenotype, and cytogenetic/molecular alterations is crucial for accurate diagnosis of soft tissue and bone tumors.",

The etiology, classification, genetic changes, and malignant progression of these lesions are reviewed. Tobacco remains the principal etiological factor with gastroesophageal reflux disease recently considered as a possible factor. In contrast, there is little evidence that microbiological agents, especially human papillomavirus infection, are frequently involved in laryngeal carcinogenesis and probably <10% of SILs are driven by biologically active human papillomavirus infection. Light microscopy, despite a degree of subjectivity, remains the mainstay of accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and guidance for a patient's treatment. The currently used classifications, the dysplasia system, squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, and the Ljubljana classification, reflect different standpoints on this important topic. The modified Ljubljana classification, with good interobserver agreement, could be considered as a proposal for a unified classification of laryngeal SILs. This review also briefly discusses recently discovered genetic changes, such as CDKN2A and CTNNB1 genes, and chromosome instability of chromosomes 1 and 7; however, none of these can at present improve histologic diagnosis. Malignant progression of precursor lesions varies from 2% to 74%, according to different studies. Cold-steel microinstruments, CO2 laser, and radiotherapy are used to treat the different grades of precursor lesions. There is as yet no worldwide agreement on the treatment of high-grade lesions and carcinoma in situ.",

    "abstract": "The paradigm of pathologic stage (pT) categorization in bladder cancer remains the depth of invasion into the different histologic layers of the bladder wall. However, the approaches to assigning pT stage category toward an enhanced outcome stratification have been marked by challenges and innovations, due in part to our growing appreciation of the surprisingly perplexing bladder histoanatomy. Upstaging of pT1 tumors after radical cystectomy is substantial and underscores the potential value of pT1 substaging in transurethral resection (TUR) specimens. The 2017 American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor-node-metastasis system recommends pT1 substaging but recognizes the need to optimize the approach. Over the years, the cut-off for microinvasion has been significantly lowered to 0.5 mm and is now a promising scheme for pT1 (micrometric) substaging. Unlike the micrometric approach, histoanatomic substaging using muscularis mucosae (MM) and vascular plexus as landmarks is less feasible in TUR specimens and inconsistent in stratifying the outcome of pT1 tumors. The lamina propria possesses inherent variations in depth, MM, and vascular plexus dispositions that should be factored in future pT1 substaging proposals. Histoanatomic variations among the bladder regions also occur, and studies suggest that trigone and bladder neck cancers may have more adverse outcomes. The muscularis propria (MP), besides being the essential histologic landmark for assigning pT2 stage category, is also considered a surrogate for the adequacy of TUR, furthering the importance of identifying its presence in TUR specimens. MP, however, may be mimicked by hyperplastic or isolated MP-like MM muscle bundles in the lamina propria with overstaging implications, and caution should be exercised in distinguishing these 2 muscle types morphologically and immunohistochemically. Presence of additional superficial MP unique from the detrusor muscle proper may also complicate staging at the trigone and ureter insertion sites. With regard to the depth of MP invasion, large and multicenter studies have reaffirmed the prognostic significance of pT2a/b subcategories. It is revealed that there are at least 3 ways used to demarcate the irregular MP to perivesical soft tissue junction, and use of a common criterion indicates improvement in pT2b/pT3a staging reproducibility. Although studies have shown significantly poorer outcome in pT3b compared with pT3a tumors, this designation has a substantial reliance on the prosector's gross assessment of perivesical soft tissue invasion which if performed incorrectly may lead to staging inaccuracy of pT3 tumors. The 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer has updated the staging schema for bladder cancers with concomitant prostatic stromal invasion and cancers within bladder diverticula. Because of 2 possible pT designations, prostatic stromal invasion in TUR specimens should not be automatically staged as either pT4a or pT2 (urethral). Recent data support that bladder cancer invading into the seminal vesicle has comparable outcome to pT4b tumors. Interestingly, several studies in pT4a tumors, which are staged based on sex-specific organs, have shown poorer outcome in females than males after radical cystectomy, and while there are possibly several reasons, they may also include anatomic factors. Despite the progress has been made, work remains to be done to inform future bladder cancer pT category definitions and their reproducibility in application and prognostication.",

These changes are associated with chronic and often debilitating cyclic pain and infertility. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is multifactorial, and several theories have been proposed to explain it. These include retrograde menstruation, celomic metaplasia, embryologic rests, and lymphovascular spread. Hormones, immunologic status, and genetic factors may also play a role. In most patients, the disease involves pelvic organs, but rarely it may also extend to a large variety of distant locations in the body. Patients with ovarian endometriosis are at higher risk for developing ovarian carcinomas including endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas. Some of these carcinomas may arise in a background of structural and/or nuclear atypia within the endometriotic foci. There is no known cure for endometriosis and treatment mostly consists of managing chronic pain or infertility.",

Although the existence of leiomyomas of soft tissue has been questioned in the past, it appears that they do exist but are rare, and must be diagnosed using stringent histologic criteria that include no atypia and minimal or no mitotic activity. They segregate into two distinct clinicopathologic groups, one group occurring in patients of either sex in deep somatic soft tissue and the second occurring primarily in women in the pelvic retroperitoneum. The latter bear a histologic similarity to uterine leiomyomas. Leiomyosarcomas occur in retroperitoneum followed by deep somatic soft tissue and are diagnosed by the presence of nuclear atypia and essentially any level of mitotic activity. Leiomyosarcomas of deep somatic tissue commonly arise from small veins and their behavior can be predicted by a number of factors including age, grade, and \"disruption\" of tumor. Conversely, few factors have proved to be prognostically useful for leiomyosarcomas of the retroperitoneum, as nearly all prove fatal. Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-associated smooth muscle tumors are a recently emerging entity that occur in the setting of immunocompromise. Their behavior is closely tied to the immune status of the patient rather than to specific histologic features.",

Although it most commonly arises in the fascial planes or skeletal muscles of the lower extremities in adults, and in the head and neck region in children, it has also been documented in extraskeletal muscle locations, especially the female genital tract. Despite extensive investigation, the histogenesis of ASPS continues to be an unsettled issue a half century after its description. The most significant morphologic features are the organoid pattern and the ultrastructural demonstration of a secretory activity that ends in the formation of the characteristic crystals. Early suggestions that it was related to paragangliomas or had a Schwann cell derivation have been discounted. More recently, a possible skeletal muscle origin has been favored based on the immunohistochemical demonstration of various muscle-associated proteins, especially desmin. However, a report of immunoreactivity for the myogenic regulatory protein MyoD1 has not been confirmed in subsequent studies. Although some immunohistochemical studies have recently indicated that ASPS may have muscle differentiation, there is presently no conclusive evidence that it represents a unique type of muscle-derived tumor.",

The incidence of benign renal tumors is low, especially when compared to renal cell carcinomas, as most are detected incidentally or at autopsy. Some of these tumors, as their names imply, are unique to the kidney, e.g., renal adenoma, metanephric adenoma, renal oncocytoma, nephrogenic adenofibroma, mesoblastic nephroma, capsuloma, juxtaglomerular cell tumor, renomedullary interstitial cell tumor (medullary fibroma), cystic nephroma, cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma, and cystic hamartoma of the renal pelvis, while others, such as angiomyolipoma, leiomyoma, hemangioma, lipoma, etc., are not unique to the kidney and show similar morphologic features in the other sites they affect. Of the tumor-like lesions, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, malakoplakia, and renal cysts are the most common. The other entities, such as fibroepithelial polyp, are rare, most having been the topic of case reports. In Part I of this paper the benign epithelial tumors of the kidney were previously discussed. This paper (Part II) is devoted to the benign mesenchymal tumors, mixed mesenchymal and epithelial tumors, and the tumor-like lesions.",

Recent studies have shown that HMGI(Y) and HMGI-C are important elements with a role in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. Like other HMG proteins they are responsible for the correct three-dimensional configuration of protein-DNA complexes and therefore play a key role in important cellular processes such as DNA transcription. Aberrant HMGI(Y) and HMGI-C expression generally correlates with a malignant tumor phenotype. However, HMGI(Y) and HMGI-C dysregulation, as a result of specific chromosomal rearrangements, is also being identified in a variety of common benign mesenchymal tumors such as lipomas and uterine leiomyomas making HMGI(Y) and HMGI-C genes probably the most commonly rearranged genes in human neoplasms. While a precise definition of the HMGI(Y) and HMGI-C role in tumor initiation and progression is still missing, it is likely that future investigations will contribute valuable insights to the understanding of human neoplasia.",

Prototypical of these are the Schneiderian papillomas (inverted, fungiform, and cylindrical cell) and their malignant counterparts. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is currently the leading candidate as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of the papillomas. Carcinomas arise in association with the papillomas in about a 10% frequency. The carcinomas may be synchronous or metachronous. Recurrences of the papillomas are the bane of surgeons. The magnitude of the recurrences is directly proportional to the completeness of removal with the best results obtained by techniques that afford the best operative exposure. A comparison of results by different surgical procedures is presented. Histologic features sought to predict recurrences or malignant transformation have, by and large, not been helpful. Keratinization and hyperkeratosis in papillomas, however, are suggested to be sufficiently ominous as to warrant further study.",

They variably express myoid immunohistochemical markers, and their differential diagnosis includes benign myofibroblastic proliferations such as fasciitis and fibromatosis as well as other types of spindle cell sarcoma. High-grade (pleomorphic) myofibrosarcomas are an ultrastructurally defined subset of malignant fibrous histiocytoma, which they resemble in morphology and behavior.

In this review, these cases are reported using updated terminology and almost all cases were immunophenotyped using immunohistochemical methods or flow cytometric methods in a small subset of cases. These cases have also been segregated into two groups: 1) localized NHL, that presumably initially arose in the gynecologic tract and therefore are primary; and 2) NHL that involved the gynecologic tract as a part of systemic disease, and therefore most likely represent secondary involvement of the gynecologic tract.

Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney is characterized by deletion of the hSNF5/INI1 gene, which links it to other rhabdoid tumors of infancy that arise in the soft tissue and brain. Primary renal synovial sarcomas and renal primitive neuroectodermal tumors have become accepted entities, and likely comprise a subset of what had previously been termed \"adult Wilms tumor.\" Renal carcinomas associated with Xp11.2 translocations that result in fusions involving the TFE3 transcription factor gene have been delineated, including a distinctive neoplasm that shares the identical gene fusion as alveolar soft part sarcoma. Most recently, a distinctive type of renal neoplasm with a t(6;11)(p21;q12) has been described, and the cloning of the resulting gene fusion links it to the Xp11 translocation carcinomas. Together, these last two translocation-associated tumors represent a significant proportion of pediatric renal cell carcinomas. This review highlights each of these recent advances.",

However, there is a wide differential, and pathologists often struggle to make a correct diagnosis because of overlapping histologic features. Perhaps the best known of these neoplasms is ovarian small cell carcinoma of hypercalcemic type (OSCCHT), a tumor of unknown histogenesis. This may be confused with a wide range of neoplasms ranging from sex cord-stromal tumors (some of which may exhibit a small cell phenotype) to neoplasms in the family of small round blue cell tumors to various undifferentiated malignancies. A neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma, so-called small cell carcinoma of pulmonary type, may also arise within the ovary, and this may be a component of a typical ovarian surface epithelial-stromal tumor. In addition to the well-known family of small round blue cell tumors of childhood, other small cell neoplasms that may arise within the ovary or involve the ovary include intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumor, metastatic small cell carcinoma, peripheral and central primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and endometrial stromal sarcoma. Malignant melanoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, and various germ cell tumors, especially dysgerminoma and immature teratoma, also on occasion enter into the differential diagnosis of an ovarian small cell neoplasm. In this review, the morphologic features of some of these neoplasms are described, as is the value of immunohistochemistry and other ancillary techniques in establishing a diagnosis.",

This strategy, although effective, depends on both sensitivity and specificity of cytology and precise histologic distinction between precursor lesions and their mimics during biopsy interpretation. The effective application of diagnostic criteria is operator dependent and varies as a function of experience and training. However, because human papilloma viruses (HPV) are causative agents and alter the cell cycle in cervical neoplasms, host genes interacting directly or indirectly with HPV oncoproteins have been identified in vitro. Recent research has centered on identifying the host genes upregulated in association with HPV infection, determining their suitability as \"surrogate markers\" for HPV infection, and using these markers to identify HPV-associated epithelial lesions in tissue or cytologic specimens. This review surveys recent advances in this field, summarizing the advantages and limitations of several candidate biomarkers, including PCNA, Ki-67, cyclin E, p16ink4, MN antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and telomerase in the recognition of preinvasive cervical neoplasia, and discusses their future potential in cervical cancer screening. Based on current studies, the strongest candidates for diagnosis and screening are p16 and cyclin E (squamous) and MN (glandular) biomarkers. As new genes are identified and tested, the concept of biomarkers as tools in primary screening and lesion recognition will continue to mature.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Breast cancer can only be life threatening when it becomes invasive, at which point it carries potential for spreading and metastasis. Therefore, it is critical to distinguish invasive carcinomas (IC) from noninvasive lesions, the latter including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and benign breast lesions. While this distinction is usually made based on histologic evaluation alone, in a small but significant number of cases, accurate diagnosis may be impossible, particularly in the context of core needle biopsies. To this end, a number of immunohistochemical markers have been utilized to help establish the presence (or absence) of stromal invasion. The fact that the loss of the myoepithelial cell (MEC) layer is a hallmark of IC (but not DCIS) suggests the use of antibodies to MEC to distinguish IC from DCIS. However, these markers have a wide range of specificity and sensitivity, with the potential for problems in interpretation. The use of many of these markers is limited by high rates of 'false positive' or 'false negative' immunostaining. In this review, the biology of stromal invasion in breast carcinomas will be discussed, as well as the various myoepithelial markers, with emphasis on pitfalls related to their sensitivity and specificity in the detection of MECs in the breast. Finally, the authors will discuss diagnostically challenging breast lesions, which may require the use of MEC marker studies to reach a definitive diagnosis.",

Cytologically, there may be overlap with classical well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

Keratoacanthomas should, therefore, be considered to be a clinically distinct variant of well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma capable of spontaneous regression.

Regression is immunologically mediated and activated by a variety of molecular mechanisms.

Thus, most ovarian teratomas are benign, and most testicular teratomas are malignant, with the exception of those occurring in children. These general statements, however, do not hold true for ovarian teratomas that are \"immature\" or exhibit \"malignant transformation\" and for dermoid and epidermoid cysts of the testis, categories of ovarian and testicular teratomas that are malignant and benign, respectively. This review concentrates on some of the \"newer\" observations concerning these interesting and confusing neoplasms, including diagnostically deceptive patterns. It is the author's opinion that much of the confusion regarding gonadal teratomas can be clarified by the concept that the usual ovarian teratoma derives from a benign germ cell in a parthenogenetic-like fashion, whereas the typical postpubertal testicular example derives from a malignant germ cell, mostly after evolution of that originally malignant cell to an invasive germ cell tumor (ie, embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, etc). The postpubertal testicular teratomas can therefore be thought of as an end-stage pattern of differentiation of a malignant germ cell tumor. The pediatric testicular teratomas, as well as dermoid and epidermoid cysts of the testis, however, must derive from benign germ cells, in a fashion similar to most ovarian teratomas. The teratomatous components of mixed germ cell tumors of the ovary, on the other hand, likely have a pathogenesis similar to that of postpubertal testicular teratomas.",

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, World Health Organization grade IV), the most malignant form of infiltrating astrocytoma, can present as a high-grade lesion from the outset (so-called de novo GBM) or can evolve from a lower grade precursor lesion (secondary GBM). Molecular genetic investigations suggest that GBM is best regarded as a clinicopathologic entity composed of multiple molecular genetic subsets. Molecular alterations associated with progression to GBM and that define genetic subsets include epidermal growth factor receptor amplifications, p53 mutations, retinoblastoma pathway alterations [most commonly, p16(CDKN2A) losses], and chromosome 10 alterations, including PTEN mutations. Despite the wide range of genetic events that ultimately lead to GBM, the vascular changes that evolve are remarkably similar. Microvascular hyperplasia is spatially and temporally associated with pseudopalisading necrosis in GBM and is believed to be driven by hypoxia-induced expression of proangiogenic cytokines such vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition, genetic alterations in GBM are thought to contribute directly or indirectly to angiogenic dysregulation. Both p53 mutations and genetic losses on chromosome 10 may tip the balance toward an angiogenic phenotype through upregulation of proangiogenic factors and/or downregulation of angiogenesis inhibitors. Understanding genetic events and their relation to angiogenic regulation in astrocytic neoplasms may eventually lead to therapies that are specifically directed at molecularly defined subsets of these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Anal squamous cell carcinoma and its precursor lesions are increasing in incidence in the United States and Europe. This trend predates human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome and has been associated with persistent high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) genotype infection, previous lower genital tract dysplasia/carcinoma, high frequency anoreceptive intercourse, heavy cigarette smoking, immunosuppression in solid organ transplant and immune disorders, and human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity. Screening protocols for at-risk patients are under active investigation and pathologists are often asked to assess anal canal and perianal biopsies for the presence of dysplasia and/or invasive carcinoma. Because underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of anal cancer and precancer may lead to inappropriate treatment, it is important for the pathologist to be aware of current screening strategies, specific risk lesions, and the role of pathology in initial diagnosis and evaluation of anal biopsy and/or resection specimens. Standardized histologic criteria and uniform terminology should be used for reporting all anal canal and perianal squamous intraepithelial lesions. HPV subtyping, anal cytology, and recently identified biomarkers, such as p16 and Becton Dickinson ProEx C may provide additional information in problematic cases, but it is important to be aware of the limitations of these assays. HPV has been linked to all the major histologic subtypes of anal carcinoma (eg, basaloid, cloacogenic, transitional, etc.) and this association is strongest for anal canal lesions. With the possible exception of the microcystic pattern, histologic subtype does not seem to predict prognosis; and anal squamous cell carcinomas should be classified as either keratinizing or nonkeratinizing. Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas have a worse prognosis and should be distinguished from poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and neuroendocrine tumors. Very well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with pushing margins (so-called giant condyloma of Buschke and Lowenstein) should be classified as verrucous carcinoma; this tumor shows aggressive local infiltration but does not metastasize. As all anal condylomata may harbor foci of high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma, careful sectioning and complete histologic examination is required.",

Subsequently, the SHH network has been shown to be critical for normal mammalian development, by mediating interactions between stromal and epithelial cells. Recent evidence suggests that, deregulation of SHH signaling is important in the pathogenesis of cancer. Further, some observations suggest that a SHH paracrine mechanism mediating tumor-mesenchymal interactions may contribute to the metastatic capacity of cancer. Preclinical studies demonstrate that tumor cells in which SHH is deregulated are dependent on signaling through this pathway for the maintenance of proliferation and viability. SHH antagonists have been identified and show promise in inhibiting tumor growth in preclinical studies. The utility of these agents in the management of cancer patients awaits the outcome of ongoing and future clinical trials.",

Dysproteinemia results from clonal proliferation of plasma cells or B lymphocytes. The abnormal circulating Ig molecules or subunits (most commonly free light chains) reach the glomerulus via the systemic circulation and are associated with the development of a variety of pathologic lesions within the kidney. Free light chain molecules may pass through the glomerular basement membrane and form casts within distal tubular lumina (myeloma cast nephropathy) or form crystals within the cytoplasm of proximal tubules (light chain Fanconi syndrome). Alternatively, Ig molecules or subunits may form paraprotein tissue deposits and produce an array of pathologic lesions, most commonly amyloidosis and monoclonal Ig deposition disease. The pattern of renal parenchymal disease is determined by the unique properties of the Ig molecule or subunit. Each of the patterns of renal disease is in turn associated with unique, but frequently overlapping, clinical features and outcomes.

The results from several series have shown a high overall sensitivity and specificity for DOG1 in the detection of GISTs and about 6% of GISTs overall exhibiting a DOG1+/KIT-immunoprofile. DOG1 antibodies are more sensitive than KIT antibodies in detecting tumors of gastric origin, tumors with epithelioid morphology, and tumors harboring PDGFRA mutation. Furthermore, DOG1 immunoreactivity is rarely observed in other mesenchymal and nonmesenchymal tumor types. These results support the use of DOG1 as a diagnostic biomarker for GIST.

    "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) are a frequent diagnosis in anatomic pathology practice. Tobacco use and heavy alcohol consumption are known risk factors for HNSCC but in other cases human papillomavirus (HPV) is linked to carcinogenesis. HPV proteins E6 and E7 promote oncogenesis by blocking the action of p53 and pRB, respectively. An absence of p53 mutations in addition to expression of p16 are part of the distinct molecular profile identified in the subset of HNSCCs because of HPV. Various methods are available for HPV detection but polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization techniques are commonly used. Both methods are amenable for testing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue that is a sample type readily available to the pathologist. HPV is detectable in approximately a quarter of all HNSCCs, and is particularly prevalent in the oropharynx in which the positivity rates approach 40%. A vast majority of HPV-related HNSCCs are owing to HPV type 16 with types 18, 31, and 33 accounting for almost all of the remaining cases. HPV-related HNSCCs are associated with better prognosis for both recurrence and survival. This group of tumors has also been shown to respond well to radiation treatment. As the clinical relevance of HPV in HNSCCs continues to emerge, anatomic pathologists are likely to receive increasing requests for testing. Herein, the authors review the biological and clinical aspects of HPV-associated HNSCC and review techniques for HPV detection.",

These tests have used both slide-based methods including immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization and nonmorphology driven molecular platforms including quantitative multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction and genomic microarray profiling. In this review, a series of partially and completely commercialized multigene assays are compared with the standard breast cancer clinico-pathologic variables and biomarkers and evaluated as to the level of their scientific validation, current clinical utility, regulatory approval status, and estimated cost-benefit. A comparison of the Oncotype Dx and MammaPrint assays indicates that the Oncotype Dx test has the advantages of an earlier commercial launch in the US, wide acceptance for payment by third party payors, the ease of use of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues, a recommendation as ready for use by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Tumor Markers Update Committee, a continuous rather than dichotomous algorithm, inclusion of both estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 in the mRNA profile, an ability to serve as both a prognostic and predictive test for certain hormonal and chemotherapeutic agents, demonstrated cost-effectiveness in 1 published study, and a high accrual rate for the prospective validation clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment Rx). The MammaPrint assay has the advantages of a 510(k) clearance by the US Food and Drug Administration, a larger gene number which may enhance further utility, and the potentially wider patient eligibility including lymph node-positive, ER-negative, and younger patients being accrued into the prospective trial (the Microarray in Node-negative Disease may Avoid ChemoTherapy).

    "abstract": "Bladder urothelial carcinoma is typically a disease of older individuals and rarely occurs below the age of 40 years. There is debate and uncertainty in the literature regarding the clinicopathologic characteristics of bladder urothelial neoplasms in younger patients compared with older patients, although no consistent age criteria have been used to define \"younger\" age group categories. Use of the World Health Organization 2004/International Society of Urological Pathology 1998 grading nomenclature and recent molecular studies highlight certain unique features of bladder urothelial neoplasms in young patients, particularly in patients below 20 years of age. In this meta-analysis and review, the clinical, pathologic, and molecular features and risk factors of bladder urothelial neoplasms in patients 40 years or less are presented and analyzed according to decades of presentation. Similar to older patients, bladder urothelial neoplasms in patients 40 years or younger occur more common in male patients, present mainly with gross painless hematuria, and are more commonly located at bladder trigone/ureteral orifices, but in contrast have a greater chance for unifocality. Delay in diagnosis of bladder urothelial neoplasms seems not to be uncommon in younger patients probably because of its relative rarity and the predominance of benign causes of hematuria in this age group causing hesitancy for an aggressive work-up. Most tumors in patients younger than 40 years were low grade. The incidence of low-grade tumors was the lowest in the first 2 decades of life, with incremental increase of the percentage of high-grade tumors with increasing age decades. Classification according to the World Health Organization 2004/International Society of Urological Pathology grading system identified papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential to be relatively frequent among bladder tumors of young patients particularly in the teenage years. Similar to grade, there was marked predominance of low stage tumors in the first 2 decades of life with gradual inclusion of few higher stage and metastatic tumors in the 2 older decades. Bladder urothelial neoplasms occurring in patients <20 years of age lack or have a much lower incidence of aberrations in chromosome 9, FGFR3, p53, and microsatellite instability and have fewer epigenetic alterations. Tumor recurrence and deaths were infrequent in the first 2 decades and increased gradually in each successive decade, likely influenced by the increased proportion of higher grade and higher stage tumors. Our review of the literature shows that urothelial neoplasms of the bladder occurring in young patients exhibit unique pathologic and molecular features that translate to its more indolent behavior; this distinction is most pronounced in patients <20 years. Our overall inferences have potential implications for choosing appropriate noninvasive diagnostic and surveillance modalities, whenever feasible, and for selecting suitable treatment strategies that factor in quality of life issues vital to younger patients.",

Some mesenchymal tumors, such as leiomyomas of the muscularis mucosae, are easily distinguished from GIST on the basis of their anatomic location and morphologic appearance. Others, such as gastrointestinal schwannomas, can significantly overlap with GIST in their gross appearance and morphology and require a panel of immunostains for correct diagnosis. This article will review the most common mimics of GISTs: desmoid tumors, smooth muscle tumors (leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas), gastrointestinal schwannomas, inflammatory fibroid polyps, and solitary fibrous tumors. Pertinent differences between each of these tumors and GIST in terms of gross appearance, histologic features, and immunophenotype will be emphasized. It is important to separate GISTs from these potential mimics because their treatment and prognosis can differ markedly.",

    "abstract": "There are 2 well-recognized cell populations lining the mammary duct system: the epithelial cells lining the lumen and the myoepithelial cells surrounding them. The mammary stem cell, a putative third cell type, has not yet been well characterized. It is not established whether the putative stem cell expresses the full complement, a subset, or none of the markers of normal epithelial and/or myoepithelial cells. However, it is likely that they would have distinctive markers of their own; whether these are retained or lost in their neoplastic progeny is unknown. All 3 cell types may theoretically undergo malignant transformation. Until recently, however, nearly all attention has been focused on carcinomas of epithelial derivation/differentiation. The advent of oligonucleotide and cDNA microarrays has facilitated gene expression profiling of breast cancers, revealing molecular subclasses that may be prognostically relevant. One such subclass, the basal-like breast carcinomas, has been found in numerous independent datasets to be associated with a comparatively worse overall and disease-free survival. These cancers show expression of molecules characteristic of the normal myoepithelial cell, such as basal cytokeratins, and reduced expression of estrogen receptor-related and Erb-B2-related genes and proteins. The classifier genes that formed the basis for the delineation of basal-like carcinomas were derived from datasets that were composed predominantly of ductal type cancers. Therefore, the clinical significance of a basal-like gene expression or immunohistochemical profile in the other breast cancer subtypes is presently unknown. Herein, we evaluate in detail the current state of knowledge on the pathologic features of breast carcinomas classified as basal-like by immunohistochemical and/or gene expression profiling criteria, with an emphasis on their full phenotypic spectrum and also previously underemphasized areas of heterogeneity and ambiguity where present. There seems to be a phenotypic and biologic spectrum of basal-like or myoepithelial-type carcinomas, just as there is a wide range among tumors of luminal epithelial derivation/differentiation. It is critical to promote lucid morphologic definitions of the molecular subtypes, if this information is intended for use in targeted therapies and patient management.",

    "abstract": "Testicular tumors are both increasing in frequency and disproportionately occur in young men; furthermore, different forms of neoplasm require different treatments. These considerations make the accurate diagnosis of testicular tumors especially important. Many of the critical distinctions involve the differentiation of seminoma from one or more potential mimics because seminoma is not only the most common testicular neoplasm but it is also the only malignant testicular tumor that is commonly treated with radiation, which is ineffective in other malignancies of the testis. For the most part, accurate diagnosis can be achieved by careful light microscopic evaluation, although appropriate immunostains can provide diagnostic assistance if doubt persists. This article discusses a number of clinically important differential diagnoses in the testis that are common sources of misinterpretations. These include: seminoma versus embryonal carcinoma, seminoma versus yolk sac tumor, seminoma versus Sertoli cell tumor, seminoma with syncytiotrophoblast cells versus choriocarcinoma, granulomatous seminoma versus granulomatous orchitis, intertubular seminoma versus orchitis, lymphoma versus seminoma or embryonal carcinoma, dermoid cyst versus teratoma, scar versus regressed germ cell tumor, and \"anaplastic\" spermatocytic seminoma versus usual seminoma or embryonal carcinoma.",

Primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus has been the subject mostly of case reports. This tumor has a dismal prognosis with a frequency estimated to be approximately 0.1% to 0.2% of all esophageal malignancies. According to the review by Volpin et al of November 2002, 238 cases of primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus have been published up to early 2001. We present an additional case of primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus of the amelanotic variant in a 69-year-old man. The patient was preoperatively investigated by esophageal endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound. The surgically resected tumor specimen was examined histologically and supplemented by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis. Intra-abdominal relapse occurred after 8 months at the site of surgery, necessitating repeat resection. The patient died of advanced intra-abdominal disease 14 months after the primary diagnosis. A comprehensive computerized (PubMed/Medline) review of the world literature was also carried out and 99 additional cases (after the review by Volpin et al) were found, 9 of them from the 1990s which escaped previous tabulations, and 90 from the years 2000 to 2010, amounting to a grand total of 337 ever published.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer represents a heterogeneous group of tumors with varied morphologic and biological features, behavior, and response to therapy. The present routine clinical management of breast cancer relies on the availability of robust prognostic and predictive factors to support decision making. Breast cancer patients are stratified into risk groups based on a combination of classical time-dependent prognostic variables (staging) and biological prognostic and predictive variables. Staging variables include tumor size, lymph node stage, and extent of tumor spread. Classical biological variables include morphologic variables such as tumor grade and molecular markers such as hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. Although individual molecular markers were introduced in the field of breast cancer management many years ago, the concept of molecular classification was raised after the introduction of global gene expression profiling and the identification of multigene classifiers. Although there is no doubt that gene expression profiling technology has revolutionized the field of breast cancer research and have been widely expected to improve breast cancer prognostication, the unprecedented speed of progress and publicity associated with the introduction of these commercially-based multigene classifiers should not lead us to expect this technology to replace the classical classification systems. These multigene classifiers have the potential to complement traditional methods through provision of additional biological prognostic and predictive information in presently indeterminate risk groups. Here we present updated information on the present clinical value of classical clinicopathologic factors, molecular taxonomy, and multigene classifiers in routine patients management and provide some critical views and practical expectations.",

Predominantly cystic renal tumors include cystic nephroma/mixed epithelial and stromal tumor, synovial sarcoma, and multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma. These entities are own tumor entities of the 2004 WHO classification of renal tumors. Tubulocystic carcinoma and acquired cystic disease-associated renal cell carcinoma are neoplasms with an intrinsically cystic growth pattern. Both tumor types should be included in a future WHO classification as novel entities owing to their characteristic features. Cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma frequently coexist within the kidneys of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas often contain cysts, usually as a minor component. Some clear cell renal cell carcinomas have prominent cysts, and multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma is composed almost exclusively of cysts. Recent molecular findings suggest that clear cell renal cancer may develop through cyst-dependent and cyst-independent molecular pathways.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma may be difficult in some cases, particularly in the small image-guided biopsies that are becoming more common. As targeted therapies for renal cell carcinoma are now standard treatment, the recognition and diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma has become even more critical. Many adjunctive immunohistochemical markers of renal epithelial lineage such as CD10 and RCCma have been proposed as aids in the diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, but low specificities often limit their utility. More recently described markers (PAX-2, PAX-8, human kidney injury molecule-1, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-β, and carbonic anhydrase-IX) offer the potential for greater sensitivity and specificity in this diagnostic setting; however, knowledge of their expected staining in other neoplasms and tissues is critical for appropriate use. In this review, we discuss the most widely used immunohistochemical markers of renal lineage with an emphasis on their sensitivity and specificity for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Subsequently, we present a variety of organ-specific differential diagnostic scenarios in which metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma might be considered and we propose immunopanels for use in each situation.",

An increasing body of evidence accumulated in the past 40 years reveals increasing incidence and prevalence rates, a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, and several histologic variants. Although several recent randomized clinical trials confirmed the efficacy of oral budesonide in treating LC and CC, disease relapse after a short-duration treatment is common. Despite their common clinical presentations and well-defined histologic diagnostic criteria, there are only few studies on the immunologic abnormalities in colonic tissue. The aim of this review is to (1) familiarize the pathologists in general practice with histomorphology of LC and CC, including the rare histologic variants and the clinical implication associated with these 2 diagnoses, (2) summarize the data from recent randomized clinical trials of oral budesonide, and (3) review immunological studies on colonic tissue. Overall, immunologic abnormalities of colonic tissue seem to explain for the histomorphologic features and the clinical symptomatology of LC and CC. Advances in the understanding of the underlying immunologic abnormalities in the colonic tissue may help develop novel and effective therapies for these 2 diseases.",

The use of telepathology for clinical patient care has so far been limited to relatively few large academic institutions. Although a number of challenges remain, there is increasing demand for the use of information technology in pathology as a whole owing to the expansion of health care networks and the opportunity to enhance the quality of service delivered to patients. The software used to acquire, display, and manage digital images for clinical patient care may be subject to national and federal regulations just as is any other electronic information system.

The sole plausible causative factor so far ascertained in the pathogenesis of these tumors is asbestos, which however is found in only around 30% to 40% of such cases. The age range of affected individuals is wide, mostly adults and the elderly, but also includes young people and children. The most common presenting symptom is either hydrocele of unknown origin or intrascrotal mass. When hydrocele is the presenting symptom, these tumors are often clinically overlooked and the diagnosis is delayed. Most paratesticular mesotheliomas arise in the tunica vaginalis, but primary tumors of the spermatic cord and epididymis are also on record. Tumors arising from the peritoneal mesothelium of a hernia sac are excluded from this group. The correct diagnosis is almost always made after histologic examination of the operative specimen. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy are always helpful and sometimes necessary tools for diagnosis. So far very few cases have been identified or suspected preoperatively on cytologic examination. Three clinicopathologic types of malignant mesotheliomas of the male genital tract are recognized: diffuse tubulo-papillary mesothelioma, well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma, and multicystic mesothelioma. The histologic subtypes are almost always pure epithelial or biphasic. The differential diagnosis is mainly with serous papillary tumors arising from Mullerian vestiges, but several diverse primary or secondary tumors also need to be considered. A clinicopathologic evaluation of a case of tunical diffuse mesothelioma in a 74-year-old male from the AMR Series is the starting point for this general review.",

Secondary immunodeficiencies must be excluded. Morphologically, the predominant polymorphic subtype shows a mixed proliferation of large transformed cells, plasma cells, plasmablasts, lymphocytes, and commonly Reed-Sternberg (RS)-like cells, whereas the monomorphic subtype reveals sheets of large cells. An additional characteristic feature is large areas of “geographical” necrosis. EBV+ DLBCL of the elderly is positive for pan-B cell markers and often for CD30. EBV infection detected by Epstein Barr early RNA in situ hybridization should be present in the majority of tumor cells. Most cases express LMP1 and up to 32% EBNA2, the latter a sign of an impaired immune system. The most challenging differential diagnosis is EBV+ classical Hodgkin lymphoma in older patients. Strong, homogeneous expression of B-cell markers, including transcription factors OCT2 and BOB.1, and lack of CD15 support a diagnosis of EBV+ DLBCL. EBV+ DLBCL of the elderly accounts for 8% to 10% of DLBCL in Asian countries, but seems to be uncommon in Western populations, indicating an ethnic or geographic predisposition. Clinically, patients may present with nodal or extranodal involvement. B-symptoms and poor performance status are common, and prognosis is significantly inferior compared with EBV- cases. Whether EBV+DLBCL of the elderly represents a true entity or only a DLBCL variant remains to be determined.",

Prompt biopsy evaluation and notification of the referring physician is essential to facilitate rapid therapeutic intervention. The differential diagnostic categories of crescentic GN include pauci-immune GN, anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis and immune complex-mediated GN, distinguished from one another by immunofluorescence and electron microscopic study of the renal biopsy. Immune complex-mediated GN is characterized by abundant glomerular deposits and encompasses several diseases including but not limited to lupus nephritis, cryoglobulinemic GN and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Pauci-immune GN, with paucity of deposits, correlates closely with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody disease due to the identifiable circulating pathogenic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in most patients. Recent studies have identified other antibodies in pauci-immune GN and implicated infectious organisms in triggering autoimmunity in a susceptible host by molecular mimicry of host antigens. Anti-GBM nephritis is a rare but potentially life-threatening autoimmune disease with circulating antibodies against GBM epitopes in α3 chain of type IV collagen. It is characterized by a linear immunoglobulin G deposition along GBM on immunofluorescence microscopy. Environmental triggers including infections and solvent exposure seem to change the tertiary structure of the type IV collagen α345 hexamer in GBM, expose neoepitopes, and initiate autoimmunity. Even in light of advances in understanding of pathophysiology and serologic testing, renal biopsy remains the mainstay of diagnosis of crescentic GN.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, a new pathologic entity has emerged: indolent T-lymphoblastic proliferation (iT-LBP). iT-LBPs share immunophenotypic similarities with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma; however, T-lymphoblastic proliferations are clinically indolent, and unlike the malignant counterpart, these expansions of nonclonal terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)+ T cells do not require treatment. Here we review the clinical and pathologic features, which are required for an accurate diagnosis of an iT-LBP. We demonstrate specific criteria can be used to accurately diagnose iT-LBP, notably: (1) confluent groups of TdT+ T cells in a biopsy specimen, (2) relative preservation of surrounding normal lymphoid architecture, (3) TdT+ T cells without morphologic atypia, (4) absence of thymic epithelium, (5) nonclonal TdT+ T cells, (6) immunophenotype of developmentally normal immature thymic T cells, and (7) clinical evidence of indolence (follow-up >6 mo without progression).",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a global public health problem and is currently the most polarized cancer in the world. Attention to this disease, public awareness, and advances in breast imaging have made a positive impact on breast cancer screening and detection. The growing use of image-detected biopsies has led to increased diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ and high-risk proliferative breast lesions. This progress, however, has created a challenge for pathologists. In lieu of the fact that these entities are difficult to diagnose even in tissue sections taken from surgically excised lesions, pathologist are now expected to diagnose them in small and often fragmented tissue/cellular samples obtained from image-guided biopsies. In addition, some proliferative lesions are associated with an increased risk of finding neighboring malignancy when diagnosed on minimally invasive procedures. Therefore, classifying these lesions in small biopsies is difficult and risky. Some of the most challenging areas in diagnostic pathology includes the differentiation between atypical ductal hyperplasia and low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular neoplasia versus solid low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, the correct interpretation of papillary lesions with atypia, and classifying the spectrum of columnar cell changes. Although these issues have been recognized for years, consensus criteria and uniform terminology for the diagnosis of these problematic lesions are far from being achieved. The purpose of this study is to review these \"borderline\" proliferative lesions in an effort to clarify some criteria and prompt the most needed discussion for consensus.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is involved in one of the at least 2 pathways leading to vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC). Inactivation of p53 and retinoblastoma by the viral products E6 and E7 is involved in malignant transformation. The percentage of HPV-positive VSCCs ranges from 18% to 75%, depending on the geographical area. HPV-associated tumors affect relatively young women and arise from high-grade intraepithelial lesions, identical to other HPV-associated premalignant lesions of the anogenital tract. HPV-independent tumors tend to affect older women and usually arise in a background of inflammatory skin disorders and a subtle variant of in situ lesion called differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. HPV-positive tumors tend to be of basaloid or warty types, whereas HPV-independent tumors tend to be of keratinizing type, but there is frequent overlap between histologic types. There is no conclusive evidence yet on the best strategy in terms of determining HPV attribution. HPV DNA detection is generally considered the gold standard although there is some concern about misclassification when using this technique alone. p16 immunostaining has shown to be an excellent surrogate marker of HPV infection. Positive results for both techniques are considered the best evidence for HPV-association. The prognostic role of HPV in VSCC is still contradictory, but increasing evidence suggests that HPV-associated tumors are less aggressive. Currently, there are no differences in treatment between HPV-associated and HPV-independent VSCC, but novel immunological strategies based on anti-HPV antigens are being evaluated in clinical trials.",

Until recently, the reporting of salivary gland FNA specimens was inconsistent among different institutions throughout the world, leading to diagnostic confusion among pathologists and clinicians. In 2015, an international group of pathologists initiated the development of an evidence-based tiered classification system for reporting salivary gland FNA specimens designated the \"Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology\" (MSRSGC) that culminated with the publication of the MSRSGC Atlas in February 2018. The MSRSGC consists of 6 diagnostic categories, which incorporate the morphologic heterogeneity and overlap among various non-neoplastic, benign, and malignant lesions of the salivary glands. In addition, each diagnostic category is associated with a risk of malignancy and management recommendations. The main goal of the MSRSGC is to improve communication between cytopathologists and treating clinicians, while also facilitating cytologic-histologic correlation, sharing of data from different laboratories for quality control, and research. Herein, we review the current status of salivary gland cytology and the role of MSRSGC in providing a framework for reporting salivary gland lesions.",

Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is a classic example of PIGN with diffuse proliferative and exudative glomerular histology, dominant C3 staining and subepithelial \"humps.\" Only the nephritogenic streptococcal infections cause PSGN and susceptibility to develop PSGN depends on both host and microbial factors. Over the last decade, two nephritogenic antigens, \"nephritis-associated plasmin receptor\" and \"streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B\" have been identified. PSGN is a self-limited disease, especially in children, but long-term follow-up studies indicate persistent low-grade renal abnormalities in a significant proportion of patients. PSGN continues to be a serious public health concern in third world countries, but the incidence of streptococcal infections has steadily declined in industrialized nations. PIGN in the western world is now primarily because of nonstreptococcal infections, often affecting older individuals with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus or alcoholism, and is associated with poor outcomes. Although the acute PIGN has diffuse proliferative, focal segmental proliferative or mesangioproliferative patterns of glomerular injury, chronic or subacute infection-associated glomerulonephritis typically results in membranoproliferative appearance. PIGN has dominant C3 staining with frequent occurrence of subepithelial \"humps\" as well as subendothelial deposits. The immunoglobulin staining on immunofluorescence is typically weak, but immunoglobulin A-dominant PIGN is a recently defined entity often associated with staphylococcal infections. The wide spectrum of morphologic changes seen in PIGN poses a diagnostic challenge, especially if adequate clinical and serological data are lacking.",

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer is a relatively common and potentially life-threatening neoplasm. The diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma usually entails a lifelong surveillance to detect recurrent disease. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in urinary bladder. An early step in the process of carcinoma development is establishment of a premalignant abnormal urothelial patch that may give rise to various types of urothelial carcinoma and may provide a fertile ground for development of multifocal synchronous and metachronous tumors. Two distinct molecular pathways are involved. Low-grade papillary carcinoma is associated with mutation in the FGFR3 or in some cases mutations in RAS genes. High-grade in situ/muscle-invasive carcinoma on the other hand is characterized by alteration of p53 and pRB. Loss of function of these key genes, which play a crucial role in the control of cell cycle, leads to accumulation of additional mutations and deletions of genes resulting in an aggressive phenotype. It is hoped that a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of urothelial cancer will facilitate early diagnosis and will lead to development of new modalities for the management and treatment of these carcinomas.",

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with sarcomatoid differentiation (sarcomatoid RCC) represents a good example of EMT both morphologically and immunohistochemically. Early spindle cell changes can at times be identified in RCC and likely represent an early step toward EMT. Herein, we present a review of the current understanding of EMT in renal neoplasms including some known signaling regulation, the association of sarcomatoid differentiation in RCC with aggressive behavior and dismal prognosis, and EMT-related tumor biology in sarcomatoid RCC. A better perception of the EMT may contribute toward an improved understanding of the development of sarcomatoid RCC. In addition, a distinct signature for sarcomatoid RCC may have utility in the differential diagnosis for prognostic stratification as well as in identifying novel genes and pathway targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Since the first description of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) as a distinctive highly aggressive sinonasal neoplasm with probable origin from the sinonasal mucosa (Schneiderian epithelium), SNUC has been the subject of ongoing study and controversy. In particular, the SNUC category gradually became a “wastebasket” for any undifferentiated or unclassifiable sinonasal malignancy of definite or probable epithelial origin. However, with the availability of more specific and sensitive immunohistochemical antibodies and increasing implementation of novel genetic tools, the historical SNUC category became the subject of progressive subdivision leading to recognition of specific genetically defined, reproducible subtypes. These recently recognized entities are characterized by distinctive genetic aberrations including NUTM1 -rearranged carcinoma (NUT carcinoma) and carcinomas associated with inactivation of different members of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling gene complex such as SMARCB1-deficient and less frequently SMARCA4-deficient carcinoma. The ring became almost closed, with recent studies highlighting frequent oncogenic IDH2 mutations in the vast majority of histologically defined SNUCs, with a frequency of 82%. A review of these cases suggests the possibility that “true SNUC” probably represents a distinctive neoplastic disease entity, morphologically, phenotypically, and genetically. This review addresses this topic from a historical perspective, with a focus on recently recognized genetically defined subsets within the SNUC spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial carcinoma has been traditionally divided into type 1 or endometrioid type that is usually moderate to well differentiated and type 2 that is usually poorly differentiated with high histologic grade and aggressive clinical behavior. However, interobserver diagnostic agreement is suboptimal, particularly among the high-grade histotypes. Furthermore, recent data indicate that this histotype assignment does not independently correlate with survival. In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in our understanding of the molecular basis of endometrial carcinoma and extensive molecular studies have been performed under The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) leading to molecular classification of endometrial carcinoma that has been shown to be significantly prognostic. This classification system divides the tumors into 4 subgroups namely, polymerase ε exonuclease (POLE) ultramutated, hypermutated microsatellite instability, copy number low, and copy number high (serous-like). Carcinomas with POLE domain hotspot mutations are highly prognostically favorable; those with copy number alterations and TP53 mutations are highly aggressive; and microsatellite unstable and \"copy number low\" endometrioid are associated with intermediate prognoses. The TCGA applied methods that are too costly and cumbersome for widespread implementation into routine clinical practice. Several other groups have attempted to identify these categories by using immunohistochemical biomarkers rather than molecular studies. Immunohistochemical biomarkers have been used successfully to identify all the subgroups except for POLE ultramutated, which requires sequencing for proper categorization. It is hoped that future studies will identify a suitable biomarker for POLE mutation so that this classification can be routinely used in all medical centers.",

These relatively rare tumors were notable among other RCC subtypes because of their disproportionally high incidence among children and young adults. Initial reports were focused on describing unifying morphologic criteria and typical clinical presentation. Follow-up studies of ancillary immunohistochemical and hybridization techniques provided additional diagnostic tools allowing recognition of tRCC tumors in practice. However, a growing body of literature also expanded the clinicomorphologic spectrum of tRCCs, to include a significant morphologic overlap with other RCC variants thus blurring the diagnostic clarity of this entity. More recent molecular studies utilizing next-generation sequencing technology accelerated recognition of numerous novel gene partners fusing at different breakpoints with the TFE3 gene. Accumulating data indicates that morphologic and clinical heterogeneity of tRCC could be explained by fusion subtypes, and knowledge of TFE3 partnering genes may be important in predicting tumor behavior. Herein we provided a comprehensive analysis of ∼400 tRCC cases with known TFE3 fusion partners, estimated their relative incidence and summarized clinicomorphologic features associated with most common fusion subtypes. Our data was based on an extensive literature review and had a special focus on comparing immunohistochemistry, fluorescent in situ hybridization and contemporary molecular studies for the accurate diagnosis of tRCC.",

    "abstract": "Summary: There is no internationally accepted classification of epithelial hyperplastic laryngeal lesions (EHLL). The majority of current classifications follow criteria similar to those commonly used for cervical epithelial lesions. However, the different etiology of laryngeal cancer and its particular clinical and histologic features necessitate a grading system more appropriate to this region. The Ljubljana classification of EHLL was devised in 1971 to cater to this requirement. Detailed criteria for histologic grading in this classification were formulated by a working group on EHLL of the European Society of Pathology in 1999. The system recognizes four grades: simple and abnormal hyperplasia are benign categories; atypical hyperplasia (“risky” epithelium) is potentially malignant, and carcinoma in situ actually malignant. The main features by which the proposed grading system differs from other classifications are: 1. the distinction between benign and potentially malignant lesions: 2. the positive separation of carcinoma in situ from atypical hyperplasia; 3. the lack of prognostic significance for any surface keratin layer. The eventual outcome of EHLL patients so graded justifies the proposal for separating the lesions into a benign group, showing malignant transformation in only 0.9% of cases, from a potentially malignant group showing malignant transformation in 11% of cases. For diagnostically difficult cases, supplementary techniques such as those using morphometry, immunohistochemical and molecular biology are advised to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and predictions of their biological behavior.",

Histogenesis has been settled in favor of a divergent (mesenchymal) differentiation of a carcinoma, most often a squamous cell carcinoma. Finding the carcinoma and/or its immunohistochemical marker in the metaplastic cells establishes the diagnosis. There are, however, lesions that can simulate sarcomatoid carcinomas to varying degrees, and in which neither a definable carcinoma nor immunohistochemical evidence of one can be found. Such lesions fall into several categories: 1. benign reactive lesions, 2. inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, 3. sarcomas, usually low-grade, 4. atypical pseudosarcomatous proliferation. The clinicopathologic considerations of sarcomatoid carcinomas are presented in this context and include immunohistochemical findings, prognostic factors, and biologic course.",

AAH is commonly multifocal, and may explain multicentricity that is observed with some adenocarcinomas. AAH has been shown to have immunohistochemical, morphometric, flow cytometric and genetic abnormalities overlapping with adenocarcinoma. Bronchiolar neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (carcinoid tumorlets) is classically associated with inflammatory lesions in the airways, but may also be multifocal and bilateral.

Of 642 women with an LSIL diagnosis who had analyzable Hybrid Capture II results, 82.9% of the women (95% confidence interval (CI) = 79.7 to 85.7%) had a positive result for the high-risk probe mix used in this assay. This high frequency of high-risk HPV positivity was confirmed by independent polymerase chain reaction assays on a subset of 210 of these patients with a very high concordance. Because of this finding, the potential for this HPV assay to effectively triage a population of women with an LSIL diagnosis is obviously limited. This study supports a growing consensus that the earlier reports suggesting that low-grade dysplasias were highly associated with low-risk HPV viral types were incorrect. Most of the mucosotropic viral infections that occur in the uterine cervix are high-risk viral types. Furthermore, most of these “high-risk” viral infections produce only low-grade lesions which are transient and not productive of high-grade dysplasia. Thus, the term “high-risk” or “oncogenic” HPV is a relative misnomer.",

Emphasis is placed on the less well-known variants of cutaneous fibrous histiocytoma, namely: cellular benign fibrous histiocytoma, a lesion that histologically mimics dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and leiomyosarcoma; aneurysmal (\"angiomatoid\") benign fibrous histiocytoma, clinically resembling a melanocytic or vascular lesion and histologically often confused with a vascular tumor or with angiomatoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma; epithelioid benign fibrous histiocytoma, characterized histologically by plump angulated eosinophilic cells with prominent nucleoli and often confused with a Spitz nevus; and atypical (pseudosarcomatous) benign fibrous histiocytoma, characterized by bizarre pleomorphic histiocyte-like or multinucleated cells and sometimes misdiagnosed as a malignant tumor. Mention is also made of lipidized benign fibrous histiocytoma, a lesion that tends to present around the ankle and mimics a xanthoma histologically; palisading fibrous histiocytoma, which shows histologically prominent nuclear palisading as seen in schwannoma, and atrophic dermatofibroma, which probably represents an \"old\" hyalinized fibrous histiocytoma. Also discussed in this review are plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor, a recurring lesion located mainly in the limbs, characterized by an infiltrative growth pattern and varying proportions of fibroblastic fascicles interspersed with nodules of histiocyte-like cells, and atypical fibroxanthoma, a histologically malignant but clinically benign superficial tumor arising in sun-exposed areas of the elderly. The existence of a \"non-pleomorphic\" spindle-celled variant of this tumor is emphasized; clinicopathologic correlation and immunohistochemistry are essential for its diagnosis. So-called \"pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma,\" which we believe is a wastebasket term for a heterogeneous group of histologically high-grade malignant neoplasms involving the skin, is mentioned only briefly.",

It encompasses at least two histopathologic entities (ie, collagenous and lymphocytic colitis). The recognition and characterization of microscopic colitis has markedly changed the approach to the evaluation and management of chronic diarrhea. The histologic features of collagenous and lymphocytic colitis are well known to most pathologists. By considering the clinical history and symptoms, the pathologist should be able to reach the correct diagnosis in most cases. However, the spectrum of morphologic changes associated with watery diarrhea syndrome appears to be broader than originally thought. Morphologic changes more often associated with chronic inflammatory bowel disease or even chronic ischemic or infectious colitis have been noted in patients with clinically established microscopic colitis. The data presented in this article suggest that microscopic colitis is a heterogeneous entity, which includes both classic and \"atypical\" forms. Problems arise when cases do not fit the usual pattern or lack some of the findings that are expected. Pathologists should be aware of the presence of atypical forms of microscopic colitis.",

In general, the mucosal melanomas are also more refractory to therapeutic modalities. In part, this may be due to anatomic restrictions of site and the large size of tumor when first discovered.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the highest-grade infiltrative astrocytoma and also the most common. It is generally associated with a dismal prognosis (mean survival 11 months), yet individual patient survivals vary. Histologic parameters have had limited value in predicting survival among patients with GBM. The current view of GBM as a histopathologic entity consisting of several genetic subtypes raises the possibility that molecular alterations could be predictive of survival. Common genetic alterations in GBM include gene amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mutations in the tumor suppressors TP53 and PTEN, and genetic losses on chromosome 10. Less common in GBMs is the combined loss of chromosomes 1p and 19q—a combination that has proven prognostically favorable in oligodendrogliomas. A recent article on prognostic factors in a series of 97 GBMs by Schmidt et al. finds that both TP53 mutations and young patient age at presentation are independent factors associated with a long survival. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 10q was predictive of a poor outcome. Perhaps most intriguing, the finding of combined LOH of 1p and 19q, which was noted in only five GBMs, was associated with a significantly longer survival. Thus, combined losses of 1p and 19 may be associated with a favorable prognosis in a wider range of infiltrative gliomas that includes GBM. While these findings will be debated and need to be confirmed, it is clear that genotyping of infiltrative gliomas will be an important component of neuro-oncology in the future. Not only will genetic alterations offer prognostication, but they will also serve as targets for directed therapies. Treatments directed against tumors with EGFR amplification, TP53, mutations and PTEN mutations are being developed and tested in clinical trials. It remains to be seen if GBMs with 1p and 19q losses are chemosensitive in the same manner as oligodendrogliomas.",

Both groups found distinct gene expression patterns that were able to reliably diagnose PMLBCL and distinguish it from other DLBCLs. Notably, the signature gene expression profile of PMLBCL was more closely related to classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) than other DLBCL subtypes. These studies provide further evidence that PMLBCL and nodular sclerosis CHL may represent related tumors on either ends of a continuum, whose interface includes an intermediate form of disease, mediastinal gray zone (MGZL) lymphoma. MGZLs are tumors that have a transitional morphology and phenotype, combining features of both PMLBCL and nodular sclerosis CHL, and provide a diagnostic challenge to pathologists. These studies provide insights into the biology of PMLBCL and CHL and demonstrate the utility of genomic technologies in defining and diagnosing hematopoietic tumors. The ability to map specific pathologic signal transduction pathways regulating hematopoietic differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis through genomic or proteomic technologies promises to provide the basis for the development of individualized molecularly targeted therapies for specific tumors.",

    "abstract": "The integration of immunostaining as an often-essential component of morphologic assessment makes it necessary that pathologists are familiar with the many technical and interpretive pitfalls that may arise because of the wide variety of factors that can significantly influence the ability to demonstrate relevant antigens in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Pre-analytical variables that affect immunostaining include fixation, type of fixative, duration, temperature, and pH of fixation, variables in tissue processing, antigen loss resulting from delays in fixation, tissue necrosis, and levels of antigen expression. Analytical factors relate to the complex and sometimes capricious immunolabeling procedure that has as variables the specificity and sensitivity of the antibody clone, reagent dilution, detection system, and chromogen, and importantly, the method of antigen retrieval, which has its own set of variables such as time, temperature, method of heat generation, retrieval solution pH and molarity, and the synergistic action of proteolytic digestion. To obtain the highest diagnostic yield from immunostaining the correct questions must be asked and the pathologist must have familiarity with the characteristics of the antibody, its cross reactivity, if any, and localization of antigen in the cell to understand thresholds and cut-off levels and to recognize false-positive staining. Proper utilization of immunostaining requires that it is employed as a morphology-based technique and not interpreted in isolation.",

    "abstract": "How metastases develop is poorly understood. The concept of intravascular dissemination of cancer cells has been widely accepted as a central paradigm. In addition to this explanation, however, other mechanisms may be operable. Ultrastructural studies have identified in malignant melanoma an angio-tumoral complex, in which tumor cells are linked to endothelium by a matrix containing laminin without evidence of intravasation. This observation has suggested that melanoma cells may migrate along the external surface of vessels and other anatomic structures, a mechanism termed \"extravascular migratory metastasis\" (EVMM). Angiotropism (melanoma cells cuffing the external surface of vessels) is the histopathologic counterpart of the angio-tumoral complex. The authors have recently drawn attention to the importance of angiotropism as a biologic phenomenom and prognostic factor in melanoma and as a likely correlate of EVMM. In addition, recent experimental studies strongly suggest a correlation of angiotropism of melanoma cells with EVMM. These studies, including cocultures of melanoma cells with capillarylike structures in vitro and the growth of green fluorescent protein-labeled melanoma cells in the shell-less chick chorioallantoic membrane model, have demonstrated the migration of angiotropic melanoma cells along the vascular channels, supporting the concept of EVMM. The new field of EVMM reviewed in this paper may prove useful in elucidating the molecular interactions involved in melanoma metastasis.",

    "abstract": "The concept of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia has evolved from the original description of a clinical syndrome to its more recent designation as a distinct clinicopathologic entity, that is, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM), in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and by the participants of consensus meetings on WM. The diagnosis of LPL/WM, however, remains a challenge in daily practice. Distinguishing LPL/WM from other B-cell lymphomas, especially marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, which share overlapping morphologic features, is difficult. The traditional practice of separating LPL/WM from other lymphomas by an arbitrary level of serum IgM is no longer considered valid. The characteristic immunophenotype described for LPL/WM by the WHO classification, that is, CD5−CD10−CD23−, is observed in 60-80% of neoplasms, but variations from this pattern of antigen expression are common, with CD23 being detected in up to 40% of cases. Lack of a distinct molecular genetic hallmark complicates the distinction of LPL/WM from other B-cell lymphomas. Although the t(9;14) is stated to be present in 50% of cases in the WHO classification, translocations involving the Ig heavy chain including the t(9;14) are actually rare in LPL/WM. Deletion of 6q21-q23, a nonspecific finding, is the most common aberration reported in 40-70% of patients. At the molecular level, the neoplastic clone in most cases has undergone Ig variable gene mutation, but not isotype switching, and the clone retains the capability of plasmacytic differentiation. Currently, the diagnosis of LPL/WM can only be established by incorporating clinical and pathologic findings and excluding alternative diagnoses. In some cases, in our opinion, distinguishing LPL/WM from marginal zone B-cell lymphomas seems arbitrary using currently recommended criteria.",

    "abstract": "Malignant mesothelioma is an uncommon malignant epithelial neoplasm originating from the serosal surface of body cavities. Because serosal surfaces are a common site of metastatic spread for a variety of malignant neoplasms originating from internal organs, separating malignant mesothelioma from metastatic tumors is of clinical importance. The diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma is complex and usually requires a multimodal approach that includes careful clinical history and physical examination, imaging studies, and tissue sampling for multimodal evaluation including routine histology, histochemistry, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical tests. Of these, immunohistochemistry has emerged as the most valuable and readily available modality for the routine evaluation of these tumors. Unfortunately, no specific antibodies have yet been developed that can be accepted as exclusive for these tumors. The immunohistochemical diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma therefore depends on the use of a panel of stains that includes markers that are commonly expected to react with these tumors (\"positive\" markers) and markers that are not commonly expected to react with these tumors (\"negative\" markers). Additionally, the selection and utility of these various markers can vary considerably based on a constellation of circumstances, including patient sex, histologic appearance of the tumor (ie, epithelioid vs. sarcomatoid, etc), and various other clinical circumstances. Herein, we will review the currently available immunohistochemical markers used for the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma and offer suggestions for the use of appropriate panels of stains based on specific morphologic types and clinical circumstances.",

Pax5 immunohistochemistry shows robust nuclear staining, and has become a valuable tool in the diagnosis and subclassification of lymphomas. Pax5 staining is positive in most Hodgkin and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and also precursor B-cell lymphoblastic neoplasms. Plasma cell neoplasms, multiple myeloma, and plasmablastic lymphomas typically are negative. T-cell lymphomas are, to date, consistently negative. Recently, Pax5 expression has been described in the majority of small cell carcinomas and Merkel cell carcinomas. Rare cases of Pax5 expression in other carcinomas have been reported. With these exceptions, Pax5 immunohistochemistry is fairly specific for B-cell lineage and is a valuable addition to the armamentarium of markers available for lymphoma subtyping.",

The \"Rosen Triad\"-named in tribute to its first categorical description by the eponymous pathologist-is a morphologic observation that may have important clinical and pathologic implications. To study these implications, the literature on the topic was reviewed. Our own institution's experience with this triad was also reviewed via a study of clinicopathologic material from all TCs diagnosed at excision during a 5-year period (2001 to 2006). The diagnosis of TC was confirmed in 86 of our cases, and relevant patient data were analyzed. TC was associated with some degree of CCL in all (100%, 86/86) cases and with LCIS in 53% (46/86) of cases. Although cases of TC that were associated with LCIS (vs. those not associated with LCIS) seemed to be slightly more likely to have multifocal TC, have another synchronous higher-grade invasive carcinoma and show nodal positivity, these differences were not found to be statistically significant (P<0.05). All 3 lesions (TC, CCL, and LCIS), whenever tested, were estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor-positive, and Her-2/neu negative. On the basis of our review of the literature and our own experience, until such time as the biologic explanation and clinical implication of this triad is further elucidated, we recommend that pathologists be aware of this triad and should proactively seek the other 2 lesions if any one of these elements of this triad is identified in any diagnostic breast tissue.",

    "abstract": "p63 plays a key role in epithelial development in various organs, being expressed in myoepithelial cells and in basal cells of stratified epithelia. In the female genital tract, p63 is expressed in the basal and parabasal cells of mature cervical, vaginal and vulval squamous epithelium, and also in cervical reserve cells at the transformation zone and in immature metaplastic and atrophic cervical squamous epithelium. In this review, the diagnostic utility of p63 immunohistochemical staining in various pathologic scenarios within the female genital tract is discussed. Cervical microglandular hyperplasia is p63 positive with a characteristic subcolumnar location due to expression in reserve cells. There is increased expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, in accordance with the degree of dysplasia. One of the most useful applications of p63 is in the evaluation of problematic cervical carcinomas; most squamous carcinomas exhibit diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity whereas most adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine carcinomas are negative or focally positive. In conjunction with neuroendocrine markers, p63 is useful in distinguishing between a squamous carcinoma and a small cell or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. In the normal endometrium, a population of p63-positive cells is present which may act as a stem cell population and which is increased in various forms of metaplasia. Placental site nodule and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (lesions derived from chorionic-type intermediate trophoblast) are usually p63 positive whereas placental site reaction and placental site trophoblastic tumor (lesions derived from implantation site intermediate trophoblast) are usually negative; thus, p63 may be useful in the diagnostic algorithm of trophoblastic lesions. p63 positivity in ovarian epithelial tumors is uncommon and largely restricted to squamous and transitional neoplasms, including benign and borderline Brenner tumor. p63 is also positive in cervical transitional metaplasia, Walthard rests, vulval Paget disease secondary to an underlying urothelial malignancy, tubulosquamous polyp of the vagina, and ectopic prostatic tissue in the cervix.",

The histologic and cytologic aspects are detailed with particular attention to key features helpful in the diagnosis of PDTC, both in surgical pathology and in cytology-based studies. Histologically, insular, solid, and/or trabecular architecture, along with at least one of the following: convoluted nuclei, mitotic activity (>3/10 HPF), or tumor necrosis, are required for a diagnosis of PDTC. Cytologically, the combination of insular, solid, or trabecular cytoarchitectural pattern, single cells, high nuclear to cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio, and severe crowding are highly suggestive of PDTC. Most PDTCs are immunohistochemically positive for thyroglobulin and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and a subset is also positive for p53. On the molecular level, ras mutations are the most common finding. PDTCs are managed aggressively by total thyroidectomy, 131I, and in some cases, external beam radiotherapy.",

HL is predominantly a disease of the far east and shows great regional differences in the incidence and the type of intrahepatic stones. Pathologically, it is characterized by pigmented calcium bilirubinate stones within dilated intrahepatic bile ducts featuring chronic inflammation, mural fibrosis, and proliferation of peribiliary glands, without extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Episodes of suppurative inflammation cumulate in sclerosing cholangitis in peripheral ducts and parenchymal fibrosis from scarring and collapse. Mass-forming inflammatory pseudotumor and neoplasms-like intraductal papillary neoplasms and cholangiocarcinoma are increasingly recognized complications. Bacterial infection and dietary factors are believed to be important in the formation of pigment stones within intrahepatic bile ducts, whereas parasitic infestation is likely coincidental. With improvement of environmental conditions and westernization of diet, the incidence of pigment stones has decreased. At the same time, cholesterol stones with milder clinical manifestations and pathologic changes are increasingly recognized, and for which stone dissolution therapy can be considered. Understanding the underlying pathology avoids confusion with other diseases more prevalent in the western world, and allows correct selection of the appropriate treatment.",

During the third endoscopic cholangioscopic procedure for removal of bile duct stones, sudden cardiopulmonary arrest occurred. Death was due to massive pulmonary air embolism. Cerebral air embolism was also found. Autopsy was performed. A spontaneous duodenobiliary fistula was found. On the basis of bench radiologic investigation (retrograde suprahepatic venography and anterograde portography), it was demonstrated that the air insufflated during duodenal endoscopy, which entered through the spontaneous duodeno-biliary fistula, penetrated into intrahepatic vein radicles injured secondarily to prolonged impaction of biliary sand and stones and infection, resulting in portal and hepatic venous gas and systemic air embolism.",

    "abstract": "Intraoperative consultation remains an invaluable tool in the initial evaluation of surgically excised specimens. Good communication is required between the pathologist and surgeon to obtain the best care for their mutual patient. Intraoperative consultation (frozen section, FS) provides a preliminary diagnosis for the surgeon and aids in guiding his/her subsequent surgical approach. For the pathologist, it serves to assess tissue adequacy in the context of the clinical and imaging features of the patient. FS can guarantee that the surgeon is in the desired anatomic location, but most often serves to ensure that adequate amounts of abnormal, and likely diagnostic, tissue will be available to the pathologist to render a final diagnosis on permanent sections. The preliminary evaluation of tissue at the time of intraoperative FS also guides the pathologist in the ordering of ancillary studies, some of which need to be performed on fresh or frozen tissues and must be sent at the time of the intraoperative consultation. This brief review will specifically focus on the role of the pathologist who is called to perform a FS for a neurosurgical specimen. We will discuss (1) the goals of the neurosurgeon for the intraoperative consultation, (2) how to achieve optimal communication between neurosurgeon and pathologist at the time of the FS, (3) what constitutes reasonable and unreasonable expectations by the neurosurgeon for the FS, (4) choices of techniques that can be used by the pathologist, (5) what tissue should be triaged, and (6) common discrepancies between FS and permanent section diagnoses in central nervous system disorders. The published literature on FS and permanent section discrepancies will be briefly reviewed so that pathologists will understand that some difficulties are inherent in neurosurgical specimens and are not specific to their practice, or to a given pathologist. Hopefully, this knowledge will enhance pathologists' confidence as they negotiate how best to handle this time-sensitive, and sometimes angst-producing, task.",

The risk of gynecologic malignancy in women with LS approaches and even exceeds that of CRC. Furthermore, gynecologic malignancies are often the sentinel cancers in these patients. There is significant variation in practice, but some groups have similarly recommended deployment of reflex testing strategies in patients presenting with endometrial cancer (EC). The College of American Pathologists has stated that pathologists should recognize the histologic and clinical features that should prompt at least a recommendation for mismatch repair testing. Morphologic and clinical schemas in EC to identify microsatellite unstable/LS tumors are less refined than the colon-centric schemas (Amsterdam, Bethesda, and MsPath). Studies of LS EC are few and interpretation is limited by recruitment strategies and the myriad of definitions and study designs used. Although serous cell type is used to triage ovarian cancer patients for BRCA screening, cell type correlation in LS is less certain but seems to involve a spectrum of cell types. We review the morphologic and clinical features/schemas in LS EC and highlight limitations of restrictive aged-based screening strategies, uncertainty in current clinical schemas and equivocal results of morphologic studies of LS EC. With uncertainty of histologic and clinical schemas, and following developments in CRC, reflex testing of all/vast majority of newly diagnosed EC for LS should be considered.",

Within this group, germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes, known otherwise as Lynch syndrome (LS), account for the majority of cases that are not associated with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Clinical schemas specific for gynecologic cancers have been developed to identify patients with LS; however, many of the recommendations are poorly defined. Few case series of germline-confirmed LS-associated ovarian cancers have been reported, limited by small sample size and often lacking central pathology review. Much insight has been gained from studies of unselected cohorts, using immunohistochemical assessment of MMR protein expression or microsatellite instability analysis. In spite of contradictory results, likely reflective of differences in study design, sample size and methodology, a recurring observation is the overrepresentation of \"endometriosis-associated tumors,\" namely, endometrioid and clear cell subtypes, in the group of ovarian tumors with MMR deficiency.

This review discusses WT1 expression in the female genital tract and its potential utility in the differential diagnosis of neoplasms that occur at this location. WT1 is of value in the differential diagnosis of synchronous serous carcinomas arising in the ovary/fallopian tube/peritoneum and endometrium, as strong WT1 positivity in both tumors points toward an extrauterine origin. In addition, WT1 can be used to distinguish sex cord stromal tumors (WT1 positive) from endometrioid carcinomas (OECs). WT1 expression is not helpful in the differential diagnosis of ovarian serous carcinomas (OSCs) and transitional carcinomas, as both are typically positive and has limited value in the distinction of serous tumors arising in the ovary/fallopian tube/peritoneum from mesotheliomas. WT1 is also not helpful to differentiate small cell carcinoma of hypercalcemic type from juvenile granulosa cell tumor, a common diagnostic problem. Intra-abdominal desmoplastic round cell tumor reacts to WT1 (C-terminal) in contrast to all other tumors discussed which helps to separate this rare tumor from most other small round cell tumors that may involve, primarily or secondarily, the ovary with the exception of small cell carcinoma of hypercalcemic type that typically reacts with the N-terminal of WT1.",

    "abstract": "Atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate gland consist of cribriform and rarely solid proliferation of prostate glands populated with cytologically atypical cells with partial or complete basal cell lining. It may represent cribriform \"high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia\" (HGPIN) or \"intraductal carcinoma of the prostate\" (IDC-P). IDC-P is almost always associated with clinically aggressive and high-volume prostate carcinoma. In contrast, cribriform HGPIN is a putative neoplastic precursor lesion, and recent data have questioned whether HGPIN on needle biopsy is associated with a significantly increased cancer risk in subsequent biopsies, and whether the diagnosis mandates rebiopsy within the first year after its diagnosis. As the result, the distinction between these 2 lesions has profound clinical implications, especially on needle biopsies. Since its original description, several studies have attempted to further refine histologic definition of IDC-P in the past decade. Even though presence of certain morphologic features (eg, pleomorphic nuclei or nuclei 6× the size of adjacent nuclei, intraluminal necrosis, and dense cribriform and solid architecture) are seen only in IDC-P, IDC-P may also exhibit \"low-grade\" morphologic features that overlap with cribriform HGPIN. Emerging molecular data on TMPRSS:ERG gene fusions further support the fact that these 2 lesions are biologically distinct. IDC-P is an uncommon finding in prostate biopsies; however, patients with IDC-P as sole findings without concomitant prostate carcinoma in biopsy are recommended for either definitive treatment or immediate repeat biopsy. This article summarizes the morphologic and molecular characteristics of IDC-P and cribriform HGPIN and an approach to work-up of atypical cribriform lesions in prostate needle biopsies.",

ERG gene fusions have not yet been demonstrated in isolated benign prostate tissue, isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, or benign cancer mimics. Taken together, ERG gene fusions are the most prostate cancer-specific biomarker yet identified and define a specific molecular subtype of PCa with important clinical and biological implications. ERG gene fusions result in the overexpression of a chimeric fusion transcript that encodes a truncated ERG protein product. Recently, N-terminal epitope-targeted mouse (9FY) and C-terminal-targeted rabbit monoclonal (EPR 3864) ERG antibodies are commercially available and are increasingly utilized as a surrogate for TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusions. Until recently, because of lack of availability of reliable ERG antibody, the most commonly utilized methods for studying ERG aberrations in PCa specimens included fluorescence in situ hybridization or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The knowledge gleaned from these studies has significantly improved our understanding of molecular biology of ERG gene fusions. With availability of highly specific anti-ERG monoclonal antibodies, there are now unprecedented opportunities to explore and validate clinical applications of ERG antibody in routine pathology practice, which has just started. This review provides a brief background of molecular biology of ERG gene fusions in PCa and focuses on characterizing the current state of ERG oncoprotein and determining the role of ERG immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis and biological stratification of prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "The amyloidoses comprise a group of disorders of diverse etiology, in which different proteins undergo abnormal folding, leading to their deposition in tissues and concomitant tissue toxicity. This process ultimately leads to tissue destruction, with organ failure and progressive disease. Recent progress in the treatment of the systemic amyloidoses has dramatically changed the outlook for affected patients and their families. From a relatively rare and esoteric disorder that was typically diagnosed only at autopsy, or was invariably fatal if diagnosed during life, it has now become a disease for which, with modern therapies, durable responses and long-term survival can be achieved. The clinical symptoms are largely nonspecific, and therefore misdiagnosis, or late diagnosis, have been major detriments in achieving better treatment outcomes. Despite advances in laboratory medicine, amyloidoses are still diagnosed on the basis of the pathologic detection of deposits in tissues. Thus, effective primary screening for these diseases requires the active engagement of the pathology community at large, while specialized laboratories and treatment centers can offer secondary consultation and assistance with further steps. This review provides an update on pathogenesis, the clinical and pathologic features, and treatments of various amyloidoses, as well as the current terminology, classification, and practical considerations that are relevant to the diagnosis.",

Since its initial discovery by Dr James Ewing, the historical context of what is acceptably included under the designation \"Ewing sarcoma\" has changed. Although Ewing sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor were both initially described in the early 20th century, these tumors were considered likely distinct entities until the end of that same century, almost 75 years later. With modern immunohistochemistry and more recent advances in molecular techniques, the understanding of Ewing sarcoma and Ewing-like tumors has improved dramatically but also raises new questions and challenges. We now know that this category of tumors is remarkably more heterogenous than initially thought, especially in regards to its cytogenetics and molecular properties, and some of these differences likely have prognostic relevance. Whether we are now expanding the spectrum of Ewing sarcoma or simply recognizing new entities is controversial. Therapeutic approaches to address these new categories and/or entities need further focus and attention. Herein, we provide a comprehensive historical perspective on Ewing sarcoma, Ewing-like tumors (CIC and BCOR-rearranged sarcomas), and related and/or similar small round cell tumors, often included in the differential diagnosis, including mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, and small cell osteosarcoma.

Establishing a diagnosis of NF1 is challenging as this disorder has numerous neoplastic and non-neoplastic manifestations which are variably present in individual patients. Further, other genetic diseases affecting the Ras signaling cascade (RASopathies) mimic many of the clinical features of NF1. Here, we review the clinical manifestations of NF1 and compare and contrast them with those of the RASopathies. We also consider current approaches to genetic testing for germline NF1 mutations. We then focus on NF1-associated neurofibromas, considering first the complicated clinical behavior and pathology of these neoplasms and then discussing our current understanding of the genomic abnormalities that drive their pathogenesis, including the mutations encountered in atypical neurofibromas. As several neurofibroma subtypes are capable of undergoing malignant transformation to become MPNSTs, we compare and contrast patient outcomes in sporadic, NF1-associated and radiation-induced MPNSTs, and review the challenging pathology of these lesions. The mutations involved in neurofibroma-MPNST progression, including the recent identification of mutations affecting epigenetic regulators, are then considered. Finally, we explore how our current understanding of neurofibroma and MPNST pathogenesis is informing the design of new therapies for these neoplasms.",

    "abstract": "Collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) and related tumors [ie, renal medullary carcinoma (RMC)] are rare types of highly aggressive renal cell carcinomas (RCC) with poor prognosis. Because of the rarity and diagnostic uncertainty of them, their molecular pathology and significance have not yet been fully elucidated. CDC, RMC, fumarate hydratase–deficient RCC (including hereditary leiomyomatosis and RCC-associated RCC HLRCC-RCC), and recently reported anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK )-rearrangement RCC have significant morphologic overlaps, but they are separately distinct entities having different molecular pathway and clinical settings. CDC is more likely to occur in middle to old age population with immunoreactivity for PAX8 and integrase interactor-1 proteins (INI-1). Various chromosomal and genomic alterations have been reported with inconsistent results. In contrast, RMC is more likely to occur in younger patients with sickle cell trait. In RMC, loss of INI-1 expression and OCT3/4 expression are distinguished compared with other RCCs. Finally, ALK -rearrangement RCC seems to have 2 different clinical settings, one with sickle cell trait ( VCL - ALK fusion) and the other without (other fusions such as TPM3 - ALK , EML4 - ALK , and STRN - ALK fusions). Interestingly, VCL - ALK fusion was found in pediatric patients with sickle cell trait, whereas other fusions were detected in adolescent or adult without sickle cell trait. Taken together, CDC and related tumors such as RMC, fumarate hydratase–deficient RCC (including hereditary leiomyomatosis and RCC-associated RCC), and ALK -rearrangement RCC are the distinct entities and their recognition is important for the development of future personalized therapeutic options. This review updates the clinicopathologic features of these tumors with overlapping morphology and outcome.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to the common tumors of the prostate, seminal vesicle demonstrates low potential for neoplastic proliferation. Of the rare primary seminal vesicle tumors, adenocarcinoma is the most common, but there are also rare seminal vesicle neoplasms which demonstrate epithelial and stromal components. These neoplasms have been described in the literature under various names, including \"epithelial-stromal tumor,\" \"cystic epithelial-stromal tumor,\" \"cystadenoma,\" \"cystomyoma,\" \"mesenchymoma,\" \"Müllerian adenosarcoma-like tumor,\" \"phyllodes tumor,\" and \"cystosarcoma phyllodes.\" The spectrum of reported mixed epithelial-stromal tumors (MEST) of seminal vesicle encompasses low, intermediate and high-grade tumors, but the precise distinction and nomenclature for these tumors remain unsettled. We propose a common nomenclature for these tumors, based on the review of published cases and 2 index cases from our practice, which represent the low-grade category. The first patient was 46 years old and presented with seminal vesicle neoplasm detected on routine rectal examination. The neoplasm measured 4 cm in greatest dimension, and completely replaced the left seminal vesicle. The tumor was circumscribed and consisted of multiple cysts separated by spindle-cell stroma. The second patient was a 60-year-old man, who had an incidental seminal vesicle neoplasm, which was discovered when he underwent a radical prostatectomy for a prostatic adenocarcinoma, (Gleason score 3+4, stage 3a). Both neoplasms contained hypercellular stroma, which was composed of uniform spindle cells, arranged in fascicles and interspersed between the glands. Both tumors lacked worrisome morphology, such as infiltrative borders, cell atypia, increased mitotic activity, hemorrhage, and necrosis. The stromal cells were reactive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, and desmin. The cysts and dilated glands were lined by epithelial cells, which were positive for cytokeratin 7 and were negative for prostate-specific antigen and prostate-specific acid phosphatase. The first patient underwent prostatectomy and was alive and without evidence of disease recurrence or progression after 11 years of follow-up. Similarly, the second patient had no evidence of disease recurrence or progression after 8 months of follow-up. We propose that term seminal vesicle \"mixed epithelial-stromal tumor\" be used to designate the tumors of the seminal vesicle containing epithelial and stromal components, with a distinction of grade based on the histologic features and the biological behavior. Histologic features to be evaluated for grade separation include stromal atypia, mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism, and tumor necrosis. Designations \"low-grade MEST,\" \"intermediate-grade MEST (uncertain malignant potential),\" and \"high-grade MEST\" of seminal vesicle can be applied to these tumors to better characterize and study them in the future.",

    "abstract": "β-catenin (CTNNB1) is a key regulatory molecule of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for tissue homeostasis and regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and function. Abnormal stabilization and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin as a consequence of missense mutations or alternative molecular mechanisms occurs at a high frequency in a variety of epithelial cancers. In mesenchymal neoplasia, the role of β-catenin has been traditionally considered limited to desmoid-type fibromatosis. However, the spectrum of β-catenin-driven (β-catenin-altered) neoplasia of mesenchymal origin has been steadily widening to include, in addition to desmoid tumors, a variety of benign and intermediate-biology neoplasms of soft tissue (intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma), head and neck (juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma and sinonasal hemangiopericytoma/glomangiopericytoma), and ovarian (microcystic stromal tumor) origin. In addition, several old and newly reported distinctive site-specific β-catenin-driven parenchymal neoplasms of uncertain histogenesis have been well characterized in recent studies, including solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas and its recently described ovarian counterpart, sclerosing hemangioma of lung and calcifying nested stromal-epithelial tumor of the liver. This review addresses the most relevant pathobiological and differential diagnostic aspects of β-catenin-altered neoplasms with emphasis on site-specific histologic and biological variations. In addition, the morphologic overlap and analogy as well as distinctness between these uncommon tumors will be presented and discussed. Furthermore, a note is made on association of some of these lesions with hereditary tumor syndromes, in particular with the familial adenomatous polyposis coli.",

    "abstract": "Cancer patients experience kidney injury from multiple sources, including the tumor itself, diagnostic procedures, hypovolemia, infection, and drug exposure, superimposed upon baseline chronic damage. This review will focus on cytotoxic or targeted chemotherapy-associated renal injury. In this setting, tubulointerstitial injury and thrombotic microangiopathy (vascular injury) are more common than other forms of kidney injury including glomerular. Cisplatin, pemetrexed, and ifosfamide are well-known causes of acute tubular injury/necrosis. Acute interstitial nephritis seems underrecognized in this clinical setting. Interstitial nephritis is emerging as an \"immune-related adverse effect\" (irAE's) with immune checkpoint inhibitors in small numbers of patients. Acute kidney injury is rarely reported with targeted therapies such as BRAF inhibitors (vemurafinib, dabrafenib), ALK inhibitors (crizotinib), and mTOR inhibitors (everolimus, temsirolimus), but additional biopsy data are needed. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies that block the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway are most commonly associated with thrombotic microangiopathy. Other causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in the cancer patients include cytotoxic chemotherapies such as gemcitabine and mitomycin C, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and cancer itself (usually high-stage adenocarcinoma with marrow and vascular invasion). Cancer patients are historically underbiopsied, but biopsy can reveal type, acuity, and chronicity of renal injury, and facilitate decisions concerning continuation of chemotherapy and/or initiation of renoprotective therapy. Biopsy may also reveal unrelated and unanticipated findings in need of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract, exhibits diverse histologic and clinical manifestations. With its putative origin in the gastrointestinal pacemaker cell of Cajal, GIST can arise in association with any portion of the tubular gastrointestinal tract. Morphologically, GISTs are classified as spindled or epithelioid, though each of these subtypes encompasses a broad spectrum of microscopic appearances, many of which mimic other histologic entities. Despite this morphologic ambiguity, the diagnosis of GIST is aided in many cases by immunohistochemical detection of KIT (CD117) or DOG1 expression. The natural history of GIST ranges from that of a tumor cured by surgical resection to that of a locally advanced or even widely metastatic, and ultimately fatal, disease. This clinicopathologic heterogeneity is paralleled by an underlying molecular diversity: the majority of GISTs are associated with spontaneous activating mutations in KIT , PDGFRA , or BRAF , while additional subsets are driven by genetic lesions—often inherited—of NF1 or components of the succinate dehydrogenase enzymatic complex. Specific gene mutations correlate with particular anatomic or morphologic characteristics and, in turn, with distinct clinical behaviors. Therefore, prognostication and treatment are increasingly dictated not only by morphologic clues, but also by accompanying molecular genetic features. In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of the heterogenous molecular underpinnings of GIST, including implications for the practicing pathologist with regard to morphologic identification, immunohistochemical diagnosis, and clinical management.",

They are rare tumors of the bronchopulmonary system that incorporate a wide range of neoplasms that by definition contain a sarcomatoid component characterized by spindle or giant cells. Such classification has led to a heterogenous tumor category that includes neoplasms with different clinical, morphologic, and prognostic features. To date, the histopathologic diagnosis of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas does not require the use of ancillary testing and is based on light microscopic criteria alone. However, with recent advances in immunohistochemical and molecular methods, it is becoming increasingly clear that pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas represent poorly differentiated or \"dedifferentiated\" variants of conventional non-small cell carcinomas with similar immunophenotype and molecular signatures. This review summarizes the latest insights and concepts of these unusual tumors and outlines future directions with emphasis on tumor classification and patient management.",

    "abstract": "Primary mediastinal Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) is rare. Nodular sclerosis CHL (NS-CHL) is the most common subtype involving the anterior mediastinum and/or mediastinal lymph nodes. Primary thymic CHL is exceedingly rare. The disease typically affects young women and is asymptomatic in 30% to 50% of patients. Common symptoms include fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea and cough, but vary depending on the location and size of the tumor. B-symptoms develop in 30% of cases. By imaging, primary mediastinal CHL presents as mediastinal widening/mediastinal mass that does not invade adjacent organs but may compress vital structures as bulky disease. Histopathology is the gold standard for diagnosis. Primary mediastinal NS-CHL consists of nodules of polymorphous inflammatory cells surrounded by broad fibrous bands extending from a thickened lymph node capsule. The cellular nodules contain variable numbers of large Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells, required for diagnosis. Primary thymic CHL may exhibit prominent cystic changes. The histopathologic recognition of NS-CHL can be challenging in cases with prominent fibrosis, scant cellularity, artifactual cell distortion, or an exuberant granulomatous reaction. The differential diagnosis includes primary mediastinal non-HLs, mediastinal germ cell tumors, thymoma, and metastatic carcinoma or melanoma to the mediastinum. Distinction from primary mediastinal non-HLs is crucial for adequate therapeutic decisions. Approximately 95% of patients with primary mediastinal CHL will be alive and free of disease at 10 years after treatment with short courses of combined chemoradiotherapy. In this review, we discuss the history, classification, epidemiology, clinicoradiologic features, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, differential diagnosis, and treatment of primary mediastinal CHL.",

Morphologically, the tumor cells are large with eccentrically located nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and basophilic/amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunophenotypically, the tumor cells express plasma cell–related antigens including CD38, CD138, interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4)/MUM1, PR domain zinc finger protein-1 (PRDM1), and/or X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1), with frequent loss of CD20. These tumors are diagnostically challenging for general pathologists due to their overlapping morphology and immunophenotype, and due to their rarity, and particularly so when clinical and radiologic information is insufficient. We also discuss HHV8-negative effusion-based lymphoma due to its overlapping features with primary effusion lymphoma. In this review, we focus on the useful diagnostic markers and pertinent molecular findings in these distinct entities and propose a practical diagnostic algorithm using anaplastic lymphoma kinase, HHV8, in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus–encoded small RNA, immunoglobulin M, light chain stains, and clinicoradiologic criteria to avoid misdiagnosis. At the molecular level, MYC protein overexpression with or without MYC rearrangement and PRDM1 -inactivating mutations or deletions are noted in a subset of such tumors, especially in plasmablastic lymphoma. Prognosis in these entities is dismal with conventional CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy. Therefore, novel target therapies, such as anti-CD30 agents, and/or immune blockade therapy, are potential treatment options in the future.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in molecular genetics have expanded our knowledge of renal tumors and enabled a better classification. These studies have revealed that renal tumors with predominantly \"eosinophilic/oncocytic\" cytoplasm include several novel biological subtypes beyond the traditionally well-recognized renal oncocytoma and an eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Herein, we present a comprehensive review of the eosinophilic vacuolated tumor (EVT) building upon a case report including radiology, histopathology, electron microscopy, and next-generation sequencing. EVTs are characterized by mTORC1 activation. We speculate that loss of chromosome 1 in EVT with MTOR mutation may be driven in part by an advantage conferred by loss of the remaining MTOR wild-type allele. mTORC1 is best known for its role in promoting protein translation and it is interesting that dilated cisterns of rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) likely account for the cytoplasmic vacuoles seen by light microscopy. We present an integrated view of EVT as well as cues that can assist in the differential diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Testicular tumors are incredibly diverse and one of the most challenging areas in surgical pathology. Because of the rarity and overlapping features with numerous entities occurring in the testis and paratestis, these tumors pose a diagnostic challenge even to the most experienced general pathologists. In 2016, the latest “World Health Organization (WHO) classification of testicular tumors” was released, which incorporated several updates to the previous 2004 classification system. These updates involved several entities, including germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors, tumors containing both germ cells and sex-cord stromal cells, a miscellaneous group of testicular tumors and paratesticular tumors. In addition, significant changes were also introduced in the 2018 AJCC TNM staging (8th edition) regarding testicular tumors. The germ cell tumors are divided into 2 major groups; tumors derived from germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) and those unrelated to GCNIS. The GCNIS associated tumors include seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, which constitute a heterogeneous group of tumors. Non–GCNIS-associated tumors include prepubertal-type teratoma, prepubertal yolk sac tumor, mixed prepubertal-type teratoma and yolk sac tumor and spermatocytic seminoma. In the sex cord-stromal category, the tumors are classified based on their cells of origin. Most are Leydig cell tumors and Sertoli cell tumors; however, several mixed and diverse entities based on cell types are included in this group. Gonadoblastoma is the only tumor in the mixed germ cell and sex cord-stromal tumor category. Because of recent advances in molecular techniques, abundant new genetic information has emerged which helped classify the tumors based on the molecular alterations and provided insights into the tumor pathogenesis. This review focused on the updates related to testicular germ cell tumors and sex cord-stromal tumors and described the morphologic, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics with an aim to provide a practical diagnostic approach and an update on relevant recent molecular advances.",

MGCTs also have a predilection for patients with Klinefelter syndrome and possibly other genetic conditions. MGCTs, as GCTs at other extragonadal sites, are thought to arise from germ cells improperly retained during migration along the midline during embryogenesis. Similar to their counterparts in the testes, MGCTs are classified into seminomatous and nonseminomatous GCTs. Seminomatous MGCT represents pure seminoma, whereas nonseminomatous MGCTs encompass pure yolk sac tumors, embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, mature or immature teratoma, and mixed GCTs with any combination of GCT types, including seminoma. Somatic-type or hematologic malignancies can also occur in association with a primary MGCT. MGCTs share molecular findings with GCTs at other sites, most commonly the presence of chromosome 12p gains and isochromosome i(12p). Treatment includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of residual tumor, with the exception of benign teratomas, which require only surgical resection without chemotherapy. In this review, we highlight and provide an update on pathologic, clinical, and molecular features of MGCTs. Immunohistochemical profiles of each tumor type, as well as differential diagnostic considerations, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Fibrosis is not a unidirectional, linear process, but a dynamic one resulting from an interplay of fibrogenesis and fibrolysis depending on the extent and severity of a biologic insult, or lack thereof. Regression of fibrosis has been documented best in patients treated with phlebotomies for hemochromatosis, and after successful suppression and eradication of chronic hepatitis B and C infections. This evidence mandates a reconsideration of the term “cirrhosis,” which implies an inevitable progression towards liver failure. Furthermore, it also necessitates a staging system that acknowledges the bidirectional nature of evolution of fibrosis, and has the ability to predict if the disease process is progressing or regressing. The Beijing classification attempts to fill this gap in contemporary practice. It is based on microscopic features termed “the hepatic repair complex,” defined originally by Wanless and colleagues. The elements of the hepatic repair complex represent the 3 processes of fragmentation and regression of scar, vascular remodeling (resolution), and parenchymal regeneration. However, regression of fibrosis does not imply resolution of cirrhosis, which is more than just a stage of fibrosis. So far, there is little to no evidence to suggest that large regions of parenchymal extinction can be repopulated by regenerating hepatocytes. Similarly, the vascular lesions of cirrhosis persist, and there is no evidence of complete return to normal microcirculation in cirrhotic livers. In addition, the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is higher compared with the general population and these patients need continued screening and surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with fibromyomatous stroma (FMS) was included as an \"emerging/provisional\" entity in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification as a \"RCC with (angio) leiomyomatous stroma.\" It has been debated whether RCCFMS represents a separate entity or a group of RCCs with overlapping morphologies. Accordingly, various names have been used to refer to the RCCs that exhibited clear cells and prominent smooth muscle and fibromatous stroma. Recent studies have demonstrated that RCCFMS indeed represents a distinct entity with subtle but distinguishable features that can be separated from other RCCs that exhibit clear cells, as well as tubulopapillary morphology and smooth muscle/fibromatous stroma, such as clear cell RCC and clear cell papillary RCC. Microscopically, the epithelial component forms tumor nodules composed of elongated and frequently branching tubules, lined by clear or mildly eosinophilic cells containing voluminous cytoplasm. Focal papillary morphology is also frequently present. Diffuse CK7 positivity is typical and is required for the diagnosis. Molecular analysis of these tumors demonstrated recurrent mutations involving the TSC/mTOR pathway. A subset of tumors with similar morphology has shown mutations involving ELOC (previously referred to as TCEB1), typically associated with monosomy 8. Finally, in addition to the more common RCCFMS that are sporadic, essentially identical tumors have been found in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, suggesting the existence of hereditary and sporadic counterparts of this tumor. It is currently debated whether TSC/mTOR and ELOC mutated RCCFMS should be grouped together, based on their shared and overlapping morphology and common CK7 reactivity, despite the differing molecular alterations. This review outlines evidence supporting the recognition of RCCFMS as a novel subtype of RCC with morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular characteristics distinct from clear cell RCC and clear cell papillary RCC.",

The recent discovery of a candidate tumor suppressor gene for MRT, INI1 on chromosome (Ch)22q11.2, has re-established this neoplasm as a distinct entity. Malignant rhabdoid tumor may arise either de novo from nonneoplastic cells or through tumor progression from other types of neoplasms. These latter tumors, in which other nonrhabdoid tumor components are identified, may be termed composite MRT. In order to avoid misdiagnosing MRT as other types of neoplasia, one must keep in mind three distinct clinicopathologic features—young age of onset, variable histologic and immunohistochemical patterns, and an aggressive infiltrative character. In difficult cases, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular genetic analysis may assist in diagnosing MRT.",

Most practicing pathologists are inexperienced with the wide array of soft tissue neoplasms and their morphologic heterogeneity, making them susceptible to misdiagnosis. However, in the hands of experienced cytopathologists, FNAB in conjunction with ancillary techniques has a diagnostic accuracy approaching 95% for the diagnosis of malignancy. FNAB has been shown to have a diagnostic yield nearly identical with core needle biopsy while avoiding significant clinical complications. Nevertheless, FNAB has certain limitations related to the accurate histologic grading and subtyping of certain subgroups of sarcomas. It may also be difficult to accurately distinguish between low-grade sarcomas and benign or borderline cellular lesions, especially in the spindle cell sarcoma subgroup. The aim of this review is to highlight the utility and limitations of FNAB in the primary diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas, highlight diagnostically challenging lesions, and comment on the limitations of FNAB in providing a \"definitive\" diagnosis.",

In many other respects, lobular breast cancers and low-grade ductal carcinomas exhibit similar geno-phenotypic profiles. The development of p53 dysfunction may be a hallmark of infiltrating ductal cancers of intermediate and high grade. Sequential Her-2/neu and ras abnormalities define a subset of aggressive high-grade tumors, and the development of Rb dysfunction may define a separate subset of aggressive ductal cancers.

    "abstract": "Eighteen percent of all new breast cancers detected on screening mammography are ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a preinvasive lesion that is highly curable. However, some women with DCIS will develop life-threatening invasive breast cancer. Because the determinants of invasive recurrence are unknown, all women with DCIS require the same treatment (usually with surgery and radiation). Therefore, there is a need to identify biologic markers and create a profile that will provide prognostic information that is more accurate than the currently used van Nuys Index to predict invasive recurrence. In the present review, we examined the many biologic markers studied in breast cancer, describe their main biologic role and their expression in DCIS, and review the various studies regarding their ability to serve as prognostic factors in breast cancer with an emphasis on predicting invasive recurrence in patients with DCIS. This review covers established markers, namely, ER, PR and HER2/neu, that are used routinely to make treatment decisions as well as investigative biologic factors involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, extracellular molecules, factors involved in extracellular matrix degradation, and angiogenesis. However, controversies exist regarding the value of these prognostic factors, their interrelationship, and their advantages over morphologic evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Nephrogenic rests are the consequence of residual metanephric tissue in a fully developed kidney. They usually occur along the perimeter of a mature renal lobe (i.e., perilobar), within the lobe itself (i.e., intralobar), or both (i.e., combined). Nephrogenic rests can be grossly obvious or microscopically discrete. Nephroblastomatosis designates nephrogenic rests that are multifocal or diffuse, and implies more extensive disease. Universal (panlobar) nephroblastomatosis denotes complete replacement of the renal lobe by nephrogenic tissue. The fate of nephrogenic rests and nephroblastomatosis varies and includes obsolescence, sclerosis, dormancy, hyperplasia, or neoplasia. Evidence strongly suggests that neoplastic transformation of nephrogenic rests results in Wilms' tumor (nephroblastoma). Nephrogenic rests almost always occur in the setting of Wilms' tumor; perilobar rests show a strong association with synchronous bilateral Wilms' tumors, whereas intralobar rests are more strongly associated with metachronous tumors. Genetic studies have shown that nephrogenic rests often share many of the same chromosomal defects as Wilms' tumor, which provides further evidence that they are precursors to nephroblastoma. Thus, nephrogenic rests are recognized as clinically significant entities requiring adequate detection and close surveillance. Heightened awareness regarding the clinical relevance of nephrogenic rests and nephroblastomatosis (1) has led to improved detection of these precancerous lesions, (2) fostered more intensive investigation into their biologic behavior, and (3) initiated in-depth discussions about potentially new treatment regimens. The pathologists' ability to identify and detect nephrogenic rests has benefited from the more efficient Beckwith classification. Radiologists have deployed high-resolution radiologic/imaging modalities to improve detection of nephrogenic rests in situ. Clinicians and surgeons are more aware of the impact that nephrogenic rests have upon patient management. Despite this progress, more data is needed to further define these lesions.",

In this review, five categories of early vulvar neoplasia are defined, based on the available literature, into (a) low-grade lesions with minimal cancer risk, (b) high-grade lesions associated with HPV, (c) high-grade lesions associated with other etiologies, (d) squamous atypias defined by abnormalities in differentiation rather than abnormalities in nuclear morphology, and (d) early carcinomas that do not exhibit conspicuous stromal invasion. The first three groups are arranged into low- and high-grade intraepithelial lesions, the fourth into intraepithelial atypias that bear careful follow-up and attention to the co-existing squamous mucosa, and the fifth into a category that, depending on the degree of cell differentiation, may warrant local excision or lymph node dissection. Recognition of these five categories is germane to proper management of women with squamous lesions of the vulva.",

In this regard, the field is primed by recent advances in basic research, elucidating the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and progression in the most common adult and pediatric brain tumors. Thus far, few have made the transition into routine clinical practice, the most notable example being 1p and 19q testing in oligodendroglial tumors. However, the field is rapidly evolving and many other biomarkers are likely to emerge as useful ancillary diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic aids.

    "abstract": "The introduction of antigen retrieval has enabled immunohistology to become an integral component of morphologic diagnosis, routinely employed in cancer diagnosis, and for the identification of therapeutic and prognostic markers. The mechanism of antigen retrieval, however, remains speculative with the key to our understanding embedded in the actions of formaldehyde on proteins. One commonly held concept is that heat primarily breaks down protein cross-linkages that occur with aldehyde fixation, thus \"unmasking\" protein epitopes of interest. Enzymatic pretreatment is also thought to have a similar action whereas such \"breakages\" are the result of extremely rapid molecular movement induced by microwaves and ultrasound. The formation of rigid cagelike calcium complexes during formaldehyde fixation is another suggested mechanism of antigen masking requiring chelating agents for reversal. A more recent suggestion for the antigen retrieval phenomenon has evoked the Mannich reaction, which occurs with the cross-linking of some proteins. Such cross-linkages can be hydrolyzed by heat or alkalis so that the process of antigen retrieval may be the simple removal of such cross-linked proteins that are sterically interfering with the binding of antibodies to linear protein epitopes in the tissue section. We are clearly not yet in possession of all the answers to the problem.",

Although, the majority of papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) are sporadic, familial forms have been described in recent years. Familial syndromes are classified into familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and familial nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma. Multifocal papillary carcinoma is the most frequent presentation of familial nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma, and based on clinico-pathologic findings it is divided into 2 groups. The first includes familial syndromes characterized by a predominance of nonthyroidal tumors, such as familial adenomatous polyposis, PTEN-hamartoma tumor syndrome, Carney complex type 1, and Werner syndrome. The second group includes familial syndromes characterized by a predominance of NMTC, such as pure familial (f) PTC with or without oxyphilia, fPTC with papillary renal cell carcinoma, and fPTC with multinodular goiter. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is derived from calcitonin-producing C cells. The familial form accounts for 20% to 25% of cases, and is usually a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) IIA or IIB, or presents as pure familial medullary thyroid carcinoma syndrome. C-cell hyperplasia is the precursor lesion of these heritable syndromes. Some characteristic morphologic findings should alert the pathologist of a possible familial cancer syndrome, which may lead to further molecular genetic evaluation.",

Nuclear staining has been seen in cases of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, Merkel cell carcinomas, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous carcinoma, colorectal and gastric cancer, and synovial sarcoma. The difference in the staining patterns seen (complete loss vs. nuclear staining) is due to the type of E-cadherin antibody used. Antibodies recognizing the extracellular domain show loss of E-cadherin staining in SPT, whereas the antibody to the cytoplasmic domain results in nuclear staining in all cases of SPT. Therefore, E-cadherin staining is of diagnostic use in the immunohistochemical work-up of SPT. Nuclear E-cadherin staining of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors identified a subset of cases with more aggressive potential, whereas nuclear staining of clear cell renal cancers identified a subset of tumors with a better prognosis. The exact mechanism by which E-cadherin enters the nucleus is not known but it is likely that it is closely related to several partner molecules such as beta-catenin, p120, and presenilin-1.",

The recent application of increasingly sophisticated molecular approaches to the study of prostate cancer in this \"postgenomic\" era has resulted in a rapid increase in the identification of somatic genome alterations and germline heritable risk factors in this disease. These findings are leading to a new understanding of the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and to the generation of new targets for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of therapeutic response. Although we are still in the very early phase of clinical development, some of the molecular alterations identified in prostate cancer are being translated into clinical practice. The purpose of this review is to update the practicing surgical pathologist, and residents-in-training in pathology, regarding recent findings in the molecular pathobiology of prostate cancer. We will highlight some of the somatic molecular alterations associated with prostate cancer development and progression, with a focus on newer discoveries. In addition, recent studies in which new molecular diagnostic approaches have been applied in the clinic will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "The development of small-molecule inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) resulted in new therapeutic options for patients with advanced lung cancer. It was clear from the experience with targeted therapy for breast cancer that a new standardized assay procedure for assessing and predicting the effects of therapeutic agents must be developed. Three academic groups almost simultaneously reported the discovery of somatic mutations in the exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of EGFR that correlated with a high likelihood of response to EGFR TK inhibitors. This observation revolutionized understanding of EGFR in lung carcinogenesis and resulted in numerous retrospective studies that correlated patient's response and molecular profile of the lung adenocarcinoma. The results of these studies indicate that clinical benefits from treatment with EGFR TK inhibitors are variable between the different subsets of patients. Multiple methodologic approaches were used including mutational analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. Conflicting results reflect the lack of standardization of the methodology and interpretation. Sample types, sample processing, and storage should also be taken into consideration as another potentially confounding factor. Therefore, it is important to standardize the approach and decide which assays are best to predict patient response to targeted therapies. It is also essential to determine the most cost-effective way to integrate EGFR molecular assays into clinical practice. This review will address practical aspects of each of the currently proposed assays. Difficulties in standardization of these assays in a clinical practice will be discussed.",

In contrast to medullary thyroid carcinoma, in which about 25% are familial, only 5% of follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas are a component of a familial cancer syndrome. The familial follicular cell-derived tumors or nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma encompass a heterogeneous group of diseases, and are classified into 2 distinct groups: syndromic-associated tumors, occurring in syndromes in which nonmedullary thyroid carcinomas are the predominant tumor encountered, and nonsyndromic tumors, those occurring in tumor syndromes in which thyroid involvement is a minor component. The first group, syndromic-associated tumors, includes phosphase and tensin (PTEN)-hamartoma tumor syndrome/Cowden syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis/Gardner syndrome, Carney complex type 1, Werner syndrome, and Pendred syndrome. Other syndromes, as McCune Albright syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and Ataxia-teleangiectasia syndrome may be associated with the development of follicular cell-derived tumors, but the link is less established than the above syndromes. The syndromic-associated tumors are the focus of this review. The second group of familial follicular cell-derived tumors syndromes or nonsyndromic tumors, in which nonmedullary thyroid carcinomas are the major findings, include pure familial papillary thyroid carcinoma, with or without oxyphilia, familial papillary thyroid carcinoma with papillary renal cell carcinoma, and familial papillary thyroid carcinoma with multinodular goiter. This review will discuss the clinical and pathological findings of the patients with familial syndrome-associated tumors: PTEN-hamartoma tumor syndrome/Cowden syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome, Carney complex type 1, Werner syndrome, and Pendred syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of immunohistochemistry, a morphology-based technique, has come about through refinements in detection systems and an increasing range of sensitive and specific antibodies that have allowed application of the technique to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The introduction of heat-induced antigen retrieval has been a significant milestone to compliment these developments so that the immunohistochemistry is firmly entrenched as an indispensable adjunct to morphologic diagnosis. Although this ancillary stain was initially used in a qualitative manner, problems surrounding the many variables that influence antigen preservation in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were not a major issue and laboratories strived to optimize their staining protocols to the material they accessioned and processed. The advent of personalized medicine and targeted cancer treatment has imposed the need to quantitate the stain reaction product and has resulted in calls to standardize the process of immunostaining. A closer examination of the variables that influence the ability to show antigens in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues revealed many important variables, particularly in the preanalytical phase of the assay, that are beyond the control of the accessioning laboratory. Although analytical factors have the potential to be standardized, the actions of many pivotal procedures including fixation and antigen retrieval are not completely understood. Postanalytical processes including threshold and cut-off values require consensus and standardization and it is clear that some of these goals can be achieved through the direction of national and international organizations associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment. With the ability to serve as a surrogate marker of many genetic abnormalities, immunohistochemistry enters a new era and the need to better understand some of the mechanisms fundamental to the technique become more pressing and the development of true quantitative assays is imperative. There is also an increasing appreciation that the technique highlights patterns of staining that reflect exquisite localization to organelles and tissue structures that are not appreciable in routine stains, adding a further dimension to morphologic diagnosis.",

Although the pathogenesis and clinical features of the disease have been studied for years, many unanswered questions remain. Typical clinical symptoms along with the endoscopic findings, pH monitoring, and biopsies, all support the diagnosis. However, these tests may yield conflicting findings, and at present there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of GERD. In patients with normal or nearly normal endoscopic findings (nonerosive reflux disease), the major diagnostic burden lies with the histology. The histologic diagnosis of GERD is based on a combination of findings, including basal cell hyperplasia, papilla elongation, inflammation, and dilatation of intercellular spaces. However, these features exhibit varying sensitivity and specificity, and minimal biopsy criteria for the diagnosis of reflux esophagitis have not been rigorously tested in well-characterized patient populations. However, given the high prevalence of GERD, pathologists face esophageal mucosal biopsies daily and must recognize the diagnostic strengths and limitations of histologic features of reflux esophagitis. Future studies and new techniques may improve the diagnostic strength of histology and establish meaningful minimal criteria for the diagnosis of reflux esophagitis.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in the routine practice of surgical neuropathology is the distinction between reactive astrocytosis, which may be because of non-neoplastic and neoplastic conditions, and a low-grade infiltrating diffuse astrocytoma [World Health Organization (WHO) grade II]. This can be particularly challenging with small biopsies that often yield limited amounts of tissue for pathologic study, especially considering the marked differences in prognosis and therapy after a pathologic diagnosis. This paper will review some basic principles of gliosis as an astrocytic reaction to a wide range of central nervous system insults and focus on some common diagnostic pitfalls such as (1) gliosis associated with brain tumor mimics, including demyelinating disease and infections, (2) gliosis associated with nonglial tumors such as craniopharyngioma, hemangioblastoma, metastases, and central nervous system lymphoma. New diagnostic methods have facilitated the differentiation between reactive astrocytosis and the diffuse gliomas. Of these, the use of mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1) as a marker of diffuse infiltrating astroctomas, oligodendrogliomas, and a subset of glioblastomas (secondary glioblastomas) is particularly exciting for tissue diagnosis and patient prognosis. In addition IDH-1 may be useful to distinguish a diffuse infiltrating glioma from low-grade \"focal\" neoplasms such as the pilocytic astocytoma in histologically ambiguous cases. The discovery of BRAF mutations as molecular signatures of some pilocytic astrocytomas, gangliogliomas, and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas has provided another diagnostic tool for the pathologist. Only after a definitive diagnosis of a diffuse infiltrating glioma or a focal glioma is made should a tumor grade be applied and some practical issues in current glioma grading are provided.",

After a succinct outline of the types and distribution of the neuroendocrine cells in the normal gastric mucosa we discuss the most common situations in which the pathologist needs to think about gastric neuroendocrine cells. In general practice gastric biopsy specimens are often numerically and topographically inadequate for the evaluation of atrophic gastritis; therefore, we have included an algorithm to address specifically the steps that should be taken when confronted with suboptimal sampling. Finally, we illustrate the suggested diagnostic process with 4 cases that are fairly representative of the type of situations encountered in everyday practice. The pathologist who follows our simple steps will be better aware of this neglected area of gastric pathology and will learn to suspect, recognize, and accurately diagnose the most common abnormalities of the neuroendocrine system in the stomach.",

We discuss the specific clinical, molecular genetic, and pathologic features of endocrine tumor in each gland and their associated inherited tumor syndromes. By understanding the pathogenesis of inherited endocrine tumor syndromes and recognizing the unique features of pathologic findings, pathologists bear the responsibility to provide the clinicians the guidelines in terms of screening and treatment of inherited tumor syndromes.",

Patients with this condition represent a unique clinically and pathologically progressive characteristic from conventional leukoplakia. Because of the lack of defined pathologic lesions, identifying patients with the early diagnosis of PVL is challenging. This is largely due to the overlapping clinical and pathologic early features with conventional multifocal leukoplakia with dysplasia. The diagnosis can only be achieved through the keen clinical observation of the temporal progression in individual patients to verrucous and/or conventional squamous carcinoma. We present a brief view of the clinicopathologic and biological characteristics of PVL and discuss diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management.",

    "abstract": "Background: Amended surgical pathology reports record defects in the process of transforming tissue specimens into diagnostic information. Objective: Systematic study of amended reports tests 2 hypotheses: (a) that tracking amendment frequencies and the distribution of amendment types reveals relevant aspects of quality in surgical pathology's daily transformation of specimens into diagnoses and (b) that such tracking measures the effect, or lack of effect, of efforts to improve surgical pathology processes. Materials and Methods: We applied a binary definition of altered reports as either amendments or addenda and a taxonomy of defects that caused amendments as misidentifications, specimen defects, misinterpretations, and report defects. During the introduction of a LEAN process improvement approach—the Henry Ford Productions System—we followed trends in amendment rates and defect fractions to (a) evaluate specific interventions, (b) sort case-by-case root causes of misidentifications, specimen defects, and misinterpretations, and (c) audit the ongoing accuracy of the classification of changed reports. LEAN is the management and production system of the Toyota Motor Corporation that promotes continuous improvement; it considers wasted resources expended for purposes other than creating value for end customers and targets such expenditures for elimination. Results: Introduction of real-time editing of amendments saw annual amendment rates increase from 4.8/1000 to 10.1/1000 and then decrease in an incremental manner to 5.6/1000 as Henry Ford Productions System-specific interventions were introduced. Before introduction of HFPS interventions, about a fifth of the amendments were due to misidentifications, a 10th were due to specimen defects, a quarter due to misinterpretation, and almost half were due to report defects. During the period of the initial application of HFPS, the fraction of amendments due to misidentifications decreased as those due to report defects increased, in a statistically linked manner. As HFPS interventions took hold, misidentifications fell from 16% to 9%, specimen defect rates remained variable, ranging between 2% and 11%, and misinterpretations fell from 18% to 3%. Reciprocally, report defects rose from 64% to 83% of all amendment-causing defects. A case-by-case study of misidentifications, specimen defects, and misinterpretations found that (a) intervention at the specimen collection level had disappointingly little effect on patient misidentifications; (b) standardization of specimen accession and gross examination reduced only specimen defects surrounding ancillary testing; but (c) a double review of breast and prostate cases was associated with drastically reduced misinterpretation defects. Finally, audit of both amendments and addenda demonstrated that 10% of the so-called addenda actually qualified as amendments. Discussion: Monitored by the consistent taxonomy, rates of amended reports first rose, then fell. Examining specific defect categories provided information for evaluating specific LEAN interventions. Tracking the downward trend of amendment rates seemed to document the overall success of surgical pathology quality improvement efforts. Process improvements modestly decreased fractions of misidentifications and markedly decreased misinterpretation fractions. Classification integrity requires real time, independent editing of both amendments (changed reports) and addenda (addition to reports).",

Traditionally myxoid leiomyosarcoma has been the most important consideration in this category, given its adverse prognosis and deceptively bland morphology. Conventional features of malignancy are variably present; in contrast, an infiltrative tumor border is a consistent pathologic characteristic. More recently, previously under-recognized lesions have been identified, in part due to our growing knowledge of their underlying molecular alterations: uterine inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor frequently harbors ALK rearrangements and a novel ZC3H7B-BCOR gene fusion has been described in a subset of myxoid high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas. These tumors need to be distinguished from myxoid leiomyosarcoma, as by comparison have a less aggressive course and are amenable to targeted treatments. In addition, uterine mesenchymal tumors with malignant potential need to be distinguished from benign tumors and epithelial and mixed malignancies. This review aims to discuss our current understanding of the most common uterine myxoid neoplasms: their clinical features, their distinguishing histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features and the clues and pitfalls in their diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor is an unusual, distinctive soft tissue neoplasm with locally recurring potential, which most commonly occurs in the ankle and foot. Morphologic evidence strongly suggests that hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor is related to another rare, locally aggressive tumor of the distal extremities, pleomorphic hyalinizing angiectatic tumor, with areas identical to hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor seen at the periphery in most if not all pleomorphic hyalinizing angiectatic tumor. This morphologic evidence is further supported by molecular genetic data, showing recurrent TGFBR3 and/or MGEA5 rearrangements in both hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor and pleomorphic hyalinizing angiectatic tumor. A possible link between hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor and yet another low-grade sarcoma of the distal extremities, myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma, has also been suggested based on the occurrence of unusual examples of hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor showing progression to myxoid sarcoma, demonstrating some but not all features of myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma. These \"hybrid hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor-myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma\" also commonly show TGFBR3 and/or MGEA5 rearrangements. However, classic myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma lacks areas resembling hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor, and shows a very low frequency of TGFBR3 and/or MGEA5 rearrangements in prospectively diagnosed cases. This suggests that so-called \"hybrid hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor-myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma\" represents a form of malignant progression within hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor, rather than a lesion strictly related to classic myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma. This article will review the morphologic features, genetic features, and differential diagnosis of these rare neoplasms, and discuss their interrelation, or lack thereof.",

The VHL gene plausibly plays a key role in the initiation and tumorigenesis of both central nervous system and extraneuraxial hemangioblastoma, therefore, the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms of the tumor growth are initially reviewed. The clinical criteria for the diagnosis of VHLD are summarized, with emphasis on the distinction of sporadic hemangioblastoma from the form fruste of VHLD (eg, hemangioblastoma-only VHLD). The world literature on the topic of extraneuraxial hemangioblastomas has been comprehensively reviewed with ∼200 cases reported to date: up to 140 paraneuraxial, mostly of proximal spinal nerve roots, and 65 peripheral, 15 of soft tissue, 6 peripheral nerve, 5 bone, and 39 of internal viscera, including 26 renal and 13 nonrenal. A handful of possible yet uncertain cases from older literature are not included in this review. The clinicopathologic features of extraneuraxial hemangioblastoma are selectively presented by anatomic site of origin, and the differential diagnosis is emphasized in these subsets. Reference is made also to 10 of the authors' personal cases of extraneuraxial hemangioblastomas, which include 4 paraneuraxial and 6 peripheral (2 soft tissue hemangioblastoma and 4 renal).",

    "abstract": "Among the more common types of intraoral minor salivary gland neoplasms are pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma, polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma. These minor salivary gland neoplasms share similar morphologic features and to a large extent immunohistochemical findings. Differentiation between these benign and malignant neoplasms is often predicated on the presence or absence of invasion. As such, in the presence of limited tissue sampling that typifies the initial testing modalities, including fine needle aspiration biopsy and/or incisional biopsy, it often is not possible to differentiate a benign from malignant minor salivary gland neoplasm. The diagnostic difficulties arise from the absence in needle or incisional biopsy of the tumor’s periphery to determine whether infiltrative growth is or is not present. In this manuscript we discuss limitations and considerations associated with evaluation of incisional biopsies of intraoral minor salivary gland tumors. We offer a diagnostic approach to evaluating these biopsies, and suggest diagnostic terminology for biopsy specimens in which distinction between benignancy and malignancy is not feasible. The pathologist’s approach to this distinction is critical, as treatment of benign neoplasms is generally conservative, whereas malignant lesions may warrant more aggressive management.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EEC) is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract, partly attributable to chronic estrogen exposure secondary to increased obesity rates. Tumor stage, which in most cases is based on depth of invasion (DOI), is of critical importance in determining if additional treatment is needed. However, the array of invasive morphologies within the spectrum of ECC can make the determination of DOI difficult. Several morphologic patterns of invasion have been described, including diffusely infiltrating irregular glands, \"broad front\" (or pushing border), adenoma malignum, adenomyosis-like, and microcystic, elongated, and fragmented glands. EEC may often contain a mixture of invasive patterns, which can further complicate evaluation of these common tumors. Recognition of these patterns may lead to more accurate staging, but perhaps more importantly, some patterns may be associated with adverse prognostic features. The purpose of this review is to highlight the various invasive patterns of EEC and note their unique pitfalls and prognostic implications in an effort to improve staging accuracy and treatment and follow-up for the thousands of women affected by this disease each year.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in molecular pathology have reshaped the practice of brain tumor diagnostics. The classification of gliomas has been restructured with the discovery of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1/2 mutations in the vast majority of lower grade infiltrating gliomas and secondary glioblastomas (GBM), with IDH-mutant astrocytomas further characterized by TP53 and ATRX mutations. Whole-arm 1p/19q codeletion in conjunction with IDH mutations now define oligodendrogliomas, which are also enriched for CIC, FUBP1, PI3K, NOTCH1, and TERT-p mutations. IDH-wild-type (wt) infiltrating astrocytomas are mostly primary GBMs and are characterized by EGFR, PTEN, TP53, NF1, RB1, PDGFRA, and CDKN2A/B alterations, TERT-p mutations, and characteristic copy number alterations including gains of chromosome 7 and losses of 10. Other clinically and genetically distinct infiltrating astrocytomas include the aggressive H3K27M-mutant midline gliomas, and smaller subsets that occur in the setting of NF1 or have BRAF V600E mutations. Low-grade pediatric gliomas are both genetically and biologically distinct from their adult counterparts and often harbor a single driver event often involving BRAF, FGFR1, or MYB/MYBL1 genes. Large scale genomic and epigenomic analyses have identified distinct subgroups of ependymomas tightly linked to tumor location and clinical behavior. The diagnosis of embryonal neoplasms also integrates molecular testing: (I) 4 molecularly defined, biologically distinct subtypes of medulloblastomas are now recognized; (II) 3 histologic entities have now been reclassified under a diagnosis of \"embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR), C19MC-altered\"; and (III) atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) now require SMARCB1 (INI1) or SMARCA4 (BRG1) alterations for their diagnosis.

PM-NHLs are defined as involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes, thymus, and/or mediastinal organs (heart, lung, pleura, pericardium) by NHL without evidence of systemic disease at presentation. The clinical scenario is variable and depends on the lymphoma subtype. The radiologic presentation is also variable ranging from a mediastinal mass with or without superior vena cava syndrome, a pleural or a cardiac mass associated with an effusion, or as an effusion only. The diagnosis of PM-NHLs can only be established by microscopic evaluation, and therefore, general pathologists should be aware of these tumors and familiar with their diagnostic approach. The most common anterior mediastinal NHLs (90% to 95%) are primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and T lymphoblastic lymphoma. Thymic marginal zone lymphoma and mediastinal gray zone lymphoma are very rare. The remainder PM-NHLs involving middle or posterior mediastinum include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and rare cases of T-cell lymphoma, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma and breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma extending to the anterior mediastinum. Primary pleural and cardiac NHLs are mostly DLBCLs. Other rare subtypes of PM-NHLs include DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation/pyothorax-associated lymphoma, fibrin-associated DLBCL (both EBV + ), and pleural and/or pericardial primary effusion lymphoma (HHV-8 + /EBV + ). We review the historical aspects, epidemiology, clinico-radiologic features, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, differential diagnosis, and relevant cytogenetic and molecular features of PM (thymic) LBCL, PM “nonthymic” DLBCL, BCL, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and classic Hodgkin lymphoma (mediastinal gray zone lymphoma), DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation (pyothorax-associated lymphoma), fibrin-associated DLBCL, and primary effusion lymphoma.

Evidence in the literature suggests that DIA has significant benefits over manual quantitation of IHC biomarkers, such as increased objectivity, accuracy, and reproducibility. Despite this fact, a number of barriers to the adoption of DIA in the clinical laboratory persist. These include difficulties in integrating DIA into clinical workflows, lack of standards for integrating DIA software with laboratory information systems and digital pathology systems, costs of implementing DIA, inadequate reimbursement relative to those costs, and other factors. These barriers to adoption may be overcome with international standards such as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), increased adoption of routine digital pathology workflows, the application of artificial intelligence to DIA, and the emergence of new clinical applications for DIA.",

It is essential for both the clinicians and pathologists to maintain up-to-date knowledge of this continuously evolving topic in the midst of the current pandemic. Besides, understanding the impact of any disease in tissue pathology is crucial for better analysis of the pathogenesis and speculation of potential therapeutic targets. This review aimed to highlight the potential implication of COVID-19 in the pathology of various organ systems. We discuss the pathologic findings of the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, brain, kidneys, heart, and the reproductive and immune systems that are associated with COVID-19. It seems that the respiratory, immune, and the digestive systems are the major targets of the disease. Mild mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration is the most frequent histologic finding in general. Besides organ-specific changes, microthrombi, especially noticed in lungs, kidneys, and prostates, are the most significant observation microscopically. In addition, the possible mechanisms of organ injury were also reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Lymphoproliferative disorders comprise 50% to 60% of all mediastinal malignancies in both children and adults. Primary mediastinal involvement is rare (∼5%), whereas secondary mediastinal involvement by systemic disease is more common (10% to 25%). Primary mediastinal disease is defined as involvement by a lymphoproliferative disorder of mediastinal lymph nodes, the thymus, and/or extranodal mediastinal organs without evidence of systemic disease at presentation. In this review, the clinical, radiologic, histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic features of some of the most characteristic mediastinal lymphoproliferative disorders are presented. The entities discussed here include: classic Hodgkin lymphoma with emphasis on nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity types, and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma, mediastinal gray zone lymphoma, mediastinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, thymic marginal zone lymphoma, mediastinal plasmacytoma, T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Although not a malignant process, hyaline vascular Castleman disease is also discussed here as this disorder commonly involves the mediastinum. Despite multiple advances in hematopathology in recent decades, the day-to-day diagnosis of these lesions still requires a morphologic approach and a proper selection of immunohistochemical markers. For this reason, it is crucial for general pathologists to be familiar with these entities and their particular clinicoradiologic presentation.",

The early detection, histologic grading, and removal of dysplasia plays a critical role in preventing the development of CRC. With advances in endoscopic visualization and resection techniques, colectomy is no longer recommended to manage dysplasia, unless surveillance colonoscopy detects flat/invisible dysplasia (either high-grade dysplasia or multifocal low-grade dysplasia) or an endoscopically unresectable lesion. Although there are numerous review articles and book chapters on the morphologic criteria of conventional (intestinal type) dysplasia, the most well-recognized form of dysplasia, at least 7 distinct nonconventional morphologic patterns of epithelial dysplasia have been recently described in inflammatory bowel disease. Most practicing pathologists are not familiar with these nonconventional subtypes and thus, may even overlook some of these dysplastic lesions as benign or reactive. However, the recognition of these subtypes is important, as some of them appear to have a high risk of developing advanced neoplasia (high-grade dysplasia or CRC) and often show molecular alterations characteristic of advanced neoplasia. This review briefly describes the morphologic criteria of conventional dysplasia but predominantly focuses on all 7 nonconventional subtypes as well as our understanding of their clinicopathologic and molecular features that can assist in their risk stratification.",

In this review, we aim to summarize the major evolutions of HGFCTC and ATC. HGFCTC is a nonanaplastic carcinoma with high grade features (High mitotic count, tumor necrosis). It is subdivided into poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma diagnosed using the Turin proposal and differentiated high grade thyroid carcinoma. The latter is defined by the presence of the cytoarchitectutal features of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (eg, papillae) but harbors elevated mitotic activity and/or tumor necrosis. Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma is predominantly RAS -driven and associated with RAI avidity and high propensity for distant metastasis, whereas differentiated high grade thyroid carcinoma is mostly BRAFV600E -driven. ATC may show a wide range of histologic features. Carcinoma of pure squamous phenotype is associated with a high frequency of BRAF V600E mutations and is now considered as a subtype of ATC. There is a stepwise molecular progression from well-differentiated carcinoma to HGFCTC to ATC manifested by 1) early and persistent driver alteration in the MAPK pathway, particularly BRAF V600E and RAS mutations, and 2) gain of secondary aggressive molecular signatures (such as TERT promoter and TP53 mutations) when tumors progress from well-differentiated to high grade to anaplastic carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of “follicular neoplasm” (FN) in thyroid cytopathology has a long history that originated not long after the practice of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules. From the outset, this interpretive category was intended to convey a set of differential diagnoses rather than a precise diagnosis, as key diagnostic features, such as capsular and vascular invasion, were not detectable on cytology preparations. Cytologic-histologic correlation studies over the past several decades have shown that FN interpretation can be applied to the spectrum of nonneoplastic tumors to carcinomas. Most tumors classified as FN include follicular adenoma, follicular carcinoma, noninvasive follicular thyroid tumor with papillary-like nuclear features, and follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Less common entities that may be classified as FN on FNA include hyalinizing trabecular tumor (HTT), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, and nonthyroidal lesions such as parathyroid tissue, paraganglioma, and metastatic tumors. Advances in our ability to detect characteristic molecular alterations (eg, GLIS gene rearrangements for hyalinizing trabecular tumor) in FNA samples may assist in the identification of some of these entities. In this review, we summarize the pathophysiology, history, and evolution of the terminology and the current differential diagnosis according to the recently published 2022 World Health Organization classification, molecular testing, and management of nodules classified as FN.",

Correct recognition of these entities can be challenging, especially on small/needle biopsies, but is required to plan therapy and guide transplant in the setting of cirrhosis. Salient histologic features of these entities, along with ancillary use of immunostains and key molecular findings aiding in diagnosis, are discussed. Type 2 intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts is typically associated with an invasive malignancy and lack unique molecular features associated with the Type 1 intraductal papillary neoplasm, thus they are called “papillary cholangiocarcinoma” by some authors. Some of the cholangiocarcinoma variants, like enteroblastic and mucoepidermoid, are under-recognized and can pose diagnostic challenges. The tubulocystic and cholangioblastic variants are relatively recently described but are being increasingly recognized. The cholangioblastic variant has a novel NIBPL-NACC1 fusion described in the more recent larger series reported, making it a somewhat unique variant of cholangiocarcinoma. Nomenclature of the cholangioblastic variant is in evolution as is the link between adenofibroma and the tubulocystic variant. Correct recognition of these variant subtypes would aid in long-term studies to better determine the prognosis in these subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Primary liver carcinoma (PLC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortalities. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent form of PLC, followed by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). In addition, there is a group of rarer PLCs that do not fit neatly into the HCC or iCCA categories. This review explores this heterogeneous group, including combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA), intermediate cell carcinoma (ICC), mixed hepatocellular-neuroendocrine carcinoma, and undifferentiated primary liver carcinoma. cHCC-CCA is a rare subtype of PLC, characterized by both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic differentiation within the same tumor. The latest WHO classification (2019, fifth edition) redefined cHCC-CCA by eliminating the “stem cell subtypes” and emphasized that diagnosis should primarily rely on morphologic features, supported by immunohistochemical staining to better define subtypes. Intermediate cell carcinoma is a subtype of cHCC-CCA and is comprised of monomorphic tumor cells that exhibit characteristics intermediate between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, with immunohistochemical expression of hepatocytic and cholangiocytic markers within the same cell. Another rare entity, combined HCC and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), contains an admixture of HCC and NEC components within the same tumor. Undifferentiated primary liver carcinoma, on the other hand, lacks definitive lineage differentiation beyond an epithelial phenotype. These heterogeneous PLCs pose diagnostic challenges owing to their mixed/unusual histologic features and overlapping immunohistochemical markers. They tend to have poor prognoses, highlighting the critical importance of accurate and timely diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare immune-mediated chronic liver disease that is diagnosed based on a combination of biochemical, immunologic, and histologic features and the exclusion of other causes of liver disease. According to the new consensus criteria of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Pathology Group (IAIHPG), the likely histologic features include a chronic hepatitis pattern of injury with a lymphoplasmacytic portal infiltrate, interface activity, and portal-based fibrosis. More than mild lobular hepatitis with any of the above features can also be diagnosed as likely AIH in the absence of features of another liver disease. Centrilobular injury with prominent hepatocellular necrosis and mononuclear inflammation may represent an acute-onset disease and indicate possible AIH in the absence of concurrent liver disease. Kupffer cell hyaline bodies and portal lymphocyte apoptosis are significantly associated with AIH, whereas emperipolesis and hepatocellular rosette formation are nonspecific features indicative of disease severity. Liver histology is an integral part of the clinical diagnostic scoring system and is required to confirm or support AIH diagnosis. Substitution of the histologic component of the simplified AIH scoring system with the consensus IAIHPG criteria has been proposed to optimize clinical diagnosis. This review explores the significant role of histopathology in AIH by analyzing its main features and current histologic diagnostic criteria, different AIH presentations, differential diagnosis, assessment of concurrent liver disease, and identification of AIH variants with primary cholangiopathy.",

A scoping review was conducted to explore the applications of multimodal Gen-AI models in advancing histopathology image analysis. A comprehensive search was conducted using electronic databases for relevant articles published within the past year (July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024). The selected articles were critically analyzed to identify and summarize the applications of multimodal Gen-AI in anatomic pathology image analysis. Multimodal Gen AI models reported in the literature claim moderate to high accuracy on tasks including image classification, segmentation, and text-to-image retrieval. This review demonstrates the potential of multimodal Gen AI models for useful applications in pathology, including assisting with diagnoses, generating data for education and research, and detection of molecular features from anatomic pathology images. These models use data from a few academic institutions thus they require validation on diverse real-world data. There is an urgent need to build consensus models for optimal model performance through multicenter collaboration using a federated learning approach and the use of carefully curated synthetic anatomic pathology data. These models also need to achieve reliability, generalizability and meet the standards required for clinical use. Despite the rigorous need for evaluation and the need to address genuine concerns, multimodal GenAI models present a promising perspective for the advancement and scalability of anatomic pathology.",

The most frequently identified mutations in large multi-institutional studies of cholestasis occur in JAG1, ATP8B1, ABCB11, ABCB4, SERPINA1 , and CFTR . Mutations in JAG1 , SERPINA1, and CFTR cause Alagille syndrome, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis, respectively. Mutations in ATP8B1 , ABCB11, and ABCB4 cause a spectrum of diseases that range from the episodic, nonprogressive benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy to the severe and rapidly progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. These cholestatic disorders present a wide range of symptoms and overlapping clinical features. However, in contemporary practice, diagnosis is often easily and rapidly established by clinically available comprehensive gene panels. In addition to diagnosis, these panels also aid in the discovery of novel genes or variants as potential causes of cholestasis. Genetic mutations may also be responsible for drug-induced cholestasis, as the liver plays a vital role in metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. Uptake into hepatocytes and elimination into the bloodstream or bile of drugs and xenobiotics involve transporters across the basolateral and apical hepatocellular membranes, respectively. Therefore, mutations in any of the transporters lead to impaired metabolism and/or elimination of these substances. Furthermore, a large number of drugs and xenobiotics have a transcriptional or functional inhibitory effect on transporters such as BSEP and MDR3, setting the stage for the all-too-common drug-induced cholestasis.",

Immunohistochemistry for specific markers of melanocytic differentiation such as HMB-45 and Melan-A can be very valuable in proving melanocytic differentiation in poorly differentiated or spindled forms of melanoma. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MiTF) is the most recently described and the only nuclear melanocytic marker. This article reviews the biology of MiTF and those published studies that have addressed its diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. MiTF may be very valuable for the diagnosis of melanoma, including desmoplastic variants; melanocytic soft tissue tumors, such as clear cell sarcoma; and the unusual group of tumors that show combined melanocytic and myoid differentiation, the perivascular epithelioid cell family of tumors (PEComas).",

    "abstract": "Until recently, the histologic diagnosis of obstetrical and gynecologic neoplasia was based principally on morphologic criteria. However, interobserver reproducibility for entities such as squamous intraepithelial, endometrial, and trophoblastic disease varies widely between observers. This inherent variability in interpretation between individuals has led to wide ranges in diagnostic precision between practices, and in many cases, between recognized experts. The advent of immunohistochemistry, and the more recent accelerated discovery of new genes and their functions has resulted in the discovery of cellular proteins or nucleic acids that are differentially expressed in tumors. When applied in conjunction with existing histologic criteria, these \"biomarkers\" have the potential to enhance diagnostic consistency and reproducibility. The gains expected are to practicing diagnostic pathologists (who will enjoy greater diagnostic consistency) and to academics (for whom biomarkers may uncover new pathways unappreciated by histologic diagnosis alone). However, fundamental to the success in both arenas will be critical analysis of the potential pitfalls in immunohistochemistry, strict validation of new markers as they arrive in the field, and a realistic view of their value in the laboratory management of obstetrical and gynecologic diseases.",

However, the prevalence of morphologically ambiguous gliomas, subjective histologic criteria, personal biases, oligodendroglioma mimics, and the lack of specific oligodendroglioma markers has led to high interobserver variability and created a contentious problem encountered daily in active surgical neuropathology practices. Since histologic assessment is still a powerful prognosticator, it appropriately remains the diagnostic gold standard. However, recent efforts have focused on identifying the most reproducible and clinically relevant criteria, standardizing classification and grading schemes, and searching for useful ancillary biologic and genetic markers capable of further stratifying an otherwise heterogeneous patient population. This paper reviews the morphologic and genetic spectrum of oligodendroglial neoplasms, recent diagnostic and prognostic developments, and potential future directions.",

Although some discrepancies exist in clinical studies, in general, HER-2/neu amplification is found to be associated with more aggressive clinicopathologic features. HER-2/neu amplification is also associated with drug resistance or sensitivity to specific chemotherapy and hormonal therapy regimens. Advances in breast cancer therapies in recent years have moved towards the development of tumor-specific targeted therapies. Monoclonal antibodies directed against HER-2/neu have been developed and used in clinical practice. These developments necessitate a reliable assay for assessment of HER-2/neu.

Furthermore, some of the unusual morphologic variants, including clear-cell, pleomorphic, and sarcomatoid variants, may be mistaken for metastases. Similarly, metastases from various primary tumors to the liver may be mistaken for primary hepatic tumors. In this overview, we summarize the immunohistochemical and molecular markers that have been developed to address these diagnostic challenges.

Survivin inhibits apoptosis by blocking activation of effector caspases in both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Expression of survivin has been demonstrated in several malignant neoplasms and is generally associated with adverse prognosis. In the case of bladder cancer, survivin is expressed in the neoplastic epithelium but not in the uninvolved mucosa. Several studies on bladder cancer have indicated that there may be a relationship between survivin expression and ultimate behavior of the carcinoma, although the exact nature of this relationship is still not fully understood, because the results of some of these studies seem to be contradictory. As survivin is differentially expressed in bladder cancer and not in the normal urothelium, several studies have demonstrated efficacy of urine testing of survivin as a diagnostic tool for an early detection of bladder cancer. Survivin has also been suggested as a suitable target for developing specific therapy for local treatment of bladder cancer with encouraging initial results. Thus, survivin is a potentially significant protein with a crucial role in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of bladder cancer.",

The tumor has a proclivity to involve the tendons and aponeuroses of distal extremities of relatively young individuals and is characterized by multiple local recurrences with late metastases and a high rate of tumor deaths. Since its seminal description in 1965, there have been many studies verifying the uniqueness of this entity and probing its differentiation. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies have shown melanocytic differentiation, whereas molecular genetic studies have shown cytogenetic rearrangements resulting in a EWSR1-ATF1 fusion gene that is characteristic but not entirely unique for clear cell sarcoma (similar fusion genes are also seen in angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma). Detection of this fusion gene and the absence of BRAF gene mutations clearly distinguish clear cell sarcoma from cutaneous melanoma. Adverse prognostic factors identified to date include larger tumor size and any microscopic tumor necrosis. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for this high grade sarcoma, with chemotherapy having little effect. Although the melanocytic differentiation of clear cell sarcoma is indisputable, its precise lineage remains unclear. Thus, clear cell sarcoma maintains the status of a unique yet enigmatic clinicopathologic entity of ever increasing complexity 40 years after its original description by an extraordinarily gifted man.",

To date, microarray analyses of sarcomas support their division into molecularly defined and molecularly heterogeneous categories, and have provided useful diagnostic markers for entities such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, synovial sarcoma, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Signatures predicting outcome and response to therapy have been published for Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma, and receptor tyrosine kinase expression patterns have suggested novel therapeutic approaches which may be applied to several types of sarcoma.

The severity of the clinical disease depends on the type of genetic mutations. Although exact function of FPC is not fully known, it is generally felt that like many of the other ciliary proteins, it plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity of organs such as kidney and liver, by modulating important cellular functions, including proliferation, secretion, apoptosis, and terminal differentiation. FPC probably works in conjunction with cellular proteins involved in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease that is, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, which are also located in the primary cilia.

    "abstract": "Recurrent gene fusions and chromosomal rearrangements were previously thought to be the primary oncogenic mechanism of hematological malignancies and sarcomas. The recent discovery of recurrent gene fusions in a majority of prostate cancers represents a paradigm shift in understanding the molecular mechanisms of one of the most prevalent epithelial malignancies, with important clinical and biologic implications. The prostate cancer gene fusions that have been identified so far are characterized by 5′-genomic regulatory elements, most notably the androgen-controlled prostate specific gene, transmembrane protease serine 2, fused to members of the erythroblastosis virus E26 transforming sequence family of transcription factors, most notably ERG, leading to the overexpression of oncogenic transcription factors. The erythroblastosis virus E26 transforming sequence gene fusions most likely define a distinct class of prostate cancer with potential implications for early diagnosis, prognosis, and rational therapeutic targeting. In this review, we summarize the bioinformatics approach that led to the discovery of gene fusions, the current state of the frequency, and diversity of gene fusions that define the molecular heterogeneity of prostate cancer, their associations with prostate cancer progression and clinical outcome, the subsequent morphological characteristics, and the potential application of gene fusions as biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.",

As opposed to the cone-shaped organ seen in vivo, radical prostatectomy specimens are typically spherical, owing to tissue contraction at surgical removal and subsequent processing. Sectioning from apex to base yields topography at the Surgical Pathology \"sign-out\" that may vary from McNeal's descriptions. There are no in depth studies of anterior prostatic anatomic variability, including the periurethral region, peripheral (PZ) and transition (TZ) zones, anterior fibromuscular stroma (AFMS), and anterior extraprostatic space (EPS) using modern prosecting techniques. Detailed analysis of 197 entirely submitted, whole-mounted radical prostatectomy specimens focused on differences in zonal anatomy from apex through base, the relationship of AFMS to PZ and TZ, and the nature of the anterior EPS revealed features that may have significant impact on determination of zonal origin and pathologic staging of anteriorly situated prostate cancer. Among these observations are the predominant nature of the anterior PZ at the apex and the potential for its broad contact with the AFMS at this location, the differing volumes and location of the TZ in prostates with and without benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the composition of the anterior EPS, including adipose tissue, blood vessels, and skeletal muscle at the apex varying to include medium to large smooth muscle bundles at the base.",

A number of molecularly and histologically distinct subtypes of pancreatic neoplasms have been identified and, importantly, many of these subtypes have important clinical implications. For example, most of the solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms harbor mutations in the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1), and, as a result, most solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms have an abnormal nuclear pattern of labeling with antibodies to the beta-catenin protein. Clinically, patients with a solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm have a much better prognosis than do patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Therefore, the immunolabeling of a pancreatic biopsy for the beta-catenin protein can help identify patients with low-risk neoplasms. It is clear that the time is now ripe for a new modern classification of neoplasms of the pancreas; a classification that does not abandon gross and microscopic pathology, but which instead integrates molecular findings with gross, microscopic, and clinical findings.",

These lesions include columnar cell lesions, atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular neoplasia, papillary lesions, radial scars, fibroepithelial lesions, and mucocele-like lesions. As minimally invasive diagnostic procedures are now standard it is more important than ever to be aware of the limitations of percutaneous biopsy, particularly with regard to apparently benign lesions because of the risk that the radiologically detected lesion may harbor malignant disease not represented in the biopsy specimen. This underscores the importance of radiologic-pathologic correlation. Increasingly, radiologists are adopting vacuum-assisted devices using larger gauge needles. The changing practices among radiologists are reflected in recent studies which have enriched the literature. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging is being used more frequently in breast imaging, resulting in pathologists more often encountering benign biopsies with uncertain imaging correlation. These changes prompted evaluation of the recent literature and its possible effect on management concerns. This review focuses on management issues following the diagnosis of nonmalignant lesions diagnosed on percutaneous breast biopsy and highlights imaging terms commonly used in breast radiology reports to facilitate accurate radiologic-pathologic correlation.",

These polyps have received increased recognition over the past 2 decades, as emerging evidence suggests that a subset may be precursors to colorectal carcinomas that lack chromosomal instability. Several investigators have proposed the concept of the \"serrated neoplastic pathway\" according to which nondysplastic serrated lesions develop progressively severe dysplasia culminating in the development of microsatellite unstable carcinomas that show DNA hypermethylation and BRAF mutations. A subset of hyperplastic polyps and sessile serrated polyps show mutations in the BRAF gene and abnormal DNA methylation, which can, ultimately, affect the promoter regions of key DNA-repair and tumor suppressor genes, such as MLH1 and MGMT, leading to their decreased transcription and microsatellite instability. On the basis of this hypothesis, many authors have proposed that sessile serrated polyps should be treated and surveilled similar to conventional adenomas, although prospective data are lacking. This review describes the clinicopathologic and molecular features of serrated polyps and discusses the current data regarding their biologic significance.",

In the presence of a normal contralateral kidney, such as in a renal transplant donor or child with Wilms tumor, it is a benign procedure without deleterious consequences on the remaining kidney. However, many adults and some children postnephrectomy will develop chronic kidney disease. The non-neoplastic kidney in tumor resections may harbor a large number of developmental and acquired diseases predictive of this outcome or that convey other medically significant information. Examination of the non-neoplastic kidney is a fertile opportunity to identify these unsuspected conditions that may ultimately dictate the subsequent clinical course and influence the medical care provided. This review discusses the consequences of unilateral and partial nephrectomy, and illustrates many conditions that may be encountered in the non-neoplastic cortex with a discussion of their clinical implications.",

Hormonal and radiation therapy, in particular, have well known, often profound effects on the histologic appearance of benign prostate tissue and prostatic carcinoma. The tissue changes induced by these treatments have been comprehensively described in several sources. Novel therapies ranging from focal ablative treatments to highly targeted molecular therapies are beginning to emerge and pathologists will play a central role in documenting the effects of these treatments on normal and malignant prostate tissue. It is therefore important that pathologists have access to basic treatment information and a solid working knowledge of the morphologic changes induced by these therapies. This will ensure accurate interpretation and reporting of posttreatment prostate specimens. This review is based on a presentation given by Dr A. Evans at the International Society of Urological Pathology Companion Society Meeting (Hot Topics in Urological Pathology) at The United States Canadian Academy of Pathology Meeting in Washington DC on March 20, 2010. This review will cover the histopathologic features seen in benign prostate tissue and prostatic carcinoma seen following: hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, ablative therapies such as vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy, interstitial laser thermotherapy, and high-intensity focussed ultrasound. An emphasis is placed on these specific modalities as they are currently in use as primary, salvage, or investigational therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.",

The majority of thyroid nodules are benign; however, up to 30% of fine-needle aspiration of thyroid nodule results are equivocal. Until 2007, various diagnostic terms were used to classify such cases, including \"atypical,\" \"indeterminate,\" and rule-out or cannot exclude malignancy. A literature review of 13 original studies was conducted to evaluate whether utilization of the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology nomenclature represent an improvement over thyroid cytopathology reporting schemes used before 2007 in diagnosing thyroid malignancy. The sensitivity and specificity of thyroid fine-needle aspiration was high in the studies that assessed the measures. However, a selection bias exists and most studies do not include indeterminate diagnosis in their calculations. Although the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology recommends a repeat fine-needle aspiration to follow-up nondiagnostic specimens, in the majority of studies, an appreciable number of cases underwent follow-up surgical biopsy or thyroidectomy. The diagnostic category of atypia/follicular lesion of undetermined significance remains heterogenous in terms of usage and clinical outcome. The majority of the studies that utilize the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology in this literature review retrospectively reclassified thyroid fine-needle aspiration into the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology nomenclature with reported malignancy rates that are similar between cases reclassified as atypia/follicular lesion of undetermined significance and follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm.",

In recent years, crucial advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular and metabolic basis of clear cell carcinoma. This tumor manifests significant alterations in the cellular metabolism, so that the tumor cells preferentially induce the hypoxia response pathway using aerobic glycolysis, rather than the normal oxidative phosphorylation for energy. Most of the clear cell carcinomas (sporadic as well as familial) have mutations and deletions in the VHL gene located at 3p (p3.25). Normally, pVHL plays a crucial role in the proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)1 and HIF2. Lack of a functioning pVHL owing to genetic alterations results in stabilization and accumulation of these factors, which promotes cell growth, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis, contributing to a neoplastic phenotype. Several other genes normally located adjacent to VHL (BAP1, SETD2, PBRM1) may also be lost. These are tumor suppressor genes whose loss not only plays a role in carcinogenesis but may also influence the clinical course of these neoplasms. In addition, interaction among a variety of other genes located at several different chromosomes may also play a role in the genesis and progression of clear cell carcinoma.",

Studies of molecular and cellular interactions involved in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy have revealed several inherent abnormalities in the production and subsequent handling of IgA1. In patients with this disease, altered glycan structures in the unique hinge region of the heavy chains of IgA1 molecules lead to the exposure of antigenic determinants, which are recognized by naturally occurring antiglycan antibodies of the IgG and/or IgA1 isotype. In addition, due to a homing abnormality there is a gradual shift of mucosal IgA1 producing lymphoplasma cells from mucosal lymphoid tissue to bone marrow resulting in excess production of mucosal-type IgA1 in the systemic circulation. As a result, nephritogenic immune complexes form in the circulation and deposit in the glomerular mesangium. Deposited immune complexes induce proliferation of resident mesangial cells with increased production of extracellular matrix proteins. A number of inflammatory cytokines produced by the mesangial cells damage the filtration barrier resulting in hematuria and proteinuria ultimately leading to progressive renal damage.",

    "abstract": "Mesothelial proliferations can be diagnostically challenging in small specimens, such as body fluid cytology and small tissue biopsies. A great morphologic challenge for pathologists is the separation of benign reactive mesothelial proliferations from malignant mesotheliomas. Reactive mesothelial proliferations may have histologic features that resemble malignancy including increased cellularity, cytologic atypia, and mitoses. Recent advances in mesothelioma genetics resulted in identification of BAP1 mutations and p16 deletions as features of malignant mesotheliomas. Hence, BAP1 immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization for p16 emerged as 2 most common diagnostically helpful ancillary studies used on limited samples when the question is whether the proliferation is malignant or benign. In contrast, separation of mesothelioma from other malignancies is relatively straight forward using morphology and immunohistochemical stains. The choice of antibody panel to be applied in an individual case is driven by morphology, either epithelioid or sarcomatoid. This brief review will focus on morphology and ancillary testing of mainly pleural mesothelial proliferations.",

The majority of precursor lesions and SCC in the anus and vulva are high-risk HPV-associated, with HPV16 the most common type. Given the morphologic overlap and biological equivalence of HPV-related preinvasive squamous lesions of the lower anogenital tract, a unified, 2-tiered histopathologic nomenclature is now recommended. In contrast, mutations in the TP53 gene have been associated with HPV-independent vulvar and anal SCC. A precursor lesion-differentiated or simplex vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (dVIN)-has been identified for HPV-independent vulvar SCC but a similar lesion in the anus has not been described. Extramammary Paget disease is a nonsquamous intraepithelial lesion of the vulva and anus that may be a primary epidermotropic apocrine neoplasm or may represent secondary involvement by a synchronous/metachronous adenocarcinoma. This entity may be mimicked by squamous lesions and melanocytic lesions. Herein, we discuss the morphologic and immunohistochemical features of anal and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia in the context of updated terminology and current understanding of disease biology.",

    "abstract": "The encapsulated and noninvasive follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma has been recently reclassified as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP). These tumors demonstrate indolent behavior. This change in nomenclature will have great clinical impact by avoiding overtreatment of patients with NIFTP lesions who in the past were diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma and typically received completion thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine ablation. The pathologic diagnosis of NIFTP requires surgical removal of the thyroid lesion or the lobe harboring it, and thorough sampling of the complete interface between the tumor capsule and the thyroid parenchyma, to exclude foci of invasion. From a cytologic point of view, the unequivocal differential diagnosis between NIFTP and infiltrative follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma in fine-needle aspiration is close to impossible based on cellular and architectural features. Therefore, use of adjunct molecular testing on fine-needle aspiration specimens may be essential for the preoperative diagnosis of low-risk tumors such as NIFTP for appropriate patient management. This review discusses and summarizes the existing known literature on molecular characteristics of NIFTP tumors, so far reported, including cases retrospectively classified or prospectively diagnosed as NIFTP. Brief reference is also made to new and promising approaches applicable to the diagnosis of this tumor.",

    "abstract": "Accurate staging of cancers is an important determinant of prognosis and guides optimal patient treatment. Although the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting recommends that endometrial cancers (including carcinosarcomas) are pathologically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 system, in many areas TNM [American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) or Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)] staging is used or even mandated; these latter systems are based on FIGO 2009. In this review, areas of difficulty in the pathologic staging of endometrial carcinomas are covered with practical advice for the reporting pathologist. These include issues regarding the assessment of the depth of myometrial involvement (which may be rendered difficult due to a variety of factors), tumor involvement of adenomyosis, and assessment of cervical and uterine serosal involvement. Although not included in the FIGO staging system, the issue of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) is covered as this is of prognostic importance and there are multiple problems in the pathologic assessment of this. One important point is that tumors should not be upstaged based on the presence of LVSI alone without tissue involvement; for example, the presence of LVSI in the outer half of the myometrium or in cervical or adnexal vessels in a carcinoma with myoinvasion confined to the inner half of the myometrium is still FIGO stage IA. The issue of simultaneously occurring tumors of the endometrium and adnexa is also covered with advice on how to distinguish between synchronous independent and metastatic neoplasms of both endometrioid and nonendometrioid types. Recent molecular evidence showing that simultaneously occurring endometrioid carcinomas of the endometrium and ovary are clonal and thus probably represent metastatic disease from the endometrium to the ovary rather than synchronous independent neoplasms, as is widely assumed, is discussed.",

    "abstract": "A major goal of modern medicine is increasing patient specificity so that the right treatment is administered to the right patient at the right time with the right dose. While current cancer studies have largely focused on identification of genetic or epigenetic properties of tumor cells, emerging evidence has clearly demonstrated substantial genetic heterogeneity between tumors in the same patient and within subclones of a single tumor. Thus, molecular analysis from populations of cells (either a whole tumor or small biopsy of that tumor) is, at best, an incomplete representation of the underlying biology. These observations indicate a significant need to define intratumoral evolutionary dynamics that yield the observed spatial variations in cellular properties. It is generally accepted that genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells is a manifestation of intratumoral evolution, and this is typically viewed as a consequence of random mutations generated by genomic instability within the cancer cells. We suggest that this represents an incomplete view of Darwinian dynamics, which typically are governed by phenotypic variations in response to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environmental selection forces. We propose that pathologic feature analysis can provide precise information regarding regional variations in environmental selection forces and phenotypic adaptations. These observations can be integrated using quantitative, spatially explicit methods developed in landscape ecology to interrogate heterogenous biological processes in tumors within individual patients. The ability to investigate tumor heterogeneity has been shown to inform physicians regarding critical aspects of cancer progression including invasion, metastasis, drug resistance, and disease relapse.",

Some of the cancers may be difficult to treat by conventional means such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, but may be controlled by the stimulation of the immune response of the body with the help of cancer vaccines. The use of vaccines for preventing infections by oncogenic viruses such as hepatitis B virus and human papilloma virus has been extremely successful in reducing the incidence of cancers resulting from these infections. The use of vaccines for treating cancers that are not due to viral infections and that are already established is currently the object of numerous clinical trials. Several types of cancer vaccines are being tried. These include antigen vaccines, tumor cell vaccines, dendritic vaccines, deoxyribonucleic acid vaccines, and viral vector vaccines. The development of these therapeutic vaccines is proving difficult with only 1 recent success. However, there is significant enthusiasm and optimism regarding the development of effective therapeutic vaccines stemming from the fact that our understanding regarding the cancer immunology is considerably enhanced in recent years. This expanded knowledge regarding the mechanisms that cancers use to escape the immune system is likely to open new avenues in modulating the immune response to cancer, thus enhancing the effectiveness of therapeutic cancer vaccines.",

In contrast to their central nervous system (CNS) counterparts, there has been a tendency to consider these 2 entities as 1 since the early 1990s, as soft tissue SFT gradually included the tumors previously diagnosed as HPC. The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification of the tumors of soft tissue considered the term HPC obsolete, and places all such tumors within the extrapleural SFT category. In contrast, CNS SFT and HPC continue to be regarded as different entities in the latest version of the WHO CNS tumor classification. A change in this approach is currently being considered for the upcoming revision of the WHO scheme, but it is not quite clear whether such a change will be as drastic as the one adopted by the soft tissue and bone tumor working group.

Increasing experience with HLRCC-associated RCC and FH-deficient RCC has resulted in recognition of tumors with lower grade morphologic features, overlapping with those of succinate dehydrogenase–deficient RCC and other low-grade oncocytic tumors. In this review article, we report a previously unpublished case that was recently encountered in our practice and review cases in the current literature with an aim of getting a better understanding of these oncocytic tumors and their morphologic spectrum. The 13 cases reviewed were approximately equally distributed across males and females, occurred at a younger age, and were more frequently seen in the right kidney, with both unifocal and multifocal presentations. While most presented an exclusive, low-grade oncocytic morphology, in 4 cases they were associated with either separate high-grade tumors, or as a secondary pattern in an otherwise conventional high-grade FH-deficient RCC. Loss of FH and 2 succinyl cysteine (2SC) positivity by immunohistochemistry supported their diagnosis, and are recommended to be performed alongside CD117, CK7, and CK20 in to aid classification in challenging oncocytic tumors. When occurring in isolation, these tumors are distinctive from their high-grade counterparts, with no reported adverse outcomes in cases reported thus far. As such, accurate diagnosis of this low-grade pattern among FH-deficient RCCs is worthwhile not only due to its association with HLRCC and need of genetic counseling and surveillance, but also due to more favorable prognosis. Finally, increasing experience with the low-grade end of the morphologic spectrum of FH deficient RCC reiterates that not all tumors of this subtype of RCC have a uniformly aggressive outcome.",

    "abstract": "The classification of poorly differentiated sinonasal carcinomas and their nonepithelial mimics has experienced tremendous developments during the last 2 decades. These recent developments paved the way for an increasingly adopted approach to a molecular-based or etiology-based refined classification of the many carcinoma variants that have been historically lumped into the sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma category. Among these new achievements, recognition of carcinoma subtypes driven by defects in the Switch/Sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex represents a major highlight. This resulted in a new definition of 4 sinonasal entities driven solely or predominantly by Switch/Sucrose nonfermentable complex deficiency: (1) SMARCB1(INI1)-deficient sinonasal carcinoma (lacking gland formation and frequently displaying a non-descript basaloid, and less frequently eosinophilic/oncocytoid morphology, but no features of other definable subtypes), (2) SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal adenocarcinoma (with unequivocal glands or yolk sac-like pattern), (3) SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated (sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma-like) carcinoma (lacking glandular or squamous immunophenotypes), and (4) SMARCA4-deficient subset (~80%) of sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma. Fortunately, diagnostic loss of all these proteins can be detected by routine immunohistochemistry, so that genetic testing is not mandatory in routine practice.

    "abstract": "Salivary gland intraductal carcinoma (IDC) is a very uncommon group of neoplasms. Many names, variations in diagnostic criteria, and newly observed molecular findings (including NCOA4 :: RET , TRIM27 :: RET , HRAS point mutations, and PIK3CA pathway alterations) have generated further confusion in being able to recognize and categorize this group of tumors. Different histologic appearances and patterns of growth suggest there is more than one tumor category, with intercalated duct, apocrine, oncocytic, and hybrid features seen. Frankly destructive invasion further complicates the category, as the name “intraductal” would suggest an “in situ” neoplasm. Recent evidence on fusion-positive IDC demonstrates the same molecular underpinnings in both the ductal and the myoepithelial cells, which aids in further separating these tumors. This article summarizes the historical group of 183 neoplasms classified under the umbrella of IDC and highlights the unique histologic, immunohistochemistry, and molecular features that may further guide nomenclature standardization and harmonization.",

    "abstract": "Hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder characterized by elevated levels of parathyroid hormone and hypercalcemia and is divided into 3 types: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Distinction between these types is accomplished by correlation of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings with pathologic features. Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs sporadically in 85% of cases with the remaining cases associated with multiple familial syndromes. The pathologic manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism include parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia, and parathyroid carcinoma. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of parathyroid disease has helped to refine the diagnosis and classification of parathyroid lesions. The identification of multiple clonal proliferations in traditional multiglandular parathyroid hyperplasia has led to the adoption by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the alternate term of primary hyperparathyroidism-related multiglandular parathyroid disease. Additional nomenclature changes include the adoption of the term atypical parathyroid tumor in lieu of atypical parathyroid adenoma to reflect the uncertain malignant potential of these neoplasms. Clinical and morphologic features characteristic of familial disease have been described that can help the practicing pathologist identify underlying familial disease and provide appropriate management. Use of ancillary immunohistochemistry and molecular studies can be helpful in classifying parathyroid neoplasms. Parafibromin has proven useful as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in atypical parathyroid tumors and parathyroid carcinomas. This review provides an update on the diagnosis and classification of parathyroid lesions considering the recent advances in the understanding of the molecular and clinical features of parathyroid disease and highlights the use of ancillary studies (immunohistochemical, and molecular) to refine the diagnosis of parathyroid lesions.",

    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)/mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathway-related genomic alterations have been classically described in hereditary TSC syndrome setting involving germline mutations, whereby cells with a bi-allelic inactivation of genes originate tumors in a classic tumor-suppressor “two-hit” Knudson paradigm. Initial studies of TSC-associated RCC categorized tumors into 3 broad heterogeneous morphologic groups: RCC with smooth muscle stroma, chromophobe-like, and eosinophilic-macrocytic. Recently, a similar morphologic spectrum has been increasingly recognized in novel and emerging entities characterized by somatic mutations in the TSC1/2 and MTOR in patients who do not suffer from the TSC. Correct recognition of RCC with TSC / MTOR mutations is critical for accurate prognostication because such tumors with aggressive behavior have the potential to be tailored to mTOR inhibitors. Whether TSC/MTOR mutated renal epithelial neoplasms represent a distinct molecular class has been confounded by the fact that TSC1/2 , and the gene encoding the downstream protein MTOR, are mutated secondarily in ∼5% of the more common subtypes of RCC, including the commonest subtype of clear cell RCC. This review summarizes the expanding morphologic spectrum of renal tumors with TSC/mTOR pathway alterations, specifically for sporadically occurring tumors where these genomic alterations likely are primary pathologic events. Finally, a practical surgical pathology approach to handling these tumors, and a conceptual framework of renal epithelial tumors with TSC/MTOR mutations as a “family of tumors”, is presented.",

Unfortunately, most of what has been written on these tumors has been in the form of case reports and small series of cases, thus precluding a better understanding of their clinical and demographic features, as well as of their biologic behavior in this particular location. In addition, mediastinal germ-cell tumors not only have never had a standardized nomenclature, but they also have lacked the benefit of a clinical staging scheme for assessment of prognosis. Another important aspect of these tumors that has required attention is the frequency with which teratomatous lesions are associated with malignant components in the mediastinum. Comprehensive studies of mediastinal germ-cell tumors to determine whether these lesions recapitulate the distribution, histopathologic features, and biologic behavior of their counterparts in other areas, such as the gonads, have been lacking for many years. In this article, we review our experience with a large series of cases of primary mediastinal germ cell tumors and examine recent concepts and advances in our understanding of these unusual and diagnostically challenging neoplasms.",

    "abstract": "There is currently great interest in the detection and characterization of putative precursor breast cancer lesions because of the possibility of chemoprevention. Knowledge of the biologic features of premalignant lesions, although limited, is rapidly evolving. Premalignant breast lesions have been examined for the presence of genetic alterations and for the expression of biomarkers such as the estrogen receptor (ER), Ki67, p53, and HER2/neu. Data obtained from genetic studies of precursor breast lesions clearly support the contention that genetic alterations begin quite early in selected subsets of histologically benign lesions. Although the results of biomarker expression profiles have been contradictory, most studies agree that precursor lesions significantly overexpress ER and that progressive alterations in ER expression accompany the transition of normal cells to hyperplastic lesions and carcinoma in situ. So far, the collected evidence indicates that precursor lesions in the breast demonstrate biomarker expression profiles and genetic abnormalities that are distinct from those of terminal ductal lobular units but share some of these features with invasive tumors. Future research in this field is urgently needed to identify specific biomarkers of prognostic and predictive value, which can help not only in the selection of patients for chemopreventive therapy but in monitoring the progression of high-risk lesions.",

    "abstract": "Impression cytology, either using cellulose acetate strips or the Biopore membrane device, is a simple, noninvasive technique that aids in the diagnosis of several disorders of the ocular surface. These disorders include ocular surface squamous neoplasia, dry eye syndrome, limbal stem-cell deficiency, specific viral infections, vitamin A deficiency, allergic disorders, conjunctival melanosis, and malignant melanoma. Another advantage is the preservation of limbal stem cells, which occur in the basal layer of the limbal epithelium and are responsible for renewal of the corneal epithelium. The Biopore membrane device is particularly user friendly, with little expertise required and adequate specimens obtained in a very high percentage of cases. The most common applications in diagnostic ocular pathology are:(i) primary diagnosis and follow-up of ocular surface squamous neoplasia, including after therapy with topical mitomycin C. The sensitivity is high (78–87%); and (ii) dry eye syndrome where squamous metaplasia and/ or hyperkeratosis are noted. Certain limitations of the technique for diagnosis of squamous neoplasia include the fact that dysplasias are often keratinizing and may yield very few or even no dysplastic cells with impression cytology. Secondly, no definite cytologic criteria reliably distinguish invasive SCC of ocular surface from in situ disease. Other applications include the rapid specific diagnosis of ocular surface infections with herpes simplex, adeno-, and varicella zoster viruses. Impression cytology samples may also be used to obtain mRNA, cells for phenotyping by flow cytometry, and proteins for Western blotting for research studies.",

The resulting data was statistically analyzed using event-free and overall patient survival as endpoints. Significant anaplasia (moderate to severe) was identified in 24% of cases and was strongly associated with decreased survival times. Additionally, those with diffuse or extensive anaplasia fared worse than those with only focal anaplasia. Although the study confirmed the favorable prognosis for the rare cases of medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity, lesser degrees of nodularity or desmoplasia were not associated with a statistically significant survival advantage. Medulloblastoma grading based on anaplasia demonstrated a statistically stronger association with patient outcome than clinical staging.

This review discusses diagnostic applications of CD10 in the female genital tract, with emphasis on CD10 use in mesenchymal tumors of the uterus and in the differential diagnosis of mesonephric versus non-mesonephric carcinomas, where CD10 positivity alone may be misleading in the final classification of a tumor.

One of the most exciting current roles of sentinel lymph node biopsy is the ability to stage patients intraoperatively, allowing a one-step axillary lymph node dissection if the sentinel lymph node contains metastatic carcinoma. Currently, intraoperative evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes is performed using imprint cytology with or without rapid cytokeratin staining, frozen sectioning with or without rapid cytokeratin staining, scrape preparations, or some combination of these techniques. We review the relative strengths and weaknesses of these different methodologies.

Sentinel lymph node (SLN) evaluation as a predictor of lymph node status has led to increased use of ancillary methods, principally immunohistochemistry, to increase the sensitivity of the SLN biopsy. So-called \"occult\" micrometastases detected by such methods have led to speculation that some may have reached the SLNs by benign mechanical transport (BMT) rather than a metastatic process. We review evidence suggesting two potential modes of BMT: lymphatic transport of epithelial cells displaced by biopsy of the primary breast tumor and by breast massage-assisted SLN localization. The biopsy techniques under most scrutiny include fine needle aspiration and large-gauge core biopsy. The evidence implicating breast massage prior to SLN biopsy as a mode of BMT has been supported by statistical analysis; however, no method of distinguishing massage-associated cells in SLNs from true occult micrometastases is available. The significance of small epithelial clusters in SLNs is currently unknown. Thus, deviation from current biopsy and SLN-localizing practices is unwarranted.",

The pathogenesis of NA is not entirely clear. Although generally presumed to be a metaplastic process of the urothelium, recent evidence suggests that NA may in fact be derived from detached renal tubular cells implanting along the urothelial tract in previously injured areas, at least in cases associated with a kidney transplant. On light microscopy, NA shows a variety of patterns, including tubulocystic, papillary, and much less frequently solid, that often coexist. Recognition of its characteristic patterns, and awareness of its unusual architectural and cytologic features, is key to making the diagnosis of NA and distinguishing this lesion from malignant neoplasms occurring at the same sites, in particular, clear cell carcinoma, nested or microcystic variants of urothelial carcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma. Although straightforward in most cases, the correct diagnosis may be difficult to make on limited tissue samples. A number of immunohistochemical markers have been studied in an attempt to characterize NA; however, to date there is no specific immunohistochemical profile to distinguish this lesion from its malignant mimickers, although PAX2, a new marker, may prove to be helpful in this regard. Clinicopathologic correlation with careful attention to morphology remains the pillar in establishing the correct diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Transient leukemia of Down syndrome (DS-TL), also known as transient myeloproliferative disorder of Down syndrome (DS) and transient abnormal myelopoiesis of DS, occurs in approximately 10% of DS neonates and in phenotypically normal neonates with trisomy 21 mosaicism. In DS-TL, peripheral blood analysis shows variable numbers of blasts and, usually, thrombocytopenia; other cytopenias are uncommon. Bone marrow characteristics of DS-TL are, likewise, variable, though (in contrast to other leukemias) the bone marrow blast differential can be lower than the peripheral blood blast differential. The blasts of DS-TL typically show light microscopic, ultrastructural, and flow cytometric evidence of megakaryocyte differentiation. DS-TL neonates have a approximately 15% risk of developing potentially fatal liver disease and show <10% incidence of hydrops fetalis. Additional manifestations of DS-TL include cutaneous involvement, hyperviscosity, myelofibrosis, cardiopulmonary failure, splenomegaly, and spleen necrosis. Despite its typical transient nature, 20% to 30% of DS-TL patients develop overt (nontransient) acute leukemia, usually within 3 years and typically of the M7 phenotype (acute megakaryoblastic leukemia). The pathogenesis of DS-TL (and of subsequent acute leukemia) involves mutation of GATA1 (on chromosome X), which normally encodes a transcription factor integral to normal development of erythroid, megakaryocytic, and basophilic/mast cell lines. The pathogenetic role of trisomy 21 in DS-TL is unclear. Though indications for chemotherapy in DS-TL have not been firmly established, the blasts of DS-TL are sensitive to low-dose cytosine arabinoside.",

    "abstract": "The distinction between endometrial hyperplasia and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the endometrium continues to be a difficult differential diagnosis in surgical pathology. Evidence-based diagnostic criteria for well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma focus on histologic features that predict myoinvasion in the hysterectomy specimen. Only 2 diagnostic criteria with significant power aid in this distinction: complex glandular architectural patterns (glandular confluence, intraglandular complexity, and hierarchical papillary architecture) and marked cytologic atypia beyond that typically defined as atypical hyperplasia (ie, prominent macronucleoli visible at low power and marked nuclear pleomorphism). Application of these 2 criteria in problematic endometrial proliferations allows stratification of patients into 3 risk categories: very low risk (<0.05% risk of myoinvasion at hysterectomy)=complex atypical hyperplasia; intermediate risk (5.5% risk of myoinvasion at hysterectomy)=complex atypical hyperplasia, cannot exclude well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (borderline); and high risk (20% risk of myoinvasion at hysterectomy)=well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. In order to optimize the use of these diagnostic criteria, a variety of gland forming lesions that may mimic well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma must first be excluded. In addition, unusual morphologic patterns of low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma should be recognized, as they may cause confusion with other, higher grade (and therefore, more clinically aggressive) endometrial processes.",

This review discusses the main differential diagnoses of an ovarian spindle cell lesion, especially concentrating on the recent literature. The majority of ovarian spindle cell lesions fall into the broad category of fibromatous neoplasms whereas others in the sex cord-stromal group may also be composed of spindle cells, including thecomas, granulosa, and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors and rarer neoplasms, such as sclerosing stromal tumor and signet-ring stromal tumor. In the recent past there have been several major contributions on various aspects of ovarian spindle cell lesions, including cellular and mitotically active cellular fibromatous lesions, smooth muscle neoplasms, and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Other mesenchymal or epithelial tumors and mixed epithelial and mesenchymal neoplasms may also enter into the differential diagnosis of an ovarian spindle cell lesion. Several non-neoplastic lesions may be composed of spindle cells, including massive edema, ovarian fibromatosis, stromal hyperplasia, and stromal hyperthecosis. Morphology remains the mainstay in diagnosis but immunohistochemistry may be invaluable in certain circumstances, one example being the identification of a metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor within the ovary.",

They comprise of a diverse group of primary and metastatic neoplasms in both children and adults. The most common small cell tumors of bone include Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor, small cell osteosarcoma, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Although each entity has its distinctive features, the differential diagnosis of this group of tumors is still challenging because they are all \"small, blue, and round cell tumors\", histologically. The correct diagnosis of small cell tumors of bone depends on an evaluation of clinical, radiologic, pathologic, and genetic features. Patients' age and sex are very important, as are the signs and symptoms at presentation. Radiologically, which bone is involved, the specific portion of the bone (epiphysis, metaphysis, or diaphysis; cortex vs. medulla) involved, and the radiographic manifestations (lytic, blastic, or mixed lytic and blastic) are also often critical parameters for the diagnosis. In recent years, with a better understanding of the molecular and cytogenetic background of several small cell tumors, more accurate diagnoses have been supported by the clinicopathologic criteria and by a panel of immunohistochemical studies. In this review we will provide an overview of the clinical, radiologic, pathologic, and genetic characteristics of these tumors.",

    "abstract": "Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are an infrequent and heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumors including more than a hundred different entities attending to histologic patterns. Research into the molecular aspects of sarcomas has increased greatly in the last few years. This enormous amount of knowledge has allowed, for instance, to refine the classification of sarcomas, improve the diagnosis, and increase the number of therapeutical targets available, most of them under preclinical evaluation. However, other important key issues, such as sarcomagenesis and the cell of origin of sarcomas, remain unresolved. From a molecular point of view, these neoplasias are grouped into 2 main types: (a) sarcomas showing relatively simple karyotypes and translocations, which originate gene fusions (eg, EWS-FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma) or point mutations (eg, c-kit in the gastrointestinal tumors) and (b) sarcomas showing unspecific gene alterations, very complex karyotypes, and no translocations. The discovery of the early mechanisms involved in the genesis of sarcomas, the more relevant signaling pathways, and the development of genetically engineered mouse models could also provide a new individualized therapeutic strategy against these tumors. This review describes the clinical application of some of the molecular alterations found in sarcomas, some advances in the field of sarcomagenesis, and the development of animal models.",

It carries an intermediate biologic behavior between a classic carcinoid tumor and a conventional adenocarcinoma. There has been a general lack of clinicopathologic parameters that can be reliably used to predict the clinical course and patient outcome. A recent retrospective study of a large number of appendiceal goblet cell carcinoids has shown that these tumors can be stratified into 3 subgroups based on careful histologic analysis: typical goblet cell carcinoid (group A); adenocarcinoma ex goblet cell carcinoid, signet ring cell type (group B); and adenocarcinoma ex goblet cell carcinoid, poorly differentiated carcinoma type (group C). Clinical follow-up data show that the histologic classification correlates with patient survival. Thus, meticulous histologic evaluation is of critical importance in determining the prognosis and guiding the management of patients with goblet cell carcinoids. This brief review summarizes these recent findings and raises a few issues that may need to be further addressed to better apply this classification to our practice.",

Since its launch and its implementation as diagnostic test in 1994, temporal patterns in patients' age and serum PSA level at presentation have changed, with younger patients being diagnosed at lower PSA cutoff levels. Many studies suggest that PSA screening has resulted in a profound downward migration in clinical and pathologic stage of newly diagnosed PCA, although the effect has slowed in the most recent years. The impact on tumor grading is less clear. Histologic grading of PCA, based on the Gleason system, is predictive of the biological behavior and prognosis of the tumor. If tumor progresses from low grade to high grade, the early detection would lead to a higher percentage of low-grade disease diagnosed over time. However, published data suggest that tumor grade shifts have occurred over time and are unlikely to be attributable to changes in tumor biology, but rather to changes in practice with respect to Gleason grading. This review will address PCA staging and grading trends from the pre-PSA era to the present time with emphasis on the potential role played by changes in clinical and pathologic practice.",

These tumors are relatively rare and have variable prognostic and therapeutic implications. Primary mucinous (colloid) adenocarcinoma of the prostate is defined as prostatic adenocarcinoma with mucinous differentiation involving 25% or more of the entire tumor. Another primary tumor of the prostate that may have mucinous features is primary mucin-producing urothelial-type adenocarcinoma of the prostate (mucinous prostatic urethral adenocarcinoma). Primary mucin-producing urothelial-type adenocarcinoma of the prostate is a distinct entity that typically arises from the prostatic urethra possibly from urethritis glandularis or glandular metaplasia with malignant transformation, and it is analogous to adenocarcinoma with mucinous differentiation arising from the urinary bladder. Signet ring cell tumors of the prostate, though rare, may also have mucinous features. Secondary tumors with mucinous differentiation that may involve the prostate include adenocarcinomas of the urinary bladder and colorectum. Pathologists should also be aware of mucin-producing tumor-like lesions involving the prostate, including mucinous metaplasia, and benign Cowper glands that may mimic malignancy. Herein we present an updated and comprehensive review of the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, molecular, and prognostic features of mucinous tumors and tumor-like lesions involving the prostate gland, with emphasis on mucinous prostatic adenocarcinoma and its mimickers, including potential diagnostic pitfalls.",

As a result, HER2 testing is now recommended for all patients with advanced or metastatic disease, although there is still some debate as to the optimal methods of assessment. HER2 expression in gastric and GEJ tumors shows several differences compared with breast tumors and, for this reason, the proposed criteria for scoring HER2 expression in biopsies and resections of gastric and GEJ carcinomas differ from those used in breast carcinomas.

    "abstract": "Composite hemangioendotheliomas are rare vascular neoplasms of intermediate biological potential, characterized by a complex admixture of benign, low-grade malignant, and malignant vascular components. They can affect both adults and children, and occur predominantly as long-standing lesions in the dermis and subcutis of the extremities, but have also been increasingly reported at other sites, including the oral cavity and in viscera such as kidney and spleen. These usually behave in a low-grade manner, with a relatively high rate of local recurrence and rarely lymph node and distant metastases, but no tumor-related deaths have been reported. Microscopically these are heterogenous neoplasms with merging of different vascular patterns, which immunohistochemically variably express vascular endothelial markers. Because of the wide morphologic spectrum, they can be difficult to recognize, but accurate diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment and prognostication. We review the literature, discussing clinical and histopathologic features, and the differential diagnosis of these rare tumors.",

For example, different dysplastic phenotypes have been identified, in addition to the traditional adenomatous type, foveolar, pyloric, and tubule-neck dysplasia (associated with diffuse type carcinoma) have been recognized. Each subtype of dysplasia shows a different immunohistochemical profile, and may vary in their risk of progression to adenocarcinoma. With regard to early gastric cancer the emergence of better diagnostic techniques allowed the development of endoscopic techniques such as endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal resection that nowadays allow optimal nonsurgical management.

    "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinomas of the lower anogenital tract that are related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection represent a significant disease burden worldwide. The diagnosis and management of their noninvasive precursors has been the subject of extensive study and debate over several decades, accompanied by an evolving understanding of HPV biology. Recent new consensus recommendations for the pathologic diagnosis of these precursor lesions were published in 2012, the result of the Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology project cosponsored by the College of American Pathologists and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology. Most salient among the new guidelines are the recommendation to switch to a 2-tiered nomenclature (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) rather than the traditional 3-tiered \"intraepithelial neoplasia\" terminology, and the recommendation to expand use of the immunohistochemical marker p16 to distinguish between low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/intraepithelial neoplasia 2. The goals of the project were to align diagnostic terminology with our knowledge of HPV biology, increase reproducibility, consolidate diverse systems of nomenclature, and ultimately better determine a patient's true cancer risk. The clinical guidelines for screening and management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia have also been recently updated, most notably with a lengthening of screening intervals. In this review, we focus on the new guidelines put forth for pathologic diagnosis of HPV-related anogenital neoplasia, with discussion of the evidence behind them and their potential implications. We also provide an update on relevant biomarkers, clinical recommendations, and the newest developments relating to cervical neoplasia.",

    "abstract": "Polyps of the gastrointestinal tract are very common lesions and most frequently sporadic in nature. Some polyp subtypes are associated with rare hereditary polyposis syndromes, including juvenile polyposis syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and Cowden syndrome. However, many sporadic benign lesions of the gastrointestinal tract can mimic some of these syndromic hamartomatous polyps. The role of the surgical pathologist is to raise the possibility of a hereditary condition in case of suggestive polyp histology and to look for clinical information to support the suspected diagnosis. In this review, the clinical presentation and the pathology associated with these rare hamartomatous polyposis syndromes are discussed in an attempt to provide pathologists clues in suggesting one such syndrome on the basis of histologic findings and clinical context. Identification of affected individuals is important because of the increased gastrointestinal and other malignancies. Recently, new adenomatous polyposis syndromes have been discovered, expanding the genetic causes of patient diagnosed with multiple colonic adenomas. By being aware of the clinical phenotype and the tumor spectrum associated with gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes, surgical pathologists can play a critical role in recommending genetic counseling when suspicious of such a diagnosis. This may lead to the identification of a genetic cause and appropriate surveillance of affected family members to screen for associated malignancies.",

    "abstract": "It has long been known that some cancers have the propensity to metastasize to certain organs thus creating a nonrandom distribution of sites for distant relapse, a phenomenon known as \"metastatic organotropism.\" Some of these examples include ovary primary to abdominal cavity, prostate primary to bone, and pancreas primary to liver. In contrast, other tumor types, such as mammary and renal cell carcinoma, can relapse in multiple organs although approximately half of advanced breast cancers metastasize to bone. On the other hand gene expression profiling studies have identified various breast cancer classes with prognostic significance. Recent studies have revealed that breast cancer subtypes differ not only in primary tumor characteristics but also in their metastatic behavior. In particular, the luminal tumors are remarkable for their significant bone-seeking phenotype; the HER2 subtype demonstrates a significant liver-homing characteristic; whereas so-called triple-negative breast cancers predispose to lung metastases. These findings suggest that this knowledge could potentially be utilized in the development of effective disease surveillance strategies in the pursuit of precision medicine, thus necessitating further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The eye and periorbital soft tissue are derived from the neuroectodermal neural crest, leading to a wide range of tumor types that arise at this site. The uveal tract (iris, ciliary body, and choroid) normally contains melanocytes, and thus both benign nevi and malignant melanoma can arise there, the choroid being the most frequent site. Uveal melanoma (UM) in adults and retinoblastoma (in young children) are the 2 most common primary intraocular malignancies. Retinoblastoma is the most common eye cancer worldwide, but the most common ocular cancer in the United States and Europe is UM. This review will focus on UM and will include the epidemiology, pathologic findings, prognosis and treatment, and review of ongoing molecular discoveries aimed at elucidating the pathways that could lead to adjuvant therapy. These tumors are not uncommon to dedicated ocular pathologists and may occasionally be encountered by general pathologists as well. First, a short word about metastases to the uveal tract is in order, because of its importance in the differential diagnosis. Although the most common primary malignancy in the adult eye is UM, the most frequent adult intraocular malignancy identified in autopsy studies is metastatic carcinoma to the uveal tract. Metastases usually occur late, and the eye is thus rarely enucleated in this setting. However it is important to be aware of this as sometimes, the ophthalmologist cannot determine clinically if an amelanotic tumor represents melanoma or metastasis, possibly from an unknown primary. Shields and colleagues reported on their experience and found that the most common primary sites for uveal metastasis are breast, followed by lung, and then the gastrointestinal tract. Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin or more specific markers such as CK7, CK20, TTF-1, BRST-2, CDX2, and PSA may be helpful if there is no known primary. Metastases to the eye also occur in the orbit, eyelid, and rarely to the retina.",

    "abstract": "Major driver mutations of pulmonary adenocarcinomas have been identified and highlighted as actionable targets for precision cancer medicine. As phenotype is largely determined by genotype, genetic changes associated with morphologic features have recently received more attention from both pathologists and clinicians. The morphologic features of adenocarcinomas with mutations in EGFR or KRAS , or translocated ALK , have rarely been described. Pulmonary adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations, the most common driver mutation encountered in Asian patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, show lepidic or papillary organotypic growth patterns. KRAS -mutated adenocarcinomas demonstrate nonorganotypic growth patterns, especially mucin-containing cells. P53 mutations are associated with aggressiveness rather than growth patterns. HER2 mutations are observed in mucinous adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma with micropapillary features. The histologic features of BRAF -mutated adenocarcinomas have not yet been established, but papillary, lepidic, solid, and acinar patterns have been observed. Adenocarcinomas with rearrangement of ALK , ROS1 , and RET genes share similar histologic features, such as solid signet-ring cells and cribriform formation. However, adenocarcinomas with NRG1 rearrangements frequently show mucinous morphology. The histologic features and related mutations of adenocarcinomas with expression of programmed cell death-1 and programmed cell death ligands-1 may be helpful in guiding immunotherapeutic treatment. This review describes histopathologic features of adenocarcinomas and their correlation with molecular alterations.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequently diagnosed noninvasively with imaging techniques. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging play critical roles in the detection, diagnosis, and staging of HCC. Standardization in the interpretation and reporting of imaging modalities has not existed until recently. In 2008, the American College of Radiology supported the development of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) for standardized terminology, interpretation, and reporting of imaging examinations for the diagnosis of HCC inpatients at risk for HCC. This article reviews the basic concepts of LI-RADS, emphasizing aspects that are most relevant to pathologists, including the categories, diagnostic algorithm, major features, and ancillary features for the diagnosis of HCC. The similarities and differences between LI-RADS and other major radiology-based diagnostic systems in terms of target population, intended users, categorization of observations, and imaging methods are addressed. Importantly, LI-RADS and other systems are designed to diagnose progressed HCC with high specificity and modest sensitivity. LI-RADS and other systems are not designed to detect early HCC and so have limited sensitivity for such lesions. Moreover, despite continuous advances in imaging technology, imaging detection and characterization of small (<1 cm) nodules remains limited; in addition, colocalization of small nodules and pathology is difficult. For these reasons LI-RADS and most other systems require lesions to be 1 cm or greater for the noninvasive diagnosis of HCC. As LI-RADS evolves, it is critical that stakeholders, including pathologists, provide expert input to help standardize and enhance reporting of radiologic findings.",

    "abstract": "The increased prevalence of BRAF mutations in thyroid carcinoma and primary cutaneous melanoma (PCM) hint that dysregulation of BRAF might contribute to the noted association between PCM and thyroid carcinoma. A recent study evaluating the rate of BRAFV600E mutations among patients who had been diagnosed with primary papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and PCM showed that patients with either PCM or PTC were at an increased risk of developing the other as a second primary malignant neoplasm. Furthermore, the authors noted that samples from patients suffering from both malignancies exhibited a higher rate of incidence of the BRAFV600E mutation, compared with patients not suffering from both malignancies. These studies support the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of these 2 malignancies might share a conserved molecular pattern associated with dysregulation of the BRAF protein. One mechanism through which BRAF might contribute to PCM and thyroid carcinoma progression is through induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Specifically, the Snail/E-cadherin axis has been demonstrated as a pathway dysregulated by BRAF, leading to EMT in both malignancies. Our analysis focuses on the results of these recent investigations, and through a review of select molecules relevant to EMT, looks to provide a context by which to better understand the relevance and role of stromal-parenchymal signaling and the BRAF mutation in the pathogenesis of PTC and PCM.",

The term “atypical hepatocellular neoplasm” has been advocated for these tumors, but a number of other terms, including “atypical adenoma,” “hepatocellular neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential,” and “well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasm with atypical or borderline features” have also been proposed.

In Europe, the incidence of BCC ranges from 44.6 to 128 cases per 100,000 inhabitants annually, whereas in the United States, the yearly incidence rate ranges between 500 and 1500. The global incidence has been calculated to be as high as 10 million cases of BCC per year. There are 2 main clinical patterns of BCC-the familial BCC in basal cell nevus syndrome and sporadic BCC. The etiology of cutaneous BCC is usually the result of the interaction between solar ultraviolet radiation and genetic factors. Somatic or germline mutations in the effector components of the hedgehog signaling pathway (ie, PTCH1, PTCH2, SMO or SUFU genes) are responsible for ∼90% of the cases of both sporadic and familial BCC, all causing a constitutive activation of the hedgehog pathway. Cutaneous BCC very rarely metastasizes, and diagnosis in metastatic sites can be very difficult. Metastatic BCC has weakly effective therapeutic options with a poor prognosis until few years ago. In 2012, small-molecule therapies, involving inactivation of the hedgehog signaling pathway, and capable of reducing tumor growth and progression have been introduced into clinical practice for advanced (locally advanced or metastatic) BCC. We performed a comprehensive literature review on metastatic BCC and found at least 915 cases reported to date. In addition, we extensively discussed the differential diagnosis of metastatic BCC, and outlined the advances in clinical therapeutics involving these small molecules.",

There are 3 commonly recognized types of renal hypoplasia, simple hypoplasia, oligomeganephronic hypoplasia (oligomeganephronia) and segmental hypoplasia (Ask-Upmark kidney). They have in common a reduction in the number of renal lobes. A fourth type, not widely recognized, is cortical hypoplasia where nephrogenesis is normal but there is a reduction in the number of nephron generations. Recently there has been great interest in milder degrees of reduced nephron mass, known as oligonephronia because of its association with risk of adult-onset hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Since the last pathology review of this topic was published by Jay Bernstein in 1968, an update of the renal pathology findings in renal hypoplasia is provided with a review of 18 new cases. The renal hypoplasias are then framed within the modern concept of oligonephronia, its diverse causes and prognostic implications.",

There has been a wider recognition of IDCP by practicing pathologists since its recognition as a separate category in the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification of tumours of the prostate gland. However, there is also a lack of clarity regarding the diagnosis and reporting of IDCP, which has been compounded by divergent expert recommendations regarding the grading of invasive prostate cancers associated with an intraductal component. The International Society of Urological Pathologists (ISUP) recommends that the IDCP component should be incorporated into the Gleason score, while the Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) recommends excluding it when grading prostate cancer. This review seeks to clarify some of these issues and outline a pragmatic approach to reporting IDCP, particularly in needle biopsies. Diagnostic issues and terminology for lesions falling short of IDCP but exceeding that of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia are discussed. The management of patients whose prostate biopsies show only IDCP without an associated invasive component is controversial. Some experts recommend radical therapy, while others recommend prompt repeat biopsy. An alternative clinicopathologic approach that takes into consideration the extent, histomorphology, and location (with respect to a radiologic abnormality) of IDCP, as well as radiologic features, is outlined.",

    "abstract": "Among all sarcoma types, liposarcoma is the most common sarcoma that develops \"dedifferentiation.\" Since its initial description by Dr Harry Evans, the spectrum of what is now acceptably included under the rubric of \"dedifferentiated liposarcoma\" (DL) has expanded, sometimes supported by cytogenetic and molecular advances. Similarly, the range of morphologic appearances considered to represent the precursor of DL, atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT)/well-differentiated liposarcoma, also has broadened, not uncommonly creating variants with significant, almost indistinguishable, morphologic overlap with occasional forms of DL, especially problematic in small biopsy specimens. More specifically, the precise criteria separating cellular forms of ALT from what some consider \"low-grade\" variants of DL remains controversial and inconsistently applied, even among individual pathologists within institutions. For this separation, the only objective and reproducible criteria historically shown to accurately predict a statistically significant difference in prognosis and survival is mitotic rate, alone or incorporated into a histologic grade [eg, Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC)], consistently identifying a higher grade neoplasm capable of metastases. While DL may have a better prognosis than other nonmyoid adult pleomorphic soft tissue sarcomas, definitive conclusions are difficult to establish due to nonuniform criteria for staging and establishing tumor size/volume of the high-grade component, compounded by variable definitions and thresholds for rendering the diagnosis of DL. If appropriate therapeutic approaches are to be applied to DL, there needs to uniform agreement regarding the histologic definition, grading, and staging of DL. Herein, is a comprehensive historical perspective on DL and ALT/well-differentiated liposarcoma, seeking to provide insights, updates, and a proposal for uniform, evidence-based guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Since neither the clinical manifestations nor the morphologic features of inflammatory bowel disease are pathognomonic alone, the differential diagnosis to consider is relatively broad, and it relies on the synthesis of clinical, endoscopic, and microscopic features. Long-held histologic diagnostic principles include recognizing structural and inflammatory features of chronicity, that is, architectural distortion, basal plasmacytosis, and expansion of the lamina propria lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. In addition, evaluation of the neutrophilic inflammation and related crypt and epithelial destruction is essential to gauge the activity of the disease. Nevertheless, these features can be difficult to confirm in special settings, including at the inception of the disease or in partially treated cases. This review will explore the classic morphologic features of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, followed by a detailed discussion of atypical and diagnostically challenging presentations and a brief review of the clinical aspects necessary for the daily practice of pathologists.",

    "abstract": "The upper gastrointestinal (UGI) manifestations of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are frequently obscured by classic ileal and colonic symptoms and are reported to involve only 0.5% to 4% of adult patients. However, because of the improvement of endoscopic techniques and the growing use of esophagogastroduodenososcopy with biopsy, both asymptomatic and clinically significant esophageal, gastric, and duodenal manifestations are increasingly recognized. The UGI involvement in IBD was historically synonymous with Crohn’s disease (CD), but the doctrine of ulcerative colitis (UC) being limited to the colon has been challenged, and UC-related gastroduodenal lesions have been reported. The diagnosis of UGI IBD should ideally rely on a combination of the clinical history, endoscopic picture, and histologic features. Although endoscopic changes such as aphthoid or longitudinal ulcers and bamboo-joint-like pattern are suggestive of CD, histologic evaluation increases the sensitivity of the IBD diagnosis since histologic alterations may be present in endoscopically unremarkable mucosa. Conversely, in many cases, the histologic findings are nonspecific, and the knowledge of clinical history is vital for reaching an accurate diagnosis. The presence of epithelioid granuloma is highly suggestive of CD but is present in a minority of CD cases; thus, pathologists should be aware of how to diagnose UGI IBD in the absence of granulomata. This article reviews the most important clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features of IBD-associated esophagitis, gastritis, and duodenitis, as well as the IBD-related manifestations in the biliary tract and the postcolectomy setting.",

    "abstract": "This review focuses on the heterogenous group of clear cell neoplasms of salivary glands and attempts to identify major differential diagnostic features. Within the head and neck region, clear cells are found most commonly in salivary gland tumors, but may also be seen in tumors of squamous or odontogenic epithelial origin, primary or metastatic carcinomas, benign or malignant melanocytic lesions, or benign or malignant mesenchymal tumors. Clear cells occur fairly commonly among a wide variety of salivary gland neoplasms, but mostly they constitute only a minor component of the tumor cell population. Clear cells represent a major diagnostic feature in two salivary gland neoplasms, epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma and hyalinizing clear cell carcinoma. In addition, salivary gland neoplasms composed predominantly of clear cells could also include clear cell variants of other salivary neoplasms, such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma and myoepithelial carcinoma, but their tumor type-specific histologic features may only be available in limited nonclear cell areas of the tumor. Diagnosing predominantly clear cell salivary gland tumors is difficult because the immunoprofiles and morphologic features may overlap and the same tumor entity may also have a wide range of other histologic presentations. Many salivary gland tumors are characterized by tumor type-specific genomic alterations, particularly gene fusions of the ETV6 gene in secretory carcinoma, the MYB and MYBL1 genes in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the MAML2 gene in mucoepidermoid carcinoma, the EWSR1 gene in hyalinizing clear cell carcinoma, and others. Thus, along with conventional histopathologic examination and immunoprofiling, molecular and genetic tests may be important in the diagnosis of salivary gland clear cell tumors by demonstrating genetic alterations specific to them.",

    "abstract": "DICER1 syndrome is a tumor predisposition syndrome in which patients are at an increased risk of developing a wide variety of benign and malignant neoplasms with a hallmark constellation of pediatric pleuropulmonary blastoma, cystic nephroma, and thyroid lesions. DICER1 encodes an RNA endoribonuclease that is crucial to the processing of microRNA and may play a role in the maturation of Müllerian tissue. Within the gynecologic tract, germline mutations in DICER1 are associated with an array of rare tumors, including Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the cervix, gynandroblastoma, and juvenile granulosa cell tumor, which typically present in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. In addition, somatic DICER1 mutations have been described in rare gynecologic tumors such as adenosarcoma, Sertoli cell tumor, ovarian fibrosarcoma, cervical primitive neuroectodermal tumor, carcinosarcoma, and germ cell tumors. In light of the significant association with multiple neoplasms, genetic counseling should be considered for patients who present with a personal or family history of these rare DICER1-associated gynecologic tumors. This review highlights the most current understanding of DICER1 genetic alterations and describes the clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features and differential diagnoses for gynecologic tumors associated with DICER1 mutation.",

In addition, it can represent a diagnostic challenge when it has an uncommon presentation (ie, paraneoplastic syndrome or incidental finding) or when it has confounding histologic features. Ancillary testing, including immunohistochemical stains, in situ hybridization for CDKN2A or NF2 , and molecular studies, in selected cases, allows its correct diagnosis. The molecular landscape of PeM is still a work in progress; however, some findings, such as ALK gene rearrangements and EWSR1/FUS-ATF1 fusions, are specifically seen in PeM of young patients. The biological behavior of PeM is variable; however, cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy have markedly improved the survival of patients affected by this disease.",

As of such, these lesions demand careful histologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic characterization to provide the clinical team with a detailed report taking into account the anticipated prognosis and risk of syndromic/inherited disease. While no histologic algorithm, immunohistochemical biomarker, or molecular aberration single-handedly can identify potentially lethal cases upfront, the combined analysis of various risk parameters may stratify PPGL patients more stringently than previously. Moreover, the novel 2022 WHO Classification of Endocrine and Neuroendocrine Tumors also brings some new concepts into play, not least the reclassification of special neuroendocrine neoplasms (cauda equina neuroendocrine tumor and composite gangliocytoma/neuroma-neuroendocrine tumor) previously thought to belong to the spectrum of PPGL.

It forms a circumscribed firm tumor, usually in deep soft tissue, with a variety of histologic patterns and cytologic features, including cords and nests of cells, some of which are vacuolated. The ultrastructure and immunophenotype indicate epithelial differentiation and parachordomas are additionally S-100 protein positive. This tumor is distinct from extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma and probably from soft tissue myoepithelioma. While histologically it somewhat resembles chordoma, parachordoma has a wider range of appearances, and the two neoplasms differ in their detailed cytokeratin immunophenotype and their clinical behavior. Parachordoma is a slowly growing tumor with occasional late recurrence; cases with reported metastasis have not been histologically convincing.

Polymerase chain reaction is currently the most sensitive method for HPV detection and an excellent research tool. However, because of frequent contamination problems and lack of standardization, it is not readily applicable to diagnostic laboratories. The recent improvements in in situ hybridization have made it possible for this method to become the most appropriate method for routine detection of HPVs in tissue. At present, however, the use of at least two independent HPV DNA detection methods is indispensable for accurate determination of HPVs.",

In this article, the various reported concepts and terminology of these mucus-producing pancreatic tumors are summarized, and the differences between intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors and mutinous cystic tumors are specifically discussed. Intraductal papillary-mutinous tumors show diffuse or segmental dilatation of the pancreatic ducts with intraductal papillary growth. Mucinous cystic tumors are mucus-producing tumors showing cyst formation, which is often accompanied by intracystic papillary projections and \"ovarian-type\" stroma. Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors occur most often in the pancreatic head of elderly men, whereas mucinous cystic tumors typically occur in the pancreatic tail or body of middle-aged women. Histologically, these tumors show a wide cytologic spectrum from benign to borderline to malignant. These tumors pursue an indolent clinical course compared with conventional ductal carcinoma of the pancreas. Mucinous cystadenocarcinomas have a higher malignant potential than intraductal papillary-mucinous adenocarcinomas, yet these tumors recur infrequently if they are excised completely. Because of the differences in clinicopathologic features, these tumors should be clearly separated from conventional ductal carcinoma of the pancreas.",

However, pathologic diagnosis of individual SCST is still based largely on morphologic criteria. Alpha-inhibin immunohistochemical (IHC) staining should be used only when a difficult morphologic diagnosis is encountered. In this perspective, α-inhibin and other properly selected markers should be ordered at the same time. This is simply because α-inhibin is not specific for SCSTs. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of α-inhibin-positive cells, because a wide variety of primary and metastatic ovarian tumors may contain significant numbers of α-inhibin-positive stromal cells. As with other immunohistochemical stains, a panel of stains and comparison with the corresponding hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides is necessary, especially when staining patterns and cellular localization are in question. The antibody will not help to differentiate tumors within the category of SCST. The pattern or the intensity of staining in SCSTs does not predict tumor behavior, although there is a tendency of loss of α-inhibin expression in poorly differentiated Sertoli or Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. In cases where metastatic granulosa or Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are a concern, positive α-inhibin staining is diagnostic, but a negative result does not rule out metastatic disease. Calretinin has been recently recognized as a more sensitive, but less specific marker for SCSTs and it may be used to recognize an inhibin-negative SCST. In this review, we have listed nine of the most commonly encountered clinical scenarios where α-inhibin and other markers could be used in diagnostic surgical pathology of ovarian tumors.",

Loss of function or loss of expression of this molecule due to mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene has been shown to be a key feature of the diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma. Of interest, in gastric adenocarcinoma showing a mixed diffuse and intestinal pattern, loss of E-cadherin is confined to the former component. In the breast, infiltrating lobular carcinoma, characterized by a diffuse permeative growth of neoplastic cells, has similarly been shown to exhibit loss of E-cadherin. Thus the molecular alteration (loss of E-cadherin) provides a plausible explanation for the observed morphologic phenotype of these two tumor types. Finally, rare families characterized by germline mutations in the E-cadherin gene have been shown to be strongly predisposed to the development of gastric cancer (diffuse-type) and/or infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast.",

    "abstract": "The classification of flat urothelial (transitional cell) lesions with atypia has historically varied in its application from institution to institution with no fewer than six major nomenclature systems proposed in the past 25 years. In 1998, the World Health Organization/ International Society of Urological Pathology (WHO/ISUP) published a consensus classification that included the following categories for flat urinary bladder lesions: reactive atypia, atypia of unknown significance, dysplasia (low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia), and carcinoma in situ (high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia). This classification expands the definition traditionally used for urothelial carcinoma in situ, basing its diagnosis primarily on the severity of cytologic changes. In proposing the classification system for flat lesions of the bladder with atypia, it was hoped that consistent use of uniform diagnostic terminology would ultimately aid in a better understanding of the biology of these lesions. In this review, the authors discuss the history of the concept of flat urothelial neoplasia, the rationale and histologic criteria for the WHO/ISUP diagnostic categories, an approach to the diagnosis of flat lesions, and problems and pitfalls associated with their recognition in routine surgical pathology specimens.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a serious, life-threatening genetic disease in which extensive epithelial-lined cysts develop in the kidneys and, to a lesser extent, in other organs such as liver, pancreas, and ovaries. In a majority of cases (80-85%), the gene involved is PKD1, which is located on chromosome 16 (16q13.3) and encodes polycystin-1, a large receptor-like integral membrane protein that contains several extracellular motifs indicative of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction. In the remaining (10-15%) cases, the disease is milder and is caused by mutational changes in another gene (PKD2), which is located at chromosome 4 (4q21-23) and encodes polcystin-2, a transmembrane protein, which acts as a nonspecific calcium-permeable channel. Both polycystins function together in a nonredundant fashion, through a common pathway, and produce cellular responses that regulate proliferation, migration, differentiation, and kidney morphogenesis. Through combined function of polycystins, normal tubular cells are maintained in a state of terminal differentiation, and their proliferation is strictly controlled. Loss of function of either protein due to gene mutations results in the tubular cells reverting to a less differentiated state, which is more prone to proliferation. Patients with ADPKD carry a germ-line mutation in PKD1 or PKD2. A second somatic mutation in some of the tubular cells results in loss of both normal alleles, leading to loss of polycystin function. The affected cells lose the normal terminally differentiated state, revert to less differentiated phenotype, and undergo proliferation, which leads to cyst formation. As the cysts enlarge over many decades, the normal renal parenchyma is progressively destroyed, leading to renal failure. Recently, the crucial role of primary cilia in modulating proliferation, migration, and differentiation of tubular epithelium has been recognized. Most of the tubular cells have one or two primary cilia projecting from the apical surface into the luminal space. The cilia act as mechanoreceptors as they bend with the urinary flow within the tubules. Both polycystins are strategically located within the cilia and act as important mediators of ciliary mechanosensation. Loss of this important function due to mutational changes in PKD1 or PKD2 leads to loss of normal control over cellular proliferation, resulting in cyst formation. Several other ciliary proteins have recently been found to contribute directly to a wide spectrum of human kidney diseases with cystic phenotype, thus underscoring the pivotal role the primary cilia play in maintaining the normal structure and function of the tubular cells and probably other cells in the body.",

    "abstract": "In recent years there have been a plethora of publications regarding the value of immunohistochemical studies in diagnosis in gynecological pathology. In many instances, papers are published initially that suggest that a certain antibody or panel of antibodies is of value in the diagnosis of a particular neoplasm and in the distinction of this from mimics. However, this is usually quickly followed by other studies that somewhat contradict these findings. The aim of this review is to present a critical appraisal of the value of immunohistochemical studies in the diagnosis of uterine neoplasms with emphasis on the recent literature. It is stressed that immunohistochemistry is necessary in relatively few cases and a knowledge of the potential immunoreactivity of utilized antibodies is required. With regard to endometrial carcinoma, topics discussed in this review include antibodies of value in the distinction between type 1 and type 2 carcinoma, in the characterization of focal serous proliferations in endometrial polyps and non-polypoid endometrium, in the sometimes problematic distinction between an endometrial and an endocervical adenocarcinoma, and in the distinction between a uterine and ovarian serous carcinoma. The value of CD10 as a proposed marker of mesonephric adenocarcinoma is also discussed. With regard to uterine mesenchymal neoplasms, a critical appraisal of the value of relatively new antibodies, including CD10 and h-caldesmon, in distinguishing between a smooth muscle and an endometrial stromal neoplasm is discussed as is the immunophenotype of two rare uterine mesenchymal neoplasms, uterine tumor resembling ovarian sex cord tumor (UTROSCT) and perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa).",

    "abstract": "The success of the routine Papanicolaou (pap) smear in reducing the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer has been chronicled extensively. Unfortunately, endometrial cancer, the most common malignancy of the gynecologic tract, continues to lack a screening modality of comparable efficacy. It is generally accepted that the Papanicolau test has a low sensitivity for detecting endometrial disease. Nonetheless, it remains true that endometrial cells are not uncommonly identified on routine cervicovaginal smears and along with each case comes an associated responsibility for pathologists to assess cytologic features, assign a potential clinical significance, and make a decision on reporting this finding. When endometrial cells with an entirely normal cytologic appearance are identified on an otherwise unremarkable cervicovaginal smear, the central question raised is whether such cells are exfoliating physiologically or whether their exfoliation is pathologic in response to an underlying endometrial disease. Additionally, in the former scenario, could subsets of patients be defined in which the reporting of this finding is deemed unnecessary in the cytologic report? In this contribution, we explore the clinical significance of finding normal endometrial cells in cervicovaginal smears based on a review of the medical literature of the last half-century. The historical and evidentiary basis for the Bethesda 2001 recommendations, which calls for the reporting of cytologically benign endometrial cells only in patients 40 years and older, is reviewed in detail.",

The significance of this distinction is paramount in preventing unwarranted surgery and untoward consequences for the patient.",

It is an outgrowth of studies using comparative genomic hybridization, a technique capable of surveying the entire genome for DNA copy number changes.

Since then, a number of studies have been published, supporting the high accuracy of FISH for diagnosing melanoma. In addition, various clinicopathological settings where FISH may be particularly useful are explored. FISH tests for melanoma are now commercially available. Meanwhile, questions have been raised by some about the true diagnostic value of FISH, particularly in melanocytic lesions with ambiguous histopathology.

    "abstract": "PAX2 is a member of the PAX family of transcription factors that, together with PAX8, is involved in the regulation of the organogenesis of the kidney and the Müllerian system. Recent investigations have demonstrated that, among tumors, PAX2 is commonly expressed in epithelial tumors of the kidney and female genital tract. Although PAX2 expression has also been reported in B-cell lymphomas and rhabdomyosarcomas, especially alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, it has been suggested that the positivity in these tumors was most probably due to a cross-reactivity of the anti-PAX2 antibody used in those investigations with other members of the PAX protein family. An analysis of published studies indicates that PAX2 sensitivity for epithelial renal neoplasms and epithelial tumors of the female genital tract is lower than that of PAX8. In contrast to the latter marker, however, PAX2 does not appear to be expressed in epithelial tumors of the thyroid gland or thymus. Because of its restricted expression, PAX2 has proved to be a useful immunohistochemical marker with a wide range of diagnostic applications in surgical pathology, some of which will be briefly reviewed.",

The current fourth edition of the World Health Organization of lymphoid neoplasms, in large part, adopted criteria proposed for WM at a consensus conference in 2002. WM is defined as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma involving the bone marrow associated with a serum immunoglobulin (Ig) M paraprotein of any concentration. Morphologically, WM is composed of a variable mixture of lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Immunophenotypically, the neoplastic cells express monotypic IgM and light chain: B lymphocytes express pan-B-cell antigens and surface Ig are usually negative for CD5 and CD10; and plasma cells are typically positive for CD138, CD38, CD45, cytoplasmic Ig, and CD19 (in a substantial subset of cases). The putative cell of origin of WM is a postantigen selected memory B-cell that has undergone somatic hypermutation. The most common cytogenetic abnormality in WM is del(6q), usually in the region 6q23-24.3, present in 40% to 50% of cases. IGH gene translocations are rare and recurrent chromosomal translocations or gene aberrations have not been identified in WM. Here, we provide a historical perspective of WM, review clinical and pathologic aspects of the disease as it is currently defined, and discuss some practical issues in the differential diagnosis of WM that pathologists encounter in the signout of cases.",

    "abstract": "Radiation-induced cutaneous vascular neoplasms occur infrequently and comprise benign, so-called atypical vascular lesions (AVL) and angiosarcomas (AS), often being high-grade malignant tumors. Both arise most frequently within previously irradiated skin in breast-conserving-treated mammary cancer patients. Because of the different clinical course and, consequently, different therapeutic approaches, histopathologic distinction of AVL and AS is essential but significant morphologic overlap has been documented. Furthermore, the coexistence of these lesions or progression of AVL into AS has rarely been reported. Whether AVL is a precursor of AS is much debated and unresolved to date. Recent interest has focused on genetic changes and their differences in AS and AVL. MYC amplification and expression of the corresponding protein has been identified in AS in comparison with AVL. Therefore, MYC fluorescent in situ hybridization and anti-MYC immunohistochemical analysis are diagnostically useful in difficult cases. Furthermore, advanced tailored treatment strategies in AS, one of the most aggressive type of sarcoma, rely on identifying genes and proteins involved in malignant angiogenesis.",

These are called Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation (OPPE) and Focused Professional Practice Evaluation (FPPE). As many pathologists work as members of a hospital medical staff, either through primary employment or contract relationships, pathology departments and groups need to have OPPE and FPPE policies in place and should be using them to evaluate physicians for competency as part of a regular cycle. There are many subtleties in the standards, and careful attention to the details of the policies will be essential. Furthermore, as credentialing and privileging decisions may be made based upon the assessments that are carried out in OPPE and FPPE, it is quite important to follow internal policies consistently. This review describes OPPE and FPPE in detail, with an analysis of the Standards and the Elements of Performance. It also provides scenarios to illustrate the concepts and charts that can be used to create OPPE and FPPE documents for a practice.",

BL is described as a monomorphic proliferation of medium-sized transformed B cells with round nuclei, clumped chromatin, basophilic cytoplasm, and squared-off cell borders, cytoplasmic vacuoles, medium-sized paracentral nucleoli, and a starry sky pattern. Translocation involving MYC is characteristic but not specific for BL. No single parameter is the gold standard for diagnosis; morphology, cytogenetics, immunophenotype, and gene expression profiles all may contribute to the diagnosis. Although neither EBV nor MYC are sufficient to cause BL there is increasing information from techniques such as complete RNA sequencing that identify essential pathways that are activated in the pathogenesis of BL. These findings suggest novel opportunities for improved therapeutic intervention.",

Individuals with loss-of-function mutations for the glypican 3 gene exhibit Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, a rare X-linked overgrowth disorder. Expression of glypican 3 mRNA and protein is normally silenced in most adult organs and may reappear during malignant transformation. In the past few years, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics of glypican 3 in hepatocellular carcinoma have been elucidated. More recently, glypican 3 has been emerging as a new diagnostic marker for germ cell tumors and especially testicular and ovarian yolk sac tumors. However, in other tumors such as renal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and melanomas, studies disagree on the level of glypican 3 expression. Finally, there is the controversial notion of glypican 3 as a tumor suppressor gene. In this review article, we update current knowledge on glypican 3 expression in normal and neoplastic tissues, evaluate its utility as a tumor marker in clinical practice, and explore its role as a novel oncofetal protein with clinical implications. Our focus is on the diagnostic value of glypican 3 in germ cell tumors and other neoplasms in addition to hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusion, glypican 3 has been proven to be a useful immunohistochemical marker in distinguishing yolk sac tumors, choriocarcinomas, and Wilms tumors from other malignancies histologically mimicking these primitive tumors. Clinically, we recommend that glypican 3 be used as part of a panel of markers in subtyping testicular germ cell tumors.",

Here, we review histologic staging and grading of urothelial carcinoma, as well as discuss many of the clinically relevant molecular markers.

Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are rarely a consideration at the time of GI biopsy examination and clinicians rarely inquire about sexual behavior at the time of initial patient interview. Although establishing a definitive STI diagnosis is not possible on histology alone, these infections are associated with inflammatory patterns that may help raise this diagnostic possibility. Becoming familiar with these patterns is necessary as worldwide outbreaks of these infections are being reported.

Although renal biopsies may be deferred in the setting of thrombotic microangiopathy, acute self-limited impairment, or slowly progressive functional decline, in many patients renal biopsy yields important diagnostic insight to guide treatment. Light microscopic, immunofluorescence, and ultrastructural analysis often reveals a number of concurrent abnormalities in glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, and vessels. Meta-analysis of the literature reveals that membranous nephropathy is the most commonly reported glomerular lesion in the setting of HCT, followed by minimal change disease. Autopsy and biopsy studies show that clinical criteria lack sensitivity and specificity for renal acute and chronic thrombotic microangiopathy. Viral infection and other causes of interstitial nephritis and tubular injury are important findings in HCT renal biopsies, which in many instances may not be clinically suspected.

    "abstract": "Very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) is a clinical umbrella classification composed of IBD-like diseases encompassing both classic IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and monogenic disorder, both arising before 6 years of age. VEO-IBD patients present significant clinical differences from IBD occurring in older children and in adults, including more severe disease, often unresponsive to conventional IBD therapy and a greater proportion of cases featuring an underlying genetic alteration. Histologic findings of gastrointestinal biopsies can show an IBD-like pattern (both Crohn's disease-like and ulcerative colitis-like pattern), an apoptotic-like and enterocolitis-like pattern. Findings of specific morphologic alterations, such as villous blunting, apoptosis, dense eosinophilic infiltrates, lack of plasma cells and severe glandular atrophy, can suggest a monogenic disorder. Moreover, individuals with monogenic disorders may develop significant problems such as primary immunodeficiency, impacting treatment options. Finally, IBD histology in childhood can differ from that in older patients and adults. This complexity makes a differential diagnosis between IBD and other pediatric diseases involving the gastrointestinal tract difficult, especially considering that histologic features can be similar between different diseases. Without an appropriate diagnosis, the clinical course of VEO-IBD has greater potential for escalated treatment regimens involving extensive surgery and more intensive medical therapies rather than specific therapy directed toward the underlying defect. For these reasons, a pattern-based histologic approach correlated with clinical and laboratory findings with a multidisciplinary approach is fundamental to reach a correct diagnosis in an adequate clinical context.",

    "abstract": "Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy that poses challenging issues regarding the diagnostic workup. Indeed, no presurgical technique or clinical parameters can reliably distinguish between adrenal cortical adenomas, which are more frequent and have a favorable outcome, and ACC, and the final diagnosis largely relies on histopathologic analysis of the surgical specimen. However, even the pathologic assessment of malignancy in an adrenal cortical lesion is not straightforward and requires a combined evaluation of multiple histopathologic features. Starting from the Weiss score, which was developed in 1984, several histopathologic scoring systems have been designed to tackle the difficulties of ACC diagnosis. Dealing with specific histopathologic variants (eg, Liss-Weiss-Bisceglia scoring system for oncocytic ACC) or patient characteristics (eg, Wieneke index in the pediatric setting), these scores remarkably improved the diagnostic workup of ACC and its subtypes. Nevertheless, cases with misleading features or discordant correlations between pathologic findings and clinical behavior still occur. Owing to multicentric collaborative studies integrating morphologic features with ancillary immunohistochemical markers and molecular analysis, ACC has eventually emerged as a multifaceted, heterogenous malignancy, and, while innovative and promising approaches are currently being tested, the future clinical management of patients with ACC will mainly rely on personalized medicine and target-therapy protocols. At the dawn of the new Fifth World Health Organization classification of endocrine tumors, this review will tackle ACC from the pathologist’s perspective, thus focusing on the main available diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tissue-tethered features and biomarkers and providing relevant clinical and molecular correlates.",

While earlier studies considered molecular subtypes to be intrinsic properties of cancer, recent data have shown molecular subtypes change as tumors progress and evolve, and often differ between histologically distinct regions of a tumor.

    "abstract": "Before the designations borderline malignancy and low malignant potential were used, the surface epithelial-stromal tumors of the ovary were simply classified into benign and malignant categories. The introduction of the borderline category of tumors has been a great advancement in classification, because it has set apart from the general group of surface epithelial cancers a subgroup with a much better prognosis, stage-for-stage, than that of conventional ovarian carcinomas. Over the last 20 years, pathologists have learned to recognize the distinctive clinicopathologic features of serous borderline tumors as well as the adverse prognostic significance of the associated invasive peritoneal lesions, whether they may represent true implants or independent primary tumors. We have urged our surgical colleagues to search for the peritoneal lesions, and sample them meticulously, and advised our fellow oncologists not to administer adjuvant therapy to patients with noninvasive implants lacking malignant epithelial cells. There is now convincing evidence in the literature that the only fatal cases of serous borderline tumors are those associated with invasive implants, and chemotherapy is indicated only for these rare tumors. It has also been demonstrated that Stage I intestinal mucinous borderline tumors and noninvasive well-differentiated mucinous carcinomas both have an almost equally good prognosis. The current treatment for pseudomyxoma peritonei is still unsatisfactory, but we have recently learned that most of the mucinous ovarian tumors associated with pseudomyxoma peritonei are secondary to similar tumors of the appendix. In the remaining cases, however, the ovarian tumor appears to be responsible for the pseudomyxoma peritonei. Borderline tumors also exist in the endometrioid, clear cell, and Brenner surface epithelial categories, but these tumors have been too rare for clear delineation of their clinical and pathologic features. Recently, some investigators have proposed to abandon the borderline category and to return to the old benign-malignant classification system by dividing unevenly the borderline tumors into a larger group of atypical proliferative epithelial cystadenomas and a smaller category of recently described but still not well-characterized noninvasive carcinomas. In the author's opinion, such a recommendation is misleading because it ignores the possibility of rare but significant behavioral exceptions on each of these two groups of tumors. Furthermore, careful tumor staging is mandatory in both instances regardless of the type of terminology used. It is hoped that by keeping the borderline designation, knowledge on this group of ovarian tumors will continue to expand as it has been until now.",

    "abstract": "Summary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare clonal disorder that consists of single or multiple mass lesions composed of cells with an abnormal Langerhans cell phenotype. Its etiology remains unknown, despite extensive searches for evidence of consistent cytogenetic abnormalities, gene rearrangements, or viral genomes. Similarly. the pathogenesis of the disease is enigmatic, although the altered expression of cytokines and cellular adhesion molecules, important for migration and homing of the activated normal Langerhans cell, may play an important role. The biologic behavior of LCH ranges from spontaneous remission to lethal dissemination, and such behavior cannot be predicted on the basis of histologic features. The presence and degree of organ dysfunction, together with the patient's age at diagnosis, remain the most reliable indicators of prognosis. Treatment of severe, refractory disease continues to be controversial and, in many cases, ineffectual. The revised classification scheme for LCH and related disorders recognizes the uncertain biological potential of LCH and its relation to other processes of dendritic and macrophage origin.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Various cervical lesions at times may be difficult to distinguish from one another on routine hematoxylin and eosin stains, and immunostaining for the proliferation-associated antigen Ki-67, using monoclonal antibody MIB-1, can aid their distinction. The reduced MIB-1 expression in atrophy and increased MIB-1 expression in dysplasia permits easy distinction between these conditions. Presence of MIB-1 in more than 15% of basal cells and/or in surface half of the epithelium favor a diagnosis of condyloma over squamous metaplasia or inflammatory changes. Normal endocervix shows MIB-1 positivity in less than 10% of the cells, but usually in more than 20% of cells in cervical adenocarcinoma. With increasing grade of dysplasia, the percentage of MIB-1 positive cells is increased, and positive cells are seen in the higher levels of the epithelium. Presence of more than 20% MIB-1 positive cells in Pap smears showing atypical cells of uncertain significance is associated with a diagnosis of dysplasia on subsequent biopsies. Cauterized tissues with dysplasia show MIB-1 expression similar to adjacent noncauterized dysplastic areas. MIB-1 expression is, therefore, useful in evaluating various cervical lesions.",

    "abstract": "Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a widely adopted procedure for the investigation of patients with mass lesions, but few studies have been published on the histologic changes resulting from the procedure. Although the effects are often minor and do not interfere with subsequent histologic diagnosis, infarction, extensive hemorrhage, and pseudomalignant changes can cause considerable problems in histologic evaluation and even lead to erroneous interpretation of benign lesions as malignancies. This article provides a comprehensive treatise on the subject, with emphasis on the thyroid, breast, lymph node, and salivary gland, the four sites on which FNA is commonly performed. The changes can be broadly classified into three groups: (a) tissue injury and repair. (b) infarction, and (c) reactive, pseudomalignant, and pseudoinvasive changes in the epithelium. Tissue injury usually takes the form of hemorrhage and hemosiderin deposit, associated with variable degrees of reparative reaction, which can occasionally be so striking that Kaposi's sarcoma or angiosarcoma is mimicked. Infarction can be focal or total and is particularly and Hurthle cell tumor. Reactive changes in the epithelium that can mimic malignancies or invasive tumors include benign implantation in or outside the fibrous capsule of benign tumors (such as thyroid follicular adenoma or mammary intraductal papilloma), epithelial displacement in benign lesions or intraductal carcinoma of the breast, reactive atypia in the benign or adenomatious epithelium (mimicking carcinoma or even angiosarcoma), and reactive epithelial or myoepithelial proliferation in salivary gland tumors. The histologic features that are helpful for recognizing the true nature of these lesions are discussed.",

Electron microscopy is useful, but immunostaining procedures offer more extensive and reliable help in reaching the correct diagnosis. Tumors histologically similar to localized fibrous tumor of the pleura have been described in a number of extraserosal locations. Some localized fibrous tumors may be true fibromas, whereas the typical pleural tumor appears to arise from the subserosal mesenchymal cell and is composed of CD34-positive cells which are more primitive in their morphology than mature fibroblasts.",

    "abstract": "Since its discovery 15 years ago, the p53 gene and its protein products have been the subjects of an almost unprecedented investigation. Justification for this lies in the critical role p53 plays as one of the cell cycle check points that control proliferation and differentiation. P53 is a tumor-suppressor gene found on chromosome 17p, and alterations (mussense mutation or deletion) within the coding sequences of gene are among the most frequent genetic changes detected in human neoplasnis. Mutation usually teads to the loss of DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory regulatory activities of the p53 nuclear phosphoprotein, with a corresponding loss of its growth suppressive activity. The tumor suppressor function of the normal gene and its wild-type (wt) p53 protein is replaced by the mutant form's oncognic properties. The mutated product of p53 is a protein with abnormal conformation, impaired DNA-binding, and a prolonged (stabilized) half-life, the latter of which results in Immunohistochemically detectable levels within nuclei in nearly all neoplasms showing p53 gene mutatin. Mutations of p53 or a complete loss of the gene is one of the important causes of failure to prevent cells from entering the S-phase of the cell cycle and malignancy. As more basic imformation of the molecular functions and cellular interactions of p53 accrues, it becomes evident that the genetic complexity of the gene and its protein products render simplistic clinical interpretations untenable. This ia especially true for prognostic or predictive screenings. Nonetheless, analysis of p53 in neoplastic or predictive states is a powerful molecular tool for dissecting the oncogenic process. In this review, we offer a contemporary assessment of the basic science and clinical status of p53.",

In the early posttransplantation period, procurement/preservation injury, non-immunologic injury to the graft during harvesting and implantation, is manifested by centrilobular hepatocyte pallor and cholestasis but rarely leads to significant graft dysfunction. Ischemic complications, such as hepatic artery thrombosis, are more serious complications and may lead to early graft loss or biliary stricture. Infectious complications generally occur in the mid-to-late period after transplantation; cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains a common pathogen. Human herpes 6 virus infection has been implicated in allograft dysfunction, but is usually seen in the setting of co-infection with CMV. De novo malignancies are emerging as a significant cause of mortality after liver transplantation; risk is cumulative, and increases with time posttransplantation. Development of such malignancies in the setting of solid organ transplantation is multifactorial, and is related to individual and regional predispositions to malignancy, pre-transplantation disease states, recipient viral status, and use and intensity of immunosuppression regimens.",

    "abstract": "Generally, gastric mucosal calcinosis (GMC) is only rarely encountered in routine biopsies. GMC may be classified as dystrophic, metastatic, or idiopathic. Metastatic calcification represents the most frequently encountered subtype, and refers to the deposition of calcium salts on largely normal tissues in the setting of an abnormal serum biochemical environment (hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and/or an elevated Ca×PO4 product). In contrast, dystrophic calcification implies calcification in inflammed, fibrotic, or otherwise altered tissue in the setting of a normal biochemical environment. The gastric mucosa, along with the kidneys and lungs, are preferential sites for metastatic calcification, a finding that has been attributed to the relative intracellular alkalinity at these sites. In addition to the wide variety of hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphatemia-causing clinical conditions, GMC has also been associated with atrophic gastritis, hypervitaminosis A, organ transplantation, gastric neoplasia, uremia with eucalcemia/euphosphatemia, and the use of aluminum-containing antacids, citrate-containing blood products, isotretinoin, and sucralfate. Although GMC has rarely been associated with epigastric pain and/or dyspepsia, most come to clinical attention owing to their accumulation of bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals or represent a postmortem finding. The precise significance or mechanistic basis for GMC remains to be elucidated. However, their presence in gastric biopsies should be reported, as they may serve as an indicator for generalized metastatic calcification, especially in organs where they may be fatal, such as the heart.

It has also been listed as a main National Patient Safety Goal for the Joint Commission Laboratory Goals. Most pathology facilities have excellent quality assurance programs and initiatives that include multiple checkpoints to ensure that specimen identity is carefully maintained. Even in the best laboratory operations, however, the potential for specimen mix-up, cross contamination, floaters, or carry-over artifacts cannot be eliminated completely. The work-up and analysis of these cases can be challenging to the pathologist for a number of reasons, including the fact that there is no standardized approach. This review discusses a standardized approach that includes clinical correlation, laboratory correlation, and laboratory analysis, potentially including a molecular DNA fingerprinting analysis. The methods and techniques behind DNA fingerprinting for tissue and sample identity are also discussed in detail.",

    "abstract": "The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a common internal organ to be involved by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related malignancies. It is the second most common site for Kaposi sarcoma after skin, and the commonest visceral site, for Kaposi sarcoma in AIDS patients. GI lymphomas have been documented in approximately 25% of AIDS patients with systemic lymphomas. Moreover, GI involvement of AIDS-lymphoma has been associated with poor prognosis and short survival. Several other malignancies that occur in the GI tract are also closely related to HIV-infected or immunosuppressed individuals; these include posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, Epstein-Barr virus-associated smooth muscle tumors, anal precancerous lesions, and squamous cell carcinoma. As a result of active antiretroviral therapy, patients infected with HIV are living longer and are consequently at increased risk for development of cancer. Therefore, it is possible that the number of AIDS-associated malignancies will rise and the pattern of tumors may change in the future. In this paper, the clinicopathologic features of GI malignancies associated with AIDS patients are reviewed and the differential diagnosis with other mimic lesions is discussed.",

Histologically it is defined by a lymphocytic lobular panniculitis and a characteristic hyaline sclerosis of the adipose tissue. Treatment is primarily medical due to exacerbation of disease by surgical intervention. A high index of suspicion, and familiarity of the histologic findings, is therefore required to make an accurate diagnosis and prevent further unwarranted diagnostic procedures.

The benefits of using the directed peer review method are unique and directed peer review detects both errors in diagnostic accuracy and precision and this detection may be used to improve practice. We utilize the Lean quality improvement A3 method of problem solving to investigate these issues. The A3 method defines surgical pathology diagnostic error and describes the current state in surgical pathology, performs root cause analysis, hypothesizes an ideal state, and provides opportunities for improvement in error reduction. Published data indicate that directed peer review practices may be used to prevent active cognitive errors that lead to patient harm. Pathologists also may use directed peer review data to target latent factors that contribute to error and improve diagnostic precision.",

Both tumors were discovered incidentally in adult patients during routine workups for other medical reasons and treated with lobectomy. On gross inspection there was no evidence of infiltration of the adjacent lung tissue. Microscopically, both lesions featured monotonous oval-shaped to spindle-shaped cells growing in a vaguely nested pattern. The cytoplasm was slightly vacuolated or granular. In 1 case there was a variable admixture with mature fat. Immunohistochemistry was negative for markers of epithelial and stromal differentiation except for vimentin. A focal reaction for CD34 was seen in 1 case. No mutation of coding sequence of VHL gene was seen in one case. Medical follow-up at 1 year was negative for tumor recurrence or metastases. The broad differential diagnosis within the spectrum of stromal lung tumor is discussed. Owing to distinctive microscopic features such as the nesting of clear cells within a vascularized background, both tumors appeared similar to hemangioblastoma, although the expected immunohistochemical profile of the latter was not fully expressed. Because of pattern of growth seen in both lesions we believe that the appellation of endobronchial, hemangioblastoma-like clear cell stromal tumor may be provisionally designed.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal neuromuscular diseases (GINMDs) comprise a heterogenous group of chronic conditions associated with impaired gut motility. These gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, differing for etiopathogenic mechanisms, pathologic lesions, and region of gut involvement, represent a relevant matter for public health, because they are very common, can be disabling, and determine major social and economic burdens. GINMDs are presumed or proven to arise as a result of a dysfunctioning GI neuromuscular apparatus, which includes myenteric ganglia (neurons and glial cells), interstitial cells of Cajal and smooth muscle cells. Despite the presence of symptoms related to gut dysmotility in the clinical phenotype of these patients, in the diagnostic setting scarce attention is usually paid to the morphologic pattern of the GI neuromuscular apparatus. It is also objectively difficult to collect full-thickness gut tissue samples from patients with GINMDs, because their disease, which can be only functional in nature, may not justify invasive diagnostic procedures as a first-line approach. As a consequence, whenever available, bioptic gut specimens, retrieved from these patients, must be regarded as a unique chance for obtaining relevant diagnostic information. On the basis of these arguments, there is an urgent need of standardized and validated histopathologic methods, aiming at overcoming the discrepancies affecting current approaches, which usually lead to conflicting definitions of normality and hamper the identification of disease-specific pathologic patterns. This review article intends to address current methodological and ontological issues in the histopathologic diagnosis of GINMDs, to foster the debate on how to discriminate normal morphology from abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "The finished sequence of the Human Genome Project, published 50 years after Watson and Crick's seminal paper on the structure of DNA, pushed human genetics into the public eye and ushered in the genomic era. A significant, if overlooked, aspect of the race to complete the genome was the technology that propelled scientists to the finish line. DNA sequencing technologies have become more standardized, automated, and capable of higher throughput. This technology has continued to grow at an astounding rate in the decade since the Human Genome Project was completed. Today, massively parallel sequencing, or next-generation sequencing (NGS), allows the detection of genetic variants across the entire genome. This ability has led to the identification of new causes of disease and is changing the way we categorize, treat, and manage disease. NGS approaches such as whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing are rapidly becoming an affordable genetic testing strategy for the clinical laboratory. One test can now provide vast amounts of health information pertaining not only to the disease of interest, but information that may also predict adult-onset disease, reveal carrier status for a rare disease and predict drug responsiveness. The issue of what to do with these incidental findings, along with questions pertaining to NGS testing strategies, data interpretation and storage, and applying genetic testing results into patient care, remains without a clear answer. This review will explore these issues and others relevant to the implementation of NGS in the clinical laboratory.",

In this review, we parse the literature on DM, NM, and desmoplastic NM, to clarify definitions and ascertain the incidence of PNI, with a view toward understanding its prognostic relevance. Neurotrophins, which represent a family of signaling peptides important to the development and maintenance of the peripheral nervous system, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PNI in select lineage-unrelated malignancies. Given this, we also detail evidence linking neurotrophins and their receptors (TrkA, RET, p75NGFR, and NCAM) to the pathogenesis of PNI in melanoma.",

The 3 women had undergone laparoscopic removal of multiple uterine leiomyomas between 1 and 6 years before the diagnoses of LPD. Laparoscopic uterine leiomyomectomies were performed on 3 occasions in patient 1, and once in patients 2 and 3 by the time a diagnosis of LPD was made. In patients 2 and 3, one of the multiple uterine leiomyomas had been qualified as mitotically active. Patients 1 and 2 received hormonal treatment before LPD was diagnosed. Malignancy was clinically and/or pathologically suspected in all the 3 cases. Patients 1 and 2 were managed conservatively. Patient 3 underwent radical hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy and omentectomy. Patients 1 and 2 belong to a rare subset of LPD that have fewer tumor nodules larger (5 to 10 cm) than typically seen. Patient 3 was classic in that she exhibited innumerable nodules measuring between a few millimeters and 1.5 cm, intraoperatively mimicking peritoneal carcinomatosis. Histopathologically, patients 1 and 2 were diagnosed as pure LPD, whereas patient 3 was diagnosed as LPD associated with endometriosis (adenomyosis type). Patients 1 and 3 had incipient foci of leiomyomatous changes in the blood vessel walls, at the site of the LPD tumors, supporting the hypothesis that these are de novo lesions arising locally and not migrated or disseminated from the previously excised or concurrent uterine smooth muscle tumors, usually seen in this context. Conceivably, laparoscopic leiomyomectomy with morcellation may play a role in the pathogenesis of this rare condition, at least in hormonally susceptible patients. Alternatively, LPD may derive from metaplastic submesothelial cells, a condition analogous to gliomatosis peritonei.",

In recent years, a growing body of literature describes a pathologic spectrum of neutrophilic infiltrates that may be seen in lupus patients. It is particularly important to recognize that neutrophilic dermatoses can be the initial manifestation of SLE in a third of patients. We were able to identify 47 patients with SLE associated with neutrophilic tissue reactions. In this review, we describe the histologic and clinical features of these cases in the hope that increased awareness of this unusual manifestation of SLE will generate prompt diagnosis and improved patient care.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive disease with considerable heterogeneity reflected in the 2008 World Health Organization classification. In recent years, genome-wide assessment of genetic and epigenetic alterations has shed light upon distinct molecular subsets linked to dysregulation of specific genes or pathways. Besides fostering our knowledge regarding the molecular complexity of DLBCL types, these studies have unraveled previously unappreciated genetic lesions, which may be exploited for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. Following the last World Health Organization classification, we have witnessed the emergence of new variants of specific DLBCL entities, such as CD30 + DLBCL, human immunodeficiency virus–related and age-related variants of plasmablastic lymphoma, and EBV + DLBCL arising in young patients. In this review, we will present an update on the clinical, pathologic, and molecular features of DLBCL incorporating recently gained information with respect to their pathobiology and prognosis. We will emphasize the distinctive features of newly described or emerging variants and highlight advances in our understanding of entities presenting a diagnostic challenge, such as T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lmphoma and unclassifiable large B-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, we will discuss recent advances in the genomic characterization of DLBCL, as they may relate to prognostication and tailored therapeutic intervention.

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of primary adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder may be challenging in routine practice. These tumors may morphologically and immunohistochemically overlap with urachal adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma. Further, their genetic background is poorly understood. We systematically searched the PubMed database for results of complex genetic evaluation of primary bladder adenocarcinoma subtypes. Subsequently, we designed our own series of bladder lesions. We evaluated 36 cases: 16 primary enteric-type adenocarcinomas, 7 urachal enteric adenocarcinomas, 3 primary mucinous/colloid adenocarcinomas, and 10 intestinal-type metaplasia/villous adenoma. Detailed clinical data were collected, and all cases were examined using targeted next-generation sequencing. On the basis of the literature, the first mutated gene in these tumors was reported to be KRAS in 11.3% of cases, followed by TERT promoter mutations in 28.5%. In addition to KRAS and TERT , other genes were also found to be frequently mutated in primary bladder adenocarcinoma, including TP53 , PIK3CA , CTNNB1 , APC , FBXW7 , IDH2 , and RB1 . In our series, the most frequent gene mutations in primary enteric-type adenocarcinomas were as follows: TP53 (56%); BRCA2 , KMT2B (both 33%); NOTCH2 , KDR , ARID1B , POLE , PTEN , KRAS (all 28%); in urachal enteric adenocarcinoma they were as follows: TP53 (86%); PTEN , NOTCH (both 43%); in primary mucinous/colloid adenocarcinomas they were as follows: KRAS , GRIN2A , AURKB (all 67%); and, in intestinal-type metaplasia/villous adenoma, they were as follows: APC , PRKDC (both 60%); ROS1 , ATM , KMT2D (all 50%). No specific mutational pattern was identified using cluster analysis for any of the groups. Herein, we describe the pathologic features and immunohistochemical staining patterns traditionally used in the differential diagnoses of glandular lesions of the bladder in routine surgical pathology. We outline the mutational landscape of these lesions as an aggregate of published data with additional data from our cohort. Although diagnostically not discriminatory, we document that the most common genetic alterations shared between these glandular neoplasms include TP53 , APC (in the Wnt pathway), and KRAS (in the MAPK pathway) mutations.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the natural history of breast cancer has evolved alongside technologies to study its genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomics landscapes. These technologies have helped decipher multiple molecular pathways dysregulated in breast cancer. First-generation ‘omics analyses considered each of these dimensions individually, but it is becoming increasingly clear that more holistic, integrative approaches are required to fully understand complex biological systems. The ‘omics represent an exciting era of discovery in breast cancer research, although important issues need to be addressed to realize the clinical utility of these data through precision cancer care. How can the data be applied to predict response to molecular-targeted therapies? When should treatment decisions be based on tumor genetics rather than histology? And with the sudden explosion of “big data” from large ‘omics consortia and new precision clinical trials, how do we now negotiate evidence-based pathways to clinical translation through this apparent sea of opportunity? The aim of this review is to provide a broad overview of ‘omics technologies used in breast cancer research today, the current state-of-play in terms of applying this new knowledge in the clinic, and the practical and ethical issues that will be central to the public discussion on the future of precision cancer care.",

    "abstract": "Advances in immunotherapy have increased the need for stratified predictive biomarkers in patients with non−small cell lung cancer. However, precise evaluation of tumor tissue-based immune biomarkers, such as programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the characteristics of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), is a challenge in clinical practice. In recent years, the digitization of whole-slide images of tissue has accelerated the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in tumor pathology and provided an opportunity to use AI tools to improve the interpretation of immune biomarkers. This review describes the current challenges in the assessment of PD-L1 scoring and TILs and demonstrates the role of AI in helping pathologists integrate PD-L1 and biomarkers of the tumor immune microenvironment. Computer-aided PD-L1 scoring is highly consistent with pathologists and reduces the variation among interobservers, providing a promising diagnostic tool in pathology clinics. In addition, applications of image analysis algorithms, in combination with multiplex staining, enable in-depth quantitative and spatial analysis of the broader tumor microenvironment. Upon combining digital pathology and AI, an automatic analysis system of PD-L1 and TILs, which was established using a set of digital staining images and deep learning algorithms, might be an effective way to overcome the challenges in the precise assessment of immune biomarkers.",

While ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma carries high mortality and adverse prognosis, most other serous lesions have better clinical behavior. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the nature and histogenesis of these lesions that has contributed to better and more precise clinical management. Most of the high-grade serous carcinomas involve the ovaries and/or peritoneum, although in most cases, their origin seems to be in the fallopian tube. This view is supported by the recognition of precursor lesions in the fallopian tube, such as p53 signature and serous tubular in situ carcinoma. This paper presents salient morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular data related to serous tumors and related lesions of the female pelvis and discusses the histogenetic interrelationship among these lesions in light of current knowledge.",

Fifty randomly selected specimens from 30 patients were independently investigated to test concordance of histopathologic interpretation. Thickness of collagen band, inflammatory cells, and epithelium were assessed by grading with H&E stained sections; measurement of the subepithelial collagen band on trichrome-stained sections was compared with the subjective grading. The results of the study appeal both to endoscopists and histologists: 1) If sigmoidoscopy is applied in the differential diagnosis of diarrhea, biopsies including the most proximal extent visualized, are mandatory. 2) Inflammatory changes parallel the collagen deposition. 3) Subjective sensitivity in the estimation of collagen thickness in H&E stained slides is low. 4) Collagenous colitis without increase of inflammatory cells and a special type of collagen deposition is doubtful.",

However, recent advances in surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer combined with the use of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy, have improved the outlook substantially. Although conventional pathologic features, such as tumor size, and status of surgical margins and lymph nodes have prognostic importance in patients with pancreatic cancer, novel approaches seem to be necessary to enhance our ability to predict outcome and select optimal therapies. In the case of colonic carcinoma, which has served as a paradigm for our understanding of the molecular basis of neoplasia, somatic mutations in critical oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes accompany progression from adenoma to carcinoma. A similar pattern is emerging for pancreatic cancer in that (a) there appears to be progression from intraductal lesions to infiltrating carcinoma, and (b) the K-ras oncogene and several tumor suppressor genes, including p53, deleted in colon cancer, and multiple tumor suppressor-1, are common targets of mutation and/or deletion. Cytogenetic and molecular studies of allelic loss suggest that additional oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer remain to be discovered. These findings enhance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and serve as the basis for early detection and potentially for improved treatment of this commonly fatal malignancy.",

Most mesotheliomas are pleural and epithelial, and the problem is usually to rule out the possibility of an adenocarcinoma that has extended to the pleura from the underlying lung or a more distant source. Histochemical stains are of limited value in resolving this differential diagnosis, and the customary approach is to request a battery of immunohistochemical stains or, if tissue is available, to resort to electron microscopy. In this article, we review the abilities of the two techniques to discriminate between epithelial pleural mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma. We suggest that while there is no consistently reliable method, a carefully selected and cautiously interpreted group of immunostains will often strongly favor one or other tumor. The contribution of electron microscopy ranges from establishing a definite diagnosis in the majority of instances to offering no aid in the case of some poorly differentiated tumors.",

However, for a variety of reasons, the pathologist may receive the core biopsy and aspirate clot section without all of this information. Although this approach is not optimal, a great deal of valuable information can be generated from these specimens. Over the past 20 years, there has been considerable progress in the fields of flow cytometric analysis, immunohistochemistry, and molecular diagnostic studies that can be performed on smears or extracted DNA from paraffin embedded tissue. These modalities have augmented and refined diagnostic criteria formerly ascertained by light microscopy, cytochemistry, and cytogenetics. This is particularly true of some myeloid and lymphoreticular neoplasms where a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis has become necessary. Despite this growing complexity and dependence on newer methodologies, the traditional role of histopathology in evaluating the bone marrow biopsy remains as important as it has been in the past. In this review, we focus on contemporary practices and expectations for interpreting bone marrow biopsies and clot sections.",

Controversy exists not only on the optimal method of laboratory testing for this HER-2/ neu alteration (i.e., fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) versus immunohistochemistry (IHC) versus others), but also on the type of reagents used for a given method. A plethora of published studies on tissue-based HER-2/ neu testing has recently appeared in many peer-reviewed journals; many have concluded that IHC could be used as a first-line screening test, with the recommendation of FISH to confirm indeterminate results. In contrast to these studies, a recent study by Pauletti et al. showed that HER-2/ neu testing by IHC does not predict clinical outcome as accurately as does FISH. This commentary discusses the findings of this study, within a broader review of critical issues relating to HER-2/ neu testing in breast cancer.",

The majority of patients present with nephrotic syndrome and outcomes are variable. Pathologically, deposits at sites other than the subepithelial aspect of the GBM favor the presence of secondary forms of MGN which are seen most commonly in the setting of autoimmune disease, infection, neoplasia, and with certain therapeutic agents. MGN is the most common form of de novo glomerular disease seen in the renal allograft and may be seen concurrently with other forms of glomerular disease including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and anti-TBM nephritis. This review emphasizes the detection of secondary forms and variants of MGN.",

    "abstract": "Digital imaging has progressed at a rapid rate and is likely to eventually replace chemical photography in most areas of professional and amateur digital image acquisition. In pathology, digital microscopy has implications beyond that of taking a photograph. The arguments for adopting this new medium are compelling, and given similar developments in other areas of pathology and radiologic imaging, acceptance of the digital medium should be viewed as a component of the technological evolution of the laboratory. A digital image may be stored, replicated, catalogued, employed for educational purposes, transmitted for further interpretation (telepathology), analyzed for salient features (medical vision/image analysis), or form part of a wider digital healthcare strategy. Despite advances in digital camera technology, good image acquisition still requires good microscope optics and the correct calibration of all system components, something which many neglect. The future of digital imaging in pathology is very promising and new applications in the fields of automated quantification and interpretation are likely to have profound long-term influence on the practice of anatomic pathology. This paper discusses the state of the art of digital imaging in anatomic pathology.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of the human genome and subsequent expansion of proteomics research combined with emerging technologies such as functional imaging, biosensors and sophisticated computational biology are producing unprecedented changes in today's healthcare. The expanding knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer has shown that significant differences in gene expression patterns can guide therapy not only for neoplastic conditions, but also for a variety of diseases including inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative processes. As a result, the fields of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics have emerged as potential new testing platforms for the individualized management of patients. An individual's response to a drug is the complex interaction of both genetic and non-genetic factors. Genetic variants in the drug target itself, disease pathway genes, or drug metabolizing enzymes may all be used as predictors of drug efficacy or toxicity. In oncology, the SNP technology has focused on detecting the predisposition for cancer, predicting of toxic responses to drugs and selecting the best individual and combinations of anti-cancer drugs. Pharmacogenomics involves the application of whole genome technologies (e.g., gene and protein expression data) for the prediction of the sensitivity or resistance of an individual's disease to a single or group of drugs. Genomic microarrays and transcriptional profiling have the ability to generate hundreds of thousands of data points requiring sophisticated and complex information systems necessary for accurate and useful data analysis. This technique has generated a wealth of new information in the fields of leukemia/lymphoma, and solid tumor classification and prediction of metastasis, drug and biomarker target discovery and pharmacogenomic drug efficacy testing.",

Criticisms have been levied at the IHC method of identifying HER-2 overexpression but convenience and costs of this technique cannot be overlooked. Modifications to the IHC technique and scoring accommodate for many of the problems that derive from variables in preanalytical and analytic factors that influence results but standardization is currently impossible to attain.

As is true in general for the entire discipline of pediatric pathology, the head and neck pathology within this age group is as diverse and different as its adult counterpart. Cases that come across the pediatric head and neck surgical pathology bench are more heavily weighted toward developmental and congenital lesions such as branchial cleft anomalies, thyroglossal duct cysts, ectopias, heterotopias, choristomas, and primitive tumors. Many congenital \"benign\" lesions can cause significant morbidity and even mortality if they compress the airway or other vital structures. Exciting investigations into the molecular embryology of craniofacial development have begun to shed light on the pathogenesis of craniofacial developmental lesions and syndromes. Much more investigation is needed, however, to intertwine aberrations in the molecular ontogeny and development of the head and neck regions to the represented pathology. This review will integrate traditional morphologic embryology with some of the recent advances in the molecular pathways of head and neck development followed by a discussion of a variety of developmental lesions finishing with tumors presumed to be derived from pluripotent/progenitor cells and tumors that show anomalous or aborted development.",

    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common form of kidney cancer in adults. RCC is a significant challenge for pathologic diagnosis and clinical management. The primary approach to diagnosis is by light microscopy, using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system, which defines histopathologic tumor subtypes with distinct clinical behavior and underlying genetic mutations. However, light microscopic diagnosis of RCC subtypes can be difficult due to variable histology, morphologic features shared by tumor subtypes, and a growing frequency of small tumor biopsies with limited morphologic information. In addition to these diagnostic problems, the clinical behavior of RCC is highly variable, and therapeutic response rates are poor. Few clinical assays are available to predict outcome in RCC or correlate behavior with histology. Therefore, novel RCC classification systems based on gene expression should be useful for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Recent microarray studies have shown that renal tumors are characterized by distinct gene expression profiles, which can be used to discover novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Here, we review clinical features of kidney cancer, the WHO classification system, and the growing role of molecular classification for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of this disease.",

    "abstract": "The immunosecretory disorders are a diverse group of diseases associated with proliferation of an abnormal clone of immunoglobulin (Ig)-synthesizing, terminally differentiated B cells. These disorders include multiple myeloma (MM) and its variants, plasmacytoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and monoclonal Ig deposition diseases, the latter including primary amyloidosis and nonamyloidotic types. These disorders are histologically composed of plasma cells, or plasmacytoid cells which produce Ig that is synthesized and usually secreted and can be deposited in some diseases. The Ig can be complete or can be composed of either heavy or light chains and is termed M-(monoclonal) protein. In MM, this proliferation overwhelms the normal cellular counterparts that synthesize and secrete appropriate levels of Ig. Immunosecretory disorders have been classified in multiple schemes, mostly morphologic, to such a degree that the classification of these entities has become a challenge to pathologists. The World Health Organization classification in 2001 was helpful because it provided specific clinicopathologic criteria for diagnosis. However, terms such as \"progressive\" disease were not well defined. In 2003, the International Myeloma Group defined MM as a disease with related organ and tissue injury, serving to better explain progressive in terms of deterioration of organ (renal, bone, and bone marrow) function over time. Therefore, modern classification of immunosecretory diseases is based on integration of clinical, morphologic, laboratory, radiographic, and biologic (including molecular) parameters, which we review here.",

All the markers presented here are used primarily for supporting or confirming the histologic diagnosis, with the exception of (4), which may be of help in identification of inherited forms in schwannomas. As with other surgical pathology practices, the judicious use of a panel of IHC antibodies selected on the basis of the histologic findings is important for an accurate diagnosis of brain tumors.

    "abstract": "When one follows a systematic approach to make a diagnosis of a malignant lesion, it is relatively easy to render a correct cancer diagnosis in most cases during routine daily practice. The first step is to recognize whether or not the specimen contains a lesion and then to determine whether the lesion is neoplastic or non-neoplastic. As a neoplasm is a clonal proliferation, neoplastic conditions are consisted of a single cell type, whereas non-neoplastic conditions consist of multiple different cell types. After determining that a lesion is neoplastic, the next step is to decide whether the neoplasm is of an epithelial origin or mesenchymal origin. The main differences between epithelial tumors and mesenchymal tumors include: (1) The tumor cells in epithelial tumors are oval-round to polygonal, but in mesenchymal tumors, the tumor cells are in general spindle-shaped; (2) Epithelial tumors generally form tumor cell nests, but mesenchymal tumors are arranged diffusely in sheets, without forming tumor cell nests; (3) In epithelial tumors, desmoplastic stroma is well formed in between tumor cell nests, but in mesenchymal tumors there is no desmoplastic stroma; and lastly, (4) feeding vessels open in the stroma in epithelial tumors but open directly between tumor cells in mesenchymal tumors. After this, we can decide whether the tumor is benign or malignant. The differences between benign and malignant tumors include; (1) differentiation, (2) growth rate, (3) growth pattern, and (4) metastasis. A benign tumor is well differentiated, grows slowly, shows expansile growth with encapsulation and does not metastasize. In contrast, a malignant tumor is often poorly differentiated, grows rapidly with many mitoses, shows invasive growth with no capsule and frequently metastasizes. In general, malignant tumors show high cellularity, tumor necrosis and nuclear alterations, which include nuclear enlargement with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, hyperchromatism, pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, and frequent mitoses. The final step is to classify the type of tumor based on the cellular differentiation and gross and microscopic growth pattern based on the light microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin stained slides. For the correct identification of the tumor, immunostaining, molecular diagnostic tools, or possibly electron microscopic evaluation may be required. After making a diagnosis of malignancy, one should then consider the relevant prognostic factors. The 2 well-known prognostic factors (category I prognostic factors) important in almost all tumors include stage and grade. Therefore, information for regarding stage and grade should be included in the pathology report.",

Both subtypes demonstrate a paucity of surreptitious (in CHL) neoplastic B cells within a background of reactive inflammatory cells underscoring both the relatedness of these 2 entities to each other, as well as their distinction from other types of lymphoid neoplasia. Clinically, they are primarily nodal diseases that disseminate in a predictable manner to contiguous nodal regions. The biology of HL as a whole, as well as the genetic and pathologic features that distinguish CHL from nodular lymphocyte predominant HL and other lymphomas has been the subject of a wealth of investigation in recent decades. The aim of this review is to detail the pathologic features of HL and to highlight the recent insights into its molecular basis and the myriad prognostic markers being described.",

    "abstract": "In current medical practice, the clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis is rendered when a patient has suggestive imaging findings or features of portal hypertension (pHTN). Liver biopsy may be considered to assess potential underlying cause(s). Cirrhosis, however, is not the only etiology of pHTN; in fact, schistosomiasis remains a significant factor worldwide. pHTN results from obstruction of hepatic blood flow; it is classified clinically based on either the anatomic location of obstruction or hepatic venous pressure gradient measurements. The clinical categories carry clinicopathologic significances. Histopathologically, pHTN is manifest with either cirrhotic or noncirrhotic features. Noncirrhotic pHTN results from a heterogeneous group of disease processes, all of which result in vascular remodeling with variable parenchymal nodularity and fibrosis. This review summarizes liver biopsy findings of cirrhosis and possible etiologies and provides a stepwise approach for the histologic differential diagnosis of a liver biopsy done for “cirrhosis.”",

    "abstract": "Although pathologic lesions in the pancreas are 3-dimensional (3D) complex structures, we currently use thin 2D hematoxylin and eosin stained slides to study and diagnose pancreatic pathology. Two technologies, tissue clearing and advanced microscopy, have recently converged, and when used together they open the remarkable world of 3D anatomy and pathology to pathologists. Advances in tissue clearing and antibody penetration now make even dense fibrotic tissues amenable to clearing, and light sheet and confocal microscopies allow labeled cells deep within these cleared tissues to be visualized. Clearing techniques can be categorized as solvent-based or aqueous-based techniques, but both clearing methods consist of 4 fundamental steps, including pretreatment of specimens, permeabilization and/or removal of lipid, immunolabeling with antibody penetration, and clearing by refractive index matching. Specialized microscopes, including the light sheet microscope, the 2-photon microscope, and the confocal microscope, can then be used to visualize and evaluate the 3D histology. Both endocrine and exocrine pancreas pathology can then be visualized. The application of labeling and clearing to surgically resected human pancreatic parenchyma can provide detailed visualization of the complexities of normal pancreatic anatomy. It also can be used to characterize the 3D architecture of disease processes ranging from precursor lesions, such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, to infiltrating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. The evaluation of 3D histopathology, including pathology of the pancreatic lesions, will provide new insights into lesions that previously were seen, and thought of, only in 2 dimensions.",

Many studies have been published in the past decade in search for the most acceptable method of assessment for predictors of response to targeted therapies in lung cancer. As a result, several guidelines for molecular testing have been published in a past couple of years. Because of accumulated evidence that targetable drugs show the best efficacy and improved progression survival rates in lung cancer patients whose tumors have a specific genotype, molecular testing for predictors of therapy response has became standard of care. Presently, testing for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements in lung adenocarcinoma has been standardized. The landscape of targetable genomic alterations in lung carcinoma is expanding, but none of other potentially targetable biomarkers have been standardized outside of clinical trials. This review will summarize current practice of molecular testing. Future methods in molecular testing of lung carcinoma will be briefly reviewed.",

In this review, we discuss diagnostic and predictive immunohistochemical markers in NSCLC, one of the most common tumors encountered in surgical pathology. We highlight 2 emerging diagnostic markers: nuclear protein in testis (NUT) for NUT carcinoma; SMARCA4 for SMARCA4-deficient thoracic tumors. Given their highly aggressive behavior, proper recognition facilitates optimal management. For patients with advanced NSCLCs, we discuss the utility and limitations of immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the \"must-test\" predictive biomarkers: anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ROS1, programmed cell death protein 1, and epidermal growth factor receptor. IHC using mutant-specific BRAF V600E, RET, pan-TRK, and LKB1 antibodies can be orthogonal tools for screening or confirmation of molecular events. ERBB2 and MET alterations include both activating mutations and gene amplifications, detection of which relies on molecular methods with a minimal role for IHC in NSCLC. IHC sits at the intersection of an integrated surgical pathology and molecular diagnostic practice, serves as a powerful functional surrogate for molecular testing, and is an indispensable tool of precision medicine in the care of lung cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was introduced 2 decades ago and thereafter validated for routine surgical management of breast cancer, including cases treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As the number of lymph nodes for staging has decreased, pathologists have scrutinized SLN with a combination of standard hematoxylin and eosin, levels, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and molecular methods. An epidemic of small-volume metastases thereby arose, leading to modifications in the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging to accommodate findings such as isolated tumor cells (ITC) and micrometastases. With the goal of determining the significance of these findings, retrospective followed by prospective trials were performed, showing mixed results. The ACOSOG Z10 and NSABP B-32 trials both independently showed that ITC and micrometastases were not significant and thus discouraged the use of levels and IHC for detecting them. However, the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database showed that patients with micrometastases had an overall decreased survival. In addition, the MIRROR (Micrometastases and ITC: Relevant and Robust or Rubbish?) trial, showed that patients with ITC and micrometastases treated with adjuvant therapy had lower hazard ratios compared with untreated patients. Subsequently, the ACOSOG Z0011 trial randomized patients with up to 2 positive SLN to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or not, all treated with radiation and chemotherapy, showing no difference in survival or recurrence rates between the 2 groups and causing a shift from ALND. As the rate of ALND has declined, the necessity of performing levels, IHC, frozen section, and molecular studies on SLN needs to be revisited.",

This novel system evaluates the morphologic features of the tumor and establishes patterns that are associated with a particular tumor behavior. Patients with pattern A EAC do not develop lymph node metastasis, and therefore avoiding lymph node resection in these patients should be considered. These patients also have stage I tumors and conservative surgery would be beneficial to decrease morbidity. Patients with pattern B tumors rarely show metastases to lymph nodes, only if there is lymphovascular invasion, whereas those with pattern C tumors would require aggressive treatment as most lymph node or distant metastases and recurrences were noted in patients with this tumor pattern. Combining this new risk stratification system with an algorithm that surgeons and oncologists could complement to other actionable data would result in a more conservative treatment plan in patients with a new diagnosis of invasive usual-type EAC, as opposed to the current more radical treatment plan. This risk stratification model significantly improves on conventionally used factors such as histologic type, grade, and stage to help manage patients with EAC and identify those in need for aggressive surgical management versus a more conservative approach.",

    "abstract": "An aberrant p53 immunophenotype may be identified in several histotypes of endometrial carcinoma, and is accordingly recognized to lack diagnostic specificity in and of itself. However, based on the high frequency with which p53 aberrations have historically been identified in endometrial serous carcinoma, a mutation-type immunophenotype is considered to be highly sensitive for the histotype. Using an illustrative case study and a review of the literature, we explore a relatively routine diagnostic question: whether the negative predictive value of a wild-type p53 immunophenotype for serous carcinoma is absolute, that is, whether a p53-wild type immunophenotype is absolutely incompatible with a diagnosis of serous carcinoma. The case is an advanced stage endometrial carcinoma that was reproducibly classified by pathologists from 3 institutions as serous carcinoma based on its morphologic features. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor was p53-wild type (DO-7 clone), diffusely positive for p16 (block positivity), and showed retained expression of PTEN, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2. Next generation sequencing showed that there indeed was an underlying mutation in TP53 (D393fs*78, R213*). The tumor was microsatellite stable, had a low mutational burden (4 mutations per MB), and displayed no mutations in the exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase epsilon ( POLE ) gene. Other genomic alterations included RB1 mutation (R46fs*19), amplifications in MYST3 and CRKL , and ARID1A deletion (splice site 5125-94_5138del108). A review of the recent literature identified 5 studies in which a total of 259 cases of serous carcinoma were whole-exome sequenced. The average TP53 mutational rate in endometrial serous carcinoma was only 75% (range, 60 to 88). A total of 12 (33%) of 36 immunohistochemical studies reported a p53-aberrant rate of &lt;80% in endometrial serous carcinoma. We discuss in detail several potential explanations that may underlie the scenario of serous carcinoma-like morphology combined with p53-wild-type immunophenotype, including analytic limitations, a nonserous histotype displaying morphologic mimicry of serous carcinoma, and true biological phenomena (including the possibility of a TP53 -independent pathway of endometrial serous carcinogenesis). Ultimately, our central thematic question is provisionally answered in the negative. At present, the available data would not support a categorical conclusion that a p53 alteration is a necessary and obligate component in the genesis and/or diagnosis of endometrial serous carcinoma. On the basis of their collective experience, the authors proffer some recommendations on the use of p53 immunohistochemistry in the histotyping of endometrial carcinomas.",

Carcinomas lacking expression of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2/neu receptors by immunohistochemistry and Her2 amplification are designated as triple negative. This group of carcinomas comprises approximately 10% to 20% of all breast carcinomas and is characterized by an aggressive nature with shorter rates of disease-free and overall survival. This aggressive behavior is further compounded by the lack of available targeted therapies. Patients receive cytoxic chemotherapy regimens. Although tumors are initially sensitive to this therapy, drugs are toxic and ineffective in maintaining long-term response thereby providing limited benefit. Much effort is being spent on this group of cancers for the identification of appropriate molecular targets, an effort that is proving challenging due to the presence of marked heterogeneity, both at the morphologic and molecular levels. An understanding of the advances in this field is crucial for developing targeted therapies and tailored patient management protocols.

    "abstract": "Germ cell tumors of the testis may be divided into 3 broad categories according to age at presentation. The tumors in the pediatric age group include teratoma and yolk sac tumor. These tumors are generally not associated with convincing intratubular neoplasia. The second group consists of tumors presenting in third and fourth decade of life and include seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, and teratoma as well as mixed germ cell tumors. The precursor cell for these tumors is an abnormal gonocyte that fails to differentiate completely into spermatogonia. These abnormal cells stay dormant in the gonad during intrauterine life as well as infancy and childhood, but undergo proliferation during puberty and can be identified as intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified (IGCNU). These tumor cells continue to manifest protein expression pattern that resembles primitive germ cells (PLAP, c-KIT, OCT3/4). After a variable interval following puberty, IGCNU cells may acquire ability to penetrate the seminiferous tubules and present as an overt germ cell tumor. Acquisition of isochrome 12 and other genetic abnormalities are usually associated with this transition. The level of DNA methylation generally determines the phenotype of the germ cell tumor. The third type of germ cell tumors is spermatocytic seminoma, which is a rare tumor encountered later in life usually in fifth and sixth decade. The cell of origin of this tumor is probably postpubertal mature spermatogonia which acquire abnormal proliferative capability probably due to gain of chromosome 9 resulting in activation and amplification of genes such as DMRT1. The tumor cells manifest many of the proteins normally expressed by mature sperms such as VASA, SSX2, and occasionally OCT2. Although spermatocytic seminoma may also have an intratubular growth phase, it completely lacks features of IGCNU.",

    "abstract": "Sweat gland carcinomas represent an important and somewhat contentious group of tumors in diagnostic skin pathology. Although their overall incidence is rare, they show a wide range of histologic features, and reliable classification is often challenging. Awareness and recognition of these tumors is, however, important as they may be associated with significant morbidity and even disease-related mortality, especially if left untreated. According to their behavior, sweat gland carcinomas are traditionally separated into tumors with low-grade and high-grade malignant behavior. This article is aimed at increasing awareness and providing an overview of malignant sweat gland tumors with emphasis on recently reported and novel findings and diagnostically challenging and potentially underrecognized entities. It further aims to illustrate the wide morphologic range of these tumors and provides a discussion of the relevant immunohistochemistry, disease-specific behavior, and differential diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The following communication summarizes the proceedings of a 1-day Workshop of the International Melanoma Pathology Study Group, which was devoted to thin melanoma. The definitions and histologic criteria for thin melanoma were reviewed. The principal differential diagnostic problems mentioned included the distinction of thin melanoma from nevi, especially from nevi of special site, irritated nevi, inflamed and regressing nevi, and dysplastic nevi. Histologic criteria for this analysis were discussed and the importance of clinico-pathologic correlation, especially in acral sites, was emphasized. Criteria for the minimal definition of invasion were also discussed. In addition, a new technique of m-RNA expression profiling with 14 genes was presented and facilitated the distinction of thin melanomas from nevus in histologically obvious cases. However, for particular nevi, it was not obvious why the results indicated a malignant lesion. Despite many molecular and other ancillary investigations, Breslow thickness remains the most important prognostic factor in thin melanoma. The prognostic significance of radial (horizontal) and vertical growth phases, Clark level, regression, and mitotic rate were also discussed. Because of the increasing frequency of thin melanomas, there is a great need to develop more refined predictors of thin melanomas with worse clinical outcome.",

When they occur in this anatomic area, these tumors more commonly arise from the lung. However, the existence of these tumors primarily affecting the thymus, although recognized in the literature, is rather not well documented or known. In addition, contrary to the primary lung SGTs, which are predominantly of the malignant type, these tumors when occur in thymus encompass a wider spectrum of biology ranging from benign to low grade, and high grade malignancy. The recognition of SGTs in the thymus, even though rare, is important to properly address treatment and prognosis. Herein, we will discuss the numerous benign a malignant SGTs that have been described in the thymus and highlight the difficulty that these tumors may pose when occurring in the thymic area.",

To date, over 50 cases of histologically proven SNUCs have been reported since its original description in 1986. Presenting symptoms include facial pain, nasal obstruction, diplopia, epistaxis, proptosis, and periorbital swelling. The histologic features of this neoplasm include cohesive cells arranged in nests, ribbons, and trabeculae. The cells exhibit hyperchromatic nuclei and a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. A brisk mitotic rate, tumor necrosis, and vascular invasion are prominent features. Confirming the diagnosis of SNUC at the light microscopic level can be challenging, since the microscopic differential diagnosis includes olfactory neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (lymphoepithelioma), malignant lymphoma, malignant melanoma, and neuroendocrine (small cell undifferentiated; oat cell) carcinoma. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma can be differentiated from these other neoplasms by correlating clinical, light microscopic, histochemical, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural characteristics. Aggressive, multimodal therapy can provide the best opportunity for local control of this neoplastic process, but the optimal treatment has yet to be determined.",

Many of these molecules are known or suspected mediators of cell-cell adhesion, cell signaling, motility, or invasion. As knowledge of fucose metabolism evolves and specific mechanisms of its distribution and incorporation are more exactly documented, modulation of fucose expression in cancer is becoming increasingly more feasible. The authors propose that cancer cell surface α-L-fucose is a logical target for selective therapeutic ablation. Reduction of fucose content on the surfaces of malignant cells should effectively cripple the cells' physiologic functions by altering or dysregulating cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions, critical for maintaining the malignant phenotype. Significant therapeutic benefits might include modulation of adhesion abnormalities in the cancer cells, reduction of cancer cell motility or invasiveness, reexposure to immune surveillance, or a combination of these events.",

Current therapeutic strategies for childhood cancers in North America require an accurate pathologic diagnosis and stratify patients based on combinations of clinical, biological, and pathologic features. In several tumor systems, the pathologic response to therapy also modifies the treatment regimen. Accurate pathologic interpretation of such specimens is critical in providing useful prognostic information for therapeutic decisions. Standardized handling of post-therapy pathologic specimens, appropriate use of molecular and genetic studies, consideration of the differential diagnoses, and assessment of the potential biologic significance of therapy-induced pathologic changes are, therefore, critical for patient management and determination of treatment protocols.",

Cytologic samples can be obtained using gastric lavage, abrasive balloons, mucosal brushing, and fine needle aspiration (under percutaneous image guidance, endoscope and endoscopic ultrasound guidance). These advances now allow simultaneous performance of brushing the abnormal mucosa, obtaining fine needle aspirates and excising mucosal biopsy samples for evaluation. Use of endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspirates now help to obtain diagnosis of submucosal lesions, preoperative staging of gastrointestinal tract malignancies and help determine further management of patients. Such advances have brought pathologists to the forefront of the patient management team for the treatment of gastrointestinal tract lesions. This manuscript reviews the advantages and limitations of each cytology associated technique as well as reviews the salient diagnostic features, differential diagnosis and diagnostic pitfalls of gastrointestinal tract lesions. Finally, it suggests the modalities best suited to obtain diagnosis for various gastrointestinal tract lesions.",

Studies from the 1970s and 1980s related its occurrence to the use of low-fiber diets and to the prolonged colonic transit time and increased intraluminal pressure associated with low-volume stools. Pulsion diverticula (pseudodiverticula) emerge through the thickened circular layer of the muscularis propria of the left colon at points of penetration of the vasa recta that supply the submucosa and mucosa. Complications of diverticular disease such as hemorrhage, diverticulitis, peridiverticular abscess, fistula, and perforation are well recognized. More recently, attention has been drawn to the polypoid prolapsing mucosal folds that may develop as the affected segment of bowel (usually the sigmoid) becomes shorter and to changes in the mucosa surrounding the diverticula and in the bowel wall that may result in confusion with ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease (sigmoid colitis-associated diverticulosis [SCAD]). Distinguishing SCAD from these entities is extremely important, and pathologists should be aware of the possibility of overdiagnosing chronic inflammatory bowel disease in biopsies or resection specimens of sigmoid colon with diverticular disease.",

The current pT3a subcategory (in addition to adrenal gland involvement) groups 2 modes of extrarenal extension by RCC, either by peripheral perinephric fat extension or by renal sinus fat invasion. Recent prospective studies have shown that with more directed gross sampling and histologic evaluation, renal sinus invasion is actually more commonly diagnosed than previously reported, or when compared with retrospectively sampled RCC nephrectomy specimens. These studies have demonstrated that renal sinus invasion is the principal pathway for extrarenal extension for clear cell RCC; the incidence of which is related to size (tumors greater than 4 cm more frequently involve the renal sinus). More significantly, a recent retrospective study of pT3a clear cell RCC nephrectomy specimens showed that tumors invading the renal sinus fat portend a more aggressive outcome than tumors invading only the peripheral perinephric fat. Clear cell RCCs invading the renal sinus are more likely to have higher nuclear grade, regional lymph node involvement and sarcomatoid transformation than tumors invading only the perinephric fat. Given the importance of renal sinus invasion, sampling strategies for nephrectomy specimens should be modified to focus in this region as appropriate and pathologists should be familiar with the histologic criteria for staging renal sinus invasion.",

    "abstract": "GRIM-19, a gene associated with retinoid interferon-induced mortality, was originally identified as a critical regulatory protein for interferon-β and retinoic acid-induced cell death. It was also demonstrated that GRIM-19 is involved in mitochondrial metabolism, as an integrant component of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. GRIM-19 appears, therefore, as a dual function protein involved in cell death and mitochondrial metabolism. GRIM-19 knock out leads to Complex I assembly disruption and embryonic lethality in mice, showing that it is a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain essential for early embryonic development. Recently, mutations in GRIM-19 were described in Hürthle cell (mitochondrion-rich) tumors of the thyroid and down-regulation or loss of its expression were found in renal cell carcinomas, suggesting a role for GRIM-19 in tumorigenesis. As GRIM-19 binds and inhibits the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), which has been shown to be activated in several human tumors it is tempting to advance that GRIM-19 may function as a tumor suppressor gene in tumors in which STAT3 plays a major role.",

    "abstract": "Pure sarcomas of the uterine corpus are uncommon, constituting less than 3% of all malignancies at this site, and most of them are leiomyosarcomas and endometrial stromal sarcomas. Rare histotypes of homologous sarcomas and heterologous sarcomas are occasionally encountered, and the absence of significant accumulated experience with these histotypes at this location may potentially raise diagnostic and patient management difficulties. In this article, the clinicopathologic attributes of all earlier reported sarcomas of the uterine corpus other than leiomyosarcomas and endometrial stromal sarcomas are summarized. Included are embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas), osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, liposarcomatous tumors, malignant extrarenal rhabdoid tumors, Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and other rare histotypes. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (20%), Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (17%), angiosarcoma (14%), and pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma (13%) appeared to be more common than the others, although there was no single overwhelmingly prevalent histotype in the group. A subset, including embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, and PEComas, peak in the premenopausal years, but most of the others were observed in postmenopausal women. Favorable outcomes have been reported for the patients diagnosed with alveolar soft part sarcoma, and the prognosis for their counterparts with PEComa remains a matter of debate. Multimodal therapeutic approaches to contemporary patients with embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas have resulted in significantly improved outcomes. Unfortunately, most of the other sarcomas have been associated with rapid tumor progression and unfavorable patient outcomes. The differential diagnosis for these sarcomas is often extensive and varies by histotype, but their accurate diagnosis fundamentally requires the careful exclusion of biphasic malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Adenomatoid tumors (AT) are usually found in the genital tract of both sexes. They are very rarely located in extragenital sites, and are exceedingly rare in the adrenal. AT of the adrenal gland (AT-AG) are nonfunctioning, usually discovered incidentally and confused on imaging with other more common adrenal neoplasms. The overwhelming majority occur in males. Thirty-four cases have been reported so far, more often presenting grossly as solid tumors, rarely as solid with cystic areas, and 5 cases were almost entirely cystic. At histology they can be either circumscribed or locally infiltrative, and may pose diagnostic difficulties when the pathologist relies on morphology alone or is challenged on frozen section. On light microscopy the diagnosis may be very difficult if the tumor is rich in vacuolated cells, mimicking metastatic signet ring-cell adenocarcinoma. Immunophenotyping and/or electron microscopy are paramount in helping to ascertain their mesothelial lineage. Lymphangioma is the main histologic mimic of solid-cystic and cystic AT-AG, but lymphangioma is immunopositive for endothelial markers and negative for cytokeratins and mesothelial markers. Ultrastructural analysis has been performed in 10 published cases of AT-AG, in all of which the classical microvilli of coelomic type were always observed. In brief we report herein the sixth case of cystic lymphangioma-like AT, which was incidentally discovered during clinical follow-up in a 39-year-old man undergoing cancer staging and surveillance after surgery. The adrenal tumor was 5.5 cm in size and was fully investigated immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally. A complete review of the literature is also presented.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews the most typical follicular dendritic cell (FDC) patterns displayed by early lymphomas involving follicles. In in situ follicular lymphoma, FDCs form a well-developed round (spherical) dendritic meshwork with a sharp outline. Other patterns that can be seen include contracted/distorted/disintegrated FDC meshworks. In early mantle cell lymphoma with mantle zone pattern, FDCs compose an ill-outlined and loosely arranged \"centrifugal\" meshwork. In marginal zone lymphoma, the FDC meshwork forms a relatively well-developed nodular meshwork with irregular outlines. In nodular lymphocyte predominant (LP) Hodgkin lymphoma, LP tumor cells are localized within an environment with prominent FDC meshwork and rare or absent LP cells outside the nodules. In angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), scattered regressed germinal centers are usually noted, although hyperplastic germinal centers are seen during the early stages of the disease (EAITL). Identifying the FDC meshwork, mainly in association with blood vessels, constitutes one of the most typical findings of the disease. In conclusion, the morphologic pattern of the FDC meshwork in early lymphomas of follicular origin is heterogenous and differs according to the lymphoma subtypes. These FDC patterns are recognizable in the most typical cases when the lymphoma is in its early stage and still maintains a follicular/nodular pattern of growth. The FDC patterns seen in the CD21 and CD23 stains contribute to the recognition of early stages of lymphomas involving follicles. Conversely, tumor cell immunostains for BCL2, cyclin D1, and other stains form the basis for the definition of lymphoma subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Lynch syndrome (LS) is a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by a germline mutation in a DNA mismatch repair gene, usually MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2. The most common cancers associated with LS are colorectal adenocarcinoma and endometrial carcinoma. Identification of women with LS-associated endometrial cancer is important, as these women and their affected siblings and children are at-risk of developing these same cancers. Germline testing of all endometrial cancer patients is not cost effective, and screening using young age of cancer diagnosis and/or presence of family history of syndrome-associated is underutilized and ineffective. Therefore, most groups now advocate for tumor tissue testing to screen for LS, with germline testing targeted to women with abnormal tissue testing results. Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is used in many clinical laboratories for this tumor screening step, as immunohistochemistry is relatively inexpensive and is technically more accessible for smaller clinical labs. PCR-based tissue testing, whereas technically more challenging, does play an important role in the identification of these patients. MLH1 methylation analysis identifies women with tumor MLH1 loss who likely have sporadic endometrial cancer and do not need heightened cancer prevention surveillance. High levels of microsatellite instability have been identified in tumors with retained positive expression of mismatch repair proteins. Somatic sequencing of mismatch repair genes from tumor DNA, whereas not currently available in most clinical laboratories, is helpful in resolution of cases in which germline sequencing fails to identify a mutation in a mismatch repair gene. The tumor tissue testing approach can help to identify most women at-risk for germline mutations in a LS gene, but not all patients will be captured using this approach. Clinical suspicion can still play a pivotal role in accurately identifying a subset of these patients.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of minimal prostatic adenocarcinoma can be challenging on prostate needle biopsy, and immunohistochemistry may be used to support the diagnosis of cancer. The International Society of Urologic Pathology currently recommends the use of the basal cell markers high-molecular-weight cytokeraratin and p63, and α-methylacyl-coenzyme-A racemase. However, there are caveats associated with the interpretation of these markers, particularly with benign mimickers. Another issue is that of early detection of presence and progression of disease and prediction of recurrence after clinical intervention. There remains a lack of reliable biomarkers to accurately predict low-risk cancer and avoid over treatment. As such, aggressive forms of prostate cancer may be missed and indolent disease may be subjected to unnecessary radical therapy. New biomarker discovery promises to improve early detection and prognosis and to provide targets for therapeutic interventions. In this review, we present the emerging immunohistochemical biomarkers of prostate cancer PTEN, ERG, FASN, MAGI-2, and SPINK1, and address their diagnostic and prognostic advantages and limitations.",

    "abstract": "Urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS) is a high-grade noninvasive malignancy with a high tendency of progression. Although it is typically grouped with other nonmuscle invasive bladder cancers, its higher grade and aggressiveness make it a unique clinical entity. Urothelial CIS is histologically characterized by replacement of the urothelium by cells which fulfill the morphologic criteria of malignancy including nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, prominent nucleoli, and increased numbers of normal and abnormal mitoses. Urothelial CIS may be categorized as primary when it is not associated with any past or present urothelial carcinoma. It is termed as secondary when there is concomitant or previous urothelial carcinoma in the patient. In recent years detailed molecular studies have provided valuable data for intrinsic molecular subclassification of urothelial carcinoma into 2 broad categories namely luminal and basal types with significant implications for prognosis and therapy. Similar studies on urothelial CIS are limited but have provided crucial insight into the molecular basis of CIS. These studies have revealed that urothelial CIS may also be divided into luminal and basal subtypes, but luminal subtype is much more common. It has also been shown that in many cases, luminal type of urothelial CIS may undergo a class switch to basal type during progression to an invasive carcinoma. Additional studies may be required to confirm and further elaborate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) accounts for 5% to 7% of all renal cell carcinomas. It was thought for many years that ChRCC exhibits a hypodiploid genome. Recent studies using advanced molecular genetics techniques have shown more complex and heterogenous pattern with frequent chromosomal gains. Historically, multiple losses of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 10, 13, 17, and 21 have been considered a genetic hallmark of ChRCC, both for classic and eosinophilic ChRCC variants. In the last 2 decades, multiple chromosomal gains in ChRCCs have also been documented, depicting a considerably broader genetic spectrum than previously thought. Studies of rare morphologic variants including ChRCC with pigmented microcystic adenomatoid/multicystic growth, ChRCC with neuroendocrine differentiation, ChRCC with papillary architecture, and renal oncocytoma-like variants also showed variable chromosomal numerical aberrations, including multiple losses (common), gains (less common), or chromosomal changes overlapping with renal oncocytoma. Although not the focus of the review, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data in ChRCC show TP53 , PTEN , and CDKN2A to be the most mutated genes. Given the complexity of molecular genetic alterations in ChRCC, this review analyzed the existing published data, aiming to present a comprehensive up-to-date survey of the chromosomal abnormalities in classic ChRCC and its variants. The potential role of chromosomal numerical aberrations in the differential diagnostic evaluation may be limited, potentially owing to its high variability.",

    "abstract": "The glomerulus has 3 resident cells namely mesangial cells that produce the mesangial matrix, endothelial cells that line the glomerular capillaries, and podocytes that cover the outer surface of the glomerular basement membrane. Parietal epithelial cells (PrECs), which line the Bowman's capsule are not part of the glomerular tuft but may have an important role in the normal function of the glomerulus. A significant progress has been made in recent years regarding our understanding of the role and function of these cells in normal kidney and in kidneys with various types of glomerulopathy. In crescentic glomerulonephritis necrotizing injury of the glomerular tuft results in activation and leakage of fibrinogen which provides the trigger for excessive proliferation of PrECs giving rise to glomerular crescents. In cases of collapsing glomerulopathy, podocyte injury causes collapse of the glomerular capillaries and activation and proliferation of PrECs, which accumulate within the urinary space in the form of pseudocrescents. Many of the noninflammatory glomerular lesions such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and global glomerulosclerosis also result from podocyte injury which causes variable loss of podocytes. In these cases podocyte injury leads to activation of PrECs that extend on to the glomerular tuft where they cause segmental and/or global sclerosis by producing excess matrix, resulting in obliteration of the capillary lumina. In diabetic nephropathy, in addition to increased matrix production in the mesangium and glomerular basement membranes, increased loss of podocytes is an important determinant of long-term prognosis. Contrary to prior belief there is no convincing evidence for an active podocyte proliferation in any of the above mentioned glomerulopathies.",

Although the number of thyroid FNACs, including small lesions, is increasing due to the reliance upon sonographic and cytologic interpretations, there are issues concerning cytomorphologic interpretation and interobserver reproducibility. Different classification systems have tried to better define the criteria for inclusion in specific categories and to therefore reduce the rate of indeterminate diagnoses such as atypia of undetermined significance, follicular neoplasms, and suspicious for malignancy. However, the support of ancillary techniques (eg, immunocytochemistry and molecular analysis) are reshaping morphologic diagnoses made on materials obtained from FNAC.",

    "abstract": "Most cervical carcinomas and their related lesions are attributed to an infection by human papillomavirus (HPV). The infection usually starts in the basal cells at the squamocolumnar junction. It causes cell proliferation and maturation abnormalities along with nuclear abnormalities resulting in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. An overwhelming majority of these lesions spontaneously disappear, and the infection is cleared. In a small subset of high-risk HPV infection cases, the lesions may persist and progress to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. These are associated with the incorporation of the viral genome into the human genome. Some of the high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, over several years, progress to invasive carcinoma. Carcinomas of the cervix are usually squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), but 20% to 25% of the cases may manifest as adenocarcinomas. Similar to SCC, adenocarcinomas may initially manifest as adenocarcinomas in situ and may progress to invasive carcinomas after a variable period of time. In the recently published World Health Organization classification of female genital tumors, SCCs, and adenocarcinomas of the cervix are divided into HPV-associated and HPV-independent tumors. This review draws on the latest terminology and the several morphologic subtypes recognized for each category.",

    "abstract": "Over the last years, a number of changes has taken place in the evaluation of thymomas. More recently, the introduction of a TNM staging system in the assessment of thymic epithelial tumors, in general, has been put forward. Important to highlight is that this TNM system is not based on tumor size, and because of that shortcoming, it was in need to borrow most if not all of the information from the experience derived from other schemas that over the years have been tested with larger series of cases. Also important to recognize is that this TNM system is nothing new as previous authors in the past had already attempted to provide a TNM system for thymomas without much success. Therefore, it becomes important that those involved with the staging of thymomas become familiar with previous schemas as the TNM system provides a slight different spin in the T component, while the M component truly represents advance stages of previous schemas. More importantly is to also highlight that despite the specific anatomic structures addressed in the T or M assessment, there is little information in the most important aspect of any staging system—clear definitions of invasion and metastasis and the gross assessment of these tumors to provide an accurate staging. Capsular integrity still remains paramount in such assessment. A critical assessment of TNM system compared with previously proposed staging systems and whether there is a real advancement in applying it is discussed as well as the gross assessment of these tumors to highlight the importance of the staging protocol.",

More than half of these alterations concern non- BRCA DDR genes. From a therapeutic perspective, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors have demonstrated robust clinical efficacy in tumors with BRCA2 and BRCA1 alterations. Mismatch repair–deficient PCa, and a subset of CDK12-deficient PCa, are vulnerable to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Emerging data point to the efficacy of ATR inhibitors in PCa with ATM deficiencies. Still, therapeutic implications are insufficiently clarified for most of the non- BRCA DDR alterations, and no successful targeted treatment options have been established.",

In the lung, the most recent grading system proposed by International association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) and adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) incorporates the predominant histologic pattern, as well as the presence of high-grade architectural patterns (solid, micropapillary, and complex glandular pattern) in proportions &gt;20% of the tumor surface. This system has shown improved prognostic ability when compared with the prior grading system based on the predominant pattern alone, across different patient populations. Interobserver agreement is moderate to excellent, depending on the study. IASLC/WHO grading system has been shown to correlate with molecular alterations and PD-L1 expression in tumor cells. Recent studies interrogating gene expression has shown correlation with tumor grade and molecular alterations in the tumor microenvironment that can further stratify risk of recurrence. The use of machine learning algorithms to grade nonmucinous adenocarcinoma under this system has shown accuracy comparable to that of expert pulmonary pathologists.

A further subset of uterine smooth muscle neoplasms, termed “smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP),” are not readily classified as benign or malignant and carry an intermediate prognosis. STUMP is a protean category, whose precise definition is subject to disagreement among experts. The risk profiles of different STUMP morphotypes remain largely unresolved. Finally, multiple morphology-based systems for risk stratification of uterine leiomyosarcoma have been proposed, though none is widely adopted.

    "abstract": "Summary: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a recently described neurovascular disease affecting young to middle age individuals. The disease is caused by mutations in the Notch3 gene located in the short arm of chromosome 19. Clinically, the disease is characterized by migrainous headaches (with or without aura), mood disturbances, focal neurologic deficits, transient ischemic attacks, strokes, and dementia. Pathologically, the disease is characterized by a stereotypic degeneration of the arterial walls (especially in the intracranial compartments) with deposition in the media of a nonatheromatous, nonamyloidotic substance that under the electron microscope (EM) appears as a granular osmiophilic material (GOM), pathognomonic for the disease. The nature of the GOM is undetermined and the pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. A review of current literature in English language is presented on the clinical, radiologic, pathologic, and genetic features of CADASIL.",

This review summarizes the reported cases of psammoma bodies identified on cervicovaginal smears in the world literature (a total of 140 cases, 113 (81%) of which had sufficient clinicopathologic information). Our conclusions are as follows: (1) The finding of psammoma bodies in this setting is distinctly unusual with an incidence of less than 0.001% on consecutively screened smears. (2) On consecutively screened smears, patients with psammoma bodies have an associated malignancy or ovarian borderline tumor 0–22.7% of the time, depending on the series; this figure climbs to 38% when all the case reports and small series in the literature are included. (3) The most reliable predictor of a malignancy in these patients is the finding of cells on the smear that by themselves are diagnostic of malignancy on cytologic grounds. (4) Other factors that, on a purely statistical basis, appear to increase the likelihood of a synchronous or metachronous malignancy or borderline tumor include an older age at diagnosis and/or clinical presentations such as postmenopausal bleeding. (5) When 1 or more psammoma bodies are identified on a cervicovaginal smear, this finding should not be ignored and should generate some clinical investigation to identify its source.",

    "abstract": "Androgens play a central role in the development and maintenance of prostate tissue. Treatment of prostate cancer by androgen ablation either surgically or biochemically results in massive cell death and tumor regression. However, this is often followed by the onset of aggressive disease, which is fatal. Various studies have been conducted to understand the mechanism leading to the establishment of aggressive disease following treatment. An interesting comprehensive study recently conducted by Chen et al shows the increase in androgen receptor (AR) transcript to be the key factor in disease recurrence following treatment. This up-regulation in the AR levels is shown to increase sensitivity to low levels of androgen, leading to ligand-dependent downstream gene expression and tumor recurrence. A \"mass action\" model has been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Moreover, the increase in mRNA levels has been shown to facilitate conversion of classic antagonists to agonists of hormones action by the recruitment of a subset of co-activators to the promoters of AR-responsive genes. This study underscores the importance of ARs in the establishment of prostate cancer and offers several insights into the mechanism by which tumors recur following androgen ablation. The study also prompts several questions about the reason behind the observed up-regulation and also the mechanism by which classic antagonists are rendered agonistic. The need for the design of novel therapeutic analogues is also emphasized.",

These highly specialized structures prevent chromosome ends from being recognized as double-strand DNA breaks, and they also provide protection from destabilizing agents. The mechanism for maintaining telomere integrity is controlled by telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that specifically restores telomere sequences lost during replication by using an intrinsic RNA component as a template for polymerization. Telomerase has two core functional components required for its activity: the catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and a telomerase RNA template (hTR). Telomerase is activated in the majority of immortal cell lines in culture and in most malignant tumors. This review outlines our current understanding of telomerase in breast cancer development and critically evaluates potential utilities in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States in the general population (men and women combined). Epidemiologic data obtained over the last several decades shows convincing evidence for the efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the reduction of risk of CRC through the inhibition of cycloxygenase (COX). Recent research has also demonstrated that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a predominant product of COX, plays a critical role in tumorigenesis of CRCs through its guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs), EP2, and EP4. Molecular analysis of CRC and its precursor lesions have shown that mutation of Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), a gene involved in the wingless type signaling pathway, is an early event during the neoplastic progression in the majority of sporadic CRCs. The fundamental questions are: why is wild type APC so important in adult colorectal tissues in preventing this tumorigenesis, and what are the mechanisms by which NSAIDs prevent colorectal tumorigenesis? We reviewed the recent literature concerning the PGE2-GPCR signaling pathway and the APC-β-catenin (wingless type) pathway in CRC cells and propose a unifying schema regarding the tumorigenesis of CRC. Colorectal epithelia are continuously exposed to various extracellular agonists (including low levels of PGE2). The binding of these agonists to their corresponding GPCRs leads to formation of activated Gαs, which in turn activates β-catenin. In normal colorectal epithelia, wild type APC blocks the Gαs-induced activation of β-catenin, and therefore maintains homeostasis and prevents tumorigenesis. In contrast, in the absence of functional APC, continuous formation of activated Gαs by the binding of various extracellular agonists to their receptors leads to the activation and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. This elevated nuclear β-catenin in turn increases transcription of many genes (COX-2, C-myc, Cyclin D1, vascular endothelial growth factor, T cell factor, etc.) involved in tumorigenesis. Increased transcription of COX-2 also leads to excessive production of PGE2 that in turn forms a stimulatory loop with many biologic functions (proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis), which may result in the development of CRC. Because NSAIDs inhibit COX and decrease the production of PGE2, interruption of the cycle helps prevent colorectal tumorigenesis.",

TFs are usually expressed during specific differentiation or activation cellular programs, making them interesting tools in diagnostic immunohistochemistry. In fact, the specificity of some of these TFs for lineage or activation/differentiation passages or their abnormal expression in specific disease entity, represents a feature that has been exploited in diagnostic/prognostic immunohistochemistry. Bcl-6 was the prototype of this class of markers. Currently, the expanding knowledge of the TFs involved in the differentiation programs and in the activation processes of T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte in normal and neoplastic conditions and the availability of antibodies able to efficiently recognize these TFs in histologic material, represent a powerful tool in diagnostic hematopathology. In this review we will consider the basic biologic aspects and the applications in hematopathology of some of the lymphocyte-related TFs, including Pax5/BSAB, MUM1/IRF4, BOB1, Oct-2, T-bet, and FOXP3.

Recent data, including the article summarized above, suggest that the interaction between GERD and eosinophilic esophagitis can be complex, and that the notion of establishing a clear distinction between the 2 disorders may be simplistic. Furthermore, the high frequency of GERD in adult patients with eosinophilic esophagitis suggests that there may be more than a chance association. This report discusses the possible relationship between these 2 conditions, including the hypothesis that GERD may contribute to or cause eosinophilic esophagitis. We also suggest that the differential diagnosis of eosinophilic and peptic esophagitis should not be based exclusively on arbitrary counts of eosinophils per high-power field; rather, there should always be a thoughtful consideration of histopathologic and clinical data.",

The most common is a mixed subtype of adenocarcinoma. This group is very heterogenous and includes a wide spectrum of tumors ranging from adenocarcinomas with a dominant BAC growth pattern (lepidic growth) to frankly invasive adenocarcinoma with no BAC component. There is a tendency among clinicians to regard tumor as BAC if any significant amount of lepidic growth pattern within the tumor is identified. The change in WHO definition of BAC and introduction of mixed subtype of adenocarcinoma resulted in disconnect between surgical pathologists and clinicians regarding the use of terminology and criteria for diagnosis of BAC and mixed subtype of adenocarcinoma. It is clear that pure BAC is an extremely rare tumor, whereas mixed subtypes of adenocarcinomas may have various clinical presentations and outcomes. The mounting evidence suggests that a subset of mixed subtype of adenocarcinomas with areas of BAC and focal invasion probably represent more indolent tumors. On the basis of the published data, there is a proposal to define a subcategory of \"minimally invasive adenocarcinoma\" of the lung. Many morphologic factors seem to play a role in predicting the behavior of these tumors. Depending on the results of ongoing clinical trials, surgical management of these tumors may change in a near future.",

In other anatomic sites similar appearing lesions have been interpreted as pedunculated liposarcomas/atypical lipomatous tumors that are more prone to local recurrences than classic giant fibrovascular polyps. Reports of dedifferentiation and metastases are lacking thus raising the possibility that the cytologic findings in such lesions are degenerative. To confirm our suspicion of liposarcomatous differentiation, we performed immunohistochemistry for MDM2 and p53, 2 markers that are known to be negative in benign lipomatous lesions and positive in well-differentiated liposarcomas/atypical lipomatous tumors. The scattered atypical hyperchromatic cells and the lipoblasts both exhibited strong nuclear staining for both markers and supported the diagnosis of pedunculated giant hypopharyngeal atypical lipomatous tumor.",

The review article also discusses the most common hematolymphoid malignancies and their immunohistochemical profiles, and how to use immunophenotyping to differentiate them from other entities. Common diagnostic pitfalls and misconceptions about certain antibodies will also be discussed. New antibodies, such as SOX11, will also be explored in the context of specific disease entities for which they may be of use.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 in early 80s, the link between HPV and cervical cancer has been established with certainty, a function of the discovery and cloning of a range of HPV types associated with both cancer precursors (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or CIN) and carcinomas and extensive epidemiologic, clinical, pathologic, and experimental data. These accumulated results have culminated in new paradigms of cancer prevention through screening and triage. Despite this, the management of women with CIN is still suboptimal and the overtreatment of these conditions still occurs, largely due to the lack of clarity regarding which precancerous lesions are most likely to progress in grade. Recently, a discrete population of cuboidal cells was discovered at the cervical squamocolumnar junction, the anatomic site where the large majority of HPV-related (pre)neoplastic lesions develop. These cells seem to be embryonic in nature and participate both in benign metaplasias and the initial phase of precancer development. This review summarizes the historical evolution of precursor management, assesses the potential role of this and other discoveries in segregating lower from higher-risk precursors, and examines their potential impact on the management of women with real or potential cervical cancer precursors.",

    "abstract": "Infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV) is globally seen a leading cause of hepatitis. Now increasingly recognized also in industrialized countries, hepatitis E constitutes a significant health problem worldwide. The patient's immune status determines the clinical course and histopathology of hepatitis E. In immunocompetent patients, hepatitis E usually follows an asymptomatic or subclinical course, but may also present with acute hepatitis. In contrast, immunocompromised patients may develop chronic hepatitis, and patients with preexisting liver diseases are at risk for liver decompensation with potentially fatal outcome. Whereas pathologists only occasionally encounter liver biopsies from immunocompetent individuals with hepatitis E, they are more likely exposed to biopsies from patients with preexisting liver disease or immunocompromised individuals. Histopathologic hallmarks of hepatitis E in immunocompetent patients comprise lobular disarray, lobular, and portal inflammation, as well as hepatocyte necrosis of varying extend and regeneration. Thus, it is similar to acute non-E viral hepatitis, yet further differential diagnoses include autoimmune hepatitis and drug-induced liver injury. Histopathologic findings of hepatitis E in preexisting liver disease are determined by the underlying pathology, but may be more severe. Histopathologic presentation of hepatitis E in immunocompromised patients is highly variable, ranging from minimal active hepatitis to chronic hepatitis with severe activity and progressive fibrosis. Taken together, the variability of the histologic features depending on the clinical context and the overlap with other liver diseases make the histopathologic diagnosis of hepatitis E challenging. Immunohistochemistry for HEV open reading frame 2 protein and molecular testing for HEV RNA are useful tissue-based ancillary tools.",

Pan-genomic studies, including the pioneering ones on papillary thyroid carcinoma, phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma, and adrenal cortical carcinoma from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, provided a comprehensive integrated genomic analysis of endocrine tumors into distinct molecularly defined subtypes. Better understanding of the molecular landscape and more accurate definition of biological behavior has been accordingly achieved. Nevertheless, how any of these advances are translated into routine practice still remains a challenge in the era of precision medicine. The challenge for modern pathology is to keep up the pace with scientific discoveries by integrating novel concepts in tumor classification, molecular genetics, prognostication, and theranostics. As an example, pathology plays a role in the identification of hereditary disease, while it offers the tools for complementing molecular genetics, for example, validation of variants of unknown significance deriving from targeted sequencing or whole exome/genome sequencing approach. Immunohistochemistry has arisen as a cost-effective strategy in the evaluation either of somatic mutations in tumors and/or germline mutations in patients with familial cancer syndromes. Herein, a comprehensive review focusing on novel and emerging biomarkers is presented in order pathologists and other endocrine-related specialists to remain updated and become aware of potential pitfalls and limitations in the field of endocrine pathology.",

PM-NHLs are defined as involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes, thymus, and/or mediastinal organs (heart, lung, pleura, pericardium) by NHL without evidence of systemic disease at presentation. The clinical scenario is variable and depends on the lymphoma subtype. The radiologic presentation is also variable ranging from a mediastinal mass with or without superior vena cava syndrome, a pleural or a cardiac mass associated with effusion, or as an effusion only. The diagnosis of PM-NHLs can only be established by microscopic evaluation, and therefore, general pathologists should be aware of these tumors and familiar with their diagnostic approach. The most common anterior mediastinal NHLs (90% to 95%) are primary mediastinal (PM) large B-cell lymphoma and T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Thymic marginal zone lymphoma and mediastinal gray zone lymphoma are very rare. The remainder PM-NHLs involving middle or posterior mediastinum include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and rare cases of T-cell lymphoma, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma and breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma extending to the anterior mediastinum. Primary pleural and cardiac NHLs are mostly DLBCLs. Other rare subtypes of PM-NHLs include DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation/pyothorax-associated lymphoma, fibrin-associated DLBCL (both Epstein-Barr virus positive), and pleural and/or pericardial primary effusion lymphoma (human herpesvirus-8 positive/Epstein-Barr virus positive). We review the historical aspects, epidemiology, clinicoradiologic features, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, differential diagnosis, and relevant cytogenetic and molecular features of the remaining mediastinal B-cell lymphomas, including primary thymic marginal zone lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type, other PM small B-cell lymphomas, PM plasmacytoma, and the most relevant PM T-cell lymphomas.",

The diagnosis of such lesions becomes more challenging in the setting of mediastinoscopic biopsies. In addition, over the years, there has been further accumulation of knowledge of the clinical aspects of these lesions that needs to be incorporated into their evaluation. Therefore, it is essential that in the general evaluation of these fibrosing processes, one not only carefully examines the histopathologic features of the lesion, that of a fibroinflammatory process with the appropriate histochemical and immunohistochemical studies, but also carefully evaluates the clinical presentation and imaging findings. Needless to say, as will be illustrated in this review, determining a definitive unequivocal diagnosis on a small mediastinoscopic biopsy may be difficult, and often one needs to provide guidance on the perspective of the histologic features present. In some cases, mainly tumoral conditions with extensive fibrosis, a conclusive diagnosis can be made; however, it is those cases in which the extensive fibrosis is the only histopathologic feature where more appropriate guidance is required. While this review will focus more on the non-neoplastic fibroinflammatory lesions of the mediastinum, within the discussion of differential diagnoses, we will discuss some neoplastic conditions that commonly show extensive fibrosing features.",

There have been many developments in refining diagnostic laboratory tests for celiac disease in the last decade. Biopsy-sparing diagnostic guidelines have been proposed and validated in a few recent prospective studies. However, despite these developments, histologic evaluation of duodenal mucosa remains one of the most essential diagnostic tools as it helps in the diagnosis of celiac disease in individuals who do not fulfill the biopsy-sparing diagnostic criteria and in those not responding to a gluten-free diet. Histologic evaluation also allows for the assessment of mucosal recovery after treatment and in the identification of concurrent intestinal diseases. Therefore, pathologists should be familiar with the histologic spectrum of celiac disease and need to be aware of other disorders with similar symptoms and histopathology that may mimic celiac disease. This review aims to provide pathologists with updates on celiac laboratory testing, biopsy-sparing diagnostic criteria, histopathology, complications, and differential diagnoses of celiac disease.",

The applications are wide ranging, including mobile technology to increase patient engagement, self-monitoring by patients, clinical algorithm calculation, facilitation between experts to resource-poor environments. These advances have been received with mixed reviews. For anatomic pathology, mobile technology applications can be broken into 4 broad categories: (a) educational uses, (b) microscope with mobile phone, (c) mobile phone as microscope/acquisition device, and (d) miscellaneous. Using a mobile phone as an acquisition device paired with a microscope seems to be the most interesting current application because of the need for expert consultation with resource-poor environments. However, several emerging uses for mobile technology may become more prominent as the technology matures including image analysis, alternative light sources, and increased opportunities for clinician and patient engagement.

Although NHT has not been recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network as a primary treatment option for patients with localized PCa, NHT is increasingly used in clinical trials for locally advanced PCa. More importantly, with the development of novel androgen signaling inhibitors, such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, there has been renewed interests in revisiting the role of such treatment in the neoadjuvant setting. Following NHT, the PCa tissues shows characteristic morphologic alterations. Of note, the collapse of malignant glands most likely leads to an artificial increase of Gleason score in the residual disease. Communicating these changes to the clinician in a way that can help assess the tumor’s response poses a challenge for pathologists. In addition, little is known of morphologic features and predictive makers both in pretreated and posttreated specimens that can be of value in predicting tumor response to NHT. In the current review, we summarize the morphologic changes associated with neoadjuvant-treated PCa, focusing on the predictive value of pathologic parameters to therapy response. We also describe the evaluation system in the stratification of pathologic response to NHT in PCa management.",

As the spectrum of RCC continues to evolve, with more recently described subtypes in the past decade, literature evidence on grading these subtypes is limited or not available for some tumor types. Herein, we outline a pragmatic approach to the topic of grading RCC, dividing the contemporarily described RCC subtypes into 7 categories based on the potential clinical applicability of grading as a useful prognostic parameter: (1) RCC subtypes that are reasonably validated and recommended for WHO/ISUP grading; (2) RCC subtypes where WHO/ISUP is not applicable; (3) RCC subtypes where WHO/ISUP grading is potentially clinically useful; (4) inherently aggressive RCC subtypes where histologic classification itself confers an aggressive biologic potential; (5) renal epithelial tumors where WHO/ISUP grading provides potentially misleading prognostic implication; (6) renal epithelial neoplasms where low WHO/ISUP grade features are a prerequisite for accurate histologic classification; and (7) renal epithelial neoplasms with no or limited data on grading or incomplete understanding of the biologic potential. Our aim in outlining this approach is 2-fold: (a) identify the gaps in understanding and application of grading in RCC subtypes so that researchers in the field may perform additional studies on the basis of which the important pathologic function of assignment of grade may be recommended to be performed as a meaningful exercise across a wider spectrum of RCC; and (b) to provide guidance in the interim to surgical pathologists in terms of providing clinically useful grading information in RCC based on currently available clinicopathologic information.",

    "abstract": "The International Consensus Classification (ICC) of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms follows the precedent set in the Revised European-American lymphoma classification for modern lymphoma classifications by defining specific diseases on the basis of all the available morphologic, immunophenotypic, genetic, and clinical findings. Primary cutaneous lymphomas exhibit a broad range of clinical behavior ranging from lesions which spontaneously regress to those which run an aggressive, often fatal course. Accurate separation of entities is therefore essential for prognostication and to ensure appropriate treatment is administered. However, despite marked differences in clinical course, many subtypes of primary cutaneous lymphoma exhibit remarkably similar, often overlapping, and sometimes indistinguishable pathologic features. While molecular analysis has furthered our understanding of some of these disease entities, it does not yet facilitate robust distinction. Thus, clinical correlation retains a central role in both the diagnosis and classification of primary cutaneous lymphoma. This review aims to draw attention to problem areas in differential diagnosis and hopefully offer some practical suggestions for resolving difficult cases. It will also highlight recent advances in the field and discuss how they reinforce the current classification system and how they might impact of future classifications and treatment strategies.",

That said, while there are some basic principles to the workup that we can all likely agree upon, individual practice habits will need to be tailored to suit an individual setting. As such, the approach presented in this manuscript is meant to serve as a practical guide and not as dogma per se. Importantly, an in-depth discussion of individual diseases and International Consensus Classification diagnostic criteria will not be covered, as the main focus of this article is the approach to these disorders. The reader is referred to a comprehensive discussion of these diseases and diagnostic criteria in several excellent articles. While there are clear areas of overlap between eosinophilia and mast cell conditions (eg, systemic mastocytosis associated with eosinophilia, myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia, and tyrosine kinase rearrangements), it is the authors’ opinion that it is perhaps easier to navigate these entities separately (eg, eosinophilia as one broad topic and mast cell conditions as another) and to recognize the settings in which overlap may exist and what testing might be considered. Eosinophilia and mast cell conditions will be discussed separately supplemented by generous use of figures and tables to highlight key points.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, there have been many meaningful contributions to the pathology literature with respect to T-cell lymphoma pathogenesis and biology and improved diagnostics. We know more about disease classification, clinical characteristics, immunophenotype, and genetics than ever before, and yet diagnosis of nodal T-cell lymphomas continues to be a challenging exercise. Complicating interpretation are the many non-neoplastic mimickers of peripheral T-cell lymphoma including drug effects, viruses, autoimmune, and idiopathic conditions, that must be considered when faced with an abnormal lymph node biopsy. The number of immunohistochemical stains required to make a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma is not standardized and may be exhaustive, requiring judicious use of tissue sections. Clonality studies may contribute to the diagnosis, though questions remain about test modality, when to exercise interpretive caution, and what to do if a clone cannot be demonstrated. Use of next generation sequencing in the diagnosis of nodal T-cell lymphomas is increasing, but how the data can be practically applied to diagnosis is still under examination. The goal of this paper is to consider nodal T-cell lymphoma diagnosis and classification in a modern context, using a question-and-answer format to capture the interest of the reader and address common pathology consultation queries.",

It is proposed that HPV DNA integration into the basal cells of cervical squamous epithelium precedes the transformation of low-into high-grade lesions. The HPV DNA tyramide-based in situ hybridization system may prove to be a powerful diagnostic/prognostic tool in this regard. It is also proposed that the presence of mitoses (especially atypical forms) in the upper layers may be a discriminatory hallmark in the morphologic distinction between low- and high-grade lesions. Further, since the biologic changes manifest between these two lesions are reflected in their respective phenotype, it appears plausible to adopt the Bethesda System two-tiered/binary classification of LGSIL and HGSIL for histopathologic diagnoses.",

The hereditary forms are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, neurofibromatosis, and tuberous sclerosis. In sporadic PETs, the most consistent and recurring chromosomal abnormality is allelic loss of chromosome 11q, which includes the MEN-1 locus.

However, the intra- and interobserver variability inherent in dating the product of the endometrial biopsy-the endometrium-has led to the current situation, in which, in approximately 20% of cases, variability attributed to the pathologist alone is determinant of whether a given biopsy in \"in phase\" or out of phase (ie, an assigned postovulatory date that is at least 2 days behind the chronologic date). Thus, studies that clearly delineate which histologic parameters serve as the greatest source of disagreement for pathologists provide a valuable framework for further refinement of the criteria for endometrial dating. Meanwhile, continued use of the criteria of Noyes et al for endometrial dating is recommended until more precise modalities for assessing the adequacy of endometrial maturation are available.",

Actual practices are less well documented. We therefore evaluated actual practices in nephropathology and their divergence from best practices. One hundred and twenty Renal Pathology Society members were given questionnaires regarding tissue handling, processing, and staining. Appropriate statistics for each question were calculated from results compiled into Microsoft Excel. Responses from 75 members showed that most received 16 or 18 gauge core biopsies, examined 9 slides for native kidneys, 8 slides for transplant kidneys, and for both used hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, trichrome, and silver stains. For native kidney biopsies, most collected for IF and EM if tissue was adequate, while clinical input could influence the rest. Almost all performed IF on adequate samples, with a minimum of 8 antibodies, including both light chains, those from Europe sometimes without proof of adequacy. Half performed EM unconditionally, the remainder based on specimen adequacy or clinical input. For transplant kidney biopsies, most collected tissue for IF and EM only with specific clinical indications, performed C4d IF on frozen tissue if available, but few used the native kidney IF panel. Very few performed EM unconditionally, but most would if given specific indications. We conclude that actual nephropathology practices within the Renal Pathology Society are geographically uniform and similar to published best practices, with divergence in performing IF and EM on the basis of specimen adequacy and clinical input, particularly in transplant biopsies.",

This is particularly true in the field of cancer biomarker research, where TMAs can be used for candidate biomarker validation and association with patient clinical, pathologic, and outcomes parameters. In this review, we examine the effect of TMA use on prostate cancer biomarker research, focusing on the types of TMAs that have been used, and the biomarkers that have been examined. The results demonstrate that TMAs have been very effective in screening candidate biomarkers for subsequent, extended evaluation in large patient populations. In addition, the use of TMAs in multiple biomarker series allows for the statistical analysis of sets of biomarkers as diagnostic or prognostic tests. The processes used here can be applied to any tumor type to improve patient diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response prediction.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, particularly in magnetic resonance imaging, have led to substantially improved spatial anatomic resolution such that subtle or small central nervous system lesions, which could go undetected on gross examination of brain sections, are now readily identified on imaging. Although neuroimaging is generally considered the surrogate of gross neuropathology, it is still not a substitute for tissue diagnosis. Rather, it can be a valuable tool for the surgical pathologist in the process of formulating a differential diagnosis based on location and imaging features, as well as in identifying radiologic/pathologic discordance, such as the possible undersampling of a heterogenous glioma, which could lead to underestimation of the tumor grade. The following review focuses on the application of neuroimaging techniques, mainly magnetic resonance imaging, to the histologic diagnosis of central nervous system lesions, and the correlation of imaging features of infiltrative gliomas with histologic findings pertinent to tumor grading. The use of advanced functional magnetic resonance methods, specifically diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy is also discussed, as well as the common pitfalls in imaging interpretation.",

The diagnosis, classification, and treatment of these tumors still cause some degree of difficulty due to their low incidence and morphologic heterogeneity. This is particularly true for thymic epithelial neoplasms, that is, thymoma and thymic carcinoma, and also applies to primary neuroendocrine carcinomas of the thymus and primary mediastinal germ cell tumors. The appropriate staging of these tumors, likewise, has been a matter of debate over the years and numerous proposals for the staging of thymic epithelial neoplasms have been put forward in the last few decades. Unfortunately, variations of such proposals have been used in some instances to stage other tumors such as thymic neuroendocrine carcinomas and germ cell tumors, which has led to the often inappropriate use of a single staging system for different types of tumors with different biological behavior. This review will provide an overview of the staging of primary mediastinal tumors with special emphasis on more recent assessments in this particular area.",

Not surprisingly, amongst the many mysteries still surrounding his person is the cause of his death, and particularly the suspicion that he was poisoned, continue to intrigue medical historians. After the defeat of the Napoleonic Army at the battle of Waterloo in 1815, Napoleon was exiled to the small island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he died 6 years later. Although his personal physician, Dr François Carlo Antommarchi, stated in his autopsy report that stomach cancer was the cause of death, this diagnosis was challenged in 1961 by the finding of an elevated arsenic concentration in one of Napoleon's hair samples. At that time it was suggested that Napoleon had been poisoned by one of his companions in exile who was allegedly supported by the British Government. Since then Napoleon's cause of death continues to be a topic of debate. The aim of this review is to use a multidisciplinary approach to provide a systematic and critical assessment of Napoleon's cause of death.",

This review synthesizes published data regarding the expression of S100P in urothelial carcinoma across histological grade and variant patterns, and in other malignancies, in an effort to summarize the state of understanding of this marker and evaluate its potential. We provide also a broad comparison of S100P with other contemporary and traditional urothelial markers and outline the potential utility of S100P in various diagnostically challenging scenarios. Taken in context, we recommend that to provide immunohistochemical support for consideration of urothelial differentiation, S100P may be included in a panel of markers (due to its high sensitivity), with better established (GATA3) and more specific (uroplakin 2) markers, for comparison with corresponding markers of other primary sites under consideration, depending on the clinical context. We emphasize that the overall most appropriate panel for any given case depends on the differential diagnosis engendered by the morphology encountered, and the constellation of clinical findings. As always with immunohistochemical panels, expected positive and negative markers for each diagnostic consideration should be included. Finally, since as of date there are no optimally sensitive or specific markers of urothelial differentiation, all final diagnoses relying on immunohistochemical support should be made in the appropriate clinical and histological context.",

Case 1 was an adult female patient who underwent thoracic surgery to remove a posterior mediastinal bronchogenic cyst, which was discovered on a computed tomography scan performed after an episode of pneumonia when traction bronchiectasis with interstitial lung disease/fibrosis was also suspected in the lungs. Histologic examination performed on the resected lung tissue revealed numerous scattered small osseous spicules on a background of intense interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, leading to further clinical and laboratory investigations and the final diagnosis of DPO secondary to lung involvement by scleroderma. Case 2 was an adult male patient who underwent thoracoscopic exploration after a computed tomography scan, which revealed traction bronchiectasis with linear thickening of the interstitial lung tissue. Histologic examination of the lung tissue specimen revealed numerous osseous spicules in the absence of interstitial septal inflammation. Noteworthy in this case were also some nodules of collagenized tissue similar to those seen in the lungs of patients affected by Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The absence of any clinical sign or symptoms related to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome attest to the nonspecificity of these pulmonary fibrous nodules. No case of DPO secondary to scleroderma has been reported in the literature so far, although around half of the patients with scleroderma manifest pulmonary diseases. Idiopathic DPO is even rarer, usually discovered postmortem, with only 20 cases diagnosed in life with lung biopsies taken by open surgery or through a thoracoscopic approach. DPO is often misdiagnosed radiologically as bronchiectasis and/or interstitial lung disease/fibrosis.",

Although it is believed to originate from the serous (mainly peritoneal) membranes, intracranial, sinonasal, intraosseous, and other soft tissue sites are also documented. A chromosomal translocation t(11:22)(p13;q12) signature that fuses EWSR1 and WT1 genes results in the production of a chimeric protein with transcriptional regulatory activity that drives oncogenesis. Integration of clinical, morphologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic data is necessary to arrive at the correct diagnosis, especially when the tumor arises in an atypical site. A 15-year-old male presented with hematuria and was found to have a large renal tumor associated with adrenal, liver, lung, and bone metastases. Histopathologic and immunophenotypic features were distinctive for DSRCT. This diagnosis was confirmed by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization and cytogenetic analysis, which documented the pathognomonic t(11;22) translocation, and by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on snap-frozen tissue, which revealed the EWSR1/WT1-specific chimeric transcript. Despite high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy targeted to a single T11 vertebral metastasis, the disease progressed, and the patient died 4 years after the diagnosis. A search of electronic databases for DSRCT yielded 16 cases of well-documented renal primaries out of around 1570 cases from all sites gathered from the global literature. Desmoplastic small round blue cell tumor and other primary renal tumors considered in the differential diagnosis with DSRCT are discussed.",

Beyond standard diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, such as those used for Lynch syndrome, mutations in KRAS exon 2 are well established as predictive for lack of response to the antiepidermal growth factor receptor therapies panitumumab and cetuximab. Recent studies have extended these findings by demonstrating that mutations in KRAS exons 3 and 4 and in NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4 (with all KRAS and NRAS mutations collectively referred to as RAS) are also predictive for treatment outcomes among patients with mCRC receiving panitumumab and cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy or as monotherapy. Consequently, evaluation of these additional loci has been incorporated into current clinical guidelines, and pathologists will need to develop testing procedures and algorithms to reliably and rapidly evaluate RAS status. With the increased number of mutations that must be examined to evaluate the status of RAS and other emerging biomarkers, next-generation sequencing technologies are likely to become increasingly important in mCRC testing. This review describes new considerations for pathologists that have arisen as a consequence of the incorporation of additional biomarker testing into clinical practice for mCRC.",

Using these data-proven target areas, and employing current Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education recommendations and patient safety literature, a strategy for delivering relevant patient safety training is proposed. Teaching patient safety to pathology trainees is a challenging, yet necessary, component of AP training programs. By analyzing the patient safety errors that occur in the AP department, relevant and actionable training can be developed. This provides quality professional development and improves overall performance as trainees are integrated into laboratory systems.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been increasingly used to treat various malignant neoplasms. Despite their superior efficacy in treating certain ones, their global immune-activation effect leads to systemic side effects, referred to as immune-related adverse events. Immune-related adverse events affect a variety of organs, including the skin, gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and endocrine organs. Gastrointestinal tract immune-related adverse events present with a wide range of symptoms with variable severity, which may lead to treatment interruption and administration of immunosuppression therapy in many cases. Histopathologic changes are diverse, overlapping with many other conditions. Therefore, recognizing these changes is crucial in diagnosing immune-related adverse events. This review discusses the pathologic manifestations of gastrointestinal immune-related adverse events and discusses the primary differential diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "Inactivation of different subunits of the SWItch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex has emerged as one of the most frequent genetic pathways driving a variety of neoplasms of diverse histogenesis, originating in different organs. With few exceptions, most SWI/SNF-deficient malignancies pursue a highly aggressive clinical course resulting in widespread disease dissemination either at or soon after diagnosis, ultimately causing patients’ death soon after diagnosis, despite the apparently curative treatment intention. To date, no satisfactorily effective systemic chemotherapy has been established for treating these diseases. This disappointing finding underlines the urgent need for an effective systemic therapy that would enable sufficient intermediate to long-term disease control. Recently, SWI/SNF-deficiency has increasingly emerged as pivotal in cancer immunogenicity and hence a promising biomarker predicting response to immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy utilizing several recently established drugs. This review summarizes the most recent literature on this topic with emphasis on the entities that most likely represent suitable candidates for immune therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women globally. Historically, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was considered necessary for the development of both precursor and invasive epithelial tumors of the cervix; however, studies in the last decade have shown that a significant proportion of cervical carcinomas are HPV-independent (HPVI). The 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Female Genital Tumors separates both squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and endocervical adenocarcinomas (ECAs) by HPV status into HPV-associated (HPVA) and HPVI tumors. The classification further indicates that, in contrast to endocervical adenocarcinomas, HPVI and HPVA SCCs cannot be distinguished by morphological criteria alone and suggests that HPV testing or correlates thereof are required for correct classification. Moreover, while HPVA SCC precursor lesions (ie, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) are well known and characterized, precursors to HPVI SCCs have only been described recently in a small number of cases. We studied 670 cases of SCCs from the International Squamous Cell Carcinoma Project (ISCCP) to analyze the reproducibility of recognition of invasive SCC growth patterns, presence of lymphovascular space invasion, tumor grade, and associations with patient outcomes. Consistent with previous studies, we found histologic growth patterns and tumor types had limited prognostic implications. In addition, we describe the wide morphologic spectrum of HPVA and HPVI SCCs and their precursor lesions, including tumor growth patterns, particular and peculiar morphologic features that can lead to differential diagnoses, and the role of ancillary studies in the diagnosis of these tumors.",

For MDS, the significance of detecting mutations in SF3B1 , usually associated with ring sideroblasts, as well as the poor prognosis of mutations of TP53 are now included. For AML, new genetic categories are included, and the classification now incorporates additional clinically significant gene mutations by recognizing AML with TP53 mutation and AML with mutations in genes associated with prior therapy or MDS. Finally, the new category of MDS/AML is introduced for adult patients without recurrent de novo genetic abnormalities with 10% to 19% peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts that allow for more treatment flexibility based on clinical findings.

However, it is not uncommon that liver biopsies reveal normal or near normal histologic findings in patients with abnormal liver biochemistries, elevated autoantibodies, clinical findings suggestive of portal hypertension, systemic autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, hepatomegaly, cirrhosis by imaging, or other indications. These scenarios present significant diagnostic challenges and are rarely discussed in detail in the literature or textbooks. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of a group of selected rare liver diseases, with a focus on metabolic, storage and inclusion disorders, that may exhibit a near-normal histology on biopsy. By recognizing subtle histologic features and correlating with clinical history, laboratory results and imaging findings, it is often possible to narrow down the differential diagnosis. In many cases, this integrative approach can yield a definitive diagnosis, allowing for tailored treatment and better patient outcomes.",

There appears to exist a spectrum of lesions in the lung that have the potential to overlap with LCNEC, compounding the difficulties inherent in making a diagnosis for what is essentially a rare lesion that most general pathologists have limited experience with. Moreover, the broad definition of LCNEC by the World Health Organization (WHO) has the potential for classifying tumors that may not clearly belong in this group under this category.

The conference proceedings on urachal neoplasms (except for their molecular features) are published elsewhere. The rationale for convening this conference was the lack of structured and consented pathologic recommendations in these rare lesions. Consensus by participants was reached on the following statements: (1) intestinal metaplasia with dysplasia is considered to be a precursor to primary bladder adenocarcinoma; (2) dysplasia arising from cystitis glandularis should be reported in terms of focality (focal or nonfocal) and grade (low or high); (3) the term “adenocarcinoma” should only be used for carcinomas showing pure (nonurothelial) morphology and should not be used interchangeably in urothelial carcinoma with “glandular differentiation” because of the pathobiological differences and management implications; (4) the different histologic subtypes of bladder adenocarcinoma should be specified in the report; (5) immunohistochemistry has an ancillary role in the work up of bladder adenocarcinoma versus gastrointestinal or Müllerian-type adenocarcinomas; (6) lymphovascular invasion should be included as a parameter when reporting bladder adenocarcinoma; (7) representative or targeted sampling will be sufficient for bladder diverticulum resection specimens; and (8) molecular analysis in genomic profiling should be performed only in advanced or metastatic bladder and urachal adenocarcinomas for targetable therapy. This report on glandular (nonurachal) lesions of the bladder from the Dublin ISUP consensus conference will serve as a best practice recommendation and as a guide for future research on these relatively rare lesions.",

These neoplasms are thought to arise from the extranodal equivalent of the lymph node marginal zone. Two recurrent chromosomal translocations, to date, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms. The t(11;18)(q21;q21), which is far more common, disrupts the api 2 gene on chromosome 11q21 and the malt 1 (mlt) gene on chromosome 18q21, resulting in the synthesis of a novel fusion gene and protein, API2-MALT1. The t(1;14)(p22;q32), which is uncommon, juxtaposes the bcl-10 gene on chromosome 1p22 adjacent to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene on chromosome 14, wherein BCL10 is overexpressed via the influence of the IgH enhancer. BCL-10 may then form a complex with MALT1 in the cell. Both translocations result in increased inhibition of apoptosis, conferring a survival advantage. Recent work suggests that API2-MALT1 and BCL-10-MALT1 may activate NF-k B and a common downstream signaling pathway.",

Why the definition of the carcinoma is so elusive is unclear. Perhaps one way to address the problem is to relate what the papillary squamous cell carcinoma is not. It is not the verrucous carcinoma nor is it the exophytic, conventional squamous cell carcinoma, which is usually broad-based, well-to-moderately differentiated, most often keratinizing, and with an easily defined invasive (endophytic) component. To date, however, the few reports dealing with papillary squamous cell carcinoma have muddied diagnostic waters by definitely not excluding these other forms of squamous cell carcinoma. Three different perceptions of papillary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract are presented in the commentary. Not only are the descriptions and depictions of the cytomorphology different among the three, so too are the biologic courses and responses to therapy. We believe the papillary squamous cell carcinoma is a separable and definable clinicopathologic entity. The reader is left to choose.",

In addition, mass production and distribution of food, on a global rather than a local scale, make it possible for localized instances of contamination to spread quickly to other states, provinces, and countries. Infectious organisms are often recovered by microbiological methods, but surgical pathologists may play a very valuable role in diagnosis. This review will focus on the diagnosis of food-borne infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, including those that mimic other inflammatory conditions of the gut (such as ischemia or idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease); available diagnostic methods; and gastrointestinal infectious processes that pathologists should be aware of in terms of potential biologic weapons threats.",

Immunohistochemistry has facilitated the diagnosis of many mesenchymal tumors; however, there is considerable overlap in the staining profiles among cells demonstrating fibroblastic and myofibroblastic differentiation. It has been our experience that soft tissue tumors associated with abundant extracellular collagen deposition commonly cause problems in classification. One reason for this is that tumors displaying this morphology include representatives from different histogenetic families. Specifically, tumors exhibiting fibroblastic, myofibroblastic and even lipomatous differentiation may manifest as a densely collagenous mass. It is the purpose of this review to highlight these collagen-rich soft tissue tumors.",

In this context, OCT4 was observed to be a highly reliable marker for metastatic germ cell tumors that contained components of seminoma or embryonal carcinoma. The results of this study indicate that OCT4 immunohistochemistry is a useful diagnostic tool for establishing the germ cell origin of a metastatic tumor and suggest a potential role for OCT4 in the immunohistochemical assessment of carcinomas of unknown primary origin.",

Two pathology-specific measures were instituted in 2008; 1 for breast cancer reporting and the other for colon cancer reporting. In 2009, Current Procedural Terminology Category II code 3250F was instituted, which allows proper coding of cases from metastatic sites when ICD 9 code and Current Procedural Terminology Category I inclusion criteria are met. After the review of the 2007 data obtained from other specialties, submission of invalid codes was predominantly attributed to failure to adhere to measurement specifications. With increased awareness and experience, the amount of invalid code submission will decrease. More performance measures would be needed to make the program available to more pathologists. PQRI is thought by many to be the first step in transforming to a Pay for Performance Program",

In this review, we will discuss several commonly encountered situations in pediatric pathology: the evaluation of pediatric esophageal eosinophilia, a child who has swallowed a non food item, caustic substance, or hot liquid, the evaluation of a pediatric colorectal biopsy with focal active colitis, and the evaluation of rectal suction biopsies for Hirschsprung disease. With each topic, we will discuss a general approach to the case, diagnostic tips, and how to avoid commonly encountered pitfalls.

By contrast, those arising in the setting of autoimmune diseases are more heterogeneous, not always overtly neoplastic and mechanistically complex. This heterogeneity and complexity is based upon, among others, the nature of the underlying disease as well as the variability of different and sometimes sequential or concomitant therapeutic interventions.",

The correlation is influenced by multiple closely interdependent clinical and pathologic factors. Many of these factors including the sensitivity and accuracy of colposcopy-directed biopsy, the diligence of the colposcopist, and the attributes of the cervical lesion represent \"preanalytical\" factors which can significantly affect the CHC outcome, but are often less emphasized during CHC process. The status of \"gold standard\" of cervical biopsy histology will be less \"golden\" if clinicians miss, during colposcopy, the lesion which had been flagged by cytology. CHC also serves as one of the important assurance tools to monitor and improve the pathology laboratory overall quality, and the ability of the pathologists to enhance their diagnostic interpretation. As pathologists, we should make every effort to improve on CHC, by applying systematic approaches, both in technical laboratory and interpretive diagnosis, which increase yield and reduce diagnostic discrepancies. The widespread use of Human Papilloma Virus testing and p16 immunohistochemistry have significantly enhanced diagnostic accuracy both in cytology and in histology. Herein, we review the intimate relationships and factors that may govern discrepancies between cytology, colposcopy-directed biopsies, and biopsies with subsequent Loop Electroexcision Procedure for cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions. Ultimately the projected risk for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and cancer and the suggested management guidelines are directly tied in with effective CHC.",

The treatment of bladder cancer has remained unchanged for the last several decades. However, in recent years the availability of comprehensive genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other large projects have considerably improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of these tumors. These studies demonstrated that bladder cancers can be grouped into 2 broad categories namely basal and luminal molecular subtypes with recognizable subgroups in each of these categories. Clinical data suggest that invasive basal cancers are more sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), such that most patients with basal cancers who are aggressively managed with NAC have excellent outcomes. Patients with luminal cancers do not appear to derive much clinical benefit from NAC, but some may appear to be sensitive to anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) antibodies and possibly other immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is hoped that future studies will also identify biomarkers such as immunohistochemical markers which may be used to predict therapeutic response of these tumors. This will contribute substantially toward efficient and cost-effective diagnosis and management of these neoplasms.",

This review provides a summary and an update on current guidelines for histological evaluation of treatment effect after neoadjuvant therapy, also known as regression grading, and discusses newer data focusing on areas of evolving questions and controversies, such as the gross examination of the tumor and tumor bed, weighted versus unweighted evaluation approaches, discussion of histologic tumor type-specific cut-offs for major pathologic response, assessment of lymph nodes and regression grading after immunotherapy and targeted therapy. As no data or recommendations exist on regression grading of multiple tumor nodules, a practical approach is recommended.

Antibodies for a variety of other targets such as epidermal growth factor receptors, for example, have lacked sufficient sensitivity and specificity to cover the range of mutations that may occur and are generally not recommended in lieu of molecular testing with the exception of limited resource settings. IHC is also used as a predictive marker for response to immunotherapy through evaluation of programmed death ligand 1 expression. In addition, multiple antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are under investigation, designed to deliver drugs directly to tumor cells through binding to specific target antigens. Some ADCs have already received accelerated FDA approval, and IHC was incorporated in many clinical trials evaluating ADC efficacy.

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) is generally straightforward using a combination of histologic evaluation and pertinent immunohistochemical staining with CD117/kit and DOG-1 (discovered on GIST) antibodies. However, this tumor can be challenging in cases with an unusual morphology, in limited biopsies, for those in uncommon sites, post-treatment, and when other neoplasms express CD117/kit and DOG-1, thereby mimicking GIST. Finding epithelioid GISTs in the stomach in younger patients should prompt testing for succinate dehydrogenase (SHD)-deficiency using immunohistochemical staining for subunit B (SDHB). However, SDH-deficient GISTs can also arise in older patients, or as part of the Carney triad or Carney-Stratakis syndrome. GISTs with PDGFRA mutations can also prove difficult if they lack kit expression. It is also important to consider morphologic and immunophenotypic changes associated with treatment, including the potential absence of kit expression, particularly in GISTs that have metastasized. Therefore, obtaining clinical information regarding prior therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is crucial.",

    "abstract": "HPV-independent squamous cell carcinomas of the vulva comprise the majority of vulvar cancers, but their putative precancers represent only a small proportion of the vulvar squamous intraepithelial lesions that are encountered in routine practice. The precancerous lesions of HPV-independent vulvar squamous cell carcinoma encompass a spectrum of lesions that, collectively, may pose significant diagnostic challenges. Included in this spectrum are differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia [dVIN], the prototypical lesion of the group, which is characterized by a high propensity for progression, a relatively short duration to progression, frequent association with lichen sclerosus, and according to our review of the recent literature, TP53 /p53 aberration in 50% to 95% (mean 77.4%) of cases. Regarding the latter, some authors consider TP53 /p53 aberration to be a diagnostic requirement for dVIN, although this is controversial, as discussed further herein. Also included in the spectrum of lesions that are considered in this review are possibly related HPV-independent, p53-wild type lesions that have historically been reported as “vulvar acanthosis with altered differentiation” (VAAD), “differentiated exophytic vulvar intraepithelial lesion” (DEVIL), “verruciform lichen simplex chronicus” (vLSC), and which more recently, have collectively been described as “verruciform acanthotic vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (vaVIN)” or “vulvar aberrant maturation (VAM).” In this review, we perform a comprehensive clinicopathologic review of putative precancerous lesions of HPV-independent squamous cell carcinomas of the vulva, with an emphasis on recent developments in terminology, practical diagnostic issues, biomarkers, and pathogenesis.",

Developments in the molecular pathology of the sarcoma and cytogenetically related tumors have not only provided considerable diagnostic assistance but also have opened new views on the classification of a formerly heterogeneous group of neoplasms. Chromosome translocations t(11;22) (q24;q12) and t(21;22) (q22;1q12) and their chimeric fusion oncoproteins are now the hallmarks of the Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor family. In this review, we present the molecular basis of this family and its interrelationships, summarize advances in diagnosis, and relate these to prognosis.

In addition, isolated cases of multiple miscellaneous tumors have been reported. Proliferative and neoplastic disorders are categorized as lesions of undetermined pathogenesis; however, there are certain factors that are suggested to be related to their pathogenesis. The symptoms related to them may be atypical or difficult to appreciate, and proliferative and neoplastic disorders may clinically mimic an opportunistic infection. The type and site of proliferative and neoplastic disorder also tends to be atypical as compared with those seen in non HIV-infected children.

    "abstract": "The glomerular filtration barrier is composed of endothelial cells, basement membrane, and podocytes. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular structure of the filtration barrier and its relation to the effectiveness of the barrier function. The glomerular basement membrane is composed of a multitude of proteins, including collagen IV, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and laminin, among others. The slit diaphragm, which is seen as a membrane covering the space between adjacent foot processes close to the basement membrane, is an extremely important structure with a crucial role in permselectivity of the filtration barrier. Its composition is now understood to consist primarily of a unique protein called nephrin. Mutations in the gene-encoding nephrin are known to result in the Finnish type of nephrotic syndrome. The exact mechanism by which nephrin controls permselectivity is not yet clear, but it is known to interact with several podocyte proteins including CD2AP, podocin, and alpha-actinin-4. Abnormalities of any of these proteins may result in proteinuria. The role of nephrin and its associated proteins in the pathogenesis of common acquired glomerulopathies in humans is still under investigation. Normal function of podocyte also depends upon maintaining a fully mature and terminally differentiated phenotype. A host of transcription factors, especially WT1 and PAX2, play a significant role in modulating podocyte function.",

Recent molecular studies, particularly those examining alterations in the E-cadherin gene, provide compelling evidence to support a role for lobular neoplasia as a direct precursor to invasive lobular carcinoma. These molecular studies also provide early insights into the biologic relationship of atypical lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ. The ability to stratify lobular neoplasia into high-risk and low-risk categories based on molecular attributes is on the horizon. With this ability will come an evolution in our thinking, diagnosis, and management of this enigmatic disease.",

In situ hybridization (ISH) studies have become well entrenched in surgical pathology practice and their role in the evaluation of HER2 in breast carcinoma and their diagnostic utility in soft tissue pathology are well known. Fluorescent ISH is being increasingly used in other sites such as the head and neck and the gynecologic tract. Like most tests in surgical pathology, ISH studies require good quality tissue, correlation with clinical and histopathologic findings, and adherence to guidelines for optimal assay performance and interpretation. Although ISH studies are largely performed in tertiary centers, the tissue is often processed by a variety of laboratories and the referring pathologists are required to discuss the need, relevance, and significance of these tests and the results with their clinical colleagues. Here we review the predictive and diagnostic utility of fluorescent ISH studies in a variety of organ systems, the preanalytical factors that may affect the results, and the pitfalls in the interpretation that all practicing surgical pathologists should be aware of.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent gene fusions have been thought to play a central role in leukemias, lymphomas, and sarcomas, but they have been neglected in carcinomas, largely because of technical limitations of cytogenetics. In the past few years, an increasing number of recurrent gene fusions have been recognized in epithelial cancers. The majority of prostate cancers, for example, have an androgen-regulated fusion of one of the ETS transcription factor gene family. Notably, the fusion genes can often serve as specific diagnostic markers, criteria of molecular classification and therefore potential therapeutic targets. Recent studies have focused on investigations of morphologic features (phenotype) of recurrent gene fusions (genotype) in malignancies. In this review, we will summarize the histologic features of known recurrent genomic rearrangements in carcinomas, especially focusing on TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in prostate cancer, EML4-ALK in lung cancer, ETV6-NTRK3 in secretory breast cancer, RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ1 rearrangements in thyroid cancer. In addition, we will describe how these features could potentially be used to alert the pathologists of the diagnosis of fusion-positive tumor. A combination of histologic validation with other screening strategies (eg, immunohistochemistry) for recognition of recurrent gene fusions is also highlighted.",

Microscopically KS may enter the differential diagnosis with several different entities, and for this purpose the immunohistochemical detection of the viral latent nuclear antigen-1 (LNA-1) may be crucial. Sporadic KS is usually benign, but rarely it may be aggressive. Anaplastic histology heralds an ominous course in any clinical context. We report a case of anaplastic retroperitoneal KS, occurring in an HIV-negative adult man. This patient presented with a huge left suprarenal mass, which was totally resected, and initially diagnosed as inflammatory leiomyosarcoma, because of the monomorphic spindle cell tumor morphology. After 12 years the tumor recurred locally as an unresectable mass, which was biopsied and examined. At the time of recurrence, the histologic slides of the primary tumor were reviewed, and the previous diagnosis was changed to that of atypical KS. Histologically the recurrent tumor showed both spindle cell and epithelioid appearances. Strongly diffuse HHV8/LAN-1 immunopositivity was documented in both tumors. The final diagnosis for the entire case was anaplastic KS. Then, the patient died in a few months.",

    "abstract": "Mucous gland adenomas represent a small percentage of primary lung neoplasms. The accurate diagnosis of these benign tumors can be challenging not only on resected specimens but also more challenging in small bronchoscopic biopsies. If to that problem we add the issue that these tumors may also exist in the periphery of the lung, then it is easy to conclude that there is much difficulty in properly diagnosing these tumors with a core needle biopsy. Furthermore, there is little knowledge on the immunohistochemical properties and radiologic features of these tumors. Therefore, pathologists need to be aware of the spectrum of histopathologic features in these tumors and place them in perspective regarding the proper radiologic and immunohistochemical correlations. Needless to say, mucous gland adenomas exhibit a gamut of histopathologic features that can be easily confused with other more common tumor of the lung. Therefore, awareness of such features become essential in a benign tumor that is essentially diagnosed on morphologic grounds.",

Although common and widely recognized, relatively little is known about the pathophysiological underpinnings of the starry sky pattern. Its resemblance to a similar pattern seen in the germinal centers of secondary follicles suggests a possible starting point for understanding the molecular basis of the starry sky pattern and potential routes for its exploitation for therapeutic purposes.

However, in the contemporary literature with the improvements in imaging modalities (computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging) and other health care screening services, metastatic tumors to the kidney are being diagnosed more frequently in surgical specimens. The utility of needle core biopsies in the primary evaluation of renal masses has also increased the number of sampled metastases, and as a result, only limited histologic material is available for evaluation in some cases and may potentially lead to diagnostic pitfalls. In the last decade, a few large clinical series have been published. In these series, the majority of metastatic tumors to the kidney are carcinomas, with the lung being the most common primary site. A significant number of the various tumor types with metastasis to the kidney are also associated with widespread metastases to other organs, and the renal metastasis may present several years after diagnosis of the primary tumor. The majority of secondary tumors of the kidney are asymptomatic, incidentally discovered, and solitary. There should be a high index of suspicion of metastasis to the kidney in patients with an associated enlarging renal lesion with minimal to no enhancement on imaging and tumor progression of a known high-grade nonrenal malignancy. Secondary tumors of the kidney can be accurately diagnosed by correlating histopathologic features with clinical and radiographic findings and the judicious use of ancillary studies.",

CT is the primary imaging modality used in staging. MRI has superior contrast resolution compared with CT and can add value in terms of determining surgical resectability in equivocal cases. MRI can further assess the degree of local invasion, particularly into the mediastinum, chest wall, and diaphragm, for malignant pleural and pericardial mesotheliomas. FDG PET/CT plays a role in the diagnosis and staging of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and has been shown to be more accurate than CT, MRI, and PET alone in the staging of malignant pleural mesothelioma. PET/CT can also be used to target lesions for biopsy and to assess prognosis, treatment response, and tumor recurrence.",

However, the underlying mechanisms contributing to immune impairment and immune responses are diverse. Loss or reduced expression of the HLA class I molecules are major characteristics of human cancers resulting in an impaired recognition of tumor cells by CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This is of clinical relevance and associated with worse patients outcome and limited efficacy of T-cell-based immunotherapies. Here, we summarize the role of HLA class I antigens in cancers by focusing on the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for HLA class I defects, which are caused by either structural alterations or deregulation at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational levels. In addition, the influence of HLA class I abnormalities to adaptive and acquired immunotherapy resistances will be described. The in-depth knowledge of the different strategies of malignancies leading to HLA class I defects can be applied to design more effective cancer immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Despite the innovations made to enhance smarter screening and conservative management for low-grade prostate cancer, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment remains a major health care problem. Driven by the primary goal of reducing harm to the patients, relabeling of nonlethal grade group 1 (GG 1) prostate cancer has been proposed but faced varying degrees of support and objection from clinicians and pathologists. GG 1 tumor exhibits histologic (invasive) and molecular features of cancer but paradoxically, if pure, is unable to metastasize, rarely extends out of the prostate, and if resected, has a cancer-specific survival approaching 100%. Most of the arguments against relabeling GG 1 relate to concerns of missing a higher-grade component through the unsampled area at biopsy. However, the designation of tumor benignity or malignancy should not be based on the shortcomings of a diagnostic procedure and sampling errors. This review explores possible solutions, mainly the feasibility of renaming GG 1 in radical prostatectomy (RP) with ramifications in biopsy diagnosis, acceptable for both pathologists and clinicians. One workable approach is to rename GG 1 in RP with a cautious neutral or nonbenign non-cancer term (eg, acinar neoplasm) using \"defined criteria\" that will stop the indiscriminate reporting of every GG 1 in biopsy as carcinoma including eventual insignificant microtumors in RPs. Use of a corresponding noncommittal term at biopsy while commenting on the possibility of an undersampled nonindolent cancer, might reduce the pathologist's concerns about upgrading. Dropping the word \"carcinoma\" in biopsy preempts the negative consequences of labeling the patient with cancer, including unnecessary definitive therapy (the root cause of overtreatment). Renaming should retain the status quo of contemporary grading and risk stratifications for management algorithms while trying to minimize overtreatment. However, the optimal approach to find answers to this issue is through multidisciplinary discussions of key stakeholders with a specific focus on patient-centered concerns and their ramifications in our practices. GG 1 renaming has been brought up in the past and came up again despite the continued counterarguments, and if not addressed more comprehensively will likely continue to reemerge as overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and patient's sufferings persist.",

It has an incidence of <0.05% and comprises <2% of all mesotheliomas; however, it is the most common primary malignancy of the pericardium. PM should be distinguished from secondary involvement by the spread of pleural mesothelioma or metastases, which are more common. Although data are controversial, the association between asbestos exposure and PM is less documented than that with other mesotheliomas. Late clinical presentation is common. Symptoms may be nonspecific but are usually related to pericardial constriction or cardiac tamponade, and diagnosis can be challenging usually requiring multiple imaging modalities. Echocardiography, computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance demonstrate heterogeneously enhancing thickened pericardium, usually encasing the heart, with findings of constrictive physiology. Tissue sampling is essential for diagnosis. Histologically, similar to mesotheliomas elsewhere in the body, PM is classified as epithelioid, sarcomatoid, or biphasic, with the biphasic type being the most common. Combined with morphologic assessment, the use of immunohistochemistry and other ancillary studies is helpful for distinguishing mesotheliomas from benign proliferative processes and other neoplastic processes. The prognosis of PM is poor with about 22% 1-year survival. Unfortunately, the rarity of PM poses limitations for comprehensive and prospective studies to gain further insight into the pathobiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PM.",

The term atypical hepatocellular neoplasm/hepatocellular neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential can be used especially in needle core biopsies when a well-differentiated hepatocellular lesion is either histologically atypical (focal reticulin loss, focal cytologic/architectural atypia) or is clinically atypical (male sex or female >50 y) and cannot be confidently classified as adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. These are resected in an attempt for more definite classification. Although radiology can suggest the diagnosis in some of the entities mentioned above, needle core biopsies are often performed to confirm the diagnosis and plan therapy. Diagnosis of these lesions on needle core biopsies can be challenging and may have overlapping histologic and sometimes even immunohistochemical features. Herein, we review the histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of well-differentiated hepatocellular lesions, along with recent advances in this area. We also provide the best approach for the diagnosis of well-differentiated hepatocellular lesions with ancillary testing, especially on needle core biopsies, and discuss the pitfalls. Accurate recognition of well-differentiated hepatocellular lesions is essential as some of them have excellent prognosis and may not require resection, while others have histologic prognostic information that is key for management.",

Twitter has historically been (and still seems to be) a positive platform for the social media pathology community to engage with each other virtually (ie, PathTwitter). However, as a new era of Twitter leadership began to unfold in October 2022, a young platform called “Mastodon” began to gain notice within this community as the hashtag #PathMastodon became prevalent. Founded in 2016 by Eugen Rochko, Mastodon is a decentralized, open-sourced, ads-free platform intended to promote public knowledge in a safe and public manner. When compared with Twitter, however, Mastodon is globally much smaller, and its medical professional server called “Med-Mastodon” is more cumbersome with certain features (eg, tracking analytics and username changes). Nevertheless, this new platform, which looks and feels much like Twitter, has great potential to provide continued medical education and virtual excellence among the social media pathology community. Thus, the purpose of this review is to provide a relevant synopsis of how Mastodon, Med-Mastodon, and #PathMastodon may benefit pathologists, trainees, and medical students who use social media. A qualitative analysis of pertinent peer-reviewed and non–peer-reviewed materials relative to the topic will be performed. In addition, we will provide a comparison of Mastodon and Twitter, provide example figures of #PathMastodon and related posts, and elaborate on the importance this discussion brings to the social media pathology community.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia trachomatis infection is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease. The authors examined the relation between chronic endometritis, which they term plasma cell endometritis (PCE), and chlamydial infection using plasmid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of paraffin-embedded endometrial sections. C. trachomatis infection was detected in 5 (24%) of 21 cases of PCE and in 1 (4%) of histologically normal endometrium. The diagnosis of chronic endometritis (with plasma cells confirmed by methyl green pyronin staining) was correctly made in 74% of the cases originally diagnosed as PCE and in 23% of control cases originally diagnosed as normal. The authors conclude that the histopathologic finding of plasma cells in endometrial samples should encourage further examination for chlamydial infection.",

    "abstract": "Renal transplantation is a therapeutic goal for children with advanced chronic kidney disease. There are many causes of renal dysfunction in children with allografts—the transplanted kidney can develop a variety of morphologic alterations leading to dysfunction. Evaluation of the kidney biopsy is one of the best methods of determining the cause of graft dysfunction. Rejection is a major cause of renal allograft failure in children. The morphologic hallmarks of acute antibody-mediated and cell-mediated rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy have been codified in classification strategies that are useful in adults and children. Viral infection and Epstein-Barr virus-driven posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease also occur in the pediatric transplanted kidney. Drug toxicity from immunosuppressive agents also causes characteristic morphologic alterations in the renal allograft. As the survival of pediatric heart and liver transplant patients improves, the incidence of immunosuppression therapy-related disease in the native kidney in these patients will likely become more important clinically. In addition to renal lesions related to the allograft state, glomerular disease can recur or occur de novo in renal allografts. Here, we describe the pathology of the more common morphologic lesions in kidneys of children with a renal allograft.",

However, nonsmall cell carcinoma represents a heterogenous group of tumors, and the subclassification of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma at the molecular, morphologic, and epidemiologic levels has led to the promise of precise treatment and better prognostication. Histomorphologic aspects of small peripheral adenocarcinomas that represent good prognosis include pure bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, minimal invasion within a mixed invasive and lepidic growth pattern tumor, and minimal scar within a lepidic growth pattern tumor. Activating mutations and increased gene copy number of the epidermal growth factor receptor protein and locus, respectively, have been shown to help predict responsiveness to small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung adenocarcinoma. These important concepts of morphology and molecular pathology are reviewed, and recommendations for application of these concepts to the practice of surgical pathology are provided.",

LAM most often occurs as a sporadic disease, but also occurs in women with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (syndromic LAM). There are no pathologic differences between sporadic and syndromic LAM. Sporadic LAM is a rare disease with prevalence of approximately 1 to 2 cases per million women in the United States and among populations of white descent, and is even rarer among Asian and African individuals. Syndromic LAM affects 4% to 5% of women with TSC. Sporadic LAM is often found also in association with renal angiomyolipoma, the most common sign of TSC, but LAM associated with angiomyolipoma does not define TSC. Although LAM is not diagnostic for TSC either in isolation or in association with angiomyolipoma, still it is considered by some researchers as an incomplete expression (forme fruste) of TSC. LAM may involve the lungs and the axial lymphatics and lymph nodes of the thorax and retroperitoneum. In sporadic LAM, thoracic, intraabdominal, and cervical lymph nodes can be involved with or without lung involvement. The diagnosis of LAM is often delayed. A case of LAM in a young lady, which was complicated with pleural and peritoneal chylous effusions, is presented. The diagnosis was first made on a retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy. The patient had a prolonged prior history of respiratory problems owing to lung involvement, and eventually died 2 years after diagnosis. Focus on the clinicopathologic diagnosis of TSC is also made.",

A number of benign entities of the thymus prove to be diagnostic dilemmas owing to their resemblance and association with true thymic tumors. These are usually discovered incidentally on routine imaging and most patients are either asymptomatic or present with signs and symptoms of compression of adjacent organs. The radiologic appearance of these lesions varies from simple cysts to complex masses that are suspicious for malignancy. The diagnosis is usually made purely on morphologic grounds, however, immunohistochemical stains can help rule out possible differential diagnoses. Surgical removal is usually curative in these lesions and recurrences are rare. The prognosis is excellent, however, some of these lesions may be associated with myasthenia gravis and/or thymomas. In this review, we describe non-neoplastic lesions and benign tumoral lesions of the thymus, with emphasis on the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features.

The sheer number of fatalities from the pandemic have been unlike any other in recent memory and needed the rapid creation of new protocols and paradigms to manage the situation. This required rapidly escalating mortuary capacity to manage the increased fatalities from the pandemic with the establishment of lines of communication and networking with governmental entities, institution of new policies for patient flow, and implementation of worker infection control and well-being plans. Autopsies also assumed a crucial role, both to provide insight into the pathomechanisms of a novel disease and to allow tissue retrieval necessary to power research directed towards finding a vaccine. We here outline the plan adopted by the Yale Autopsy and Mortuary Services, in alignment with the institutional mission of high-quality patient care, education, research and health care worker safety and well-being, as the Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic surged in Connecticut. In the early response phase, ensuring sufficient mortuary capacity necessarily took center stage.

    "abstract": "The interpretation of biopsy specimens in the diagnosis of thymoma is a subject that is generally not addressed in the literature. Even though the diagnosis of thymoma may seem to be an easy step in the assessment of these tumors, in reality, it is the biopsy specimen interpretation that will be use to determine course of action in any particular patient. It may determine whether a patient is a surgical candidate or on the contrary whether a patient may be benefited the most by medical therapy. In addition, there may be conditions in which all that is required is surgical resection without any further treatment, and that the evaluation of those conditions does not necessarily required the careful pathologic staging that thymomas need. In addition, it is important to highlight that in small biopsies, there are limitations not only in terms of the cellularity and other features that may not be present in such biopsy but also the limitation in term of immunohistochemical interpretation. Herein we have attempted to highlight numerous tumoral conditions that are frequently encountered in the daily practice of mediastinal pathology, some of them pose significant problems in separating them from thymomas. Needles to say, the entire spectrum of mediastinal pathology that may at any given time mimic thymoma is well beyond the scope of this review. Furthermore, we also herein emphasize the need for proper clinical and radiologic information and correlation in order to lead to a better interpretation of the biopsy specimen. The emphasis in this review is on thymoma and their possible pitfall and shortcomings while evaluating small biopsy specimens.",

The reported cases of biopsy and surgical samples with metastatic involvement have increased; however, a comprehensive understanding of secondary tumors of the prostate is currently missing. Metastases to the prostate carry a dismal prognosis and may pose serious diagnostic challenges to both clinicians and pathologists, with crucial therapeutic implications. Secondary tumors of the prostate spread more frequently from the digestive tract, the lung, and the kidney. The integration of clinicoradiologic data with appropriate pathologic and immunohistochemical analyses is essential for the identification and the characterization of secondary tumors of the prostate, whereas molecular analyses could provide additional and complementary information, enabling precise diagnosis and appropriate clinical management. Patients with solitary metastases could benefit from prostatic resection and adjuvant therapy, whereas in cases of disseminated diseases, symptom control may be obtained with palliative procedures.

In most academic and community practice settings, adrenal gland resections are encountered less frequently than other endocrine or genitourinary specimens, leading to less familiarity with evolving classifications and criteria. The unique dichotomy between cortical and medullary lesions reflects the developmental evolution of these functionally independent components. Adrenal cortical lesions at resection include hyperplasia, adenoma, and carcinoma, with some cases straddling the boundary between these distinct clinical classifications. The lack of immunohistochemical or molecular markers to definitively categorize these intermediate lesions enhances the diagnostic challenge. In addition, modified terminology for oncocytic and myxoid cortical lesions has been proposed. Medullary lesions are somewhat easier to categorize; however, the prediction of aggressive behavior in pheochromocytomas remains a challenge due to a lack of reliable prognostic biomarkers. Recent work by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project and other research groups has identified a limited subset of molecular and signaling pathway alterations in these 2 major neoplastic categories. Ongoing research to better define prognostic and predictive biomarkers in cortical and medullary lesions has the potential to enhance both pathologic diagnosis and patient therapy.",

    "abstract": "Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) is the third most common renal cell carcinoma in adults. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview highlighting the broad morphologic spectrum of ChRCC, and offer a practical approach for handling cases in daily practice. For the purpose of this review, we classify ChRCC subtypes as (1) classic, (2) eosinophilic, (3) sarcomatoid, and (4) other rare patterns. The concept of eosinophilic ChRCC has significantly evolved, yet it still is one of the major diagnostic challenges pathologists face in routine practice due to its morphologic overlap with renal oncocytoma. Rare patterns of ChRCC have been described over the last few decades, showing a wide histologic spectrum including those with adenomatoid microcystic pigmented, multicystic, neuroendocrine, small cell, and papillary features. ChRCC represents a heterogenous group of neoplasms, demonstrating varied but unique morphologic and genetic profiles. Although the field of ChRCC knowledge is still evolving, rare patterns can present diagnostic challenges if they are not known to pathologists and/or clinicians. Proper and generous tumor sampling along with careful histologic examination allow for recognition of these rare morphologies. The role of routine molecular testing appears to be limited. From a clinical management standpoint, the rare patterns of ChRCC seem to have no definite clinical implications at present and likely can be managed similarly to usual ChRCC. Finally, we will discuss distinctive novel/emerging renal neoplasms previously considered under the spectrum of ChRCC, low-grade oncocytic renal tumor and eosinophilic vacuolated tumor, with regard to their current significance and implications for future classification strategies.",

Although the histologic diagnosis of clearly benign or clearly malignant lesions is usually straightforward, problems arise in the differential diagnosis of benign “nodules” and dysplastic lesions or well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas. This is especially so in limited diagnostic material, such as cytologic preparations from fine-needle aspirates and needle-core tissue biopsies. Recently, additional helpful markers have been described that may help to establish a conclusive diagnosis even on such material. Two of these, the reticulin stain and immunohistochemical staining for CD34, have been found to be useful also in cytologic cellblock material. Telomerase, a complex enzyme that is active in most malignant tumors, has also been found to show strong activity in most hepatocellular carcinomas. Mention is made of an immunohistochemical marker (MOC-31), reported to be useful in the differentiation between metastatic adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma.",

The vacuumassisted core biopsy (VACB) (Minimal Invasive Breast Biopsy (MIBB), U.S. Surgical, Norwalk, CT; Mammotome, Biopsys Medical, Cincinnati, OH) obtains multiple tissue cores (11-gauge) in a circumferential manner around the biopsy probe, inserted under stereotactic guidance. It provides more complete sampling of mammographic lesions than the conventional 14-gauge stereotactic core biopsy, reducing the number of unsatisfactory biopsies. The advanced breast biopsy instrumentation (ABBI) (United States Surgical Corporation, Norwalk, CT) system utilizes stereotactic technique and an oscillating blade-cutting mechanism to obtain a single large diameter (5mm to 20mm) tissue core, with the aim of obtaining an intact lesion in its entirety for histologic assessment. Its potential as a treatment option is still under investigation. Suggested protocols for specimen handling are presented together with a review of the recent literature. Close liaison with radiologists and surgeons performing these biopsies will allow the collection of further outcome data to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each technique.",

    "abstract": "Axillary lymph node status is one of the most important prognostic factors in breast carcinoma. The weight of cumulative evidence suggests that the development of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy procedure has not only allowed for accurate lymph node-staging but has also helped avoid the morbidity of a full axillary dissection in those patients who are unlikely to have metastatic tumor in that location. The detection of metastases in SLNs is facilitated by the, now relatively routine, enhanced histopathologic examination via step-sectioning and immunohistochemistry. In clinical terms, the finding of a metastatic deposit that measures between 0.2 and 2 mm, that is, “micrometastasis” in a SLN is largely noncontroversial; however, the presence of smaller metastatic foci detected either by routine hematoxylin and eosin stain or by cytokeratin immunostain [<0.2 mm, ie, so-called “isolated tumor cells (ITCs)”] has remained problematic since the advent of the SLN biopsy. In this communication, attention is drawn to the broad morphologic range of metastatic disease in SLN that may be placed in the category of so-called ITC. To facilitate the reproducible classification of the various strata of minimal metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes, we recommend the following: (1) the term “isolated tumor cell” (note singular form) be restricted to cases that show the presence of only a single tumor cell. (2) In situations where there are multiple isolated single cells and/or cell cluster(s) present and each cluster measures<0.2 mm, the term “submicroscopic metastasis” be adopted and an actual count of tumor cells present may be given. (3) Restrict the use of the term micrometastasis to cases wherein the largest metastatic focus is larger than 0.2 mm but smaller than 2.0 mm.",

This article reviews digital image acquisition in the anatomic pathology setting using a consumer-type digital camera. The camera type chosen as an example for the discussion was selected for its popularity and wide use among pathologists and for its potential to function as a sole image input device in all applications combined.

    "abstract": "Human malignancies are driven by heritable alterations that lead to unchecked cellular proliferation, invasive growth and distant spread. Heritable changes can arise from changes in DNA sequence, or, alternatively, through altered gene expression rooted in epigenetic mechanisms. In recent years, high-throughput sequencing of tumor genomes has revealed a central role for mutations in epigenetic regulatory complexes in oncogenic processes. Through interactions with or direct modifications of chromatin, these proteins help control the accessibility of genes, and thus the transcriptional profile of a cell. Dysfunction in these proteins can lead to activation of oncogenic pathways or silencing of tumor suppressors. Although epigenetic regulators are altered across a broad spectrum of human malignancies, they play a particularly central role in tumors of mesenchymal and neuroectodermal origin. This review will focus on recent advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of a subset of tumors in which alterations in the polycomb family of chromatin modifying complexes, the SWI/SNF family of nucleosome remodelers, and histones play a central role in disease pathogenesis. Although this review will focus predominantly on the molecular mechanisms underlying these tumors, each section will also highlight areas in which an understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases has led to the adoption of novel immunohistochemical and molecular markers.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of a critical review of published literature, it is concluded that there is as yet insufficient evidence to conclude that the melanocytic lesion, which is currently known as \"lentiginous melanoma,\" is a full-fledged melanoma, with the capacity to metastasize to distant sites and to cause the demise of the patient. It is proposed that this lesion is better designated as \"lentiginous SAMPUS,\" that is, a superficial atypical melanocytic proliferation of uncertain significance, with a lentiginous, or predominantly lentiginous, arrangement of the junctional component. As there is uncertainty regarding its actual metastatic potential or the likelihood of progression to melanoma NOS, the lesion should be removed completely, with free surgical margins.",

These challenges relate to unique aspects of molecular genetic testing: molecular test ordering, informed consent issues, diverse specimen types that encompass the full breadth of specimens handled by traditional anatomic and clinical pathology information systems, data structures and data elements specific to molecular testing, varied testing workflows and protocols, diverse instrument outputs, unique needs and requirements of molecular test reporting, and nuances related to the dissemination of molecular pathology test reports. By satisfactorily addressing these needs in molecular test data management, a laboratory information system designed for the unique needs of molecular diagnostics presents a compelling reason to migrate away from the current paper and spreadsheet information management that many molecular laboratories currently use. This paper reviews the issues and challenges of information management in the molecular diagnostics laboratory.",

The RB gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein of ∼110 kDa. With a modified antigen-retrieval method, several polyclonal and monoclonal anti-RB antibodies are now available for demonstration of RB protein in formalin-fixed, routinely processed pathological specimens. Differing from the uncertainty about p53 immunoreactivity, the immunohistochemical assay for RB protein has proved to be a sensitive and reliable method for detecting RB gene inactivation. Furthermore, although the literature remains controversial, there is growing evidence suggesting that RB protein status is potentially a prognostic marker in urothelial carcinoma and perhaps also in some other types of human neoplasms. More definitive studies, however, must be conducted before the RB gene can be considered a prognostic factor in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The various types of spindle-cell lesions of the bladder can be difficult to distinguish because their clinicopathologic features overlap considerably, even between benign and malignant lesions. This problem can become most acute during an intraoperative consultation wherein the urologist must decide the extent of a cystectomy. In this review of the pathologic differential diagnosis of spindle-cell bladder lesions, a case of inflammatory (myofibroblastic) pseudotumor of the bladder will be presented to help illustrate the difficulties in making the diagnosis. Recognizing inflammatory (myfibroblastic) pseudotumor of the bladder requires a high index of suspicion. Inflammatory (myofibroblastic) pseudotumors are fibromyxoid spindle-cell tumors that usually occur in relatively young patients who have no history of surgery of other procedure to the area. They show normal mitotic figures (few), have a delicate granulation tissue-like vascularity, contain chronic of mixed inflammatory infiltrates, reveal minimal nuclear atypia, and rarely display tumor necrosis, except adjacent to the ulcerated surface. Electron microscopy reveals reactive myofibroblasts, and immunohistochemical stains often show both cytokeratin and desmin reactivity in the spindled tumor cells. For the unaware, this immunophenotype can lead to an overdiagnosis of either sarcomatoid carcinoma or a form of myogenic sarcoma. Although inflammatory (myofibroblastic) pseudotumors may recur locally, their prognosis is very good following complete or incomplete resection. Thus far, there have been no reported metastases.",

    "abstract": "Grading schemes for meningiomas have traditionally designated tumors as \"meningioma,\" \"atypical meningioma,\" or \"anaplastic (malignant) meningioma,\" depending upon the presence of histopathologic features thought to indicate aggressive behavior. In the past, most systems have considered brain invasion by tumor as the best evidence of malignancy. Perry et al. have recently investigated the significance brain invasion as a prognostic feature in meningiomas. The authors studied a series of 116 patients who had been diagnosed previously with \"malignant meningioma\" due to the presence of brain invasion, histologic anaplasia, or metastasis. On the basis of a multivariate analysis of histopathologic features and their relationship to tumor recurrence and patient survival, the authors concluded that brain invasion should be considered one of the diagnostic features of atypical meningioma. Accordingly, the diagnosis of malignant meningioma should be reserved for those tumors that are frankly anaplastic and/or contain (> = 20 mitoses per 10 high-power fields (HPF). Due in large part to the strength of evidence in this study, the World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted a grading scheme for meningiomas that incorporates many of the authors' proposals. New diagnostic criteria will result in improved reproducibility with fewer diagnoses of malignant meningioma (WHO grade III).",

Flow cytometric DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction seem to be of value as predictors of tumor behavior, aneuploidy, and high S-phase identifying an unfavorable clinical evolution of salivary gland neoplasms. Cell proliferation markers assessed by immunohistochemistry (e.g., PCNA, Ki-67) also appear to have predictive significance, but some conflicting results, in part related to technical procedures, limit their routine clinical application. Silver-stained methods (AgNORs) show a scarce value in estimating prognosis of salivary gland malignancies. p53 and c-erbB-2 as well as karyotyping, are of disputable benefit for clinical use, but the biologic information they provide give a better understanding on the molecular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of tumors. Further studies, with large databases, long follow-up information, uniformized histologic classification, and standardized methodologies, are needed to establish how these “objective” parameters would be of truly beneficial for the treatment of patients with salivary gland tumors.",

    "abstract": "Although the histologic diagnosis of endometriosis is usually straightforward, many diagnostic problems can arise as a result of alterations or absence of its glandular or stromal components. The diagnostic difficulty in such cases can be compounded by tissue that is limited to a small biopsy specimen. The appearance of the glandular component can be altered by hormonal and metaplastic changes, as well as cytologic atypia and hyperplasia. Although the last 2 findings are often referred to collectively as “atypical endometriosis,” they should be separately recognized as their premalignant potential likely differs. In some cases, the endometriotic glands are sparse or even absent (stromal endometriosis). The stromal component can be obscured or effaced by infiltrates of foamy and pigmented histiocytes, fibrosis, elastosis, smooth muscle metaplasia, myxoid change, and decidual change. Occasional findings in endometriosis that may raise concern for a neoplasm include necrotic pseudoxanthomatous nodules, polypoid growth (polypoid endometriosis), bulky disease, and venous, lymphatic, or perineural invasion. Inflammatory and reactive changes within, adjacent to, or at a distance from foci of endometriosis can complicate the histologic findings and include infection within endometriotic cysts, pseudoxanthomatous salpingitis, florid mesothelial hyperplasia, peritoneal inclusion cysts, and Liesegang rings. The histologic diagnosis of endometriosis can also be challenging when it involves an unusual or unexpected site. Five such site-specific problematic areas considered are endometriosis on or near the ovarian surface, superficial cervical endometriosis, vaginal endometriosis, tubal endometriosis, and intestinal endometriosis, including the important distinction of an endometrioid carcinoma arising from colonic endometriosis from a primary colonic adenocarcinoma. Finally, endometriotic foci can occasionally be intimately admixed with another process, such as peritoneal leiomyomatosis or gliomatosis, resulting in a potentially confusing histologic appearance.",

These tumors include metanephric adenoma, mixed epithelial and stromal tumor, juxtaglomerular cell tumor, mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma, Xp11.2 ( TFE3 ) translocation-associated renal cell carcinoma, and tuberous sclerosis complex (somatic or germline) associated renal neoplasms. The latter category is a heterogenous group with entities still being delineated. Eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma is the best-described entity, whereas, eosinophilic vacuolated tumor is a proposed entity, and the remaining tumors are currently grouped together under the umbrella of tuberous sclerosis complex/mammalian target of rapamycin –related renal neoplasms. The entities described in this review are often diagnostic considerations when evaluating renal mass tissue on biopsy or resection. For example, Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinoma is in the differential when a tumor has clear cell cytology and papillary architecture and occurs in a young or middle-aged patient.

    "abstract": "Eighteen histologic patterns of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) are described, most of which are also seen in other commonly occurring acute and chronic liver diseases. However, certain patterns such as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease, \"bland\" cholestasis and cholestatic hepatitis are more often caused by drugs than other competing etiologies. Amiodarone, acetaminophen, anabolic androgenic steroids and estrogens, result in histologic patterns that are virtually diagnostic of the respective drug. Recognition of a DILI or drug specific injury pattern enables the clinician to focus on eliciting an appropriate history to identify the offending agent, which may otherwise be rare and not immediately apparent. Although drugs can mimic any and every liver disease, the mimicry is often imperfect. Unusual features that do not completely fit the clinicopathologic paradigm of the mimicked liver disease are clues to diagnosis of DILI. When mimicking a liver disease, drugs tend to hasten or accelerate the natural progression of the disease. Novel immunomodulatory drugs for inflammatory disorders and cancer may cause unintended effects on the immune system, resulting in immune-related side effects. The role of the pathologist in diagnosis of DILI is to recognize known patterns of DILI, and either confirm a diagnosis when clinically suspected, or alert the clinician to the possibility of DILI when it is not suspected. The latter is particularly vital in contemporary practice, which is witnessing an accelerated pace of drug development, and a surge in consumption of nutritional supplements and herbal compounds by an increasingly health conscious society.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, considerable changes have been made to the classification of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, mainly with respect to the classification of small solitary tumors. The main goal seems to have been the identification of tumors that not only follow an indolent clinical course but that can also be treated more conservatively. Thus, the most important change to the classification of lung adenocarcinoma was proposed for a tumor no greater than 3.0 cm in size with a pure lepidic growth pattern and lacking stromal, vascular, or pleural invasion, which should now be categorized as in situ adenocarcinoma. At the same time, a category of minimally invasive adenocarcinoma was proposed for tumors with a predominantly lepidic growth pattern, <3 cm in size, and with <5 mm invasion in greatest dimension in any 1 focus. What is interesting about all these developments is the fact that all the publications on this issue have been presented under the terms of small adenocarcinomas or bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. Unfortunately, the literature reviews that have proposed the change in nomenclature to in situ adenocarcinoma have not offered a more in-depth assessment of these neoplasms. More recently, a publication of a large series of cases of small adenocarcinomas has offered a different view and underscored some of the important issues that need to be taken into account before a serious change in the nomenclature can be considered.",

    "abstract": "Highly customizable laboratory information systems help to address great variations in laboratory workflows, typical in Pathology. Often, however, built-in customization tools are not sufficient to add all of the desired functionality and improve systems interoperability. Emerging technologies and advances in medicine often create a void in functionality that we call a functionality gap. These gaps have distinct characteristics—a persuasive need to change the way a pathology group operates, the general availability of technology to address the missing functionality, the absence of this technology from your laboratory information system, and inability of built-in customization tools to address it. We emphasize the pervasive nature of these gaps, the role of pathology informatics in closing them, and suggest methods on how to achieve that. We found that a large number of the papers in the Journal of Pathology Informatics are concerned with these functionality gaps, and an even larger proportion of electronic posters and abstracts presented at the Pathology Informatics Summit conference each year deal directly with these unmet needs in pathology practice. A rapid, continuous, and sustainable approach to closing these gaps is critical for Pathology to provide the highest quality of care, adopt new technologies, and meet regulatory and financial challenges. The key element of successfully addressing functionality gaps is gap ownership—the ability to control the entire pathology information infrastructure with access to complementary systems and components. In addition, software developers with detailed domain expertise, equipped with right tools and methodology can effectively address these needs as they emerge.",

    "abstract": "A variety of endometrial lesions may contain mucinous cells. Herein, the author reviews the literature on the classification and clinicopathologic significance of uterine corpus proliferations with a significant mucinous component, assesses the 2020 World Health Organization classification of such lesions, and presents a diagnostic framework. The key epithelial mucinous lesions include mucinous metaplasia, atypical mucinous glandular proliferation and mucinous carcinoma. Each of these categories are classifiable into “usual” and gastrointestinal subtypes, the latter being indicative of intestinal (presence of goblet cells) and/or gastric-type (abundant, pale eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm and well-defined cell borders) morphology. It has been proposed that at least focal expression of gastrointestinal immunohistochemical markers be required for all gastrointestinal type lesions, and for gastrointestinal type atypical mucinous glandular proliferation and carcinoma, minimality or absence of estrogen receptor expression, and the absence of an endometrioid component. Mucinous carcinomas of the usual type, in which &gt;50% of the tumor is comprised of a mucinous component, are the most common. Morphologic subtypes include mucinous carcinoma with microglandular features and mucinous carcinoma with signet rings (signet ring carcinoma). Endometrioid carcinomas with a less than a 50% mucinous component are classified as endometrioid carcinoma with mucinous differentiation. Several studies have directly compared endometrioid and mucinous carcinomas, the latter presumably of the usual type, with respect to patient outcomes after treatment. All have found no difference in overall and disease free survival between these groups. However, three major studies have found mucinous carcinomas to be associated with a higher risk of lymph node metastases. Nineteen cases of mucinous carcinoma of the gastrointestinal type have been reported, and the limited data on their follow-up after primary treatment suggests that this subtype is more clinically aggressive and should accordingly be classified separately from mucinous carcinomas of the usual type. The morphologic spectrum of mucinous carcinoma of the gastrointestinal type is unclear and continues to evolve. Mucinous change, which may sometimes be extensive, may also be associated with papillary proliferation of the endometrium, adenomyoma of the endocervical type, atypical, and typical adenomyomas. In a curettage or biopsy, intestinal type mucinous epithelium may be indicative of any of the gastrointestinal lesions mentioned above, but may also represent samplings of uterine teratomas, yolk sac tumors, genital and extragenital adenocarcinomas with intestinal differentiation, or low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms that secondarily involve the endometrium.",

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology plays an important role in the initial workup of adrenal gland nodules, especially in patients with a known history of malignancy.

However, there is a significant cytomorphologic overlap between primary and metastatic adrenal neoplasms. This review focuses on the current state of adrenal gland FNA cytology, with an emphasis on distinguishing adrenocortical adenoma from carcinoma and adrenal cortical neoplasms from metastatic malignancies.

In clinical practice, a thyroid nodule can be classified as solid, cystic, and partially cystic based on its internal components. Different thyroid imaging reporting systems and cytologic diagnostic systems have focused their attention on solid nodules, which are more frequently linked with a malignant outcome. In fact, numerous papers demonstrated that nodules with microcalcifications, a taller-than-wide shape, hypoechogeneity, and irregular margins, are more likely to be malignant on histology. Nevertheless, according to the literature, the risk of malignancy in a partially cystic thyroid nodule ranges between 3.3 and 17-5%, including, for instance, the possible diagnosis of a cystic papillary thyroid carcinoma and other malignant entities. Therefore, in the current review article, we are going to discuss the approach to thyroid cystic lesions on fine needle aspiration cytology.",

Our increasing knowledge about them is reflected in the newer syndromes included in the new World Health Organization classification and in the evolving discovery of new endocrine tumors and new familial associations. In many of these syndromes, the clinical features and co-occurrence of multiple neoplasia are the only clues (multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes). In other syndromes, specific morphologic findings (pituitary blastoma and DICER1 syndrome, cribriform morular thyroid carcinoma, and AFP syndrome) and available ancillary studies (SDHB in SDH-deficient tumor syndromes) can aid pathologists.

We analyze here some of the issues involved in the classification of these tumors and the difficulties encountered for practicing pathologists in deciphering the “letters and numbers” system devised by the World Health Organization. We would like to propose an alternate approach to thymoma histologic classification that capitalizes on the basic observation of their cytologic features and incorporates the pattern of growth resulting from the interplay of the tumor cells with other cellular constituents as a secondary characteristic. The proposed histologic classification provides a simplified, reproducible means of histologically categorizing these tumors and can be easily understood by most practicing pathologists in simple and clear morphologic terms.",

Large lactiferous sinuses may be involved by inflammatory conditions such as squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts and ductal ectasia or be the site of uncommon superficial epithelial neoplasms such as nipple adenoma or syringomatous tumor of the nipple. Paget disease of the nipple may be secondary to intraepidermal extension of ductal carcinoma in situ in the underlying lactiferous ducts or develop from malignant transformation of Toker cells. Invasive breast cancer may also arise primarily in the nipple. Most of these conditions present as a palpable mass and/or skin changes with or without nipple discharge. Due to the delicate location and often relatively small size of nipple lesions, biopsy specimens are often superficial and fragmented, and the interpretation is challenging. Knowledge of the morphologic and immunophenotypic features of nipple lesions is essential in making the correct diagnosis.

This risk stratification can help clinicians select the optimal treatment for patients with UTUC, such as kidney-sparing (conservative) treatment, radical nephroureterectomy or ureterectomy, and perioperative systemic therapy. However, due to the technical difficulty of obtaining sufficient tissue from the upper urinary tract, it is often challenging for pathologists to accurately grade the tumor and assess tumor invasion in small biopsy specimens. Although the majority of UTUCs are pure urothelial carcinoma, a considerable subset of UTUCs show histologic subtypes or divergent differentiation. Recent studies have identified genetically distinct molecular subtypes of UTUC by examining DNA, RNA, and protein expression profiles. The prognosis of pT3 UTUC, particularly renal pelvic UC, remains controversial, and several studies have proposed subclassification of pT3 UTUC. Lynch syndrome is a significant risk factor for UTUC, and screening tests may be considered in young patients and those with familial histories of the disease. Despite significant progress in recent years, several issues remain to be addressed in the pathologic diagnosis, molecular classification, and treatment of UTUC.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) is one of the most common familial cancers with characteristic molecular changes that are different from those found in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) coli. Genetic mutations in the germline and somatic cells lead to loss of expression of one of the two most commonly involved mismatch repair genes, hMSH2 or hMLH1, and consequently, to expansion of certain repetitive DNA sequences (microsatellite instability (MSI). The paper describes a distinct subtype of “HNPCC-like” sporadic colonic carcinoma that can easily be identified by immunohistochemistry. Recognition of this subtype of colonic cancer is important because it occurs in the younger age group and is associated with better survival, but also a five-fold chance of developing a second colorectal carcinoma compared to “conventional” colorectal carcinomas.",

    "abstract": "Summary: For nearly 100 years, pathologists have utilized \"special histochemical stains\" to assist in tissue-based diagnosis. As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, histochemical stains have been used to identify infectious microorganisms (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis with acid-fast bacillus (AFB) stain), to detail inflammatory stromal or structural alterations (e.g., fibrosis in liver cirrhosis with Masson trichrome), to identify microanatomic sites of disease (e.g., basement membrane in glomerulonephritis with Jones methenamine silver), to identify abnormal chemical deposits (e.g., iron in hemochromatosis with Prussian blue stain), or abnormal immune deposits (e.g., amyloid via Congo red stain). The current surgical pathology laboratory may employ a repertoire of 20 to 25 \"special stains\" to ensure the full diagnostic complement. While the diagnostic repertoire and the biochemical recipes for the stains are now a well-established, condified part of surgical pathology, there is an ever-moving, leading edge of new developments including new reagents, applications, and methods. This review seeks to update the reader on some of the new applications including both new reagents and methods. Particular emphasis will be placed on the recent technologic advance of automating special stains in kinetic-mode (1-4). The authors consider in turn: 1. In brief, the \"news\" (recent literature review) of new staining applications; 2. In greater detail, two new applications for detection of Microsporidia and Helicobacer pylori; 3. The new technologic advancement of kinetic mode automation of special stains.",

Advances in genetic and epigenetic analysis, as well as development of mutation-specific antibodies enable more accurate classification of histologically indistinguishable tumors. Compared with histopathologic grading, molecular biomarkers are also superior in predicting natural behavior of tumors and therapeutic response. Diffuse gliomas can be separated in astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma based on IDH1 / 2 , ATRX , and TP53 mutational status. Pediatric gliomas are molecularly distinct from adult tumors and molecular drivers include histone H3 genes and fusions involving the MAPK pathway. Using genetic and epigenetic profiling, ependymal tumors, medulloblastomas, and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors can be separated in biologically and clinically distinct entities. Identification of novel gene fusions and matched DNA methylation signatures enable accurate diagnosis of primitive neuroectodermal tumors, which were previously misdiagnosed. Genomic classification of central nervous system tumors is being readily translated into the clinical practice and will enable molecularly based patient management and clinical trials.",

In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in our knowledge about molecular cell biology of cancer leading to the development of several molecularly targeted therapies. These therapeutic agents are used specifically for those tumors that are found to be susceptible to such a therapeutic approach. These therapies include a variety of monoclonal antibodies that target cell-surface receptors or, in some cases, their ligands. A second type of targeted therapies consists of small molecules that are designed to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity within the cancer cells. Despite initial optimism, this approach to cancer therapy is proven to be problematic because of inherent cancer heterogeneity and frequent development of drug resistance. The targeted therapies have improved survival time for many cancer patients but have not provided any definitive cures. The treating physicians constantly face the daunting challenge of balancing expected benefit with risk for complications, to achieve the most successful outcome. Still, the results often fall short of expectations. Personalized cancer treatment on the basis of targeted therapies is certainly an achievable goal, but more work is needed to make it a reality.",

The neural invasion is considered as a histopathologic characteristic for malignancy and is considered a mechanism for its spread. Both of these patterns usually portend a poor prognosis and very often are markers to prompt additional treatment. There are also some nonmalignancies representing PNI, including benign neoplasms, mimicking lesions, and disorders, such as chronic pancreatitis and endometriosis. The previously recommended terms are PNI, spread, or infiltration. To distinguish PNI in malignancies from that in nonmalignancies, we propose the term “perineural pseudoinvasion” to convey their nonmalignant behavior. Despite the low prevalence, awareness of this benign pseudoinvasion is necessary to avoid aggressive treatment and its misdiagnosis with malignancies. We conducted a systematic search in PubMed and Scopus databases up to December 2015 to find articles reporting PNI in nonmalignancies. After screening, 63 articles were identified as relevant. There were also 2 review articles discussing PNI in nonmalignancies. We aim to present an overview of the perineural pseudoinvasion and to discuss the previously published review articles.",

    "abstract": "Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor (PMT) is a rare neoplasm that ectopically secretes fibroblast growth factor 23, a bone cell-derived protein that regulates phosphate homeostasis. The overproduction of fibroblast growth factor 23 causes a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by hyperphosphaturia, hypophosphatemia, hypovitaminosis D, and vitamin D refractory rickets/osteomalacia, effects that disappear with tumor removal. The PMT may occur in several anatomic regions, mainly in the limbs, usually involving both soft tissue and bone. Acral locations occur in 10% to 15% of the cases, mostly in the feet, with 95 cases reported in this anatomic region to date. We report a case of a PMT in a young adult male who presented in 2007 with the classic constellation of signs and symptoms. A small soft-tissue tumor was detected in his right heel, 3 years after exhaustively seeking for it by various imaging techniques performed at different institutions. Before the tumor was detected, attempts to manage this patient's osteomalacia with phosphate and vitamin D (both calcitriol and ergocalciferol) supplementation were unsuccessful. Following surgical resection, the patient experienced prompt correction of the phosphaturia and gradual reconstitution of his bone mineralization. The pathologic diagnosis was (benign) PMT, mixed connective tissue type. In 2019, 12 years after resection, the patient is asymptomatic, and his bone mineral homeostasis has been restored.",

    "abstract": "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is routinely performed in most laboratories, and other than purchase of commercially available antibodies, requires no additional equipment or reagents. As such, IHC is an accessible and relatively inexpensive test and one that can be performed quite quickly. This is in sharp contrast to genomic or mutational testing methodologies that are routinely \"send out\" tests as they require specialized equipment and reagents as well as individuals with expertise in the performance of the tests and analysis of the results, resulting in a prolonged turn-round-time and enhanced associated costs. However, many open questions remain in a rapidly changing therapeutic and scientific landscape with most obvious one being what exactly is the utility of \"good old fashioned\" IHC in the age of targeted therapy? For molecular applications, is a negative immunohistochemical result enough as a stand-alone diagnostic or predictive product? Is a positive immunohistochemical result perhaps more suitable for a role in screening for molecular alterations rather than a definitive testing modality? This review is an attempt to answer those very questions. We elucidate the broad range of entities in which IHC is currently used as a molecular surrogate and underscore pearls and pitfalls associated with each. Special attention is given to entities for which targeted therapies are currently available and to entities in which molecular data is of clinical utility as a prognosticator.",

However, metastatic BCC is a very rare event with weakly effective therapeutic options and a poor prognosis, until a few years ago. In 2012, small-molecule therapies, capable of inactivating the hedgehog signaling pathway and thus reducing tumor growth and progression, were introduced into clinical practice for the treatment of patients with advanced BCC. We present retrospectively 2 personal cases of metastatic BCC of the skin, from the premolecular therapy era, from primary tumors that arose years before in the head and neck area. The former case occurred in a 45-year-old woman with a history of recurrent BCC of the retroauricular skin who eventually died due to diffuse metastatic spread. The latter case concerned a 70-year-old man also with a history of recurrent BCC of the nasal-perinasal skin who developed multiple subcutaneous and lymph node metastases in the neck. In both cases, the diagnoses were based on biopsies of the metastatic sites. The first patient died 5 months after the diagnosis of metastatic disease, while the second was alive and disease-free 2 years after neck lymph node dissection and external radiation therapy, and then lost to follow-up. We extensively discuss several tumor entities with basal or basaloid features that may enter the differential diagnosis with BCC in metastatic sites. In addition, we briefly summarize the advances in clinical therapeutics using small molecules, which are now an integral part of the treatment of such advanced BCC cases.",

Cytomorphologic examination is essential and fundamental for diagnosis and may provide important clues to the nature of diseases. However, based on morphology alone, cytologic diagnosis of lymphocyte-rich effusions could be very challenging, particularly when the lymphocytes are small. Cytologists/cytopathologists might be uncertain when a lymphocyte-rich effusion specimen warrants a comprehensive hematopathologic workup. Herein we present a simple and practical algorithmic approach. On the basis of the cytomorphology of lymphocytes (small vs. large cells), presence or absence of cellular atypia, and clinical information (an earlier history or current lymphoma), the lymphocyte-rich effusion samples could be triaged for ancillary studies including immunophenotyping and molecular assays if indicated. Incorporation of cytomorphology, correlation with clinical information, and appropriate application of various ancillary techniques is mandatory for a correct diagnosis of lymphocyte-rich effusion specimens.",

Neoplastic lesions consist of both benign and malignant neoplasms. The cytomorphologic features of these entities can overlap and the cystic background may additionally contribute to the complexity of these lesions and their interpretation. Ancillary studies have been reported in several studies to be beneficial in further characterization of the cellular components and subsequent diagnosis of the cystic lesions of the salivary gland. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and next-generation sequencing are now being utilized to detect molecular alterations in salivary gland neoplasms. MALM2 rearrangement is the most common gene fusion in mucoepidermoid carcinoma. PLAG1 rearrangement is present in more than half of pleomorphic adenomas. AKT1:E17K mutation is the key diagnostic feature of the mucinous adenocarcinoma. NR4A3 overexpression is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of acinic cell carcinoma. MYB fusion is noted in adenoid cystic carcinoma. ETV6:NTRK3 fusion is helpful in diagnosis of secretory carcinoma. p16 and human papillomavirus (HPV) studies differentiate HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma from non-HPV-related neoplasms with overlapping features. NCOA4:RET fusion protein is the main fusion in intraductal carcinoma.",

Currently, PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression by tumor and immune cells is the most widely used predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Nevertheless, patients with PD-L1 − tumors may still respond to treatments, thereby emphasizing the need for the identification of other predictive biomarkers.

For example, in Europe the anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) ICI Azetolizumab is approved for adult patients with locally advanced or metastasized TNBC (mTNBC), depending on the immunohistochemical (IHC) PD-L1 expression of immune cells in the tumor area [immune cell (IC) score ≥1%); the anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) ICI pembrolizumab is approved for mTNBC if PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS), that is PD-L1 expression on tumor and/or immune cells, is ≥10. For early TNBC, in contrast, neoadjuvant use of pembrolizumab is approved in the United States and Europe independent from PD-L1 IHC expression. The determination of PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue to predict response to ICI therapy requires sensitive immunostaining with appropriate primary antibodies and staining protocols and a standardized and meticulous assessment of PD-L1 IHC stained breast cancer tissue slides. For the selection of the test material and continuous quality control of the dyeing, high standards must be applied. The evaluation is carried out according to various evaluation algorithms (scores). Here, the role of PD-L1 in BC and the currently most relevant PD-L1 assays and scores for TNBC will be explained.

Microsecretory adenocarcinoma, a novel salivary gland malignancy recently included in the fifth edition of the World Health Organization Classifications of Head and Neck Tumours, is one such example. This novel entity was discovered among the umbrella category of adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified, using a combination of careful histologic analysis and advanced molecular techniques. Its strikingly characteristic histologic features including subtle infiltration, flattened tubules, and abundant blue secretions highlight the necessity of meticulous morphologic observation, even in the age of increased molecular testing. It harbors a recurrent novel MEF2C::SS18 gene fusion, which is amenable to fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. It presents predominantly in the oral cavity with a propensity for the palate and the majority are thus far low grade, clinically indolent tumors. The recent discovery of a cutaneous corollary to this tumor suggests that the spectrum of its presentation has not entirely been delineated. In the context of expanding molecular testing, pathologists are tasked to sift through constantly evolving molecular data to incorporate diagnostically relevant tests into their practice. In salivary gland pathology, the example of microsecretory adenocarcinoma demonstrates that primary histologic assessment, with sensible use of immunohistochemistry, can lead to accurate diagnosis. Molecular testing is beneficial in cases with significant diagnostic challenges.",

    "abstract": "The current WHO classification of testicular germ cell tumors is based on the pathogenesis of the tumors driven by different genomic events. The germ cell neoplasia in situ is the precursor lesion for all malignant germ cell tumors. The current understanding of pathogenesis is that the developmental and environmental factors with the erasure of parental genomic imprinting lead to the development of abnormal gonocytes that settle in the “spermatogonial Niche” in seminiferous tubules. The abnormal primordial germ cells in the seminiferous tubules give rise to pre-GCNIS cells under the influence of TPSY and OCT4 genes. The whole genome duplication events give rise to germ cell neoplasia in situ, which further acquires alterations in 12p along with NRAS and KRAS mutations to produce seminoma. A subset of seminomas acquires KIT mutation and does not differentiate further. The remaining KIT-stable seminomas differentiate to nonseminomatous GCTs after obtaining recurrent chromosomal losses, epigenetic modification, and posttranscriptional regulation by multiple genes. Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors also develop directly from differentiated germ cell neoplasia in situ. TP53 pathway with downstream drivers may give rise to somatic-type malignancies of GCT. The GCTs are remarkably sensitive to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy; however, resistance to cisplatin develops in up to 8% of tumors and appears to be driven by TP53/MDM2 gene mutations. Serum and Plasma miRNAs show promise in diagnosing, managing, and following up on these tumors. The mechanisms underlying the development of most tumors have been elucidated; however, additional studies are required to pinpoint the events directing specific characteristics. Advances in identifying specific molecular markers have been seen recently and may be adopted as gold standards in the future.",

    "abstract": "The increasing incidence of multiple lung nodules underscores the need for precise differentiation between multiple primary lung cancers (MPLCs) and intrapulmonary metastases (IPMs). This distinction impacts patient prognosis and treatment strategies. The prevalence of multiple lung nodules, ranging from 19.7% to 55.5%, highlights the clinical significance of this challenge. Historically, the role of histopathology, particularly comprehensive histology assessment (CHA), has been pivotal in differentiating MPLCs and IPMs. However, CHA has significant limitations, resulting in a constant search for a better way to distinguish those lesions. The best strategy for delineating MPLCs from IPMs is a multidisciplinary approach combining clinical data, radiology, histology, and molecular methods. Histology provides architectural and cellular characteristics, radiology contributes anatomic context and lesion characterization, and molecular methods reveal molecular features critical for accurate differentiation. Incorporating clinical data further enhances diagnostic precision. This review presents current knowledge and current approaches to multiple lung tumors. It is clear that even with a combination of pathology, radiology, and molecular data, definitive classification of multifocal lung tumors is not always possible.",

    "abstract": "Very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) is a clinical term referring to IBD-like symptomatology arising in children younger than 6 years. VEO-IBD may be due to polygenic etiology in “pure” IBD (Crohn disease-CD and ulcerative colitis-UC), or it may be caused by primary immunodeficiency underlined by monogenic disease. Primary immunodeficiency monogenic diseases have a Mendelian inheritance and affect the immune system with multiorgan morbidity and possible effects on the gastrointestinal system. Primary Immunodeficiency monogenic diseases differ from “pure” IBD as the latter primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract with mitigated extraintestinal symptomatology. Since their first description, primary immunodeficiency monogenic diseases, although rare, have been the subject of increasing interest due to their dramatic phenotype, difficulty in reaching a timely diagnosis, and specific therapeutic approach. In this paper, we present a brief review of primary immunodeficiency monogenic diseases, focusing on to their clinicopathologic features as well as delving, in greater detail, into monogenic diseases caused by IFIH1 mutations. The clinicopathologic features of 4 patients with IFIH1 , a gene involved in interferon pathway deficiency, will be described using a histologic pattern of damage approach confirming the need to avoid the histologic diagnosis of VEO-IBD in children younger than 6 years.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal and spindle cell tumors of the breast represent a broad and heterogeneous group of lesions that may be sampled on core needle biopsy or surgical excision. Mesenchymal lesions unique to the breast are those that derive from the specialized breast myofibroblast, such as mammary myofibroblastoma and pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia. However, any mesenchymal lesion arising in extramammary soft tissue may also arise in the breast, including fibroblastic, peripheral nerve sheath, adipocytic, and vascular lesions. The spindle cell lesions pose the greatest diagnostic challenge, due to the significant radiographic, morphologic, and immunophenotypic overlap within the category of mesenchymal lesions and more broadly with other nonmesenchymal breast lesions. The distinction is particularly challenging on the limited material of breast core needle biopsies, and caution should be taken before definitively classifying a breast spindle cell lesion on core needle biopsy to avoid unnecessary treatment if misdiagnosed. Consideration of a wide differential diagnosis, adequate sampling of a resection specimen, use of a targeted immunopanel, and selective use of molecular assays are essential steps for accurate classification of mesenchymal lesions in the breast. This review covers the clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic features of mesenchymal tumors of the breast, with a special emphasis on the differential diagnoses unique to the breast and challenges encountered on breast core needle biopsy.",

In this review, we cover the molecular events in ovarian SCSTs and provide practical guidance to the reporting pathologist as to how and when molecular testing may be useful in diagnosis. We stress the need to correlate the morphology and molecular since most of the molecular events are not entirely specific for a particular tumour type and our knowledge is continually evolving with the elucidation of “new” molecular events. We also discuss that in some tumours, molecular testing is helpful in triaging the patient for genetic referral and germline testing since some of the molecular events may be germline in nature.",

The diagnosis does not identify a specific entity, but reflects one of the inherent limitations of the pap screening procedure. Cervical/vaginal cytology cannot always distinguish reactive from dysplastic changes. Specific cytomorphologic criteria, guidelines for the management of ASCUS diagnoses, the risk of underlying dysplasia, and the natural history of ASCUS have been published. Recently, stratification of ASCUS cases by morphologic features and testing for human papillomavirus have been studied. However, the diagnosis itself remains poorly understood and controversial. The controversy is caused in part by the lack of consistency and reproducibility of ASCUS diagnoses, but it also is related to the struggle to define a modern approach for screening and managing preneoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix.",

In addition to classic-appearing MO, the following are closely related entities osteoma cutis, a mature-appearing, localized ossification within the skin and subcutis associated with a variety of precipitating factors (i.e., trauma, neoplasm); florid reactive periostitis (fi-bro-osseous pseudotumor of the digits), a fibroblastic and osteocartilaginous prolif-erative lesion of the fingers and toes, especially the proximal phalanx, often associated radiographically with a laminated periosteal reaction; bizarre parosteal osteochon-dromatous proliferation (Nora's lesion), a hypercellular cartilage-capped exostosis surrounding an irregular mixture of bone and reactive fibrous tissue, most often arising from the juxtacortical surfaces of the middle and proximal phalanges of the hands and feet; Dupuytren's subungual exostosis, a fibrocartilage to hyaline cartilage exostotic proliferation morphologically resembling bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation but anatomically characterized by subungual distal phalangeal origin. As considerable clinical and histomorphologic overlap exists between MO and these: related entities and nosologic distinction appears to be based largely on anatomic and radiographic relationships, we propose the unifying term pseudomalignant heterotopic ossifications. These benign heterotopic ossifications must be distinguished from extraskeletal osteosarcoma.",

    "abstract": "Found in virtually any organ system, immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related disease (RD) is a recently recognized immune-mediated, systemic, a fibroinflammatory disease characterized histologically by storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis, and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with IgG4-positive plasma cells (PCs). IgG4-related Hashimoto thyroiditis (IgG4-RHT), also called IgG4-related thyroiditis, shares many features with IgG4-RD but is distinct in several ways. A case of IgG4-RHT in a 51-year-old African American female is assembled together with a literature review which uncovered 82 cases of IgG4-RHT. The findings and criteria which the respective authors used to reach their diagnoses are analyzed. Findings common to all studies are lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and IgG4-positive staining, while most describe follicular atrophy (95.2%, 79/83). Stromal fibrosis involving >33% of thyroid architecture was reported in 74% (58/78) of cases. While few reports observed storiform fibrosis, all describe lack of obliterative phlebitis or systemic involvement. Discrepancies between reports exist in immunostaining thresholds, as well as grading systems for stromal fibrosis. Based on our review of the literature and experience, we propose a set of best practice recommendations for the diagnosis of IgG4-RHT. Our diagnostic criteria are (1) lack of extrathyroidal IgG4-RD, (2) the fibroinflammatory process should not extend beyond the thyroid capsule, (3) stromal fibrosis comprises at least 30% of the involved tissue, (4) >30% IgG4/IgG ratio, with absolute immunostaining cutoffs varying by the degree of stromal fibrosis: for >50% stromal fibrosis use >20 IgG4+PCs/HPF, for 30% to 50% fibrosis use >30 IgG4+PCs/HPF, (5) fibrosis infiltrates the interlobular/interfollicular space, (6) features of follicle injury, and (7) obliterative phlebitis is not required.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic lymphoepithelial cysts are more common in men, can occur anywhere in the pancreas, are sharply demarcated from surrounding tissues, and range in size from 1.2 to 17 cm. Patients are usually middle aged, presenting symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, although many tumors are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on organ imaging or at autopsy. An elevated serum carbohydrate-associated antigen 19-9 may wrongly suggest a mucinous neoplasm. The diagnosis can be made preoperatively with a combination of organ imaging, fine needle aspiration biopsy, or ultrasound-guided Trucut biopsies. Cysts can be unilocular, bilocular, or multilocular, have walls up to 0.6 cm thick which are lined by squamous epithelium, occasional columnar mucinous cells, and small foci of sebaceous cells. The epithelium is surrounded by a dense rim of lymphoid tissue with scattered lymphoid follicles. Invaginations of the epithelium into the lymphoid tissue, reminiscent of a Warthin tumor, are occasionally observed. The pathogenesis is unknown. Pancreatic lymphoepithelial cysts are cured by conservative resection but if they are asymptomatic and are diagnosed before surgery, no treatment is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Modern evaluation of specimens from biopsies of colorectal polyps has become increasingly complex because of tremendous progress in the understanding of colorectal neoplasia. Although pathologists are generally familiar with the basic handling of carcinoma in the setting of polypectomies or resections, the comprehensive evaluation of specimens from biopsies of colorectal polyps obtained with forceps is far from intuitive and has yet to be reviewed. Comprehensive evaluation requires always addressing several key issues, even when dealing with seemingly routine cases. These issues include taking further action when initial sections lack polyps, accurately quantitating polyps, accurately classifying polyps, determining whether thresholds are met for considering conditions at high risk for carcinoma, detecting incidental findings other than polyps, and determining which incidental findings are clinically significant. In particular, polyposis with attenuated phenotype or Lynch syndrome may be clinically occult, and the possibility of these entities should always be kept in mind, regardless of age or history. Ancillary studies performed immediately on carcinoma that is detected at biopsy guides surgery, guides medical therapy, prognosticates, provides evidence for hereditary neoplasia, and guides surveillant colonoscopy for the family.",

    "abstract": "A 43-year-old female patient diagnosed with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) because of mitochondrial myopathy documented by muscle biopsy is presented. The chief complaints were represented by blepharoptosis and ophthalmoplegia. The muscle biopsy was evaluated by histology, using the appropriate histochemical and histoenzimological stains. Ragged red fibers with Gomori trichrome stain were seen, which showed cytochrome c oxydase deficiency and abnormal succinate dehydrogenase staining in around 20% of muscle fibres. Electron microscopy was also performed which demonstrated abnormal, hyperplastic, pleomorphic, and hypertrophic mitochondria, characterized by paracrystalline inclusions arranged in parallel rows (“parking-lot” inclusions), consisting of rectangular arrays of mitochondrial membranes in a linear or grid-like pattern. In conclusion, mitochondrial myopathy was definitely diagnosed. Although molecular analysis, which was subsequently carried out, failed to reveal mutations in the mitochondrial DNA or in selected nuclear genes, the pathologic diagnosis was not changed. The differential diagnosis of CPEO with other forms of ocular myopathies as well as the possible association of CPEO with systemic syndromes is discussed. Ophtalmologists and medical internists should always suspect CPEO when dealing with patients affected by ocular myopathy, either in its pure form or in association with other myopathic or systemic signs.",

    "abstract": "A Hispanic newborn male, the product of nonconsanguineous parents, exhibited major and minor signs of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). MRI of the abdomen disclosed a discrete unilateral, cystic, right upper pole renal mass that prompted a nephrectomy. Histologic examination showed a polycystic renal mass that involved all segments of the nephron, with a preponderantly glomerulocystic pattern. The cysts were rounded, uniform, and small, most measuring 2 to 3 mm in diameter. The lining of the cysts was hyperplastic, made up of tall epithelial cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and large nuclei, and focally formed mounds and papillary tufts. DNA analysis detected a constitutional deletion of exon 1 in the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16p13.3. Cystogenesis in TSC2 is manifested because of alteration or dysfunction of the primary cilium, where polycystin, the gene product of PKD1 gene, is localized. Renal cysts are often seen in TSC, varying in number from a few to innumerable, involving all segments of the nephron, including Bowman spaces, and are currently considered as one of the minor diagnostic features. A glomerulocystic pattern is a rare form of kidney involvement in TSC that aptly describes the innumerable cystically dilated Bowman spaces. Glomerulocystic kidney associated with the aforementioned hyperplastic epithelial lining (TSC epithelium) is sufficiently characteristic that could conceivably serve as a major TSC feature in the future.",

Although slow to evolve, in recent years there has been a rapid advance in the discovery of new and novel molecular markers in primary bone neoplasms, which has enhanced diagnostic accuracy and has shed light into their pathogenesis. Modern technological approaches such as next-generation sequencing including RNA sequencing are serving as \"rapid discovery platforms\" for new and novel mutations and translocations with diagnostic, prognostic, and possible therapeutic applicability. As next-generation sequencing technologies are finding their place in clinical laboratories, one could envision routine testing for mutations spanning across a gene or translocations with multiple breakpoints and partner genes.

Microscopically, the thyroid parenchyma showed signs of Hashimoto thyroiditis. The nodule in the right lobe was composed of a part of solid cell nests appearance, another part resembling a branchial cleft cyst, and a part resembling Warthin tumor. This lesion may belong to the histogenetically similar group of entities in the head and neck region which are derived from branchial cleft derivatives and which, under the inflammatory influence, have the ability to a cystic dilatation and proliferation of the epithelial component. The epithelium can afterwards become papillary and may undergo oncocytic transformation, thus gaining features that impart the resemblance of a Warthin tumor.

Breast pathology has a critical role as a medical domain, where the patient’s pathology diagnosis has significant implications for prognostication and treatment of diseases. The advent of digital and computational pathology has brought about significant advancements in the field, offering new possibilities for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving patient care. Digital slide scanning enables to conversion of glass slides into high-fidelity digital images, supporting the review of cases in a digital workflow. Digitization offers the capability to render specimen diagnoses, digital archival of patient specimens, collaboration, and telepathology. Integration of image analysis and machine learning–based systems layered atop the high-resolution digital images offers novel workflows to assist breast pathologists in their clinical, educational, and research endeavors. Decision support tools may improve the detection and classification of breast lesions and the quantification of immunohistochemical studies. Computational biomarkers may help to contribute to patient management or outcomes. Furthermore, using digital and computational pathology may increase standardization and quality assurance, especially in areas with high interobserver variability. This review explores the current landscape and possible future applications of digital and computational techniques in the field of breast pathology.",

    "abstract": "Some histologic special types of breast carcinoma harbor specific recurrent genetic alterations that are not seen in other types of breast carcinoma (no special type), namely adenoid cystic carcinoma, secretory carcinoma, and tall cell carcinoma with reversed polarity. These tumors have unique morphologic features, are triple-negative, that is, do not express hormone receptors or HER2, and are generally associated with a favorable prognosis. Adenoid cystic carcinoma, like its counterpart in other organs, shows a MYB-NFIB fusion gene that is the result of a recurrent t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24) translocation. Other MYB alterations have been described that result in overexpression of MYB . Secretory carcinoma is characterized by an ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion that is the result of recurrent (12;15);(p13;q25) translocation, which is also seen in mammary analog secretory carcinoma of the salivary gland. Tall cell carcinoma with reversed polarity shows IDH2 p.Arg172 hotspot mutations. Immunohistochemical antibodies have emerged that identify the underlying genetic alterations in these tumors and serve as useful diagnostic tools. This review will provide an update on the molecular features and diagnostic immunohistochemical markers that have become increasingly popular to aid in diagnosing these uncommon triple-negative breast tumors.",

The TNM staging system is used globally and is a critical component of colorectal carcinoma pathology reporting. However, our experience informs us that there are significant variations in the assignment of the TNM stage, both between pathologists and between hospital centers. We identify several potential reasons for this, among them suboptimal gross and microscopic assessment of colorectal resection specimens and, later, nonuniformity in applying criteria set forth in pathologic TNM staging guidelines. In addition, some defining characteristics of the staging system remain poorly defined. We aim to enlist those issues with potential remedies to improve reproducibility and, therefore, multidisciplinary discussion.",

Since elevated activity of telomerase has been selectively demonstrated in a large number of human cancers, it has generated considerable excitement as a potential cancer marker, a prognostic factor, and a target of possible anticancer strategy. This article details diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic prospects linked to the measurement of telomerase activity and the growing complexity of its regulation and function.",

    "abstract": "Soft tissue tumor pathology is an actively evolving field. Novel clinicopathologic entities are reported each year, and ongoing histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular reappraisals lead to evolution in the categories to which each tumor type is assigned. In some cases, the advent of new nonmorphological information suggests that some soft tissue tumors, previously regarded as different, are in fact closely related entities in a common spectrum of disease. Needless to say, sometimes there are substantial differences of opinion, amongst experts, as to which tumor types should be regarded as distinct, and which are closely related to each other. Therefore, critical and ongoing reassessment of the myriad of soft tissue tumor categories is intrinsic to the field. Most such evaluations are based primarily on skillful histopathologic assessment integrated with judicious application of ancillary techniques. Recently, Nielsen et al. explored the intricate lattice of soft tissue tumors using cDNA microarray technology. cDNA expression profiles of different soft tissue tumors were consistent with current morphology-based categorizations. Importantly, the profiles revealed new constellations of tumor markers that should lead to refinements in soft tissue tumor classification, and ultimately to predictors of prognosis and therapeutic response.",

The aim of this review is to characterize this tumor in a larger cohort of patients using all the available cases in the literature. We systematically searched the PubMed and Scopus database for primary thymic mucoepidermoid carcinoma. A total of 24 studies were included in the final analysis. A total of 41 patients were identified; 23 (56.1%) were male and 18 (43.9%) were female. Mean age was 49.8±21.3 years. Mean tumor size was 7.6±3.5 cm. Twenty (66.7%) were low grade and 8 (26.7%) were high grade. In total, 20 (55.6%) patients were treated with surgery alone. Nodal dissection was performed in 4 cases only. Two patients had MAML2 gene rearrangement and 2 were negative. Follow-up time varied from 2 to 93 months. A total of 13 (44.8%) patients died of disease with a median survival of 12 months. There seems to be a bimodal age distribution with peaks between second and third decades of life, and between sixth and eight decades. Lymph node sampling is frequently not performed; however, we recommend performing it, as it may lead to more accurate staging. There is limited data regarding the utility of MAML2 gene rearrangement in the thymic location. Histologic grade and tumor stage/resectability are the main prognostic factors.",

Although first described in the 19th century, systematic biological understanding of HLs has been hindered due to the challenges presented in studying the complex tumor microenvironment and scarce tumorigenic cells. Recent advances in single-cell isolation and characterization, sensitive mutational analytic tools, and multiplex immunohistochemical strategies have allowed further advances in understanding the development and progression of HL. Here we provide a current update on the chromosomal and mutational abnormalities seen in HL, the impact of Epstein-Barr virus infection on driving a subset of HLs, and the possibility of disease monitoring via high-sensitivity detection of genetic aberrations. We also discuss recent developments in understanding the intricate microenvironment through intercellular cross-talk, and describe novel potential biomarkers to aid in distinction of HL from other overlapping entities.",

This role includes the initial diagnosis of the disease, assessment of the response to treatment and the identification of short-term complications such as cytomegalovirus infection and long-term complications such as dysplasia. Furthermore, the assessment of resection specimens for complication of disease is important to determining the risk of subsequent disease or inflammation within an ileal pouch. Adequate sampling of the disease at endoscopy and from the surgical resection specimen is vital to determining the ultimate information that can be provided by the pathologist. This sampling is determined by the clinical scenario. Similarly, a standardized approach to reporting and synthesizing the histologic findings will improve patient management. This is best exemplified by the increasing interest in histologic activity indices, such as the Nancy index in ulcerative colitis, and in the standardized reporting for inflammatory bowel disease dysplasia recommended by the SCENIC international consensus.",

    "abstract": "In 1999, Nguyen et al divided focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in 2 groups, the classical and nonclassical. The former also included those cases of FNH with classical characteristics exhibited “on a subtle scale,” whereas the latter included among others mainly the telangiectatic FNH (T-FNH) variant. Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) was classically considered by definition a neoplasm with no ductal or ductular differentiation, but today the spectrum of HCA does include variant 3, which may have CK7+ ductules. Owing to genotypic-phenotypic correlation, T-FNH (synonymous with progressive FNH of others) is not considered yet as part of the spectrum of FNH, instead it is diagnosed as a variant of HCA, which now includes 4 variants. Variant-3, which may contain CK7+ ductules, and is also termed HCA with ductal/ductular differentiation, corresponds to T-FNH. Notwithstanding the nosologic advancement, and outside the “archetypal” types, the differential morphologic diagnosis of spontaneous HCA versus FNH may remain problematic as ductular proliferation in some cases of FNH may be scanty and hard to find. In some histologic overlapping cases of FNH and HCA the morphologic diagnosis may be very difficult or even impossible (especially in small lesions) and molecular biology may be of critical assistance. A prototypical case of surgically resected multiple spontaneous liver cell adenomas of various types, including HCA of T-FNH type and steatotic type, previously interpreted in different ways, affecting a young girl, is presented herein.",

    "abstract": "A repeat survey of the Association of the Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology, done 10 years after the original was used to assess trends and variability in classifying scenarios as errors, and the preferred post signout report modification for correcting error by the membership of the Association of the Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology. The results were analyzed to inform on whether interpretive amendment rates might act as surrogate measures of interpretive error in pathology. An analyses of the responses indicated that primary level misinterpretations (benign to malignant and vice versa) were universally qualified as error; secondary-level misinterpretations or misclassifications were inconsistently labeled error. There was added variability in the preferred post signout report modification used to correct report alterations. The classification of a scenario as error appeared to correlate with severity of potential harm of the missed call, the perceived subjectivity of the diagnosis, and ambiguity of reporting terminology. Substantial differences in policies for error detection and optimal reporting format were documented between departments. In conclusion, the inconsistency in labeling scenarios as error, disagreement about the optimal post signout report modification for the correction of the error, and variability in error detection policies preclude the use of the misinterpretation amendment rate as a surrogate measure for error in anatomic pathology. There is little change in uniformity of definition, attitudes and perception of interpretive error in anatomic pathology in the last 10 years.",

The grading system for OED is also fraught with significant interobserver variability. This review summarizes the essential clinical and histopathologic features of OED and its mimics.

    "abstract": "Spindle cell proliferations of the breast are a heterogeneous group of lesions ranging from benign or reactive lesions to aggressive malignant neoplasms. Diagnosis on core biopsy can be particularly challenging as lesions displaying different lineages associated with variable outcomes share overlapping morphologies (scar vs. fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma) whereas individual entities can exhibit a large variety of appearances (myofibroblastoma). In this review, lesions are grouped into lineage, when possible, including those showing fibroblastic/myofibroblastic differentiation, ranging from entities that require no additional management, such as scar and nodular fasciitis, to those with unpredictable clinical outcomes such as fibromatosis and solitary fibrous tumor or locally aggressive behavior such as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. The review of low-grade vascular lesions includes atypical vascular lesion and low-grade angiosarcoma. Also discussed are various adipocytic lesions ranging from lipoma to liposarcoma, and rare smooth muscle and neural entities more commonly encountered in locations outside the breast, such as leiomyoma, neurofibroma, schwannoma, or granular cell tumor. Optimal histological evaluation of these entities merges clinical and radiologic data with morphology and ancillary testing. We present our approach to immunohistochemical and other ancillary testing and highlight issues in pathology correlation with imaging. Recent updates in the management of breast spindle cell lesions are addressed. In a well-sampled lesion with radiographic concordance, the core biopsy diagnosis reliably guides management and we advocate the inclusion of management recommendations in the pathology report. Precise characterization using up to date guidelines is important to identify a subset of patients who may safely avoid unnecessary surgical procedures. A multidisciplinary approach with close collaboration with our clinical colleagues is emphasized.",

However, ICIs provide clinical benefit only in a minority of patients due to primary and/or acquired resistance mechanisms. Immunotherapy resistance is a complex phenomenon relying on genetic and epigenetic factors, which ultimately influence the interplay between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Information is accumulating on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the production of resistance and the resulting diminished therapeutic efficacy. In addition, current knowledge on predictors of response and toxicity to immunotherapy and on biomarkers that reliably identify resistant patients is in progress. In this review, we will focus on the tumor microenvironment changes induced by ICIs in melanoma, summarizing the available evidence of clinical trials in the neoadjuvant and metastatic setting. We will also overview the role of potential biomarkers in predicting disease response to ICIs, providing insight into current and future research in this field.",

The most common corneal specimens, full-thickness corneal discs and corneal biopsies, are discussed in this review. Corneal discs removed at keratoplasty are non-urgent specimens, as definitive treatment has already been undertaken, and while the pathologic diagnosis may change the prognosis for the graft, it rarely affects immediate treatment. Accurate diagnosis is still important, and will affect counseling of the patient, but referral to a colleague with a special interest is possible if necessary. Conversely, small partial-thickness corneal biopsies, which are mostly undertaken for culture negative keratitis with underlying suspected infection, are very urgent. Infectious keratitis can follow an extremely aggressive course, resulting in destruction of the cornea within hours. Accurate diagnosis is imperative. Due to the urgency of such specimens and the importance of diagnosis for immediate treatment, referral is not usually possible. It is the role of the pathologist to make optimal use of a small specimen to reach the relevant diagnosis in the minimum space of time.",

    "abstract": "The kidney is one of the most complicated organs in development and is susceptible to more types of diseases than other organs. The disease spectrum includes developmental and cystic diseases, involvement by systemic diseases, iatrogenic complications, ascending infections and urinary tract obstruction, and neoplastic diseases. The diagnosis of kidney disease is unique involving 2 subspecialties, urologic pathology and renal pathology. Both renal and urologic pathologists employ the renal biopsy as a diagnostic modality. However, urologic pathologists commonly have a generous specimen in the form of a nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy while a renal pathologist requires ancillary modalities of immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The 2 subspecialties differ in the disease spectrum they diagnose. This separation is not absolute as diseases of one subspecialty not infrequently appear in the diagnostic materials of the other. The presence of medical renal diseases in a nephrectomy specimen is well described and recommendations for reporting these findings have been formalized. However, urologic diseases appearing in a medical renal biopsy have received less attention. This review attempts to fill that gap by first reviewing the perirenal anatomy to illustrate why inadvertent biopsy of adjacent organs occurs and determine its incidence in renal biopsies followed by a discussion of gross anatomic features relevant to the microscopic domain of the medical renal biopsy. Unsuspected neoplasms and renal cysts and cystic kidney diseases will then be discussed as they create a diagnostic challenge for the renal pathologist who often has limited training and experience in these diseases.",

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of the practice of pathology and health care in general requires that pathology residents acquire a vast number of skills during their training. This has been reflected by the broad range of skills addressed in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) milestones. In order to address some of these milestones, our residency program instituted an introductory didactic series in surgical pathology that focused on 2 objectives. First, the didactics provided basic grossing and histology training to first year residents transitioning from medical school. Second, the sessions allowed upper level residents to refine their teaching and communication skills at the microscope and therefore served as an important career development tool. Surveys of both first year residents and the upper level residents that led these sessions confirm the utility of these didactics and the use of upper level residents to teach junior trainees. In addition, these sessions led to a dramatic increase in RISE scores among first year trainees. An introductory series with upper level residents leading slide sessions could easily be replicated at other institutions and provide similar benefits.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of a 14-year-old female with primary adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon. She was hospitalized after presenting with abdominal pain and signs of intestinal obstruction. There was no health antecedent or family history of neoplasia. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen. Tenderness was elicited to palpation of the right lower quadrant. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen revealed obstructive signs, with a constricting lesion in the mid-transverse colon of probable neoplastic nature. Laparoscopic segmental resection of the colon was followed by standard right hemicolectomy. A circumferential mid-transverse tumor was diagnosed as primary colorectal carcinoma (CRC) of signet-ring cell type, AJCC stage IIIC, Dukes’ C stage. On the basis of immunohistochemistry and clinical data, hereditary nonpolyposis and hamartomatous colorectal cancer syndromes were excluded. Involvement of either the p53, BRAF, or K-RAS genes was ruled out by immunohistochemistry profiling and genetic testing. The neoplasm was categorized as sporadic. The possibility of activation of the Wnt signaling pathway was suspected, because of a defective turnover of the β-catenin protein. Postoperatively, the patient was treated with both systemic and intra-abdominal adjuvant chemotherapy, including oxaliplatin. Between 18 and 24 months after diagnosis, intra-abdominal tumor recurrences were detected. The patient underwent bilateral oophorectomies for Krukenberg tumors and received salvage chemotherapy. Recently, additional recurrent metastatic retroperitoneal disease caused hydronephrosis. The retroperitoneal mass was debulked and a ureteric stent was placed. At the time of this writing, 43 months after diagnosis, the patient is receiving FOLFOX chemotherapy combined with panitumumab. CRC of childhood is exceedingly rare, generally develops in the setting of unrecognized genetic predisposing factors to cancer, presents with advanced disease, is high grade, and tends to have dismal prognosis.",

    "abstract": "A high-grade angiosarcoma with epithelioid features located in the buttock of an 87-year-old woman arose in an area of old, palpable fat necrosis at the site of several subcutaneous injections administered 20 years previously. The nature of the injected material is unknown, but is presumed to have been an iron compound. Two weeks before surgery, the buttock lesion started to enlarge and was excised. It consisted of 3 contiguous nodules of old, calcified fat necrosis associated with plentiful hemosiderin. One of the nodules was largely replaced by an angiosarcoma, which was invading the edges of the other 2 nodules. The patient died from wound sepsis 41 days postoperatively, with no clinically apparent metastases. Vaccination injection-site sarcomas are well known to occur in cats, whereas in humans, rare sarcomas associated with prostheses and foreign materials have been reported; however, human injection-site sarcomas are vanishingly rare. The Club members agreed with the diagnosis of angiosarcoma at an injection site, with the majority calling it an epithelioid angiosarcoma. Many accepted that the injected material was probably iron, but one cautioned about regarding the injections as the cause of the angiosarcoma.",

The tumor involved uterine corpus as well as lower uterine segment and presented as polypoid tumor protruding through the cervical orifice. Microscopically, the tumor was characterized by broad zones of cytologically bland fibromyxoid stroma resembling nodular fasciitis, showing vaguely nodular architecture. Neoplastic glands were characterized by interconnected elongated slit-like and large cystic profiles, mostly lined by flattened epithelium with variable squamous differentiation, whereas typical columnar endometrioid cells were only focally present. Voluminous nodules of the stroma produced phyllodes-like appearance of the tumor. The tumor showed some resemblance to the microcystic, elongated, and fragmented (MELF) glands growth pattern, but in contrast with MELF pattern, where fibromyxoid change occurs focally, in the presented case abundant myofibroblastic proliferation was present throughout the tumor and the neoplastic glands showed anastomosing “large cystic” rather than “small cystic” profiles. Some of the neoplastic glands presented almost complete or complete squamous differentiation, with relatively bland-looking squamous cells and no hint of endometrioid differentiation, which resulted in initial misdiagnosis of Müllerian adenofibroma. We believe that nodular fasciitis-like pattern represents yet undescribed, and diagnostically challenging pattern of invasion in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "A case of combined melanocytic nevus characterized by extensive granular cytoplasmic changes is described. Clinically, the lesion presented as an irregular, slightly asymmetric, and raised pigmented lesion of back with indistinct borders. Microscopically, a congenital pattern of distribution of melanocytes could be recognized growing along follicular and adnexal units. Melanocytes were arranged in sheets of epithelioid cells with abundant granular cytoplasm. A minor component featuring conventional dermal melanocytes was also present. Mitotic figures were not recognized. Immunohistochemistry was positive for Melan A and S100 protein in both conventional melanocytes and granular cells. In addition, the granular cells were also strongly positive for HMB45 and NKI-C3. The proliferative marker Ki67/MIB1 was nonreactive. Ultrastructural examination showed large cells with round to oval nuclei and numerous scattered cytoplasmic granules showing features consistent with lysosomes or autophagosomes. No premelanosomes, glycogen, lipid, or other distinctive organelles could be identified. Clinical follow-up at 2 years was uneventful. This unusual lesion may represent a peculiar dermal melanocytic proliferation in which the abundant granular cytoplasm is most likely due to degeneration of melanosomes induced by autophagocytic activity. The striking cytoplasmic granularity observed in this lesion may lead to confusion with other conditions, thus warranting adding granular cell nevus to the phenotypic spectrum of benign melanocytic proliferations.",

    "abstract": "There are two approaches to the detection and treatment of breast cancer. Almost all current efforts are focused on improving the detection of small cancers and their treatment. Breast cancers, even when detected at their smallest visible size, still carry a substantial risk of claiming the life of a patient. The alternative is to focus on the identification of cancer precursor lesions. Effective identification and treatment of precursor lesions would prevent all breast cancer deaths. This requires scientific assessment of the effectiveness of prevention strategies in high-risk women. Certain groups of women are known to be at high risk for development of breast cancer. These include women with a personal and/or family history of previous breast cancer, women carrying certain genes, and women with atypical hyperplasia. Detection of atypical hyperplasia by surgical biopsy in a symptomatic population for risk assessment is not practical. The alternative is the use of noninvasive procedures such as fine-needle aspiration biopsy in order to sample and monitor the earliest changes associated with breast cancer. This requires adequate recognition of the cytomorphology of breast cancer precursor lesions and the ability to distinguish between prognostically relevant morphologic alterations and atypias associated with various benign breast diseases.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 26 sclerotic lipomas have been reported since Zelger and colleagues’ 1997 report of 5 cases involving the scalp and hands. In 2006, Laskin and colleagues published 21 sclerotic lipomas in a study restricted to tumors of the hands and feet. Patients’ ages ranged from 7 to 72 years (mean and median 39 y); there were 12 males and 9 females; the masses, which were mostly asymptomatic and solitary, ranged from 0.6 to 2.2 cm (median 1.2 cm, mean 1.3 cm) and involved fingers (N=17), hands or wrists (N=3), and toes (N=1). Microscopically, lesions were well circumscribed, of low cellularity, and consisted of cytologically bland spindle and stellate-shaped cells with a minor component of randomly dispersed adipocytes embedded in a collagenous to myxocollagenous stroma. Eight tumors were fibroma-like with dense fibrosclerotic stroma and inconspicuous blood vessels. One tumor exhibited features of spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma, whereas another displayed a vague onion skin–like arrangement of collagen reminiscent of a sclerotic (storiform) fibroma. The mitotic activity was negligible. Nonlipogenic cells were immunoreactive for CD99 (6/6) CD34 (6/8), S100 (4/7), and smooth muscle actin (2/6). Follow-up on 8 patients (range, 1 to 20 y, median 9.5 y) revealed no recurrence in 6 and possible persistent tumor in 2 after simple excision. The slide circulated to club members was from a 35-mm tumor on the dorsum of the right hand of a male aged 75. Club members generally agreed with a diagnosis of sclerotic lipoma but opinions differed as to whether it is a specific entity or a variant of spindle cell lipoma or dendritic fibromyxolipoma.",

    "abstract": "Over the last years, great advancements have taken place in the medical approach to lung non-small cell carcinomas. Currently, with the use of biomarkers and diagnostic molecular pathology, tumors that in the past were treated with conventional chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both, now similar patients afflicted by non-small cell carcinoma may have other alternative treatments. More importantly, because of those advancements in treatment options, it has become imperative that pathologists not only become familiar with the pathologic response to those treatments but also attempt to provide a pathologic assessment of the different changes that may be present as a result of a particular treatment. Even though for pathologists the demonstration of tumor necrosis and other inflammatory responses because of therapy as well as residual tumor does not represent a difficult task to accomplish, the issue is not in the diagnostic histopathologic assessment but in providing an adequate assessment of tumor viability as well as tumor necrosis and other histopathologic changes. More interesting is to acknowledge that it is in this particular area in which there may be differences in the approach because of the lack of a universal approach regarding how much of a particular tumor needs to be examined. Needless to say, the number of histologic sections examined may at the end be used as a specific parameter for tumor response to a particular treatment. The current review, will highlight, the different methodologies that over the years have been used or employed in the assessment of what is now referred as major pathologic response.",

    "abstract": "Found in virtually any organ system, immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related disease (RD) is a recently recognized immune-mediated, systemic, a fibroinflammatory disease characterized histologically by storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis, and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with IgG4-positive plasma cells (PCs). IgG4-related Hashimoto thyroiditis (IgG4-RHT), also called IgG4-related thyroiditis, shares many features with IgG4-RD but is distinct in several ways. A case of IgG4-RHT in a 51-year-old African American female is assembled together with a literature review which uncovered 82 cases of IgG4-RHT. The findings and criteria which the respective authors used to reach their diagnoses are analyzed. Findings common to all studies are lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and IgG4-positive staining, while most describe follicular atrophy (95.2%, 79/83). Stromal fibrosis involving >33% of thyroid architecture was reported in 74% (58/78) of cases. While few reports observed storiform fibrosis, all describe lack of obliterative phlebitis or systemic involvement. Discrepancies between reports exist in immunostaining thresholds, as well as grading systems for stromal fibrosis. Based on our review of the literature and experience, we propose a set of best practice recommendations for the diagnosis of IgG4-RHT. Our diagnostic criteria are (1) lack of extrathyroidal IgG4-RD, (2) the fibroinflammatory process should not extend beyond the thyroid capsule, (3) stromal fibrosis comprises at least 30% of the involved tissue, (4) >30% IgG4/IgG ratio, with absolute immunostaining cutoffs varying by the degree of stromal fibrosis: for >50% stromal fibrosis use >20 IgG4+PCs/HPF, for 30% to 50% fibrosis use >30 IgG4+PCs/HPF, (5) fibrosis infiltrates the interlobular/interfollicular space, (6) features of follicle injury, and (7) obliterative phlebitis is not required.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase and a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Persistent activation of the mTOR pathway is a common event in several human tumors. Rapamycin, a macrolide antibiotic, inhibits the mTOR pathway and derivatives of rapamycin are currently being investigated as promising therapeutic agents in several cancers. Recent in vitro studies, including the report by Marzec et al discussed in this commentary, have reported activation of the mTOR pathway in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). ALK+ ALCL is a distinctive type of T/null-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by the presence of chromosomal translocations involving the ALK gene, the most frequent being the t(2;5)(p23;q35). Marzec et al and others have shown that inhibition of mTOR pathway induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ALK+ ALCL, thereby establishing rapamycin or, more likely, its derivatives as potential effective therapeutic agents. In addition, Marzec et al provide new insights by demonstrating that nucleophosmin-ALK induces activation of the mTOR pathway via the mitogen-induced extracellular kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway, in addition to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. Furthermore, a combination of an mTOR inhibitor with an inhibitor of the upstream mitogen-induced extracellular kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway was more effective at inhibiting ALK+ ALCL cell proliferation than either inhibitor alone. In conclusion, there is growing evidence that the mTOR pathway is activated in ALK+ ALCL and that this pathway can be targeted as part of combination chemotherapy in patients with these lymphomas.",

Two hereditary syndromes are known to be related to uterine mesenchymal tumors: hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome and the tuberous sclerosis complex. In the following review, we describe the current literature on these syndromes, summarizing their clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic data. It is possible that the surgical pathologic diagnosis is the first indication of a familial syndrome, thus emphasizing the importance of a pathologist's familiarity with these potentially suggestive lesions.",

By studying the first draining lymph node of a tumor field, a sentinel lymph node biopsy can serve as an indicator of the nodal status of the rest of the lymphatic drainage, and unnecessary regional lymph node dissection can be avoided in sentinel node-negative patients undergoing curative surgery for cancer. This technique has already been widely applied in the management of patients with malignant melanoma.

    "abstract": "Evaluation of a renal biopsy can be intimidating, because observational data from histologic stains, direct immunofluorescence (IF), and electron microscopy must be integrated with clinical and laboratory data to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Numerous diagnostic categories usually merit consideration. The typical strategy to diagnose renal disease is heavily weighted toward analysis of the histologic pattern of glomerular injury. This focus on histology is understandable; histologic evaluation was the first analytic probe available and has driven the formulation of classification schemes. Evaluation of IF before review of the light microscopy facilitates diagnostic evaluation, because the possibilities are immediately reduced. This simplifies the crucial final step—clinical and histologic correlation. In this review, I discuss the information content of IF and provide an algorithmic approach to the major renal diseases based on an IF-driven dissection of the differential diagnosis.",

The MICA system is a novel, avidin-free immunohistochemical detection system that provides a significant increase in sensitivity compared to traditional immunodetection systems. The principle of the system is the alternate and sequential application of mutually attractive polyclonal antibodies to form a large complex of antibodies which can cross-link tissue-bound primary antibodies. Peroxidase conjugated to the constituent antibodies permits signal generation. The formed peroxidase-containing complex is very stable and, by cross-linking tissue-bound primary antibodies, possesses high avidity for the target antigens, thereby producing high immunohistochemical sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "The retroperitoneal soft tissues, extending from the pelvic floor to the level of the diaphragm, are the source of a variety of mesenchymal neoplasms with overlapping features and distinct clinical behaviors, making their distinction of crucial importance. Herein, we report a rare retroperitoneal angiomyofibroblastoma (AMFB) that presented as a right abdominal mass in a 25-year-old woman and that clinically simulated a primary renal carcinoma. The patient underwent complete surgical resection showing a well-circumscribed tumor adjacent to but separate from the right kidney. It was comprised of irregular, often anastomosing islands and cords of plump to spindled cells in a collagenous stroma with numerous thin-walled vessels. The tumor cells clustered around the vessels and admixed with moderate numbers of adipocytes. There was neither significant nuclear atypia nor mitotic activity. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed strong reactivity for desmin, diffuse expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors, retained nuclear expression of retinoblastoma protein, and absent CD34 expression. The immunomorphological features were these of a \"lipomatous variant\" of AMFB of the retroperitoneum. The occurrence of AMFB in the retroperitoneum is unexpected since it mostly develops in the lower genital tract of young women, making its recognition in this rare location difficult. As a consequence, more common pelvic or retroperitoneal soft tissue neoplasms may represent the primary diagnostic considerations. We, therefore, review a variety of soft tissue tumors occurring in the pelvis/retroperitoneum that, to some degree, may mimic AMFB, and present key findings to assist in accurate diagnosis.",

The diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma weighs heavily on clinical and radiologic information. In addition, in the past, before the era of immunohistochemistry, the diagnosis was aided with the use of special histochemical stains-PAS, D-PAS, and mucicarmine, which now very much have been replaced by immunohistochemical stains. In the era of immunohistochemistry, a combination of carcinomatous epitopes and positive mesothelioma markers has become paramount in the diagnosis of mesothelioma, and more recently the use of molecular techniques has become another ancillary tool in supporting such a diagnosis. At the same time, the treatment and clinical outcome of these patients may in some measure be determined by the histopathological features of the tumor and one that also over the years has changed from a palliative type to surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of these types. The histopathological growth patterns of mesothelioma are also wide, and in some cases may mimic other tumors that may be primary or metastatic to the pleura. Therefore, the assessment of the diagnosis of mesothelioma is one that requires a global view of the different factors including clinical, radiologic, pathologic-including immunohistochemistry and molecular diagnosis.",

HCT is associated with several complications and comorbidities with differential effects on a wide spectrum of organs and tissues. We present an update on HCT-associated complications such as graft versus host disease (GVHD) and infection, with focus on the surgical pathology of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver, and lung. Although the grading system for GI tract acute GVHD was proposed 40 years ago, recent studies have shed light on minimal histologic criteria for diagnosis of GVHD, as well as its differential diagnosis, including histologic effects of various medications. GI dysfunction in autologous transplant recipients is increasingly appreciated and patients are often biopsied. Acute liver injury in HCT is often due to sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (previously known as venoocclusive disease), or acute GVHD. Liver dysfunction at later time posttransplantation may be associated with acute or chronic GVHD, iron overload, or other causes of hepatitis. Lung injury in HCT is multifactorial, and it remains crucially important to diagnose and treat pulmonary infections. The pulmonary biopsy yields clinically unsuspected diagnoses in the majority of cases and its utilization is likely to increase. The pathology of the skin and kidney in HCT patients are detailed in accompanying articles.",

    "abstract": "As the leading cause of cancer morbidity and the second leading cause of cancer mortality among women, breast cancer continues to remain a major global public health problem. Consequently, significant attention has been directed toward early breast cancer detection and prevention. As a result, the number of image-detected biopsies has increased, and minimally invasive diagnostic procedures have almost replaced open surgical biopsies. Therefore, pathologists are expected to provide more information with less tissue and diagnose increasing numbers of atypical proliferative breast lesions, in situ lesions, and small breast carcinomas. This is a difficult task, as reflected by continuous reports highlighting the challenges associated with morphologic distinction between atypical ductal hyperplasia and low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. The current interobserver variability among pathologists to accurately define these two entities often leads to silent overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Up to now, there are no reproducible morphologic features and/or any reliable biomarkers that can accurately separate the above-mentioned entities. Despite these reports, patients diagnosed with low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ are subject to cancer therapy regardless of the fact that low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ is known to be an indolent lesion. Studies have shown that low and high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ are genetically different forms of breast cancer precursors; however, the term ductal carcinoma in situ is followed by cancer therapy regardless of the grade and biology of the tumor. In contrast, patients with the diagnoses of atypical ductal hyperplasia do not undergo cancer therapy. In the current article, attempts are made to highlight the continuous dilemma in distinction between atypical ductal hyperplasia and low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. Going forward, we suggest that low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ be referred to as ductal neoplasia. This alternative terminology allows for different management and follow-up strategies by eliminating the word carcinoma.",

All patients had a mixed inflammatory infiltrate (predominantly neutrophilic in four patients and lymphocytic in two) and about one-half also had minimal crypt disarray. The intestinal symptoms resolved in all patients after NSAIDs were discontinued, but there was no histopathologic verification that the inflammatory changes had subsided. Nonspecific changes (\"focal colitis\"), similar to those described in this group, are present in most patients who undergo a colonoscopy for the investigation of diarrhea. This article calls attention on one of the possible and neglected causes for nonspecific colitis. However, larger controlled studies are needed to firmly establish a cause-and-effect relationship with NSAID intake.",

There major pathogenetic mechanisms are discussed: (1) tumor cell cohesiveness mediated by proteins involved in cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion; (2) mutations and loss of heterozygosity of tumor suppressor genes, leading to critical steps in the progression to adenoma and carcinoma, as illustrated by the adenomatous polyposis coli gene; and (3) germline mutations in mismatch repair genes causing generalized genetic instability as observed in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The recent advances in molecular biology techniques have enhanced the understanding of the genetic events that occur in tumorigenesis and may now be applied in the development of new diagnostic and treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Medical malpractice occurs when a hospital, doctor, or other health care professional, through a negligent act or omission, causes an injury to a patient. The negligence might be the result of errors in diagnosis, treatment, aftercare, or health management. To be considered medical malpractice under the law, the claim must violate the standard of care, the injury must be caused by the negligence and, last but most certainly not least, the injury must result in significant damages. This review is an overview of medicolegal issues specific to the practice of Dermatopathology with the caveat that most are likely pertinent to other specialties of pathology as well. The safety of patients remains the priority in pathology as it does in any medical undertaking, and this is no different in the practice of Dermatopathology. The review is broadly divided in 2 parts-we begin with an overview of tort reforms, advocated by physicians to reduce costs associated with malpractice defense. In the second part we address practical issues specific to the practice of pathology and dermatopathology. These include among others, errors-related to the biopsy type, inadequacy of clinical information regarding the lesion that is biopsied, role of interstate dermatopathology as well as examples of select entities commonly misdiagnosed in dermatopathology. In the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has moved to the forefront of technology. While research into the uses of AI in pathology is promising, the use of AI in diagnostic practice is still somewhat uncommon. Given that AI is not fully integrated routinely as a diagnostic adjunct, its' impact on pathology-specific medicolegal issues cannot, as yet at least, be defined. Restriction of medical malpractice is of particular relevance in the COVID-19 era, a period that is anything but normal. The response of states with specific pandemic-related guidelines is addressed with the caveat that this particular issue is only covered in select states. Furthermore, given that the COVID pandemic is only a year old, while it does not appear to have had an immediate impact on pathology-specific medicolegal matters, it is possible that the role of COVID on this issue, if any at all, will and can only be fully defined a few years down the line.",

    "abstract": "Molecular techniques have clearly demonstrated that the Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of most cases of Hodgkin lymphoma are of B-lineage, but until recently little was known about the unusual immuno phenotype of HRS cells that do not express many B-cell antigens. The study by Mathas and colleagues hypothesizes that a mechanism that usually controls gene expression during normal development might be at least partially responsible for the abnormal phenotype of the neoplastic cells in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. This mechanism relies on modulation of the activity of basic helix-loop-helix E transcriptional factors (HEB, E2-2, E12, and E47) by the dominant negative proteins ID2 and ABF1. E proteins are crucial for B-cell development, controlling expression of Pax5 (BSAP), EBF, mb-1, VpreB, λ5, RAG1, and RAG2. When the E proteins dimerize with ID2 (and, as shown in this study, with ABF1), they lose their ability to bind DNA, resulting in down-regulation of the B-lineage–specific genes under their control. This chain of events has now been demonstrated in classic Hodgkin lymphoma and is proposed to be the probable explanation for the loss of B-lineage markers in HRS cells.",

It is more common in men, median age is 50 years, the history is usually long, and the usual size is around 3 cm. Most lesions are subcutaneous but approximately 25% involve skeletal muscle. Histologically, they are sparsely cellular with stellate and spindle-shaped fibroblasts-myofibroblasts that are separated by a collagenous or myxocollagenous matrix. Mitoses are minimal or absent. Tumor cells are focally positive for muscle-specific and alpha smooth muscle actins, and rarely, for keratins. The S-100 is usually negative but a very few cases have been positive. It can be confused with one of the fibromatoses, myxomas of various kinds and neural tumors. It neither recurs nor metastasizes.",

    "abstract": "The NKX3.1 immunohistochemical stain is widely recognized as a highly sensitive and specific marker for prostate adenocarcinoma. Nevertheless, its expression has been documented in various nonprostatic tissues and malignancies. This review aims to provide an overview of NKX3.1 expression in diverse tumor types, with a specific focus on its aberrant expression in esophageal/gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (E/GE-ADC). In our investigation, we explored the expression of NKX3.1 in a series of E/GE-ADC to shed light on its prevalence in this tumor category. A total of 50 samples, comprising primary and metastatic E/GE-ADC specimens from 34 patients, were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. Stained sections were scored based on the intensity and distribution—categorized as negative, weak, moderate, or strong in either a focal or diffuse pattern. Strong staining corresponds to the intensity observed in normal prostate controls, while focal and diffuse staining denote &lt;50% and ≥50% of tumor nuclei staining positive, respectively. Our semiquantitative scoring revealed that 6 (12%) of the primary and metastatic E/GE-ADC specimens exhibited variable positivity for NKX3.1. This finding suggests that E/GE-ADC can sporadically stain positive for NKX3.1, introducing potential challenges in definitively determining the primary site of origin in certain clinical scenarios. Along with a literature review of NKX3.1 expression in other tumor types, our study provides additional important information about the extent to which this immunostain can be seen in E/GE-ADCs, which, to our knowledge, has not been reported.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis and reporting of prostatic adenocarcinoma have evolved from the classic framework promulgated by Dr Donald Gleason in the 1960s into a complex and nuanced system of grading and reporting that nonetheless retains the essence of his remarkable observations. The criteria for the “Gleason patterns” originally proposed have been continually refined by consensuses in the field, and Gleason scores have been stratified into a patient-friendly set of prognostically validated and widely adopted Grade Groups. One product of this successful grading approach has been the opportunity for pathologists to report diagnoses that signal carefully personalized management, placing the surgical pathologist’s interpretation at the center of patient care. At one end of the continuum of disease aggressiveness, personalized diagnostic care means to sub-stratify patients with more indolent disease for active surveillance, while at the other end of the continuum, reporting histologic markers signaling aggression allows sub-stratification of clinically significant disease. Whether contemporary reporting parameters represent deeper nuances of more established ones (eg, new criteria and/or quantitation of Gleason patterns 4 and 5) or represent additional features reported alongside grade (intraductal carcinoma, cribriform patterns of carcinoma), assessment and grading have become more complex and demanding. Herein, we explore these newer reporting parameters, highlighting the state of knowledge regarding morphologic, molecular, and management aspects. Emphasis is made on the increasing value and stakes of histopathologists’ interpretations and reporting into current clinical risk stratification and treatment guidelines.",

    "abstract": "This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of The International System (TIS) for reporting serous fluid cytopathology. Our aims were to present the pooled malignancy rate of each TIS reporting category and the diagnostic accuracy of cytology using this system. Database search using a predefined strategy was followed by study selection, data extraction, study quality assessment, and statistical analysis. Data derived from 16 eligible studies were pooled. The pooled rates of malignancy were as follows: 27% (95% CI; 16%-41%) for “nondiagnostic” (ND), 11% (95% CI; 7%-18%) for negative for malignancy” (NFM), 49% (95% CI; 37%-61%) for “atypia of undetermined significance” (AUS), 90% (95% CI; 81%-95%) for “suspicious for malignancy” (SFM), and 100% (95% CI; 98%-100%) for “positive for malignancy” (MAL). Studies performed exclusively in cancer hospitals showed higher pooled malignancy rates, compared with academic and community hospitals serving the general population, in the ND [40% (95% CI; 21%-62%) vs. 22% (95% CI; 11%-39%)], NFM [20% (95% CI; 13%-30%) vs. 9% (95% CI; 5%-17%)], and AUS categories [55% (95% CI; 47%-63%) vs. 46% (95% CI; 31%-62%)]. Notably, the difference was significant in the NFM category ( P =0.04). When both SFM and MAL cytology interpretations were considered as malignant outcomes, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 68.74% (95% CI; 59.90%-76.39%) and 98.81% (95% CI; 98.18%-99.22%), respectively. In addition, the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was found to be 170.7 (95% CI; 96.2-303.3). Despite its strengths, our study also had some limitations. Therefore, future large-scale longitudinal studies could strengthen the findings of this review.",

Sampling of soft tissue margins may be delegated to the pathologist, and contingent on the tumor extent into soft tissue.

However, over the past few decades, the increasing volume of gastrointestinal endoscopy has expedited the recognition of several novel entities with varying clinical significance. Its spectrum extends from reactive changes and benign neoplasms to highly aggressive sarcomas. At the malignant end of the spectrum, the importance of correctly diagnosing these tumors is underscored by the specific therapeutic implications available for some tumor types (eg, tyrosine kinase inhibitors for gastrointestinal stromal tumors) that allow personalized treatments. Benign lesions frequently surface among routine polypectomy specimens, sometimes offering diagnostic challenges. However, precise classification is the only way to avoid prognostic uncertainty and overtreatment, and to recognize possible syndromic associations. Hereby, we offer a pragmatic review of the topic from the gastrointestinal pathologist's perspective, who, although more accustomed to epithelial neoplasms, can use an algorithmic approach to diagnose mesenchymal entities successfully.",

    "abstract": "There is no doubt that alterations in the DNA methylating machinery play an important role in the development of cancer. DNA methylation is part of the inheritable epigenetic system that influences expression or silencing of genes necessary for normal differentitation and proliferation. Gene activity is associated with demethylation. In mammalian genomes, it is usually only cytosine residues within a 5′-CpG-3′ dinucleotide that are methylated. The methyl group is transferred from the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine by the enzyme 5-methyltransferase, When cytosine is methylated it becomes susceptible to spontaneous deamination or mutation. In this review we summarize current understanding of the biological functions of DNA methylation, how it is brought about and how dysregulation of the methylating machinery may cause cancer. Consistent findings in cancer cells include hypomethylation of bulk DNA, focal genomic hypermethylation, and overexpression of a 5-methyltransferase gene. These alterations may contribute to tumorigenesis in a number of ways. For example, some of the focal hypermethylated regions contain tumor suppressor genes that may become silenced and susceptible to spontaneous mutation, whereas hypomethylation may allow activation of normally quiescent genes, Moreover, recent evidence indicates that methyltransferase itself, in the absence of the methyl donor 5-adenosylmethionine, increase the mutational rate of nonmethylated cytosine residues, thus increasing the chance of mutational events in the bulk of the demethylated genome. Results of studies into the significance of dysregulation of DNA methylation will provide new approaches to the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer.",

    "abstract": "The major goal of this article is to provide the reader with a better understanding of electronic imaging by presenting an overview of the devices processes, technology, and applications involved. Particularly telepathology. Understanding how an image is electronically captured and how it can be manipulated and transferred allows the anatomic pathologist to evaluate the range of its uses and advantages. Electronic imaging can be applied in every day documentation of case material, in making a CD for teaching purposes, and most especially. In interacting with colleagues in other parts of the world As standards change, so will the technologies, but and introduction to the basic principles and jargon of electronic imaging will make the transition smoother.",

Retrospective study design may obscure subtle differences in clinical features. Careful prospective studies are needed to help clarify classification of these disorders. Autoimmune cholangitis is often considered synonymous with antimitochondrial antibody-negative primary biliary cirrhosis, but may instead be a heterogenous group of disorders including some cases of isolated small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis. The variable response of variant syndromes to established therapies such as corticosteroids provides justification for continued efforts to define their clinicopathologic features.",

As acid-control drugs have proved ineffective for this purpose, current interest is focused on antireflux surgery, particularly fundoplication. Several studies, including the one discussed in this commentary, have reported regression metaplasia and the absence of progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma after successful fundoplication, suggesting that this procedure is an effective approach for the management of patients with Barrett esophagus. The crucial question whether regression and absence of progression will result in the prevention of Barrett-associated adenocarcinoma may be answered by long-term follow-up of operated patients.",

    "abstract": "The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a prevalent site for extranodal lymphomas. Some subtypes of GI tract lymphomas are aggressive and have dismal clinical outcomes. Therefore, prompt histopathologic detection of such types can be very important. We thus introduce a practical approach in the histopathologic diagnosis of GI lymphomas according to the revised World Health Organization (WHO) classification. When lymphocyte proliferation is found in the GI tract, a stepwise approach can help narrow down the differential diagnoses. When considering subtype incidence, macroscopic findings, and microscopic patterns, applying a first-line marker battery of CD20, CD3, CD30, and Epstein-Barr virus–encoded RNAs can effectively narrow down the top differential diagnoses at the initial step. Generally, the most common subtype among GI tract lymphomas is B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma identified by CD20 expression, followed by T-cell and NK-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas identified by the CD3 expression, and some subtypes are defined by Epstein-Barr virus infection or CD30 expression. Macroscopically, lymphomas present as various gross types, such as large masses, small lesions, superficial and shallow lesions, polyp-like or polyposis-like features, or ulcer/necrosis/perforation. Microscopically, large pleomorphic cells or small to medium-sized tumor cells grow with various architectures and tumor microenvironments. Incorporation of macroscopic and microscopic features and the stepwise immunophenotyping may be a practical approach to the differential diagnosis of aggressive lymphoma, indolent/low-grade lymphoma, or benign to indolent lymphoproliferative disease. Exceptions always exist; this approach focuses on the relatively prevalent circumstances of lymphomatous lesions initially encountered in the GI tract.",

As such, becoming familiar with morphologic features of nonurothelial malignancies in urine cytology as well as their related clinical risk factors, radiologic and cystoscopic features, differential diagnostic considerations, and the utility and pitfalls of ancillary tests can facilitate optimal patient care.",

The spectrum of myxoid soft tissue tumors encountered in practice ranges from benign lesions such as simple ganglion cysts to high-grade malignant sarcomas such as myxofibrosarcoma. These myxoid tumors have clinical, cytologic, and histologic overlap. Therefore, making an accurate diagnosis by FNA alone is challenging. Despite this challenge, using a systematic cytomorphologic approach and ancillary studies, an accurate diagnosis is feasible in the majority of cases. This article provides a systematic approach to diagnosing myxoid soft tissue tumors by FNA along with a review of the literature.",

    "abstract": "Most cystic renal tumors after resection (Boniak IIF to IV cysts) have an indolent course despite the significantly higher proportion of malignant [ie, renal cell carcinoma (RCC)] diagnosis. Most cystic renal tumors have clear cell histology that include cystic clear cell RCC and multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential (MCNLMP). There is growing evidence to suggest that MCNLMP, cystic clear cell RCC, and noncystic clear cell RCC form a cystic-to-solid biological spectrum with MCNLMP representing the most indolent form and with cystic clear cell RCC behaving better than noncystic (solid) clear cell RCC. Extensively (&gt;75%) cystic clear cell RCC also has an excellent outcome similar to MCNLMP stressing the need to reevaluate the histologic criteria that separate these 2 cystic clear cell tumors. Other tumors with clear cells that can be extensively cystic such as the recently reclassified noncancerous clear cell papillary renal tumor and the newly described MED15::TFE3 RCC also have indolent course and may mimic MCNLMP. Cystic features occur also in renal tumors with nonclear cell histology including tumors capable of metastasis such as acquired cystic disease-associated, tubulocystic, fumarate hydratase-deficient, and eosinophilic solid and cystic RCCs. Cystic imaging presentation of some renal tumors such as papillary RCC can be attributed in part to pseudocystic necrosis and hemorrhage. It is important to know that tubulocystic RCC may have a lower Bosniak class presentation that overlaps with benign renal cysts (Bosniak I to IIF) that are managed conservatively. This review highlights the cystic renal tumors with clear cell and nonclear cell morphologies including some novel RCC subtypes that may have cystic features. The presence of cystic features and their extent may aid in the classification and prognostication of renal neoplasms underscoring its increasing importance in the pathologic diagnosis and reporting of renal neoplasia.",

Morphologically, tumors originate from the muscularis propria or the muscularis mucosae, well-circumscribed with spindle cells arranged in fascicule. Tumoral cells exhibit positivity for smooth muscle markers while being negative for GIST markers and others. The mitotic index ranges from 2 to 500/50 high power field. Ki-67 index varies from 15% to 70%. Management typically involves gastrectomy and other appropriate treatments, with tumor recurrence being uncommon. 56% of patients are alive, with 5 patients dying from this disease. Statistical analyses conducted on post-GIST era cases reveal that a mitotic index of ≥100/50 high power field, tumor recurrence, metastasis, or positive lymph nodes significantly correlate with prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Horseshoe kidney is a rare congenital anomaly with an unusually higher frequency of neuroendocrine tumors. Symptoms are rare, and, in most of the cases, are incidentally diagnosed. The clinical behavior of these tumors is heterogeneous and can be difficult to predict based on histology alone. Necrosis and percentage of Ki-67 may have a role in prognosis. Almost all tumors are carcinoids (well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors) observed at an early age and with no sex dominance. It is not known the reason for the higher frequency of neuroendocrine tumors in horseshoe kidneys and the histogenesis is unknown. One of the hypotheses supports that renal carcinoid tumors may arise from neuroendocrine cells within foci of metaplastic or teratomatous epithelium within the kidney. With consonance with this hypothesis, there are reports of carcinoids in horseshoe kidneys associated with a cystic lesion lined by the intestinal epithelium, with mucinous differentiation and osseous metaplasia, arising in a mature teratoma of the kidney, arising within mature teratoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, with a mucinous cystadenoma element, and arising within mature cystic teratoma synchronous with primary adenocarcinoma. There is only one reported large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of a horseshoe kidney in a 57-year-old Chinese woman. Herein, we report a patient that to the best of our knowledge is the first case of a combined well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with rhabdoid features in horseshoe kidney. The histologic component of rhabdoid features expands the morphologic spectrum of neuroendocrine tumors in the horseshoe kidney. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature summarizing pertinent key clinical and pathologic aspects.",

These tumors often show significant overlap in morphology and immunophenotype posing diagnostic difficulties and, thus, their classification remains challenging. Recent advances in immunohistochemistry have proved helpful in identifying a specific line of differentiation in some tumors, but other tumors remain difficult to classify. Molecular investigations have provided an existing tool to better understand the pathogenesis of some of these tumors and, in some cases like the EWING family of tumors, expanded the classification resulting in the emergence of previously unknown tumors. Some of these tumors are currently diagnosed according to their underlying molecular abnormality, such as CIC-rearranged sarcoma, BCOR-rearranged sarcoma, etc. This review focuses on the common mesenchymal neoplasms of the pediatric population with emphasis on the salient histologic features, immunoprofile, and molecular characteristics.

    "abstract": "The Arkadi M. Rywlin International Slide Seminar Club was started in 1990 by one of us (SS), to honor the memory of one of our mentors in pathology, the late Arkadi M. Rywlin. The Club officially started on November 28, 1990 with 10 participants, and currently has 37 members encompassing North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. The majority of the participants are seasoned and highly experienced pathologists practicing at academic institutions throughout the world. The intention is to distribute challenging and interesting cases with the view of fostering rapid dissemination of information and an exchange of ideas in a collegial environment. The modus operandi of the Club, however, differs from that of other slide seminars. All members are expected to contribute H&E slides of selected cases along with their diagnoses, comments, and queries, which are distributed to the rest of the members for their comment. The comments are then collated and resubmitted to all of the members for their review, along with the slides for the forthcoming seminar. In this way, we all see the opinions and obtain the views of the other members on the circulated cases. The exercise is repeated quarterly, with 16 to 20 cases being circulated with each seminar. The Club has already distributed over 500 cases since its inception. The exchange of opinions has always been lively and eclectic, occasionally interspersed with wit, and sometimes with the acknowledgement of the limitations we face and the need to constantly revise our thinking about disease processes. In keeping with Dr. Rywlin's legacy, the Club fosters not only an open exchange of ideas but also a free-thinking spirit that challenges dogma in the specialty and pushes its members to explore additional possibilities. This exchange of ideas has already resulted in several collaborative publications by members of the Club. Dr. Rywlin's legacy and spirit remains alive today not only through the countless residents he trained, but also through the continuation of his quest for excellence and the tradition of free thinking fostered by this Club. Arkadi M. Rywlin, M.D. (1923–1987) (Figure 1), also know as “Ark” by his friends, was the Director of Laboratory Services at Mount Sinai Medical Center of Greater Miami and Professor of Pathology at the University of Miami School of Medicine. He was born in the free city of Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland), on July 27, 1923, to a Jewish family of Russian origin. Although initially educated in Danzig, he moved to Paris in 1937 to study in the Lycee Michelet, and escaped from France to Spain (Barcelona) in 1939 to avoid the Nazis. From Spain, the Rywlin family moved to Tel-Aviv in 1940 where he finished his schooling. The exposure to so many languages at an early age resulted in Ark's being fluent in German, Russian, Hebrew, Polish, French, and Spanish by the time he was 16.FIG. 1.: A smiling Arkadi M Rywlin (right) at a multiheaded microscope in the dermatopathology section, Suite 7J, at New York University School of Medicine in 1980. His famous disciple, A. Bernard Ackerman (left), is seated opposite him. (Reproduced, with permission, from Am J Dermatopathol 1989;11:380. Copyright © by Raven Publishers.)After a period at the American University of Beirut, Arkadi Rywlin enrolled in the Medical School of the University of Geneva, where he completed his medical education, and later stayed on to finish his residency in pathology under Professor Erwin Rutishauser. Ark was often fond of pointing out that he was directly linked to the master of pathology, Rudolph Virchow, through a direct line from his disciples, who included Professor Askenazi and Professor Rutishauser. In 1953, Ark moved across the Atlantic and entered residency training in pathology at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago under Otto Safir. After a few years of moving around at various jobs, he went to South Florida where he eventually became Chairman of Pathology at the Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach in 1962, until the time of his death due to acute myeloid leukemia in 1987. Although Ark Rywlin was recognized internationally as an expert on bone marrow pathology (1), he was truly a “pathologist's pathologist.” He could hold his own in any discussion regarding any topic with any expert in pathology as well as converse eruditely on virtually any topic in the sciences and humanities, from world politics to sports to history. His quick wit and merciless logic combined with his formidable intellect served to produce an overpowering and intimidating figure. Ark was feared and respected at Mount Sinai Medical Center, where he enjoyed a demigod status. He was equally feared and respected in academic circles, where his shrewd observations and pointed comments would often be the object of anxiety for many speakers. In his later years, he became an insightful contributor to the evolving field of dermatopathology, as eloquently attested to by his famous disciple, A. Bernard Ackerman (2). To those who knew him and had the privilege of being closely associated with him, Ark represented the best in pathology: knowledge, professional honesty, and humility. He often stunned those around him with his brilliant diagnoses merely by applying his eyes to the microscope. It is the spirit of Arkadi M. Rywlin that is being celebrated in each of the AMR Seminars. It would be a shame if the wonderful teaching material contained in these exercises were restricted only to club members. It is for this reason that we are now making them available to the broader public through the pages of this journal. The Editorial Board and Club members have considered how best to publish the free-ranging comments that characterize the Club without inhibiting the future expression of Members' opinions. We have resolved to list the comments anonymously, although each comment has been approved for publication by its author. We believe that the members' candid views and uninhibited critical approach to the cases will impart an unusual practical dimension and set this teaching exercise apart from ordinary case reports. After the comments by Club members, the various opinions and literature are reviewed and the paper concludes with a summary of the distilled essence of the case. We hope you will enjoy the section and become inspired by the spirit of Ark Rywlin as you leaf through the pages.",

The purpose of the present study was to develop a logical and systematic approach to the diagnosis of mucosal infections by identifying several morphologic compartments in the intestinal mucosa, and establishing a differential diagnosis for the organisms that are associated with each compartment. The organisms involved may be identified by their appearances in histologic sections, or by the nature of the host reaction to their presence. The process of systematically examining each compartment of the mucosa and scanning for evidence of infection is performed subconsciously by many pathologists, and we have found this approach to be particularly appreciated by pathologists in training.",

Because QM or particle physics explains the very basic structure and function of nature, there are growing interconnections between the fundamentals and applications of QM and biologic sciences. QM is not only applied to the structure of atoms but also probes the structure of biologic molecules, explains their mutational changes and has provided an insight into the basic mechanisms of many different biologic systems. Many of the current applications in biologic sciences, medicine, and surgical pathology rely on the principles of QM. Because surgical pathology uses quantum phenomena such as light and studies disease's alterations that are ultimately governed by quantum changes at nanoscale levels, QM will have potential future implications for the progress of surgical pathology. These might include quantum-enhanced refinements in light, ancillary tools, and interpretation assistance computerized systems. The future of applying the concepts, discoveries, and tools of QM in surgical pathology might create something analogous to quantum biology; that is, quantum pathology or \"QuPath.\"",

Monogenic and digenic causative defects, particularly in primary immunodeficiency and intestinal epithelial barrier genes, have been identified in a subset of patients with VEO-IBD allowing for targeted therapies and improved outcomes. However, these findings are the minority, thus strategies to correctly diagnose patients, including identification of specific histopathologic findings with correlating clinical and laboratory features may provide critical and necessary insight into mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and subsequent therapeutic options. In this article, we review the pathologic findings seen in patients with VEO-IBD and outline a pattern-based approach to diagnosis using examples from primary immunodeficiencies with gastrointestinal manifestations.",

    "abstract": "Club members unanimously agreed with the diagnosis of an unencapsulated 8×2.5×3.6 cm aggressive angiomyxoma, which was invading the voluntary muscles of the pelvic floor beneath the left labium of a female aged 65. The tumor consisted of histologically bland, round, stellate to fusiform cells set in a myxocollagenous matrix with occasional mast cells, a few extravasated red cells, and prominent blood vessels varying from thin-walled capillaries 7 µm in diameter to larger thick-walled vessels >250 µm in diameter. The tumor cells stained positively for estrogen and progesterone receptors, vimentin, and desmin. A stain for the nuclear transcription factor HMGA2, which is emerging as a useful and relatively specific marker for aggressive angiomyxoma, was not performed. The tumor had not recurred 4 years after the surgical excision. One member commented that virtually all lesions diagnosed as aggressive angiomyxomas in superficial locations turn out to be either fibroepithelial stromal polyps or superficial angiomyxomas. None of the club had seen a metastasizing aggressive angiomyxoma nor had they any experience with gonadotropin hormone-releasing and luteinizing hormone-releasing agonists therapy, which have been reported to cause tumor regression.",

    "abstract": "Conjunctivitis, or inflammation of the mucosal covering the anterior third of sclera and inner eyelid, is a common clinical condition of varied causation. Most cases are self-limited due to infection or allergy and rarely necessitate biopsy. Inflammation of the conjunctiva, however, is one of the most common principal histopathologic diagnoses rendered when the tissue is biopsied. In the context of conjunctivitis, biopsy is usually performed when inflammation is chronic and recalcitrant to therapy, has clinically atypical features, or requires an etiologic diagnosis when one cannot be reached through other laboratory methods. The exclusion of ocular surface neoplasia in a chronically inflamed conjunctiva is a common justification for biopsy. When inflammation is the principal histopathology finding, it is desirable—whenever feasible—to establish the cause. This brief review provides a guide in how histologic findings of an inflamed conjunctiva can direct the clinical evaluation towards an etiologic diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Until very recently, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy have been the mainstay of treatment in non-small cell carcinomas (NSCLCs). However, recent advances in molecular immunology have unveiled some of the complexity of the mechanisms regulating cellular immune responses and led to the successful targeting of immune checkpoints in attempts to enhance antitumor T-cell responses. Immune checkpoint molecules such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein-4, programmed cell death protein-1, and programmed death ligand (PD-L) 1 have been shown to play central roles in evading cancer immunity. Thus, these molecules have been targeted by inhibitors for the management of cancers forming the basis of immunotherapy. Advanced NSCLC has been the paradigm for the benefits of immunotherapy in any cancer. Treatment decisions are made based on the expression of PD-L1 on the tumor cells and the presence or absence of driver mutations. Patients with high PD-L1 expression (≥50%) and no driver mutations are treated with single-agent immunotherapy whereas, for all other patients with a lower level of PD-L1 expression, a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy is preferred. Thus, PD-L1 blockers are the only immunotherapeutic agents approved in advanced NSCLC without any oncogenic driver mutations. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, however, may not be the best biomarker in view of its dynamic nature in time and space, and the benefits may be seen regardless of PD -L1 expression. Each immunotherapy molecule is prescribed based on the levels of PD-L1 expression as assessed by a Food and Drug Administration-approved companion diagnostic assay. Other biomarkers that have been studied include tumor mutational burden, the T-effector signature, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, radiomic assays, inflammation index, presence or absence of immune-related adverse events and specific driver mutations, and gut as well as local microbiome. At the current time, none of these biomarkers are routinely used in the clinical decision-making process for immunotherapy in NSCLC. However, in individual cases, they can be useful adjuncts to conventional therapy. This review describes our current understanding of the role of biomarkers as predictors of response to immune checkpoint molecules. To begin with a brief on cancer immunology in general and in NSCLC, in particular, is discussed. In the end, recent advancements in laboratory techniques for refining biomarker assays are described.",

    "abstract": "In response to recent clinical trials that demonstrate the clinical benefit of antibody-drug conjugate drug therapy in breast cancer (BC) with human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) immunohistochemical scores of 1+ or 2+ and negative in situ hybridization results, a new concept of “HER2-low BC” has emerged to describe this newly relevant therapeutic category of BC. Clinical recognition of HER2-low BC has caused a paradigm shift in the therapeutic landscape and management of patients with BC and resulted in rapid changes in clinical practice guidelines. In addition the American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) recently updated their HER2 Guidelines Recommendations to specifically address HER2-low BC. A literature search in PubMed of peer-reviewed articles, regulatory communications, and relevant practice guidelines pertaining to HER2-low BC was conducted. In this review, we have summarized current published knowledge regarding the clinicopathologic and molecular features, diagnostic criteria, and most current guideline recommendations regarding HER2-low BC, and also highlight ongoing practical and diagnostic challenges when identifying HER2-low BC in routine clinical practice.",

The iron negative pigment, which is likely to be confused with hemosiderin in the hematoxylin and eosin stain, is lipofuscin. The seminar case, apparently the third published, arose in a 37-year-old woman who presented in October 2015 at 24 weeks pregnancy with abdominal pain. Investigations revealed a ruptured left ovarian cyst and rising serum carcinoembryonic antige levels. At laparotomy, there was no free intraperitoneal blood but the omentum and uterine serosa were black. Histology showed lipofuscinosis and a decidual reaction. The patient delivered a normal baby in February 2016 and was clinically well after delivery. A left ovarian endometriotic cyst was removed in February 2017. The patient made a good recovery with no clinically apparent symptoms from the liposuscinosis. We postulate that the endometriotic cyst had ruptured and released blood into the peritoneal cavity in 2015. The iron from the red cells breakdown was then rapidly resorbed because of the pregnancy requirements for iron, leaving lipofuscin in peritoneal macrophages.",

The protocol of the unit handling the case mandated that all lesions amenable to biopsy should have a core biopsy before any definitive surgery, but the unnecessary biopsy was not representative and suggested an incorrect diagnosis of perifollicular fibroma. The lesion was excised. The sections showed dilated hair follicle pores on the skin surface, squamous lined hair follicles plugged with keratin, prominent sebaceous glands, perifollicular inflammation without granulomas, intradermal budding of hair follicle basal cells, and extensive hypocellular, mildly edematous fibrous tissue with slightly dilated, thin-walled vessels and a few chronic inflammatory cells. These fully representative sections confirmed the diagnosis of giant rhinophyma, suggesting that preoperative core biopsies of this condition are unnecessary and may be misleading.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver represents a spectrum of morphologic changes, all of which have in common the presence of fatty change (steatosis) with or without other features, such as lobular inflammation, necrosis, fibrosis, and even cirrhosis—all in the (apparent) absence of significant alcohol consumption. It is still a matter of debate whether fatty change alone will progress to fibrosis and possibly cirrhosis or whether other changes, such as episodes of active inflammation, are necessary for such a progression. The difficulties for the anatomic pathologist ranges from terminology (steatosis versus steatohepatitis versus steatoncrosis versus nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)) to the prediction of likely outcome based on morphologic features on liver biopsies. The study by Matteoni et al. investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with fatty change as the single common feature in their biopsy with or without other changes. This was done in a retrospective manner (1979–1987) in 772 biopsy specimens, 132 of which had complete follow-up (up to 18 years). The biopsy findings were divided into four groups: Type I: fatty liver alone Type II: fatty liver plus lobular inflammation (steatohepatitis) Type III: fatty liver plus ballooning degeneration (“steatonecrosis”- why ballooning degeneration is referred to as “necrosis” is somewhat puzzling?) Type IV: fatty liver plus ballooning degeneration plus Mallory bodies or fibrosis (steatoncrosis plus either Mallory hyaline or fibrosis). The authors found that Type I fatty liver did not differ from the three other groups with respect to gender, race, age, and presence or absence of obesity and diabetes. The overall mortality, presence of histologic stainable iron and incidence of Hepatitis C (as determined by revers transcription—polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) did also not differ between these groups. However, cirrhosis developed in only 4% of Type I fatty liver while 21% and 26% of Type III and Type IV, respectively, developed cirrhosis. Liver-related death was seen in 13% of Type IV, compared to only 2% in Type I fatty change. Once again, Type II did not result in any liver-related death. The authors conclude that fatty change alone (Type I) is a relatively benign disease while fatty change associated with ballooning degeneration and Mallory bodies of fibrosis follows a more aggressive course.",

    "abstract": "The list for possible causes for the presence of epitheloid granulomas in the liver covers an entire A4 page in any textbook of hepatology and includes divers disease such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, drug induced liver injury, Crohn's disease/ and many others. Recently, the presence of epithelioid granulomas within portal tracts and in lobules has been reported also in chronic Hepatitis C. Granulomas in Hepatitis C may present yet another diagnostic problem in that they may be associated with bile duct damage (itself typically seen in Hepatitis C) and may, therefore, cause confusion with primary biliary cirrhosis. In the study by Harada et al. granulomatoud lesions were found in (only) 2% of cases with chronic hepatitis that the granulomas were positive for HLA-DR and 2-microglobulin. Some of these cases showed portal granulomas with mild biliary epithelial damage. Importantly, bile ducts showing mild epithelial damage in chronic Hepatitis C were positive for 2-microglobulin but negative for HLA-DR, both antigens frequently present in damaged bile ducts in primary biliary cirrhosis. In 5 of the 11 cases with granulomatous Hepatitis C follow-up, information after treatment was available. These five cases showed a favorable response to interferon-(IFN)-return of serum ALT to normal levels (<40 IU/1). The presence of granulomas was, therefore, taken as a predictor of a good response, similar to previously reported features such a necroinflammatoryactivity, less fibrosis, and lack of haemosiderin deposition in portal endothelial cells. It is important to distinguish between chronic granulomatous Hepatitis C with mild bile duct damage and primary biliary cirrhosis because of their very different therapeutic approaches—despite their histologic similarity in at least some cases. This distinction, however, should not really be a problem clinically.",

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia affects approximately 6–10% of nulliparous women and is clinicallly characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, and oedema, all pointing towards endothelial damage in the maternal circulation. The experiments by DiFederico et al. suggest that the cytotrophoblast—or lack thereof!—plays an important role in preeclampsia. In normal pregnancy, some placental cytotrophoblasts invade the uterus and the maternal vasculature to establish the uteroplacental circulation. Previously, it has been reported that preeclampsia is associated with only very superficial invasion by cytotrophoblasts and decreased blood flow to the placenta. The investigators found that in samples of patients with preeclampsia, 15–50% of the invading cytotrophoblasts had undergone apoptosis (programmed cell death) as assessed by failure to stain for Bc1-2, an anti-apoptotic protein that is normally expressed in trophoblasts both within the placenta and the uterine wall. The authors suggest that programmed cell death in cytotrophoblasts may account for the sudden onset of symptoms in some patients, as well as the associated coagulapathies.",

    "abstract": "Prognosis of renal cell carcinomas depends on a variety of factors such as local extension (pathologic stage), metastatic spread, tumor grade, DNA ploidy, and tumor cell proliferation. In a given case, however, it is not possible to predict prognosis based on the above parameters. In recent years, considerable information has been available regarding the relationship of morphologic features of renal cell carcinoma with specific genetic abnormalities. This has provided impetus for developing a combined morphologic and genetic classification of renal cell carcinoma. In 1996, a consensus of a histopathologic classification based on genetic abnormalities was proposed at a Heidelberg workshop. Subsequently in 1997, at a WHO/UICC sponsored-workshop on renal cell carcinoma, held in Rochester, Minnesota, a similar classification scheme was proposed. According to this classification, four distinct renal cell carcinoma types were identified. These included clear cell or conventional, papillary, chromophobe, and collecting duct renal cell carcinoma. The real value of a tumor classification depends upon recognition of specific subtypes, which appear to have distinctly different clinical behavior. In order to evaluate the relevance of the Heidelberg classification of renal cell carcinoma to prognosis, Ljungberg et al. retrospectively studied 186 cases of renal carcinoma according to the guidelines of Heidelberg classification. All patients were treated by nephrectomy and were staged by TNM system. The follow-up time in these patients ranged from 44 to 174 months. On histologic evaluation, the carcinomas were classified as follows: conventional carcinoma 145, papillary 25, chromophobe 12, and unclassified 4. There was no significant difference in the tumor size in the various categories. Conventional carcinoma had the highest rate of metastatic disease at presentation (37%), as compared to papillary carcinoma (16%) and chromophobe (8%). The 5-year survival rate was also significantly different in the various subtypes: 43% for conventional renal carcinoma, 61% for papillary type, and 91% for chromophobe carcinoma. Thus, the results of this study show that classification of a renal tumor, based on the specific morphologic as well as genetic subtypes or renal cell carcinoma as defined in the Heidelberg classification, has significant prognostic implications. Other investigators have also shown similar prognostic utility for the contemporary classification system for renal cell carcinoma.",

Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 1999, 315 pp. Experience/Background of Authors: 30 years, 30,000 aspirates. Orientation: Clinically oriented diagnostic cytology for practicing cytopathologists. Readability: Excellent. Can be read cover to cover if desired. Pictures: Black and white except for a token collection of color plates. The picture selection is excellent, but the photographs are small and not always in focus, as with all the books in this series. The side by side comparison of similar entities is a excellent format (see Figure 5.30 from p. 115), but the pictures are simply not good enough to allow wallpaper matching in individual cases, and the subtlety of the finding in many breast aspirates, which cannot always be classified into discrete diagnostic entities and often depends as much upon the quantity as the quality of individual findings, may not lend itself to this approach. Usefulness: Excellent summary of the field. Useful if one desires to know the findings associated with a particular entity. Less likely to be useful with a difficult case. Commentary: This second edition of a classic is a concise and well-written overview of the large challenging field of diagnostic breast aspiration. The authors have as much clinical and academic experience in this field as anyone, and their analysis of the utility of different diagnostic features are clearly outlined. The direct comparison of images from similar lesions is well thought out and well illustrated. Nevertheless, breast aspiration is a useful but imperfect test, which sometimes results in uncertainty. This uncertainty, involving sampling, inaccuracy, and the inability to make a precise diagnosis, is the central issue in breast aspiration. This is best reflected by the fact that the last chapters in this book are devoted to medicolegal issues and the relative utility of core-needle biopsy. Both of these subjects are clearly discussed in an even-handed manner. Although whether aspirations or core biopsies are better initial tests is still discussed by experts in national meetings, for most practicing pathologists who interpret both specimens, the choice is obvious. In practices with a large experience performing and interpreting aspirations, especially those that assess relatively large and palpable lesions, this test will remain the diagnostic test of choice for a broad range of lesions. However, the number of such practice settings appears to be diminishing. For the rest of the U.S., core-needle biopsies are clearly a more specific and accurate test, especially for very small lesions. In this setting, aspiration biopsies are being refocused on cysts and large lesions with a high index of suspicion, and most pathologists can achieve an acceptable level of accuracy for these specimens. With this trend firmly in place, one wonders whether the new generation will ever achieve the levels of expertise that is possessed by the current leaders in this field. As a result, the current edition of this book may truly be a classic, marking both a pinnacle of the authors' careers and the field of breast aspiration itself. FIGUREFigureFigure",

    "abstract": "The website of the National Kidney Foundation's official journal, The Amercian Journal of Kidney Diseases, provides full text access to their journal online. However, their homepage also allows access to a very nice atlas of renal pathology which is available to subscribers and nonsubscribers alike. The atlas consists of online cases selected from both present and past journals. The cases are categorized by both the disease and the journal issue from which the cases were presented. Each case is composed of a set of image thumbnails representing H&E and special stain sections, in addition to images of both the immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The jpeg-format images are of excellent quality and expandable to half-screen size. Each image is annotated with a microscopic description. The site provides permission to use the images for noncommercial teaching purposes within slide presentations. A full set of instructions on how to download the images for use in slide presentations is included on the main atlas page. The journal is currently beta-testing an online CME program that will allow the public to receive 3 hours of CME credit per month for $15, answering a set of questions related to pertinent literature on a renal disease topic. Seventeen tests are currently online, dating back to January of 1999. The online access to the full text journal articles is very useful to the practicing renal pathologist. However, their inclusion of an atlas, representing the most common renal diseases, provides a useful online reference for both the general surgical pathologist and residents in training.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in the molecular genetics of hereditary peripheral neuropathies have led to changes in the classification of these neuropathies. The hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSNs) include Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, both the hypertrophic and neuronal forms of disease among others. The hypertrophic from (HMSN, type 1) is characterized by the presence of abundant omon bulbs pathologically and is caused by mutations in at least four separate genetic loci. The neuronal from (HMSN 2) is characterized by axonal loss on nerve biopsy and is caused by entirely separate genetic loci. The infantile hypertrophic hereditary neuropathy (Déjérine-Sottas disease, HMSN 3), which is characterized by abundant onion bulbs similar to HMSN 1, includes patients with mutations of either PMP-22 or MPZ. Among other hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies, the molecular basis of one form of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (Schindler disease) has been identified as absence of α-N-acetyl-D-galactosminidase activity, and the hereditary neuropathy with liability to develop pressure palsies and segmental thickening of myelin layers (tomaculous neuropathy) in volves a deletion of the PMP-2 locus on chromosome 17,. Among the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSANs), only the chromosomal region for the autosomal recessive familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome, HSAN 3) has been localized (Chromosome 9131-q33). Finally, the gene involved in the Portuguese, Swedish, Jewish, Maryland, Appalachian, German, and Indiana types of familial amyloid neuropathy has been identified as transtbyretin, with many of these separately identified kindreds showing the same mutation and others showing mutations with neuropathy result from mutations in the gelsolin gene and apolipoprotein A-I. The remarkable remarkable recent progress has clarified the molecular basis for the genetic heterogeneity of the clinical syndromes of hereditary peripheral neropathies and clarifies the relationships between genotype and clinical and pathologic phenotype.",
